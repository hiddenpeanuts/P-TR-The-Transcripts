1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,360
All right, let's take a little Club Three victory lap.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,640
Jason, congrats, here we are.

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,520
The dream has come true.

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,360
How do you feel?

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,520
I feel great.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,520
You know, when I checked the poll, it was still active.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,840
And then like one day, a few days ago,

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,760
you're like, all right, we'll do Club Three on Sunday.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,080
And I was like, oh yeah, it ended, great.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Uh-huh, and it ended just where you wanted it.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,920
Votes for Jason, votes for the heart of PTR,

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,920
a definite thing that was organically said by the audience.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,400
Organically said, not a thing I took from Mike.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,000
Not a crowd I took from Mike.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,240
I definitely called it before.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,560
I checked on the post where that would have been said,

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,800
where you had imagined it had been said,

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,280
and I looked for the word heart in the comments.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,320
I did a find in the comments.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,160
No, it wasn't said.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, you knew, okay, okay.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,360
Oh yeah, it was just the spirit, it's just the vibe.

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,120
I was just feeling so energized, so excited.

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,120
What was Scott about to reveal that it was in the post?

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,880
And then I, well, I did the search

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,120
and I found the word heart three times,

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,040
always preceded by the word kingdom.

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,480
It was always in the context.

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,440
More kingdom hearts, they said.

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,400
No, somebody said kingdom hearts too with susser, what?

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,240
Why?

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
Does he like that?

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,840
He shouldn't.

35
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,680
Yeah, well that's interesting.

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,880
I don't know why we gotta ask him about that.

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,680
We have so many people who are like,

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,680
very high level video game enthusiasts.

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,640
And while I know susser is a little more active

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,800
in that sphere than I am in terms of keeping up

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,000
with gaming systems, he is not the first one

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,080
I would think of.

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,160
Look, I made a lot of WW2K with him.

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,760
I've played GTA with him.

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,240
I've played some other things, fall guys,

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,520
I think I've played with him.

47
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,760
You haven't played any of these

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,800
in front of an audience on Twitch.

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, we did play, what did we play?

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,240
We played a little GTA on Twitch once.

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,680
I watched that, yeah, yeah.

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
We were like, why aren't there

53
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,680
thousands of people watching us?

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,080
There's five people in here.

55
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,920
It's hard.

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,760
Give up.

57
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,600
It's hard.

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,440
You really have to commit to it.

59
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,600
The Switch, the Switch, we're playing Switch on Twitch.

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,920
Well, we're here to talk about Port of Entry.

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,360
Really fast not to dwell on it,

62
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,480
the runner up that moves into next month

63
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,960
is Disney Adventures Magazine.

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,960
Fun choice.

65
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Another thing I love as a kid.

66
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,920
Do we all subscribe?

67
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,760
Yeah.

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,600
Oh yeah, yeah.

69
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,040
We won't give away the episode

70
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,240
in case we'll be doing it,

71
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,120
but if you didn't know this,

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
in the late 80s, early 90s,

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,000
Disney had this magazine that was like

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,920
Reader's Digest sized.

75
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,440
It was the little, or TV Guide sized maybe,

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,840
the little magazine at the grocery checkout,

77
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,760
and I subscribed, and I think if we do that episode,

78
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,840
it will be almost, I think it'll be like 80%

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,800
about the covers of Disney Adventures.

80
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Oh my God, iconic covers.

81
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,840
Incredible photos.

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,760
Usually great pair ups of Disney character

83
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,960
and pop culture icon of the time.

84
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,880
I was trying to remember specific ones.

85
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,880
I found the hammer hanging out with Darkwing Duck.

86
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
That's the best one, yeah.

87
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,760
They'd get along great.

88
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,960
They'd be such good friends.

89
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,520
I think Darkwing Duck also is in the crew

90
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,600
of Star Trek Next Generation.

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,560
My second favorite one, yes.

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

93
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,560
I looked up one, I found one that is glued in my mind,

94
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,320
and I don't want to reveal the pairing

95
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,440
because it's really good.

96
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,560
I'll save it for the episode.

97
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
Okay, well it is.

98
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,240
If it gets loaded.

99
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,320
It is, if we do it, but if we don't do it

100
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,680
or you want to hear something else,

101
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,400
comments below in this episode on the Patreon

102
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,440
and we'll do the poll for March.

103
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,560
But for now, we go into the topic suggested

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,080
by Seth Finkelstein, the Seth Finkelstein I've met?

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,160
BugCon attendees, Seth Finkelstein?

106
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,280
If so, hello.

107
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,680
If I haven't met this Seth, then hello for the first time

108
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,200
through a one-way medium.

109
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
But Seth Finkelstein suggested a deep dive

110
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,840
into port of entry, the main street USA

111
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,960
of Islands of Adventure.

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,720
Yes, this is a land, I mean it's a park I really like.

113
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,560
Oh, is it?

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,400
It's a park I really like.

115
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,320
I'm not sure if you've gotten into that before.

116
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,000
This is sincerely, I do like this land a lot.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,160
And I think it's pretty successful

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,640
in what it's trying to do.

119
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,280
I think it is in a park where it's often,

120
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,080
like the early credit was often given

121
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,240
to Marvel's Super Hero Island,

122
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,080
it's Su's landing of being so successful.

123
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,080
So like living up to the things that they're about.

124
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,400
I think this land actually accomplishes its like backstory,

125
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,080
its idea behind it as well as it can in a park

126
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,440
where the narrative for years was like,

127
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,280
oh, getting this open was such a headache.

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,920
The licensing kept falling through,

129
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,560
we kept losing partners.

130
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,320
They picked up a lot of people who were laid off

131
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,880
from Animal Kingdom, so that was kind of an injection,

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
but like they were running out of money constantly

133
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,120
or resources constantly.

134
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,960
Wow, okay, the struggle was real for Islands of Adventure.

135
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,680
So much fondness from Jason.

136
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,160
Mike, before we started researching,

137
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,360
thoughts and feelings about port of entry

138
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,480
at Islands of Adventure.

139
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,240
I love Islands of Adventure.

140
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,760
I could care less about the port of entry.

141
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,600
I don't think about it.

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,880
I have never stopped and done anything in it.

143
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,760
I've never walked right past.

144
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,160
You haven't ripped the full soundtrack

145
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,480
of Islands of Adventure.

146
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,680
You don't get enthused when the song

147
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,400
Adventure Continues starts welling up.

148
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,080
The main entrance.

149
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,680
I didn't say I didn't like, I don't think I said that,

150
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,800
but I've never thought about it for two seconds.

151
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,040
I thought, okay, do you want to put in the microphone

152
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,320
at least so I can really feel inspired here?

153
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,120
This is very William John Williams-esque

154
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
sort of like soaring march along.

155
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,840
I like this piece of music.

156
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,640
When Jason hears this, he feels what some people feel

157
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,320
when they hear the national anthem.

158
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,760
That's right. That's true.

159
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,120
Certainly it's more pride.

160
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
It's more fun for sure.

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,320
That's his actual home country.

162
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,120
He's a citizen of the IOV.

163
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,280
I pledge allegiance to the IOV.

164
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,880
But reading battle was fun too

165
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,320
because I found out things like I had,

166
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,600
do you know their original characters?

167
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,000
I do.

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,840
I have some clips in fact.

169
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,840
Well, how do you want to tackle this in general?

170
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,560
I don't know.

171
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,200
I wasn't sure.

172
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,800
Honestly, I try to kind of get a good overview of this.

173
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,120
I wasn't sure how much this was.

174
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,600
We're all talking about it versus Mike explaining

175
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Mr. McPhisto where I just kind of got

176
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,480
the base level McPhisto.

177
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,160
I, by the way, think I did a bad job on that episode.

178
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,520
I listened back to it and I was like, oh no.

179
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,880
I feel like I didn't do a good job here.

180
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,720
I'll give this peek behind the curtain

181
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,880
when we finished recording, we stopped recording,

182
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,720
we're packing up.

183
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,600
You went there so much more.

184
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,880
You said that in the episode.

185
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,920
There was more, but that's not even, I just feel like I did.

186
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,400
I didn't do McPhisto justice.

187
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,240
That's all.

188
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
So we have to do it again?

189
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,160
Maybe we have to do it again.

190
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,400
Take two as if there wasn't a previous one.

191
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,440
Yeah, it won't be this month though, don't worry.

192
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,840
People could vote for it.

193
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,000
If you want to vote for we're back to McPhisto immediately.

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,600
Sooner rather than later, before Space Mountain.

195
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,280
Back to McPhisto.

196
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,120
Back to McPhisto.

197
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,440
The return.

198
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,240
If it could be, if it could be Kit Phisto

199
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,200
and McPhisto episode, maybe that could at least give you

200
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,760
a little more of a different flavor.

201
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,600
Sure.

202
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,720
But that's up to the listener.

203
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
That's your birthday.

204
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,120
That's your birthday call.

205
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,960
That's my birthday call.

206
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,800
That's your shot.

207
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,640
Yeah.

208
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,520
So March Club Three, yeah.

209
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,200
Well, as for this, so Islands of Adventure,

210
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,200
it is very like disparate themes in the five lands

211
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
that you go to.

212
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,400
So to establish what is this park

213
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,800
is a pretty particular challenge

214
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,840
because how do you sum up Jurassic Park

215
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,160
and very specifically 90s Marvel

216
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,560
and then some made up stuff and now Harry Potter, but later.

217
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,760
It's a lot to summarize.

218
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,560
And so where they land and really Port of Entry

219
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,000
is also the vibe of the park in general,

220
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,840
because the like de facto, the weenie,

221
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,640
the castle essentially is here.

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,840
The logo sort of stems from the vibe of this.

223
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,960
Like that all has to act as a piece.

224
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,200
And I guess where they land, how do we describe this vibe?

225
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,120
It's this like, it is this adventure port.

226
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,960
It's the kind of city where you launch from

227
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,320
and go and do incredible adventures,

228
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,960
both real and mythical.

229
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,600
Where Sinbad would launch from.

230
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,760
The ancient world, the ancient world.

231
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,680
Because the lighthouse,

232
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,720
which I don't consider a lighthouse in Port of Entry,

233
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,360
Port of Entry is a land after the turnstiles, okay.

234
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,440
Are you now, does this mean that the,

235
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,520
are you saying the lighthouse has to be a different episode?

236
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,360
Is that what you're gunning for?

237
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
I have two shots that I would like

238
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,720
there to be their own episode.

239
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,320
It's the lighthouse and the defunct island skipper tours.

240
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,680
This is, you've got a lot of requests here for this part.

241
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,000
Those are my only two, those are my only two.

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,480
Thin islands of it.

243
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,360
How does the lighthouse need more than?

244
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,400
I think it's funny.

245
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,280
It's like, well, then you do a companion episode

246
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,160
on the globe.

247
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,960
We've never done an episode on the big globe.

248
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,920
Oh, we need to do an episode on the globe for sure.

249
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,760
Yeah, so.

250
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,200
Well, he just said companion.

251
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
Wait, no, companion means they're separate?

252
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes, the companion means they're separate.

253
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,720
But I'll compromise, I'll compromise.

254
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,080
All globes can be in one episode.

255
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,800
Cause globes have changed over the years

256
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,240
and there's globes on both coasts.

257
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,440
Okay, we don't have to do separate.

258
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,280
Globes.

259
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,000
What you're saying is you are not prepared to talk about,

260
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,360
you've refused the call on the lighthouse.

261
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,200
Oh, I mean, I know it's.

262
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,440
In an episode about a land that is entirely restaurants,

263
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,280
you refuse to talk about.

264
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,440
There's shops.

265
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,280
There's a Cinalon.

266
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,120
There's shops.

267
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,960
There's shops.

268
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,800
There's shops.

269
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,520
There's a big, there's a shockingly big caricature station.

270
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
Well, there's 20 minutes right there.

271
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
There's 20 minutes right there.

272
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,320
No room for the lighthouse.

273
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,160
Well, I mean, look, we can say just to establish,

274
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,800
it's called the Ferris Lighthouse

275
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,520
and it's based on the lighthouse of Alexandria.

276
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,160
One of the seven wonders of the ancient world

277
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,920
burned down in third or fourth century.

278
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,760
Okay.

279
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,400
Can we have like the lighthouse keeper

280
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,360
on that episode at least to keep it fresh

281
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,200
and the vibe.

282
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,480
I'd love to have a lighthouse keeper on that.

283
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,560
All right, well, there we go.

284
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,400
Sure.

285
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,360
I think it's just, these are more episodes where like,

286
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,480
I'm free and everyone else is busy.

287
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,600
So I'm like, I'm saying I'll take some of the load for like,

288
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,920
after the Dr. Doom episode and we didn't know that,

289
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,400
you know, you guys weren't 100% sure

290
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,920
about all the backstory in the queue

291
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,600
and the original animation, like the Tom Kenny voice

292
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,160
and that kind of thing.

293
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,720
There's a bunch of weird islands of adventure stuff,

294
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,720
like cut off, like Cartoon Circus recently got online,

295
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,440
like a full version.

296
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,720
This was the show that played in the giant

297
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
Toon Lagoon theater for a short amount of time

298
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,160
before being replaced with BMX tricks,

299
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,440
which is also very funny

300
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,520
because that ran on and off for a while.

301
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,000
But island skipper tour has only lasted two years.

302
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,520
And then there is the much maligned

303
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,560
Sylvester McMonkey McBeans,

304
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,600
very unusual driving machines in Seuss Landing,

305
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,600
the Monorail People Mover thing above that never opened

306
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,960
but would have empty cars running on it.

307
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,560
And then they flipped it to be a new ride

308
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,760
called the High in the Sky Seuss Trolley Train Ride,

309
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,360
which is the current ride.

310
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,040
That I've done, worst queue I've ever been in my life.

311
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,360
Just a spiral up and over.

312
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,480
That is the boringest, slowest.

313
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,320
We did that.

314
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,140
Awful.

315
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,120
Pretty bad, but you know,

316
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,640
when you spend a lot of time in the preview center

317
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,680
and you were an annoying 13 year old going,

318
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,640
is Sylvester McMonkey McBeans

319
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,880
a very unusual driving machine open?

320
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,720
How do we get up there?

321
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,280
I saw the thing running on it.

322
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,240
And they're like, no, it's not.

323
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,800
Don't, it's not.

324
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,760
Have we really established,

325
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,760
like what, because it is so deep seated with you,

326
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,600
with this park.

327
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,440
Is it just a matter of like-

328
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,960
That's what I wanna get into here real quick.

329
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,360
Yeah, I think that's,

330
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,640
since being that we can't talk about the lighthouse,

331
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,920
we'll use the time to talk.

332
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,760
What is it?

333
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,080
Is it just like, was it just a time for you?

334
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,920
Was it like a coming of age?

335
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,760
Yeah, what's going on in your life?

336
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,600
Was it your family?

337
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,960
What's going on in your life?

338
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,280
I have answers for both of these.

339
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,100
Thank you.

340
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,640
A lot of this stuff, it like hit at like 12, 13, like 14.

341
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,760
And it just was like,

342
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,720
when I was just very into this stuff

343
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,480
and my family was going a lot.

344
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,300
Yeah.

345
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,120
So we didn't go for a few years.

346
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,280
And then when we did go back,

347
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,000
we were usually staying at Universal

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,400
cause they were like, please come to our resort

349
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,220
that we fucked up with a weird name about escaping.

350
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,840
So are you implying cheap rates

351
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,800
that somehow you knew about

352
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,240
and were excited about when you were 14?

353
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,580
Well, I didn't know about it until after it was all booked,

354
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,280
but also staying at, we always stayed at the Hard Rock.

355
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,360
So then you just flash your room key at rides

356
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,640
and go right to the front.

357
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,540
And it worked.

358
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,560
Is it like that this was, it was you coming into your own?

359
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,560
It's a park, it feels like your park because it's new.

360
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,280
You're not hearing about a previous generation's memories.

361
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,680
There's probably a certain amount about that.

362
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,160
These are probably a lot of parks

363
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,760
that I went off on my own.

364
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,520
Like, oh, we're going to the back to the hotel.

365
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,680
If you want to do more rides, go ahead.

366
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,240
Cause I'm like 15 or so.

367
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,360
Yes, I do.

368
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,160
Yes, I absolutely do.

369
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,240
Dad, I feel I completely agree,

370
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,840
especially on the Marvel thing.

371
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,160
Cause when you were a kid in the nineties,

372
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,720
there were only a couple of kids in school

373
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,400
who knew Marvel comics.

374
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,240
Oh yeah.

375
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,060
Really well.

376
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,440
It was not, look kids, it was not like it is today.

377
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,280
I, and I never dropped off to,

378
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,160
you had some normal years where you got away from it a little.

379
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,000
Not so much.

380
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,840
Oh, okay.

381
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,680
Yeah, I wasn't hardcore collecting necessarily,

382
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,960
but then in college I would like,

383
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
there's a comic store over here I should go.

384
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,640
Oh yeah.

385
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,160
But I was every Wednesday, like until,

386
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,200
until I guess in college I was going like,

387
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,040
Jason's trying to prove he's a bigger fan than I am.

388
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,880
And I don't like it.

389
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,680
Oh no, I'm not at all saying it.

390
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm saying I have more brain rot than you do.

391
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,640
I don't know about that.

392
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,360
I think we both rotted our brains, brains plenty.

393
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,480
Guys, we can't do little nerd face-offs.

394
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,800
Oh, actually I've been wanting to ask,

395
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,080
how are the CVS deals going between you guys?

396
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,280
Okay, Scott, here's the deal.

397
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,320
Here's actually the update.

398
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,800
Here's the deal, I am winning

399
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,160
and I am the best at the deals.

400
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,640
Well, I've got other things I'm working on

401
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,120
as far as the CVS to try to figure out some good deals.

402
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,960
I try here, let me tell you this,

403
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,080
this is an exclusive because I did not have time

404
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,480
to make a video of this

405
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,040
because the Zankou chicken was ready

406
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,480
and I needed to run and go get it

407
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,680
and bring it back to the family.

408
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,680
But I tried to buy wine with the coupon.

409
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,640
Oh no, it's in the fine print, no alcohol.

410
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,480
No, it's in the fine print, no alcohol.

411
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,040
This is like you can't use discounts

412
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,880
in the theme parks on alcohol.

413
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,880
$2.50 bottle of wine from CVS.

414
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,600
You could not take Sutter home two euro.

415
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,320
Wait a minute, Mike, separate issue.

416
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,640
Why are you buying his oral wine?

417
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,440
It was $5 discounted.

418
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,760
Even I go up, even I go to $10 wine.

419
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,640
It was for the bits, it was for the bits.

420
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,880
Oh, I see, okay.

421
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,200
So, but no, I'm working on it.

422
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,040
There'll be more videos to come.

423
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,200
You've got a fine bottle of Digits at home,

424
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,320
which we've established.

425
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,160
That's true.

426
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,200
Bring your Digits first.

427
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,800
But no, all that to say that when I went,

428
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,000
whenever I was, whenever it opened,

429
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,640
we went the first year,

430
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,000
the Marvel land specifically was like

431
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,120
it had been built for me,

432
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,800
because it was comic specific.

433
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,640
Yeah.

434
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,680
And the Spider-Man ride and everything.

435
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,200
Like that felt like, oh my God,

436
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,960
like when am I gonna get something that is tailored to me?

437
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,800
And that's more so even than any Marvel thing they'll do now.

438
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,200
And again, I like the movies fine and every,

439
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,800
I like the movies, but back then when it was like,

440
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,360
these comics that only like me and three people

441
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,400
in my class of 700 in my high school,

442
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,320
like that felt crazy, yeah.

443
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,200
Yeah, and also an even smaller contingent,

444
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,400
meaning me, I love the Sun,

445
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,480
I read the Sunday Funnies every week.

446
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,320
Well, I like that too,

447
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,440
but at that point it wasn't as relevant

448
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,440
and I hadn't gotten like retro poisoned

449
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,760
like I have now, whatever you would call it.

450
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,600
I wasn't, I knew-

451
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,320
I knew a little about the King Features syndicate.

452
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,800
Yeah, we know, we read, we knew Baby Blues,

453
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,880
we read all the stuff.

454
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,360
Sure, Foxtrot, the teen in Foxtrot was named Jason,

455
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,600
I felt a lot of affinity with him.

456
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,440
So I hear what you're saying there.

457
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,840
By the way, it is funny that like,

458
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,520
here is this land where you embark,

459
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,960
you embark from this place into world's unknown.

460
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,280
Dun dun, ba ba ba ba ba, and then you go see-

461
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,120
Betty Boop.

462
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,760
Kathy, a big sliding down ice cream,

463
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,840
a big Dagwood sandwich.

464
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,600
A giant mural of gasoline alley,

465
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,600
which I don't think other than the bookstore market

466
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,160
for fanagraphic, I don't think anyone

467
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,760
besides the reprinners of gasoline alley

468
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,280
has thought about gasoline alley much.

469
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,840
Even Seuss, like Seuss and Tomb Lagoon both,

470
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,120
the premise of the whole place is like,

471
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,160
great adventure awaits.

472
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,960
And most of Tomb Lagoon is like,

473
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,040
your wife's mad at you again.

474
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,960
You didn't take the trash out last night

475
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,280
and your old lady's upset.

476
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,440
That's not as epic as the sort of tone would suggest

477
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
when you go in with that piece of music you play.

478
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,720
There's an adventure, follow Billy's dotted line

479
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,000
from the family circus.

480
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,960
The adventure is like Marmaduke got off his leash.

481
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,800
Yeah.

482
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,000
It is a little, look, it's a little corny,

483
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,920
but also the practical reality of Tomb Lagoon

484
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,840
is they're like, we're going to hit you

485
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,800
with a power washer's worth of water

486
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,320
because it's so hot.

487
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,400
So that is some adventure.

488
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,440
And Seuss, all the places,

489
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,600
I mean, I guess there's some Seuss

490
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,800
that's a little more adventury,

491
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,640
but Cat in the Hat is just like stress,

492
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,800
kids stress the ride.

493
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,040
It's not like some great adventure you're going on.

494
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,640
It's not, it doesn't fit the tone.

495
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,080
I mean, I liked Cat in the Hat growing up.

496
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,760
I'm not saying I didn't like the Cat in the Hat,

497
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,480
I'm just saying tone wise, as far as like,

498
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,600
ah, welcome to the adventure.

499
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,440
And the adventure is just like,

500
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,680
oh, mom and dad are gonna kill me.

501
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,480
Like that's not the adventure.

502
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,920
Jurassic Park is the adventure

503
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,760
and Marvel kind of is the adventure.

504
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,800
Cat in the Hat must have hit you really particularly

505
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,120
that it is, it's a very popular kids book

506
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,040
about how mom will be mad at you if you deviate.

507
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,200
Are you a man?

508
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
This is, I mean, the kid, like, whatever,

509
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,240
like the house floods and there's thing one

510
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,560
and thing two and creature,

511
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,300
like that you had that amount of stress,

512
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,760
you know, because you made a blanket for the Ghostbusters.

513
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,600
Yeah.

514
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,720
This fucking cat is gonna get in here

515
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,840
and I'm gonna get in trouble

516
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,640
for all this shit this cat is doing.

517
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,280
I mean, I do think as a very little kid,

518
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,760
like, oh, the places you'll go Cat in the Hat,

519
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,720
like these were fun adventures you would get to go on.

520
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,920
You know what I'm saying?

521
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,880
Tonally, I would say Epic Universe,

522
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,240
maybe other than the monsters feels like,

523
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
okay, all those things are like,

524
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,080
adventure awaits in Mario,

525
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,240
adventure awaits in How to Train Your Dragon

526
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,720
and Harry Potter.

527
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,440
It does all feel kind of like more like epic adventures

528
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,440
that you'll go on versus little Nemo,

529
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,520
well, maybe little Nemo in Slumberland is an adventure.

530
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,400
Maybe I just contradicted myself.

531
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,800
I think, yeah, little Nemo I think is actually,

532
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,880
that one we should have gotten a whole ride on

533
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,840
because it would have been crazy.

534
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,080
But like Beetle Bailey overslept and Sarge is mad at him.

535
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,520
That's the adventure that awaits in Toon Lagoon.

536
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,640
Well, if you were in the barracks with Beetle like I was,

537
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,560
that's a real adventure with Sarge is mad.

538
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,800
Sure, sure.

539
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,840
No, I get it.

540
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,080
I think part of that might be they have a little easier time

541
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,680
when they, to live up to the premise

542
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,640
where they're owned by communications conglomerate

543
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,960
with unlimited money than like a liquor dynasty

544
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,760
who's offloading them to a French film company.

545
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,960
Yeah, it's a good name.

546
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,800
I understand it.

547
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,880
And there was obviously like,

548
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,240
we've talked a little bit about the different options they had

549
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,760
or the different ideas they had for lands.

550
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,600
Yeah.

551
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,840
So I get it.

552
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,680
It's just funny.

553
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,640
It looks really good if you were to call it Cartoon World.

554
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,840
It's like, oh yeah, that's what this is.

555
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,680
Yeah, sure.

556
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,880
We didn't have enough cartoons at the end of the day.

557
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,960
No.

558
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,160
They did some like, there's, you know,

559
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,280
generic mythical world, which this really,

560
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,760
it's almost like if that fed right into,

561
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,480
if those were next to each other.

562
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,640
That makes so much thematic sense.

563
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,920
But I, but I don't know.

564
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,000
I mean, I like that land and I do like this.

565
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,040
I like Port of Entry.

566
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,880
Yeah, I do too.

567
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,440
Yeah, I think that land and this land are very copacetic

568
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,440
and kind of the top level for 1999 with fluctuating,

569
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,560
in terms of attention to detail,

570
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,240
this is as good as it got in 1999 with insane budgets.

571
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,080
Sure.

572
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,400
Well, look at what made Disney starting to get cruddy around then.

573
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,240
Yes.

574
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,000
So to like, that, you know,

575
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,000
and some of the islands of adventure is IP,

576
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,920
but that you are getting some,

577
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,640
here is like completely original worlds

578
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,240
that you haven't seen before and an original vibe

579
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,640
and this like mashup of whatever ancient world,

580
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,200
Egypt, Africa, Asia,

581
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,600
Egypt, Africa, yeah, Middle East and Africa.

582
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,440
That's all combining.

583
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,960
Yeah.

584
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,800
I don't know.

585
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,680
This was like a huge dose of originality

586
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,320
put together very well.

587
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,240
Yeah, and I think, you know,

588
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,440
like Main Streets at Orlando parks,

589
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,680
you had Main Street USA,

590
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,200
you had like the main drag at MGM Studios

591
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,040
and Epcot was always kind of like, you know,

592
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,040
little buildings, brutalist metal and stone buildings.

593
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,120
It's not a proper, you have your kind of your entrance area

594
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,120
with the fountain, but that's not quite the format of,

595
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,000
you know, not all theme parks have a Main Street.

596
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,160
Yeah, and that Epcot thing has changed so much.

597
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,560
Like it's still changing.

598
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,800
They've messed with what exactly you see

599
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,960
in front of Spaceship Earth a couple of times at this point.

600
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,720
Yeah, I mean, this is a lot more exciting in 1999,

601
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,600
this area than the giant stone slabs

602
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,840
with poorly printed digital photographs on it.

603
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,000
So I think at the time it was also just exciting to,

605
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,040
one, have a brand new park,

606
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,800
two, it was exciting to see like another place

607
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,120
taking Disney's ball and running with it

608
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,080
in terms of big attractions, big theming, you know,

609
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,160
something different because like Animal Kingdom was cool.

610
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,040
We liked Animal Kingdom, but like,

611
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,680
it was kind of a heat trap those first few years

612
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,240
when all the trees were really tiny.

613
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,080
It still is a heat trap.

614
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,400
Yeah, it was a heat trap.

615
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
It was hotish.

616
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,360
The hottest thing we were there a couple of years ago.

617
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,520
My family was definitely of the mind of like,

618
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,720
could use a couple more rides

619
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,640
and Islands of Adventure certainly has never been hurting

620
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,480
for rides.

621
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,840
Yeah, that's true from the very beginning.

622
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,680
Absolutely.

623
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,920
Yeah, and I,

624
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,320
what was my point here?

625
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,360
I don't know that it is like, okay,

626
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,600
Universal up until that point, the vibe,

627
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,520
but there had always been like well themed things

628
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,920
in Universal and in the other Universal Florida park,

629
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,520
but it also you get in and it's all sound stages.

630
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,480
And there's a lot couched in that

631
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,160
and good theming within that.

632
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,320
But this part of entry is the first thing that you see

633
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,000
in Universal's first stab at we are fully committed.

634
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,320
You're in the world.

635
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,320
It's not, you're going into stage 16 and oh,

636
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,200
something went wrong in there.

637
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,200
And I've, they've proven so adept at that kind of thing

638
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,840
ever since.

639
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,720
And it does sort of stem from this era in this part.

640
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,600
Also, and I remembered this,

641
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,080
but I had to find the like reports that came out.

642
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,360
In 2021, Island of Adventure is the most attended theme park,

643
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,040
the second most attended theme park in the world

644
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,560
after the Magic Kingdom.

645
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,840
And the-

646
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,160
You had to look that up from the tattoo on your arm.

647
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah.

648
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,840
Well-

649
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,360
And then it says, that's that fact.

650
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,600
And then it's, and then bitches at the end.

651
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,920
I had to look it up because it's kind of a weighted ranking

652
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,760
because they were like, okay, we're here's the 2019,

653
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,000
2020 and 2021 numbers.

654
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Cause they're all over the place with closures and stuff.

655
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,280
But 2021, sheerly on its own, Islands of Adventure,

656
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,080
like jumps ahead of all the other Disney parks in Orlando.

657
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,920
Geez.

658
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,280
And that's still the record of all the other,

659
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,920
you're saying that just that year of all time.

660
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,240
No, I'm saying in it.

661
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,240
So in 2021, Magic Kingdom at 12.6 million visitors,

662
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,480
Islands of Adventure had 9 million visitors.

663
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,320
Okay.

664
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,240
He's so happy in the research for it.

665
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,080
Looking up all these.

666
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,920
I loved it.

667
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,840
And then, and then 14.2 million.

668
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,280
Is there like a box office, Mojo,

669
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,800
whatever that site is called for theme park attendance

670
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,440
yearly?

671
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,560
There is like an annual report that looks like this,

672
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,280
that the TIA puts out.

673
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,520
Okay. So we can have access to the TIA information

674
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,360
every year.

675
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,120
This, this doc is public.

676
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,960
Okay, good.

677
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,320
Cause we don't have a good relationship with the TIA and-

678
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,760
So, but when you add them all up.

679
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,880
They haven't voluntarily asked us to host their award show.

680
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,200
We weren't a good fit to go to the awards too.

681
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,400
Oh, I forgot that.

682
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,200
We also could have just bought tickets.

683
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,040
Yeah, for like thousand dollars.

684
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,360
No, it was only a few hundred.

685
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,480
For the, it's like the rock and roll hall of fame.

686
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,800
For our own table.

687
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,640
We could get it.

688
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,480
You can buy your own table.

689
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,640
We got a Kurt email saying we weren't a good fit

690
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,960
for the TIAs.

691
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,200
You know, those emails, those PRP.

692
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
You're saying they don't know the tone.

693
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,040
Maybe they don't know the tone.

694
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,640
They turn over all the time, you know.

695
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,120
Well, we still, I mean, yes,

696
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,240
it would be nice if they asked us to host, but.

697
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,520
All right, Jason's made it clear.

698
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,080
He's going to finance a thousand dollar table

699
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,040
for us to get to these TIAs finally.

700
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,880
And thank you.

701
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,280
And we will be your guests as well our wives

702
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,480
and a bunch of other friends.

703
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,240
Sure. Thank you, Jason.

704
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,760
We should go down again this year when the TIAs happen.

705
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,600
Oh, let's go around the-

706
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,280
I cannot disagree with you guys more.

707
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,000
We gotta work tuxedos this time though.

708
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,880
The time where you just floated around

709
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,120
wanting to be at a bar with anonymous,

710
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,000
unrecognizable deep feet parking.

711
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,720
No, we were haunting a confection center.

712
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,480
And then we went to the bar where we were clearly

713
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,400
not in a bathing suit or a tuxedo.

714
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,240
We made a mistake that year.

715
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,680
And the mistake was not wearing tuxedos.

716
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,280
This year we will be wearing tuxedos

717
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,320
and we will try to sneak into the awards.

718
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,440
That you need to rent, correct?

719
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,560
Well, prior tux says my measurements on file.

720
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,720
I married a tuxedo a few years ago.

721
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,640
And yeah.

722
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,920
I have Joseph A. Bank has, do they have tuxes

723
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,760
or do they just have suits?

724
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,680
I forget.

725
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,360
I think they'll supply you with both.

726
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,200
Yeah.

727
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,440
So maybe this year we'll go full suits, full tuxedos.

728
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,840
And then we'll go there and try to sneak in.

729
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,200
And you'll be like, you know, I,

730
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,120
oh my God, you'll never get it.

731
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,480
I met Dan Johnson.

732
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,320
Silence.

733
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,160
Who's Dan Johnson?

734
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,440
I actually, I'm not even sure who Dan Johnson is.

735
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,760
Oh, he's the head of operations at a Kentucky kingdom.

736
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,040
Jason went up on stage with him to accept his award.

737
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,480
Yeah.

738
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,360
I'll take presenting an award.

739
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,800
Cause you can get a few jokes and if they don't want full

740
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,000
hosts, I don't want to do that.

741
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,840
See you all.

742
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,680
Yeah.

743
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,520
You shoot for the star and I shoot for attainable.

744
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,720
The only thing, the Scott does really does not want to do

745
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,960
this, but I think the only thing that would entice him is

746
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,440
that if we put together a, like a, it's a wonderful night

747
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,480
for Oscar, Oscar, Oscar song that we would have to do

748
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,320
at the start.

749
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,160
I think.

750
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,000
Yeah.

751
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,960
That's very tempting that we would do that.

752
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,600
There is, I think there's no scenario where there's an open

753
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,040
playing field to write a Billy Crystal medley.

754
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,880
Yeah.

755
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,920
That would kill for any other crowd.

756
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,160
I do that for a ISIS event.

757
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,480
The top five attacks this year were, so they killed number two.

758
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,440
Who's number two now.

759
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,480
Who was number three?

760
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,720
Well, well, I guess we're all willing to host that too.

761
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,760
So either way.

762
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,600
Okay.

763
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,080
Port of entry stuff here.

764
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,920
Let me read this.

765
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,800
This, this sums up the vibe pretty well that I don't know

766
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,640
where I pulled this from,

767
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,760
that it's recalling a literary seaside explorers

768
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,120
marketplace of global architectural elements,

769
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,440
real, ancient and imagined.

770
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,280
So it's kind, it is sort of, you know,

771
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,240
it's based on things from our world, but it's also,

772
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,920
it's very, it's very mythological and it's very like a place

773
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,320
where, where time doesn't exist.

774
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,040
Like I was looking up details on walls and there's, you know,

775
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,000
here's like some rental spot, right?

776
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,920
And then painted on the wall in very like old school fashion.

777
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,800
It says flats to let, and then it lists the amounts of time

778
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,160
you could rent a flat for and it's day, week, month, year,

779
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,200
lustrum, decade, century, millennium.

780
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,960
I don't know what, I've never heard lustrum before.

781
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,560
Lustrum.

782
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,960
But you see, it's so like not only you,

783
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,920
you could rent for a day, but also for a century,

784
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,280
because this is a place of gods and myths.

785
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,640
Yeah, yeah.

786
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,000
I like that.

787
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,400
I never noticed it when I was there.

788
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,240
There's a lot of photo, there's a lot of like a steampunky

789
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,880
kind of ritual, like photo ops that you can sit in,

790
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,600
sit on a tie, sit on a leopard.

791
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,520
Do you think, why did I, why do I always just race through this

792
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,360
area when I get there?

793
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,440
Because you want to get to a ride.

794
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,280
Yeah, you want to get to a ride.

795
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,000
When I'm looking at pictures, I can appreciate it.

796
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,040
And I like what you're telling me here.

797
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,720
And I like, I guess maybe it's just,

798
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,040
there's not as much as Main Street where you're like forced to be

799
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,120
on Main Street longer.

800
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,440
It does feel over quickly.

801
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,720
It doesn't feel like a ton of physical space.

802
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,360
Now I have the question for Jason.

803
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,320
Has Jason stopped specifically to,

804
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,240
I'm going to take several hours to breathe in the port of entry?

805
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,000
Answers no.

806
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,400
No, it isn't. It isn't.

807
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,360
I appreciate it when I'm going down.

808
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,080
When you're racing full speed faster than you ever raced before,

809
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,400
because you're in the Orlando sun, which is where you get your powers.

810
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Yeah.

811
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,480
I like the day we were down there together,

812
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,240
I was like looking at my watch and I was like, OK,

813
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,080
they're all coming from Disney World.

814
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,840
It's eight fifty.

815
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,120
Do I have time to go in and do a quick Spider-Man or Doctor Doom?

816
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,880
The reality was I did have plenty of time because you both were a lot farther away.

817
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,000
I took no, it was totally reasonable.

818
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,280
I was staying at the wasn't reasonable.

819
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,160
My bad.

820
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,600
My fault.

821
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,840
I like you turn in when you're at Islands of Adventure in Orlando,

822
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,280
you turn into one of those rising grind guys.

823
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,120
You're like, yeah, I'm up at 430 a.m.

824
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,480
I'm doing my exercises and then I hit it.

825
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,760
I hit it hard.

826
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,920
Well, because this park closes so early.

827
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,560
It used to be open late at night.

828
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,120
There used to be nighttime entertainment.

829
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,760
Now closes at like seven or eight.

830
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,160
Turn into like the rock, though.

831
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,320
I'm saying like I sleep three hours a night.

832
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,280
Sure.

833
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,360
And then I hit it hard in the middle of the day.

834
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,840
I just and then meal wise, I smell the chicken breast.

835
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,040
It's just the aroma like gives me a little bit of bread.

836
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,880
There is there's airborne protein.

837
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,160
That's actually all you need.

838
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,360
I don't need anything else.

839
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,600
Well, that might be part of the reason why,

840
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,120
because there is like a candy shop along this way.

841
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,800
And there's like a default like entry to a theme park bakery.

842
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,000
And those are never the strongest like food options.

843
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
I like Confisco Grill a lot.

844
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,600
I've been there once or twice.

845
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,280
OK, yeah, this is let me let me say something else about my

846
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,640
my journey in discovering Port of Entry, because as I said,

847
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,600
I've never taken the time to do anything at Port of Entry.

848
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,440
Preferring rides, if you can imagine.

849
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,760
Although I realize I'm tied with Jason.

850
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,360
Jason also has never just walked around.

851
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,960
I take my time getting out.

852
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,160
OK, I go through the islands of Adventure Trading Company,

853
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,240
which is what they call their big store.

854
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,280
OK, sure.

855
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,040
Separate a lot of names of stores are trading or market or sure.

856
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,240
That sort of thing.

857
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,000
Well, that's what so basically so we this wins as the as the topic.

858
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,920
And in the not only does it win, but there's so many comments

859
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,000
hammering.

860
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I mean, it should be main feed.

861
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,880
It really should be main feed.

862
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,600
It's got to be main feed.

863
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,080
Obviously, you know, it should have been main feed.

864
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,240
But actually, I'm not going to vote for it because it is a protest vote.

865
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,320
I'm not voting for it because it should be main feed.

866
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,680
So I'm hearing all I've seen all that fair and I'm

867
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,720
and I'm like, well, what am I missing in this?

868
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,160
Because the enthusiasm is so hot.

869
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,640
What have I not stopped to check out that is so enriching about Port of Entry?

870
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,400
And then I pull out an Islands of Adventure map and I look at the attraction,

871
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,080
the attractions list for what what you can do in Port of Entry.

872
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,920
And I and my eyes go straight to this this five a through E.

873
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,080
D and E are Starbucks and Cinnabon.

874
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,320
Yeah, it's got to be made.

875
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,200
So I mean, first of all, I mean, Cinnabon is going to take you 45 to talk about it.

876
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,480
And also, you're not going to want to miss out on the ad revenue.

877
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,160
Like when you when sponsors start, when HelloFresh hears that you're going

878
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,680
to talk about the Cinnabon at it's going to make people hungry.

879
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,480
And then you're going to get there's never going to be more.

880
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,720
HelloFresh sales than through your promo code that day.

881
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,640
I wonder if it's because

882
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,720
the kind of have rules for this stuff.

883
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,800
But then also we don't.

884
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,040
There's been second gate ish for like main feeds.

885
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,400
There's been, you know, it's not such a reason.

886
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
It's just an art fest.

887
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,240
We like to keep it interesting.

888
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,360
We like to keep it.

889
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,120
Those rules are there to drive ourselves insane.

890
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,840
OK, but I wonder, just because it's in the main park

891
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,960
and it's something you walk through, I'm wondering why.

892
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,600
It is the entryway to the second most attended park in the world.

893
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,080
But there's nothing there.

894
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,280
Yes, but you never got to know.

895
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
You don't hang out here.

896
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,280
You know, I just wonder out.

897
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,520
It looks great at night.

898
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,560
I really get it.

899
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,880
You have to understand. I like it.

900
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,680
I do too.

901
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,120
There's just nothing.

902
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,600
I just race right past it right now.

903
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,360
But this is maybe there.

904
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,880
I think they're telling all this to teach us the lesson.

905
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,120
Yeah, maybe they're off.

906
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,560
They're rushing through the gate.

907
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,160
They don't realize it should be a main.

908
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,560
It's a metaphor about life port of entry.

909
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,280
Well, yeah, the adventure.

910
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,800
Hey, the adventure begins like it says in the giant fake stone.

911
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,560
And really, the adventure begins with slow down.

912
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,000
Don't get to the adventure.

913
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,600
The adventure doesn't quite begin.

914
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,680
It doesn't quite begin.

915
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,400
I am amazed that none of us have hung out at the backwater bar more.

916
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,480
Well, when we're there next, I will spend more time in this area.

917
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,760
I will. I mean, now, when I say more time,

918
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,640
anything longer than two minutes is more time.

919
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,360
Sure. Yeah.

920
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,040
Eight minutes and I'm like doubled or tripled my time.

921
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,840
My average time where I spend in the port of entry listeners.

922
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,960
I hope you're hearing this. This is Mike saying all that.

923
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,960
I'm saying all those quotes were Mike Carlson, not Scott,

924
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,400
who you get mad at for opinions like this all the time.

925
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,280
Oh, they I'll say save some of that anger for old Mike.

926
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,320
Hey, bring it on.

927
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,480
I think we can all agree on this funny detail.

928
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,440
This giant painted mural that used to be outside the bar that says,

929
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,240
say Seagram's and be sure.

930
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,160
And it's got a giant painting of a Seagram seven crown

931
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,320
blended whiskey, mostly notable for being the second ingredient

932
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,840
and a seven and seven.

933
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,640
So in this mythical land, they have Seagram's.

934
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,920
Well, when the park opened and still owned by Seagram's,

935
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,240
it's like a weird giant ad that sat around for ages.

936
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,480
But it's still there.

937
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,200
No, it's painted over.

938
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,520
Now it's painted over.

939
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,280
Pulls the seat up to the bar and

940
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,600
what's Seagram's please?

941
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,320
Do you have any well whiskey I could sup upon?

942
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,200
Look, I smuggled a Cinnabon in here.

943
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,520
I must invite the gods.

944
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,840
I must invite the liquor never ordered by anyone at any bar

945
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,000
you've ever been to anyone with.

946
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,000
Probably one of the things I liked about Islands of Adventure

947
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,600
is there is shit like sea,

948
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,680
not Seagram's, but Cinnabon,

949
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,920
Onions, you know, there is bullshit.

950
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,960
And I love the mall at 13.

951
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,800
I love the little taste of the mall.

952
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,160
I never went to any of these places.

953
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,400
The violence of adventure. I'm going to fucking theme park.

954
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,760
I'm not going to the mall place.

955
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,520
Where did you get sick at City Walk? Hollywood?

956
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,880
It's the other pretzel one. Oh, Wetzel's.

957
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,640
What you got? You felt ill.

958
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,200
No, never had that problem with any ends.

959
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,200
I also still don't know how I'm supposed to say any.

960
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,960
I always said any ends.

961
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,240
What do you wait? What do you think it's supposed to be?

962
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,720
I swear I've heard people say onyons.

963
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,920
Onyons? No, I say any ends.

964
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,760
You make both of them an on?

965
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,800
Well, that doesn't make any ends.

966
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,720
An would never be said on.

967
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,360
I don't know.

968
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,960
You have a syllable out too in there, I feel like.

969
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,760
There's a syllable missing when you're saying that, right?

970
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,640
Any, any, any ends.

971
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,760
I think it's the same N.

972
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,160
You're saying any ends.

973
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,680
No, it's just the fill.

974
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,680
You just mush all the words together into the indecipherable phrase.

975
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,640
I think it's just anti-ends.

976
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,440
Yeah. That's my guess.

977
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,280
That's what I think.

978
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,560
Onty-ums.

979
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,400
So just to be...

980
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,240
But hold on, sorry.

981
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,080
No, no, no.

982
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,520
Onty-ans is possible.

983
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,640
Yeah, it's weird.

984
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,040
Yeah, it is really weird.

985
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,360
Yeah.

986
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,000
Onty-ant.

987
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,720
That doesn't...

988
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,280
You have to think about it.

989
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,480
You have to choose to do it.

990
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:53,880
Yeah.

991
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,560
Can you...

992
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,320
Does somebody pronounce the name an like on?

993
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:03,280
I might be over-correcting because when I'm self-conceived about saying milk, you know?

994
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,880
Right.

995
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,400
Milk.

996
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,320
What's the milk that you...

997
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,200
He says milk.

998
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
No, okay.

999
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,240
Very funny though, the listener at a live show gave the button that said M-E-L-K on it.

1000
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,040
Was it made for that?

1001
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,120
Made for it because we got an argument about how I say milk.

1002
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,000
We did?

1003
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,600
Yeah, on an episode a long time ago.

1004
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,120
When you say argument, was it an actual argument?

1005
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,960
Not an argument per se, but it was one of those like, what did you just say moments?

1006
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,920
Well, we wrapped it up.

1007
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,560
We like...

1008
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,840
It was a tussle at least, but then it ended by a set, look, Jason, we respect the way you say it.

1009
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,440
You're the heart of PTR.

1010
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,880
Let's just put this aside.

1011
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,320
Let's share a Cinnabon like lovers.

1012
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,560
We're gonna have to cut it in three and that's gonna be difficult, but we'll figure it out.

1013
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,640
I was just gonna say, I think it's weird.

1014
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,920
One of the things you like about Port of Entry is that it has a Cinnabon that you also don't want to go to.

1015
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,000
And you'll never go.

1016
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,360
I won't ever go.

1017
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:04,120
Look, I know the line is gonna be smaller, Crisson Moon Bakery, which I think is a pretty good pun.

1018
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:09,440
That line, I'm pretty sure is similar or shorter.

1019
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,040
That line's gonna be shorter.

1020
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,160
Cinnabon is gonna be more satisfying.

1021
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,000
Oh, really?

1022
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,520
If you have to eat breakfast.

1023
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,120
Have you done either though?

1024
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,000
No.

1025
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,760
Then what?

1026
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,240
You're making judgments about things you've never done.

1027
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,120
Why do you think it'll be...

1028
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,840
Seriously, why would Cinnabon be...

1029
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,320
Because everyone loves the Cinnabon.

1030
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,600
They're delicious.

1031
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,800
But do they actually have breakfast items at the other place?

1032
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,960
Yeah.

1033
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,280
Breakfast and sandwiches and stuff and coffee and juice.

1034
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:44,920
So you just think that Cinnabon does the one thing really well and it'll be just better to have a baby's head-size Cinnabon versus a burrito or something.

1035
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,840
You can get bites.

1036
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,440
You can get Cinnabon bites.

1037
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,920
Cinnabon, I'm sure.

1038
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,680
At the theme park?

1039
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,400
What if it's a limited menu?

1040
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,160
I'm sure it's a limited menu, but I think that's a pretty big seller for them at this point.

1041
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,480
Okay, that would make the cut of a limited menu.

1042
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,800
I guess if it's a quick service restaurant, your probably better bet is the chain.

1043
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,600
I guess I can see what you're saying there.

1044
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,560
Now, I'm a quick cup of coffee in a Clif Bar kind of guy, usually in the morning at theme parks.

1045
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,960
Well, yeah, you rise and then your energy, whatever your energy powder is that you're taking.

1046
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,840
Oh, sure.

1047
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,520
Yeah.

1048
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,440
Well, I drink it bottled.

1049
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,840
I drink it Logan Paul's energy drink.

1050
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1051
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,560
Wrestling superstar Logan Paul.

1052
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,960
That's right.

1053
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,720
So, okay.

1054
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,400
Will you next time you're there, go to one of these places?

1055
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,880
Sounds like no.

1056
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,560
Sure, no, I'll give it a shot.

1057
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,120
I never gave it much thought.

1058
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,400
This is a strange mix to me of hyper enthusiasm, but also refusal.

1059
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,560
I think I just like to amble around, like up and down the street.

1060
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,440
I don't think I've spent terribly long on it.

1061
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,960
Peruse the local market, the marketplace and the crinkets.

1062
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,840
Okay, how about this?

1063
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,360
Next time you're there, will you sort of kind of like in a fun way,

1064
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,120
sing a song up and down the street, like singing in the rain style?

1065
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,440
I don't think that's ever been my MO.

1066
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,480
So I don't...

1067
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,160
You're welcome.

1068
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,560
That seems something you would like.

1069
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,880
If you would like to do it or ideally you would like to witness me doing it.

1070
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,560
Even though I have no interest doing that.

1071
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,520
I'll do it if you do it.

1072
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,840
If we both get Cinnabons and then we have a little song and dance.

1073
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,360
We meet the explorers.

1074
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,560
We meet the walk around.

1075
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,000
Yeah, sure.

1076
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,240
I'll do it next time we're there.

1077
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,040
Because again, I feel like I've missed out now.

1078
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,520
Well, I think a lot of people partly miss out now because so many people like hop on the

1079
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,800
train at Universal Florida and take it over and come in the back.

1080
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,120
Yeah.

1081
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,320
Oh, does that piss you off that now there's a new entrance or that you don't even get an entrance?

1082
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,080
You aren't getting what Universal creatives Mark Woodbury intended.

1083
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,640
That you pass through an exotic marketplace and then something tells you the adventure begins.

1084
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,400
I prefer the main end.

1085
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,600
I like the vibes.

1086
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,480
I like the vibe.

1087
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,400
This is a heavy vibe based land.

1088
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,240
And if you want to buy an overpriced beach dress.

1089
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,600
But here's the thing.

1090
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:19,120
JK Rowling aside, the ultimate way to get in to do Harry Potter is to go in in regular Universal,

1091
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:26,160
go into Diagon Alley first, then take the Hogwarts Express to Hogsmeade to get to Hogwarts

1092
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,480
Castle.

1093
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,760
If you were taking a kid there, that would be the main thing you would do.

1094
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,040
You wouldn't go.

1095
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,840
You would go to the correct order, I believe.

1096
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,640
That is the order and the storyline wise.

1097
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,000
Storyline wise, that's storyline wise because you start out in a regular London.

1098
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,480
You go on the train station, then you go to Diagon Alley, which is fantastical or whatever.

1099
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,880
If you're a kid and you're thinking you're going to go to Hogwarts, then you go to the train,

1100
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,640
then you see all Hogwarts in the distance.

1101
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,600
There we are.

1102
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,400
That's the narrative way to do it, which would prevent you from going through this wonderful

1103
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,200
port of entry.

1104
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:12,080
To me, the way that you're supposed to do it is to walk past an unthemed Starbucks,

1105
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,200
a theater that's playing a Kung Fu Panda 3D movie,

1106
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,760
then round a hard right corner and then just be in Hogwarts and there's nothing else.

1107
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,080
Yeah.

1108
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,840
And then you leave into Springfield.

1109
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,640
That's my Hollywood-centric view.

1110
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,680
And the only way you said they can improve it is if you get to a very important decision point

1111
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,440
and right is Hogwarts and left is a big Fast and Furious ride.

1112
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:35,760
Yeah.

1113
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah.

1114
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,320
So you can make a good decision there.

1115
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,800
That's a different way to go about it, but we'll see.

1116
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,400
It throws you in more.

1117
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,880
But maybe they'll solve this problem and they'll do the same thing where there'll be another

1118
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,680
entrance and they'll finally do Diagon Alley here.

1119
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,600
What's your theory about if they were going to do Diagon here?

1120
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,760
There's many different people who have speculated this.

1121
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,960
First of all, I will say there's a very strong rumor that Donkey Kong is up next here.

1122
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,440
What?

1123
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,680
And they're demolishing another sound stage.

1124
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,080
Wow.

1125
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,400
I think they were doing the voice maybe.

1126
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,600
Okay.

1127
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,720
Or the voice.

1128
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,480
The voice pretty far into the back.

1129
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:14,800
Yeah.

1130
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,160
Well, the voice, I think I read somewhere that like voice has like offices there.

1131
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,680
And once that's wrapped, they're going to demolish that and Kong's going down.

1132
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,160
Yes.

1133
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,760
Take down whatever.

1134
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,960
I think that'll be, yeah.

1135
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,200
But there's a lot of different theories.

1136
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,040
I mean, some people have said doing Diagon without the ride,

1137
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,920
you can kind of shove it in the Simpsons area because that's going away at a certain point.

1138
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,080
This is everybody suddenly gotten like more severe.

1139
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,400
I feel like with this, like Simpsons is gone.

1140
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,560
Are we really feeling like we're a couple?

1141
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,520
I was about a lot of money.

1142
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:43,920
It's gone.

1143
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,480
Yeah.

1144
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,560
I think the agreement isn't as ironclad as the Marvel one.

1145
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,400
We're like universal can keep doing the Marvel one as long as they keep it up.

1146
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,080
You know, the contract runs out of 2028.

1147
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:58,400
Yeah.

1148
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,440
So I didn't know that year.

1149
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,720
I believe that's yeah.

1150
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,000
Which would be 20 years from when the first one opened.

1151
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So like they capped it at 20 years.

1152
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,120
Right.

1153
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:11,520
Probably with the thought of like, oh, we'll renegotiate this for a lot more money,

1154
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,800
not thinking they would get bought by Disney theme park.

1155
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,000
They're also like, well, the show surely will be off the air by then.

1156
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,200
No, no, no.

1157
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:20,640
Yeah.

1158
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,080
I will outlive all of us.

1159
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,600
I would be shocked because I think I'm sure that ride is still very popular,

1160
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,840
but they've gotten a lot of usage out of that ride system at this point.

1161
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,960
It's not like it's a fresh, innovative new ride.

1162
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,120
I feel like the real estate, they could throw something in there that would make them more money.

1163
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,160
Yeah. But it's somehow Diagon and you pack it in there.

1164
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,200
Because it doesn't fit in.

1165
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,400
You would have to still.

1166
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,840
Do you just take all like Springfield's all gone and it's like a weird,

1167
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,600
it's not the same where it's just a footprint exactly the layout that it is in Florida.

1168
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,400
It's like a weird new, it's all the greatest hits of Diagon and it goes as far back as you can.

1169
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:00,960
I don't know.

1170
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,880
I think if they do it, it's got to go down in the lot somewhere.

1171
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,840
Part of the studio tour has to go away and you have to do the train.

1172
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,080
You could just move the, because they've done that.

1173
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,320
They've moved where the tram leaves from.

1174
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,480
So maybe they got to build a new tram plaza.

1175
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,880
They haven't updated that in a long time.

1176
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,240
They haven't tweaked that like since the mid 2000s or so.

1177
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:30,400
But I wonder, are theme parks now more hesitant to do with all these shifting licensing agreements?

1178
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:37,600
Is Universal skeptical of committing that much land and construction to a like co-agreement?

1179
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,160
Oh, and now that like all the companies are much more fiercely at war with each other.

1180
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,880
I think that applies to almost everything but Harry Potter.

1181
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,760
I think Harry Potter probably still makes them so much money.

1182
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,320
It's worth it to them.

1183
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,960
Even though it's not quite as lucrative as something, percentage wise, not as lucrative.

1184
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,480
Money wise, it is still.

1185
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,720
So that's my guess, but yeah, I think, and plus it's built.

1186
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,720
I mean, it's like designed.

1187
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,240
It's still wooden.

1188
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,440
So it's just a clone.

1189
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,800
So yeah, you basically have to clone it.

1190
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,120
I don't know.

1191
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,080
Supposedly, and I'm probably just stealing Alicia Stella rumors,

1192
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,800
but I think supposedly like Universal maybe is going to do another big thing a year out here,

1193
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,840
which is like Fast and Furious Coaster, Donkey Kong.

1194
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,600
Donkey Kong, fuck yes.

1195
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,240
The Donkey, and I said before, the Donkey Kong Coaster,

1196
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,080
holy shit, does it sound amazing.

1197
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,960
It's not up in Japan yet, right?

1198
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,880
Not up, but there's been a lot of progress, I think, on it there.

1199
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,400
So yeah, I think.

1200
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,840
They're coming in Orlando, opening attraction in Orlando.

1201
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,840
I believe it is opening day.

1202
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,400
Yeah.

1203
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,680
They're already building that.

1204
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,840
This is the rosiest news that older millennials have gotten in quite a long time.

1205
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,480
Donkey Kong will open in Orlando in 2025.

1206
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,600
Opening in multiple places around the world.

1207
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,100
Yeah.

1208
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,680
We love Donkey Kong, us older millennials.

1209
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,120
It ain't so bad for us.

1210
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:01,120
I am amazed at how many people know the lore and extended character universe of Donkey Kong.

1211
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,960
I swear to God, give me a Bible.

1212
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,800
I swear to God, I've had the Donkey Kong Country theme song stuck in my head all day today,

1213
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,000
and I don't know why.

1214
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,120
I don't know where it came from.

1215
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,120
There's music in that game that makes me feel emotions.

1216
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:15,600
Yeah.

1217
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:22,240
That to me is like kind of like oddly angsty electronic music.

1218
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,640
Are you talking about the slowed down version of the main theme?

1219
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:25,760
No.

1220
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,160
I mean like underwater is good.

1221
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,040
Yeah.

1222
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,160
It's like real, I don't know.

1223
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,280
It's like kind of like eerie, mysterious, scary.

1224
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,520
Yes.

1225
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,400
I have feelings about Donkey Kong music.

1226
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,680
I took all those emotions and I placed them onto the original music made for the various

1227
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,200
lands of Islands of Adventure.

1228
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,520
Yeah.

1229
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:45,680
Yeah.

1230
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,800
That's where all the feels were coming.

1231
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,720
I think what you said that like when other kids were coming to life in other areas,

1232
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,960
dating all of us in 99, we blossomed in different ways.

1233
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:01,760
Yeah.

1234
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:02,560
Yeah.

1235
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,720
I don't know.

1236
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,280
I don't think this is the episode to tell the story, but I was looking at my parents

1237
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,160
brought a lot of my old photos and I took the high school band trip when I was 18.

1238
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,960
And I have one of the most devastating stories, romantic stories of my life

1239
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,280
that happened sort of on this trip that I've not told on this podcast yet.

1240
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,720
That we get to hear?

1241
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,840
I don't think it's, I don't think it's this is the episode for it.

1242
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,120
Oh man.

1243
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,200
I like it'll tease.

1244
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:33,520
Yeah.

1245
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,040
Yeah, I love it.

1246
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,680
It's, but it's like, oh, it's brutal.

1247
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,400
I was looking at photos.

1248
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,040
I'm like, oh God, oh God.

1249
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,440
Oh, like just destroyed me.

1250
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,160
If you want your, but don't vote in the comments for an episode just about that.

1251
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,040
But if you want, if you give us a topic and you say, and I would like if Mike

1252
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,720
just did that in the next club, that might be, you can add, just make it a sub part of your votes.

1253
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,440
Not the main topic.

1254
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,200
As you gain more and more perspective on this story and you feel more comfortable, it'll, it'll get

1255
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,040
promoted every, you'll tell it, you'll tell it on club three and then you'll tell it again

1256
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,240
on the second gate and then you'll tell it on the main feed when you're ready.

1257
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,960
Oh, this is a good way for us to air a lot of stuff, isn't it?

1258
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,280
Yeah.

1259
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:15,840
Sure.

1260
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:15,920
Yeah.

1261
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,000
Just our closest friends.

1262
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:18,960
Yeah.

1263
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,200
Yeah.

1264
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,960
The ones who pay us the most.

1265
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,000
It's still humiliating.

1266
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,640
It's still like, I will, it's humiliating.

1267
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,800
It makes me humiliated in a way.

1268
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,360
Now I know it not really, but it's still brutal.

1269
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,600
It's really, I can feel it again.

1270
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,280
Oh, and I'm an old man at this point.

1271
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,960
I've never felt closer to you than hearing the tease of the story.

1272
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,800
Oh God.

1273
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,440
It's just, I want to beat myself up.

1274
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,680
And you call yourself an old man as part, I'm humiliated and I'm an old man.

1275
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:52,080
And my life's passing me by and I live in an old islands of adventure watchtower.

1276
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,800
Jason, would you want to retire up into that islands of adventure?

1277
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,680
Oh, I love it.

1278
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,920
We talked about it in the morning, taking a nap up there.

1279
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,400
Right.

1280
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:00,800
Sure.

1281
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,640
Do we know, can you go up there?

1282
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,960
I mean, obviously you could fix things and stuff to fix light.

1283
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,760
I don't know.

1284
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,880
I feel like I looked that up at a certain point and never, never quite found it.

1285
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,760
Is that like your Matterhorn basketball court?

1286
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,840
I would be happy with the navigators club, the second floor of the confisco grill,

1287
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,640
which is open here and there.

1288
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,080
I'm not saying what you'd be happy about.

1289
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,040
I'm just saying like, what's the Walt's apartment of islands of adventure for you?

1290
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,320
Oh, I would haunt the light.

1291
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,560
Yeah.

1292
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,320
I would be like the Wilm Defoe of that lighthouse.

1293
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,400
That's an easy, that's a poster to make, right?

1294
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:32,640
Yeah.

1295
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,040
Yeah.

1296
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,040
Let's see if we, I mean, we know people work there.

1297
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,000
If anyone's listening that works at islands of adventure and you can get Jason up in the

1298
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,240
lighthouse, it doesn't have to be Scott and I, it doesn't matter.

1299
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:46,080
Jason specifically, all you have to do is sneak one of us into that lighthouse and have it be Jason.

1300
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,440
Yeah.

1301
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,160
I read the, I saw a message board with somebody who said they went up there and it's,

1302
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,240
it's a really narrow staircase.

1303
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,800
So only two people can at a time.

1304
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:04,400
So if somebody, if one person who works there wants to take Jason up and we end up in a little

1305
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,240
seven minutes in heaven scenario.

1306
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,800
Or just open the door for me and I can

1307
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,400
end up in the seven, seven scenario with my beloved.

1308
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,600
I'll take it from here, please.

1309
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,680
I need to be alone.

1310
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,840
Me and this beautiful lady have some business to attend to.

1311
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,800
You're talking about the lighthouse?

1312
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,160
The lady is the lighthouse.

1313
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,360
No, I was talking about Jane.

1314
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:23,840
Oh, okay.

1315
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,720
No, I thought you were alone.

1316
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,520
That's disappointing.

1317
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,680
I thought, oh, just me and the lady, some personal time.

1318
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,880
No, me and the lady, no, that's a, that me in the lighthouse.

1319
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,600
That's another.

1320
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
With a little lady called the lighthouse.

1321
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,320
Go up there, light some candles.

1322
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,400
It's just you and me now, girl.

1323
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,360
Just me in the finest rush construction that 1999 would give you.

1324
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,320
Yeah, that's what I think.

1325
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,440
It's just, there's nothing.

1326
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,960
It's not themed on the inside.

1327
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,480
It's just flats, but only two people can fit up there.

1328
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,320
What's is the light?

1329
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:56,800
Oh, wait, wait.

1330
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,320
I think I saw that the light is like that.

1331
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,040
There is like the control panel for the light.

1332
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,520
Yeah.

1333
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,360
You can like make the light.

1334
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,160
The light drawing you to the port of entry.

1335
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,120
Calling beacon.

1336
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,520
Calling.

1337
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:14,080
Can you switch the light and like shine the spotlight on like the Margaritaville?

1338
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,960
Can you like, can you spotlight it?

1339
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,400
Might set the plane on fire.

1340
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,280
Are you crazy?

1341
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:19,760
Yeah.

1342
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,320
Which plane?

1343
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,520
The plane's been through enough.

1344
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,120
That's true.

1345
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:23,520
You're right.

1346
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,760
We didn't bring up the plane, by the way, on the episode about McPhisto.

1347
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,800
That was an oversight.

1348
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,080
Not that McPhisto was on the plane.

1349
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:30,720
Why are we supposed to?

1350
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,400
But his alter ego was on the plane.

1351
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,760
Friend of McPhisto.

1352
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah.

1353
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,320
Yeah.

1354
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,880
So that wasn't why I was upset with myself.

1355
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,000
I just felt I did a bad job.

1356
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,680
That's separate from your list of bullet points.

1357
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,560
What you got wrong.

1358
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,600
It wasn't the information.

1359
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,800
It was how I felt.

1360
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,920
I presented it poorly.

1361
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,800
The listeners are supposed to give us the gripes, not yourself.

1362
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,120
Sorry.

1363
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:51,520
Sorry.

1364
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:59,760
You can rent strollers and wheelchairs, but then it's a list of a bunch of crazy stuff

1365
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,520
that you can rent like a aero boat, auto gyro dirigible.

1366
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,480
And then some are real.

1367
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,960
Then just like ECV, $50.

1368
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,160
Then fun ones.

1369
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:16,240
Gondola, Contiki, Pedicab strollers, $14.99, $24.99.

1370
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:16,480
Yeah.

1371
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:23,920
This sort of whimsy and mixing world cultures, world music.

1372
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,680
This was something in the air at the time.

1373
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,280
So you watch that special about the Millennium Celebration at Epcot.

1374
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,000
The guy composing the music for the parade with the puppets is like,

1375
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,520
we made a language that's all the languages.

1376
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:43,520
And it's just kind of like, hey, hey, hey, like it's very similar.

1377
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1378
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,840
All the nations of the world are going to come together and make a bunch of fucking crap.

1379
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,360
Yeah, it's very Leonardo.

1380
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,120
This is a more successful execution.

1381
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,800
Let Leonardo Columbus.

1382
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,360
I was prepared to say that exact phrase.

1383
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,960
And here I will play you why.

1384
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,240
Because we've maybe played clips of the special before.

1385
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:04,960
I don't even know what it is.

1386
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,320
It might be like the vacation planning type thing.

1387
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,040
There's some video that takes you through all the lands and you meet a character.

1388
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,040
It's like a bearded, so adventure you see, that kind of thing.

1389
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,520
Yeah.

1390
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,200
I think this is the one where there's a John Hammond who looks a lot like an old you,

1391
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,560
or exactly like your dad.

1392
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:24,880
Yeah.

1393
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,080
We stalled on that before.

1394
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,400
So there were characters walking around.

1395
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,560
Port of Entry specific characters, as Jason, as you alluded to.

1396
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,000
And they appear in this video made in the year 2000.

1397
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,840
First of all, first up, I will turn my laptop to you guys and you will see a character not

1398
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,560
invented for Port of Entry, but a universal style wart, of course, Woody Woodpecker.

1399
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,240
So Port of Entry was your place to meet Woody.

1400
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,960
He's got his hat on.

1401
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,920
Should have been main feed.

1402
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,200
Woody's there, should have been main feed.

1403
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,240
He's got his hat.

1404
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,720
Woody has a special hat in Port of Entry.

1405
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,560
They got a musketeer style hat.

1406
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,840
He's got a little feather in it.

1407
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,040
He needs the shade.

1408
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,480
His adventure is to go to.

1409
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,520
But the next voice you'll hear is an original character.

1410
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,360
And yeah, it's the most Leonardo.

1411
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,200
He's well, I'll get to this.

1412
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,600
Let's play.

1413
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,760
Look, looking for adventure.

1414
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,120
You've got the right place.

1415
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,120
I'm the official storyteller here.

1416
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,200
So I know the story.

1417
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,520
He's like he's on like a, you know,

1418
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,960
kind of like your fixer.

1419
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,920
He's your minder.

1420
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,680
He's got a BMX bike.

1421
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,040
He's headed to the BMX show.

1422
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,760
Oh, yeah.

1423
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,400
Follow me to adventure and stunts.

1424
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,360
Quite extreme.

1425
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,760
The raddest you'll ever see.

1426
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,640
I think there's more of this.

1427
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,360
I'm trying to remember.

1428
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,920
Oh, you can tell by the architecture, the Port of Entry has been on this very spot

1429
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,280
for hundreds of years filled with treasures from the four corners of the world.

1430
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,360
Well, there you go.

1431
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,120
This is your trading company.

1432
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,520
But yes, low, hard.

1433
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,040
There's that guy and then there's one other.

1434
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,560
And I don't see.

1435
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:14,640
I was referring to a video from 2021 or 22, where it's like two British explorers

1436
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:22,640
and like pith helmets and then a guy like with like a fez and like a vest and just a

1437
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,480
shitty sign that says mayor.

1438
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,000
And he's like, yeah, I'm the mayor.

1439
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,500
Hey.

1440
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,800
And then we're just accosting people at the end of Port of Entry.

1441
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,760
And the video like vlogger was just like, oh, hey, what are you?

1442
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,200
Sorry.

1443
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,480
So they still to this day, now there are new characters who you don't know what the hell it is.

1444
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,040
And then there's the other one from back then.

1445
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,720
This seems to be like a fortune teller.

1446
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,400
You're going to get a little wet.

1447
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,440
Kind of like, yeah, like cheese wearing an Esmeralda kind of dress.

1448
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,520
And but talking in the Brooklyn accent, talking in the New York streets.

1449
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,080
Yeah.

1450
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:17,440
When you know that there are, you can hire a ample amount of employees who can all do

1451
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,080
that voice.

1452
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:22,320
They will never stop flowing theme park performers who can do that voice.

1453
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,880
If your city has an improv theater in it, you're not going to have any shortage of

1454
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,640
people who can do the Brooklyn voice.

1455
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:28,960
You know?

1456
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,440
Right.

1457
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,160
So and this place is, you know, it's all places.

1458
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,280
So anybody can have any voice that is that's fair.

1459
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,560
Yeah, that's beautiful.

1460
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,120
Very millennial, very like it's all combining.

1461
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,960
Yeah, because there's Cinnabon there, but there's also some sort of mythical place to,

1462
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,160
I don't know, go to the bathroom.

1463
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,480
Anyway, I just like these guys.

1464
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,920
Let me play one more clip of this guy.

1465
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,720
I think here.

1466
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,800
My regards to the good doctor.

1467
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,200
And don't forget to try the green eggs.

1468
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,920
It's partially in the chicken feed.

1469
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,280
My idea.

1470
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,560
I don't want to hang out with these guys.

1471
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,680
I don't like those guys.

1472
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:15,200
I want to rush past it just like the pith helmet guys you just described any of them.

1473
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,400
I am I am running.

1474
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,480
Maybe this is why I just went through this land.

1475
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,000
I didn't want to meet these people.

1476
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,160
Yeah, the storyteller.

1477
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,160
I have the stories you see.

1478
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,600
Would you care to hear what?

1479
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,040
Absolutely not.

1480
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,480
You're harassing me.

1481
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,280
Security.

1482
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,400
I'm being harassed.

1483
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,080
I think you were more in character though than he was maybe with that voice.

1484
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,880
A little too much.

1485
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,680
Oh, hey, that's the green eggs and ham.

1486
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,560
My bike chain snapped.

1487
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,240
Oh, like whoopsies.

1488
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,880
Like I don't I don't feel that anyone's very committed to the characters either.

1489
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,280
Cinnabon stomach shouldn't have crammed that before my shift of storytelling.

1490
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,440
No one's going to buy the $40 souvenir VHS.

1491
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,120
It's 2000.

1492
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,600
Come to my improv show later at 8 p.m.

1493
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:06,080
This footage shall not be snarked on by ye new timey podcast.

1494
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,360
Other improv students.

1495
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:12,160
By a different student who somehow feel like they're allowed to make fun of what I'm doing.

1496
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,920
A couple other losers.

1497
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:23,040
Is this just to confirm we're talking about the 27 minute Islands of Adventure VHS capture?

1498
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,800
Is that what this is called on YouTube?

1499
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,600
I think so.

1500
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:25,840
Yeah.

1501
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,920
Does anyone want to go to Mannequin's later?

1502
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,360
It's going to be a good night.

1503
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,360
Always a good night.

1504
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,520
There's oh man I'm in the real quick I'm in the Pleasure Island Memories Facebook group still.

1505
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,400
Oh of course.

1506
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,400
And somebody the other day was just like does anyone know a good place in California that's

1507
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,440
like Mannequin's?

1508
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,680
My husband used to go all the time and he he misses Mannequin's so much.

1509
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,520
Does anyone have any suggestions?

1510
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,360
And I have yet to see anyone suggest anything comparable to Mannequin's.

1511
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,920
I was just glad you used the present tense misses because I thought that was going to be a story

1512
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,880
about a dead husband.

1513
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,840
There are plenty of people that have passed away from the glory days of Mannequin's that will be

1514
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,800
like RIP so and so bartender at Mannequin's.

1515
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:13,280
So I get a steady steady stream of sadness from this group as well.

1516
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,000
Ironically now there is Lifeless is a Mannequin.

1517
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,240
Not one of the fun ones that danced danced at Mannequin's.

1518
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,760
If you wrote that you'd be arrested like you would there would be so many people that will call the

1519
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,960
police on you in this group because there is not there's not a lot of like people

1520
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,160
fucking love Mannequin's and they love Pleasure Island and there's no joking about it.

1521
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,160
Somebody will post an emoji sometimes and it's like hey that was a little goofy for what we're

1522
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:38,800
doing here.

1523
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,480
This is a memories page.

1524
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,120
I don't like you.

1525
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,480
We open those doors and suddenly somebody's using the poop.

1526
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,480
I don't want to see that poop emoji anywhere near this.

1527
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,520
We're talking about Mannequin's.

1528
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,120
Shockingly spacious.

1529
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:51,920
Oh it's huge.

1530
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,960
It seems huge.

1531
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,760
Huge.

1532
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,800
By the way it sounds great.

1533
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,160
I said on the episode.

1534
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:56,960
Looks really fun.

1535
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,840
I would have had a ball.

1536
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,720
What have we not talked about about Port of Entry?

1537
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,440
Oh well.

1538
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,120
What stories have we not been told?

1539
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,240
So I mentioned Confisco Grill.

1540
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,840
I don't think I knew until yesterday that's a play on words.

1541
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,880
Confisco.

1542
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,680
Confiscate.

1543
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,680
So there's all of the.

1544
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,480
What?

1545
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,040
There's all of there's a lot of artifacts.

1546
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:23,360
There's a lot of stuff from all the islands and I think somewhere in the backstory I think

1547
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:28,640
there's stuff about pirates or people coming to Port of Entry and having to check some of

1548
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:34,160
their items and some of those are you know pretty fun little like oh there's a cat in

1549
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:34,960
the hat to add.

1550
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,720
One of them just appears to be a particle board cut out of Rocky and Bullwinkle and

1551
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,840
Natasha and Boris.

1552
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,200
Probably an item from there.

1553
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,000
It's just them.

1554
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,840
It's just them hanging out.

1555
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,960
Well there we go.

1556
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,440
All right.

1557
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,960
It seems like this arbitrary name but then it's part of a story.

1558
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,120
It's part of a story and they in the last few years have committed more to the like

1559
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:02,320
food from around the world of like curry and a banh mi sandwich and French onions like a

1560
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,720
hodgepodge of different stuff you can get.

1561
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,040
Okay.

1562
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,440
Seems like an okay restaurant.

1563
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:07,600
Yeah.

1564
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,200
And you've had you have had food there.

1565
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,240
I have had food there.

1566
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:10,480
Yeah.

1567
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:10,800
A couple times.

1568
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,760
And it was pretty good.

1569
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,080
Okay.

1570
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:12,400
Yeah.

1571
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,160
Pretty was it better than what the Odyssey?

1572
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:22,080
I'd say it was I think one trip my family went on we ate at Mythos and Confisco on the same

1573
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,520
trip and they were about similar.

1574
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:23,600
I meant Mythos.

1575
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,240
I didn't mean the Odyssey.

1576
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:24,400
Yeah.

1577
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:24,960
I was wondering.

1578
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,200
Okay.

1579
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,320
I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

1580
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:26,960
What is Odyssey?

1581
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,360
What am I?

1582
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:27,680
That's the Epcot thing.

1583
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,120
The Odyssey is an Epcot.

1584
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,240
It's in between.

1585
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,320
Yeah.

1586
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:30,800
That's right.

1587
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,280
Mm-hmm.

1588
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:31,840
It's a festival.

1589
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,040
I'll edit this part out so.

1590
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:33,440
That's fine.

1591
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,160
I don't look foolish.

1592
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,920
Um, sorry.

1593
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,680
Oh, Jason's coming over here to strangle me.

1594
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,360
He's so upset with my mistake.

1595
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,040
Two parks with your heirs and this after McPhisto gate.

1596
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,920
And the and my story when I was 18 that makes me sad.

1597
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,200
Very excited for that.

1598
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,560
Man, you were 18.

1599
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:54,800
Yeah.

1600
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,400
I thought you were a lot younger.

1601
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,920
I was so excited.

1602
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:58,720
No, no.

1603
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,120
I mean, my emotional maturity was a lot younger.

1604
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:01,680
Oh, sure.

1605
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,560
He's probably true.

1606
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,160
We're allowed to make fun of the story.

1607
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:04,560
That's true.

1608
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:04,720
Yeah.

1609
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:04,960
Yeah.

1610
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,960
Below 18, we couldn't snark on it.

1611
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:07,440
Mm-hmm.

1612
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:07,840
That's true.

1613
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,840
It was at the end of the year of my senior year.

1614
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,640
Oh, geez.

1615
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,440
Yeah.

1616
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,360
Um, uh, yeah, well, that's there's a lot of things like this in the land that like tie

1617
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:20,240
everything together, which is, is again, the land, the islands could have could not have less

1618
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,360
to do with each other.

1619
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:26,560
So I kind of admire the like, okay, so in this mythological place, then we'll write like rare

1620
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:33,120
wares, fantastic finds, mezzozoic marvels, which is that's mezzozoic marvels is about

1621
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,520
Jurassic, not Marvel, confusingly.

1622
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,560
I not what that.

1623
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,880
Yeah, that kind of I was confused.

1624
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,720
I thought that they were getting two for one with that, but I think they were mostly doing

1625
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,120
Jurassic.

1626
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,840
I think fantastic finds is Marvel.

1627
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,080
Right.

1628
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,720
Unless they joined Fantastic Four pizza restaurant.

1629
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,000
Okay.

1630
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,120
Yeah, I guess so.

1631
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,480
Sucy and supplies.

1632
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,840
You know what that one is notions and potions, I guess is.

1633
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,160
Lost.

1634
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,280
Okay.

1635
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:57,840
Yeah.

1636
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:01,840
We're potter works for either or they've they never painted the sign and never will.

1637
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,520
No one noticed.

1638
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:13,520
There's also a sign for a dance studio that says, uh, from Merlin's Mumbo to the Stegosaurus

1639
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:13,920
Stomp.

1640
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,360
Discover the world of Xan dance.

1641
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,040
Um, that's fun.

1642
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,360
I wish to see the dances.

1643
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:25,440
I think they should draw on the floor how you do the Stegosaurus Stomp.

1644
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:25,920
Yeah, please.

1645
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,120
I'd like to do that very much.

1646
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,720
And then I'd like to hit if you did that at mannequins, you would have been the hero of

1647
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,440
the night.

1648
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,920
Would have been a good night for a Merlin's Mumbo.

1649
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:34,720
Right.

1650
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,040
Yeah.

1651
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,880
Merlin's Mumbo.

1652
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,000
You and the star of the night.

1653
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,440
Yeah, that's a great international.

1654
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,000
What is that?

1655
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,840
It's like, you know, it's like the Spanish dance.

1656
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:46,080
Yeah.

1657
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:46,400
Yeah.

1658
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,800
And old, old England.

1659
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,400
How does that was all combined?

1660
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,280
I'd like to see it.

1661
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:51,840
I would too.

1662
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,080
Yeah.

1663
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:52,320
Yeah.

1664
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,240
Uh, so.

1665
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:54,800
What else?

1666
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,000
Ocean Trader Market.

1667
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,560
They have somehow kept up since 1999.

1668
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:03,440
That's like the open air, like, uh, items from around the world.

1669
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,800
That's like right next to the trading company store.

1670
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,040
Right.

1671
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,480
Which is a regular merge.

1672
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:08,880
Yes.

1673
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,120
Yeah.

1674
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,320
So that seemed like the thing that I mean, I think there's some stuff in this that I'm like,

1675
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,960
oh, I like that's that they kept that open.

1676
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:17,920
Like they still have that.

1677
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,920
They flipped one store to a Christmas shop.

1678
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,080
Cause you were saying they could just easily have switched it into like Harry Potter wants.

1679
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:24,400
Yeah.

1680
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,280
Which they have, uh, turned plenty of their gift shops into corners of that.

1681
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:29,360
Yeah.

1682
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:29,600
Right.

1683
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:36,240
So it's a little bit, I like galaxy's edge still has, they haven't switched every gift shop into

1684
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,040
like, it's just selling star wars t-shirts yet.

1685
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:39,840
Yeah.

1686
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,520
I don't know if that's, I don't know how they're doing sales wise for like the different

1687
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,080
trinkets and the handmade things or whatever.

1688
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,560
Probably pretty well, but I don't know.

1689
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,680
So yeah.

1690
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,800
I'd like to see the numbers.

1691
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,840
They're probably, yeah.

1692
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:57,440
I think you're, you're selling thousands of stained glass queen on my dollars every day.

1693
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,720
Does that really sell that?

1694
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:58,880
Yeah.

1695
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,000
That's the thing they have.

1696
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,240
Yeah.

1697
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:05,760
Well that was the way I, when I always said assured bug main that it wasn't bad in galaxy's edge.

1698
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,600
Like, well there is one shop with a stained glass on my dollar.

1699
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,320
Oh, okay.

1700
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,160
Well, is that Oka's?

1701
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,040
Uh, no, it's in that, you know, you're thinking of doc on doc.

1702
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,000
Oh, doc on doc.

1703
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,280
Come over and strangle you.

1704
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:17,760
Oh yeah.

1705
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,160
That's fine.

1706
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:20,720
Doc on.

1707
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:26,560
Yeah, there is like, there's a, uh, kid Fisto stuff in there and you get some prequel weird stuff.

1708
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,320
You said, you said kid Fisto earlier and I did not remember what it was.

1709
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,600
I didn't know it was a star wars thing and I didn't go back up and ask.

1710
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,680
And remember there's a Monday on the Jedi council key ad Monday.

1711
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,240
Is that his name?

1712
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:43,200
Oh, you were the one who just, I said it out loud and you were like, Monday is in prequels.

1713
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,760
We're forgetting a lot that has been said.

1714
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,400
There's things get kind of like lapped.

1715
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,640
I feel like it happened over two years.

1716
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,400
Like three months ago.

1717
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,160
Oh, I think he, it's key.

1718
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,760
Key Adi Monday.

1719
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,440
It's the guy with kind of the cone head.

1720
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,320
Oh, okay.

1721
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,640
And I said his name and you went, and I never thought of it either.

1722
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,560
And you go, there's a Monday and it's like, yeah, it's M U N D I.

1723
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:04,960
Okay.

1724
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,520
I think this is one of those things that may perhaps like Frank Marshall stories.

1725
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:15,120
Um, the prequel specific prequel characters are in one ear and out the other.

1726
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:22,080
Raced through my, between my ears, like me racing out of port of entry to go on a ride.

1727
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:22,720
Oh wow.

1728
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,800
Racing fast, like a pod racer Tito.

1729
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,360
All right.

1730
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,080
I liked that.

1731
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,360
Doesn't mean I'll remember it.

1732
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,160
Listener, you're going to have to hear me hear the name Tito.

1733
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,760
But Golis ask about it.

1734
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,200
Be told what it is.

1735
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,960
Enjoy all that in 2020.

1736
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,800
Actually later this year, actually, uh, maybe next month, maybe next month's club three.

1737
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,000
This is another East coast thing.

1738
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,120
Jason says Pagalis.

1739
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,000
I say Pagalis.

1740
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,960
Oh yeah.

1741
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,200
Pagalis is how we say it when I was a kid and he is, it's a regional dialect.

1742
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,120
I think I was at straw.

1743
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,120
I was getting all the stuff off the end caps at straw bridges.

1744
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:01,040
You were at what Mervins or I was not at Merve Cal door.

1745
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,720
I don't know what you had in Chicago.

1746
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,360
What are we talking about?

1747
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,440
A grocery store department stores or department store?

1748
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,200
We had Lord and Taylor.

1749
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:07,920
Okay.

1750
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,240
We had a Marshall fields.

1751
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:10,480
Yeah.

1752
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,840
Oh, sears.

1753
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,080
Yeah.

1754
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:12,480
Sure.

1755
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,680
Uh, uh, pennies.

1756
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,880
JC pennies.

1757
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,320
We were certainly a pennies household.

1758
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:16,560
Yeah.

1759
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,280
But we did not have Mervins or any other garbage you just said.

1760
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:24,400
I would, I'd like to, uh, you know, Jason, you can do this if you want, but any other,

1761
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:30,080
any aspiring standups out there, I'm just going to give a bit idea for free, which is the, uh,

1762
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,560
the, just the initiate and just start your act this way.

1763
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,040
Go to an open mic and just say, Hey, you ever notice how people from pencil bear?

1764
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:37,680
No, it's Philly.

1765
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,480
You ever notice how people from Philly say the pod racer names?

1766
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,120
I'm diving in like slide.

1767
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,000
Paramita.

1768
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,080
And somebody tells me it's slide.

1769
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,120
Paramita.

1770
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,560
I'm like, shut the fuck up.

1771
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,320
Huge applause.

1772
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,040
Hold for that.

1773
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:55,120
Then, you know, then go into your food saying your Bozzie, baranta,

1774
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,520
Juan sandage,

1775
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,880
Odie Randrell.

1776
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:04,720
I didn't look it up.

1777
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,200
There's nothing.

1778
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,280
There's, you know, that's your button.

1779
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,240
That's your button.

1780
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,920
This is like, this is, I'm calling.

1781
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,280
Coaching Jerry Seinfeld in comedian.

1782
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,680
That's your, that's your tag right there.

1783
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:15,920
Yeah.

1784
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,840
You come back tomorrow.

1785
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,960
You do that one.

1786
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,880
Go try it at Caroline's and do it here.

1787
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,360
Okay.

1788
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,480
Well, I will try it.

1789
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,000
It'll play well.

1790
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:24,720
I think.

1791
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,920
Um, what else?

1792
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,280
They got the lockers.

1793
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,320
The lockers are here.

1794
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,600
The lockers are here.

1795
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,320
Lockers.

1796
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,120
Lockers, Jason.

1797
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:31,440
Huh?

1798
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,320
Have you ever done the lockers?

1799
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,480
We were never a locker fan.

1800
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,520
We were not either.

1801
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,360
No, he is a big locker.

1802
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,240
Is she a big lock?

1803
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:38,800
Interesting.

1804
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,240
She likes to do the lockers on Main Street.

1805
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,920
The ones that outside the park at Disneyland.

1806
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,120
We have not used the islands of adventure lockers, though.

1807
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,240
I don't believe.

1808
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:46,480
Okay.

1809
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,120
Probably we were staying on site.

1810
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,720
So we left stuff in the hotel because it's just a walk, a quick walk.

1811
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,280
Right.

1812
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,240
But yeah, she's a locker.

1813
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,840
I've never been at lockers.

1814
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:00,080
I understand purse, different situation, but still we were not locker family.

1815
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:05,920
When I was down for that bachelor party, I made a point of packing in such a way that

1816
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:11,120
it would fit into a Disney's Hollywood studio locker because I wanted to go to that park

1817
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,480
on the way to the airport.

1818
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,800
So I stressed myself too much about this.

1819
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,040
It's got to be the kind of bag that can fold up.

1820
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,640
And all right, what are the prices there?

1821
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,080
Okay, it's got to be one of the...

1822
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,280
And I was like, wait, are there outside the park ones?

1823
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:23,840
There were.

1824
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,880
I don't think there are anymore or there wasn't one big enough for...

1825
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,320
I oddly did a lot of research about this.

1826
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,040
That makes sense.

1827
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,960
And I'm glad I did because it got me a little runaway railway before we got here.

1828
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:36,880
The...

1829
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,840
I had some...

1830
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,160
If I have any port of entry animosity, it's that I think technically you're still in port

1831
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,680
of entry outside the park.

1832
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,040
That's still the theming.

1833
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,000
And I associate it with another bachelor party memory, which is when everyone in the party

1834
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,640
bought $209 express passes that did not get us into the park.

1835
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:00,240
And we all needed to wait in a horrible line for an only two windows open for an hour

1836
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,360
in order to rectify this mistake and just even start being in the park.

1837
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,640
It was the most stressful hour.

1838
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,200
While the other half went and did shots at what do you call it?

1839
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,680
What's the shock tooth some?

1840
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:16,480
Yeah.

1841
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,120
Well, we were all hunkered down there and...

1842
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,120
When you resolved it and got in the park, I bet you were going up and down

1843
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,320
that main entry and like, look at this theming.

1844
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,400
Come on, get me in there.

1845
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,520
Does anyone want a muffin from the croissant bakery?

1846
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,440
I know it's 530 in the afternoon.

1847
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,720
Does anyone want a muffin?

1848
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:39,120
We have to look at this fire brigade sign, guys.

1849
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:39,760
The fire...

1850
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:45,840
There is like a fire shanty kind of thing, a fire brigade shanty.

1851
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,040
There's a little story.

1852
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:51,840
There's a boarded up sign that says fire brigade moving closer to water.

1853
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,400
That's like put up very hastily, just like big pieces of wood.

1854
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,040
And then closer to water, there is indeed a little fire cart.

1855
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,280
Yeah.

1856
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,960
There's a story to find out.

1857
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,360
I'll wag my finger at you, Mike.

1858
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,640
There's a story.

1859
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,760
So next time you go, rear about the fire brigade.

1860
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,440
Yeah, do a photo op if you got kids, you got a big party, you know.

1861
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,200
Did you get any...

1862
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,000
Big party?

1863
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,960
Yeah, big party.

1864
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,560
That's like the old fire cart.

1865
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,360
Hey, could you hold this?

1866
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,200
Yeah, we'll take a picture.

1867
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,840
Did you get any first aid or guest services at the Open Arms Hotel?

1868
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,080
Have you gotten any first aid there?

1869
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:31,520
No.

1870
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,560
Have you ever gotten first aid at any theme park?

1871
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,680
I got an ice pack at Hollywood Studios.

1872
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,000
When I was there last year or two last year.

1873
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,560
Well, my knee hurt and I asked for ice pack.

1874
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,720
Did you rather did you hold it on the whole trip?

1875
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:53,680
No, it was just crushed ice really wrapped up in some bags and towels.

1876
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,360
Did they wrap your knee?

1877
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,240
No, they didn't wrap it.

1878
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,240
They just gave it to me and then I went back to the hotel and I just put it on my knee.

1879
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,000
I was wondering if you were on rides with that?

1880
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,520
No, no.

1881
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,240
I would have just stuck it out.

1882
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:06,960
Okay.

1883
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,600
So, okay.

1884
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,360
But that's the only time you've gotten first aid?

1885
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,280
I think so.

1886
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,800
Maybe went in to get like a Tylenol at Disneyland once.

1887
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,360
Retail on my eye wash is really I think the only time I ever did it when I had that

1888
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,320
sunscreen in my eye that wouldn't come out.

1889
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,160
Skin my knee really bad.

1890
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,360
SeaWorld San Diego.

1891
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,960
How old?

1892
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,440
Like 10.

1893
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,360
I remember it really bad.

1894
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,400
One of the worst.

1895
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:30,560
Oh.

1896
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:36,640
Yeah, it was on some like because it was on like theme like sea ride was on like coral

1897
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,000
and it's jagged, you know?

1898
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,640
Yeah.

1899
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,600
Cuts you up.

1900
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,600
So what just Band-Aids?

1901
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,480
I think so.

1902
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,160
Bring you out the rest of the day?

1903
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:44,800
I don't quite recall.

1904
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,840
I did you tough it out.

1905
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,280
It like dampened my spirits, I will say.

1906
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:55,520
And then the next time then we went down to SeaWorld with the little one a couple years ago now.

1907
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,640
And that was it was just talk about hot also like

1908
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,120
barely shaded park.

1909
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,880
So crazy hot bad party.

1910
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,080
We got out of there so fast.

1911
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,880
I've not really had a good time at SeaWorld San Diego.

1912
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,160
Was Sesame Street open yet?

1913
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:09,760
Yeah, we went.

1914
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,280
Yeah, we went with the kid.

1915
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,240
So that's good.

1916
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,360
I don't think Sesame Place was open.

1917
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,160
Oh, right, right.

1918
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,760
They had the water park.

1919
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,640
Right, right, right, right.

1920
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,800
So there was an Elmo dance party.

1921
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,440
Yes.

1922
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,240
Sure.

1923
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,040
And was the moves like Bert was happening?

1924
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:25,840
Yeah, that's right.

1925
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,120
That is where I heard moves like Bert.

1926
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,320
Okay, let me amend this.

1927
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,920
I did like moves like Bert more than skinning my knee.

1928
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,240
Okay.

1929
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,040
When I was 10.

1930
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,120
Well, we've talked about how like the old trauma, childhood trauma does sometimes still

1931
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,240
color your feelings like about for earnest for me.

1932
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,040
Or it's like it's hard to escape my feelings.

1933
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:48,080
Yeah, or how 18 year old trauma colors entire episodes for you.

1934
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,080
God, you guys have no idea.

1935
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:50,720
Oh boy.

1936
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,920
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

1937
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,560
I hate it.

1938
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,520
It's so humane.

1939
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,440
It just makes me feel so bad.

1940
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,840
I'm gonna get we'll resolve this.

1941
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,000
We'll go in the Port of Entry Christmas shop.

1942
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,840
We'll get you a minion wearing like a Santa hat ornament.

1943
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,440
Do you think that's gonna make me a minion?

1944
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,160
No, I don't know.

1945
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,440
We got to go back in time.

1946
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,680
We got to get me some from the like the era.

1947
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,640
We're gonna get you a character you don't care for and didn't grow up with.

1948
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,720
We're going to get you a 98 degrees t-shirt 98 degrees and what he would.

1949
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,800
Pecker mashup t-shirt.

1950
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,240
Were there all like all the members of 98 degrees are Woody Woodpeckers?

1951
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,320
Oh, that'd be great.

1952
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:24,880
That's good.

1953
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,480
That would be a good shirt.

1954
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:26,880
Uncle.

1955
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,200
Yeah, everybody would understand that back in high school.

1956
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,440
When you when you returned to your hometown.

1957
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:36,080
Oh man, if we could find footage of like an event at Universal and they get all the 98

1958
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:41,040
degree guys to do the Woody Woodpecker like ha ha ha ha like sort of thing.

1959
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:41,760
That'd be great.

1960
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,960
I'd love that.

1961
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:48,320
There was just a concert happening at Universal Orlando like as they do a concert series at

1962
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:52,480
that stage they have and there was a concert where just a I never listened to the music

1963
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:57,040
but I looked at the photo and the photo made me think Mike would like this band

1964
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,920
and then I and then I looked up what the band was and it was a Christian.

1965
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,280
That's a huge Christian music festival.

1966
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,480
I think it wasn't the festival.

1967
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,320
I think it was a on their own.

1968
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,200
That might have been called Thrive.

1969
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,080
That's what the closest in my head could be Thrive.

1970
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,680
There does seem to be a band called Thrive but was am I right?

1971
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,720
I don't know.

1972
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,160
Does Thrive look cool?

1973
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,600
Do they look like some hooks?

1974
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,280
I don't think it was Thrive.

1975
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,280
If you saw a Christian concert at Universal Studios recently let me know.

1976
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,680
I mean the Goo Goo Dolls were playing at the Mardi Gras concert series.

1977
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,200
Well and you know I've seen the Goo Goo Dolls at the City Walk in Orlando.

1978
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:35,760
Oh sure.

1979
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,560
At the Hard Rock.

1980
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,600
Your favorite.

1981
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah.

1982
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,040
Hard Rock Live.

1983
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:39,680
That giant venue.

1984
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,680
My sister, my mom and I saw Goo Goo Dolls.

1985
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,180
Wow.

1986
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,360
You saw the Goo Goo Dolls with your mom.

1987
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,320
Yeah and they closed with Tom Petty's American Girl.

1988
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,400
I'll never forget it.

1989
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,160
They closed with not their song.

1990
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,680
With not their song right.

1991
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,160
Lord.

1992
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:54,720
That's right.

1993
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:00,240
Okay Jason I think you should bring us to a summation statement.

1994
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:06,080
If you have one, if you can summon the spirit of adventure and just kind of like

1995
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,880
if there's anything else you want to say about what this place means to you

1996
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,680
while I look up what the Christian bands were that have recently played at Universal Florida.

1997
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:17,360
Look the you know like the sign says the adventure begins.

1998
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,560
It's a great vibe.

1999
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,520
It's pretty chill.

2000
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,280
It's a pretty chill way to get into a theme park.

2001
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:30,000
If you are looking on YouTube someone ripped the soundtrack that used to be able to buy in the park

2002
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,920
and I think the tracks you want to recreate this land are the Call to Adventure, Ocean Trader Market,

2003
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:43,600
Confisco Grill and the Adventure Lives On which is kind of I believe the intent was I don't know

2004
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,200
they still do it but the intent was like as you're leaving the park at the end of the night like

2005
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,080
this is the exit music you know.

2006
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:52,720
Sure sure.

2007
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,320
I think they should change this place.

2008
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,760
I think they should demolish it.

2009
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:57,280
What?

2010
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,400
You're gonna tell Jason this on the way up north?

2011
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,960
There's not enough there for me to get invested.

2012
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,320
I just I'm thinking about it over the course of this episode and I feel like

2013
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,080
change the theme.

2014
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,040
Change it.

2015
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,640
I mean I think they could update the existing they could keep the existing theme and gussy it up a

2016
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,040
little.

2017
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:15,600
Make it new.

2018
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,640
Make it different.

2019
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,200
I don't know.

2020
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:17,680
Okay.

2021
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,840
I don't think it all gels quite frankly.

2022
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,040
I don't like it at all.

2023
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,040
Diving in with hot take right at the end.

2024
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:23,920
I'm thinking about it.

2025
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,840
I want to think of my feelings.

2026
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,600
I don't want to hear Jason's anymore.

2027
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,720
I don't hear my feelings out loud and I think it's like what are they doing?

2028
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,000
It's like too much you know.

2029
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,640
You know sometimes people are trying to do too much at once.

2030
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,600
Too many eras.

2031
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,800
Too many accents.

2032
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,360
Make it simpler.

2033
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,560
Make it simple simplify it.

2034
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,840
I guess you can keep the rocks but I feel like I need a more of a type.

2035
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,120
Good fake rocks.

2036
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:45,840
You got to give it that.

2037
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,440
Yes I do have to give it good fake rocks.

2038
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,960
But tighten up the narrative here.

2039
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,360
Just tell us like this is where the gods meet or something and it's this is where like Zeus

2040
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,600
sits and this is where Ares sits.

2041
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,560
You don't like going to the end of the island and see where the other two islands like

2042
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,400
this island ends and the others begin.

2043
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:03,920
That's kind of fun.

2044
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:04,640
I'm fine with that.

2045
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:11,040
I'm just saying like from a narrative standpoint give me something a little more like concrete.

2046
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:11,600
Okay.

2047
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,440
A little more that's not so open-ended if that makes sense.

2048
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,880
Mike's throwing this out at the end.

2049
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,160
Jason's okay with it.

2050
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:18,720
Yeah he's fine.

2051
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:23,360
Do you realize the wrap how this audience likes port of entry more than any of us do.

2052
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:29,360
We're all canceled actually finally least of which me you did that exchange you guys are gone.

2053
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,400
You're toast now.

2054
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,280
You're ratioed.

2055
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,440
Anything divisive there's going to be people who like it and who don't like it.

2056
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,320
But they're going to say Jason just being polite.

2057
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,840
They're going to say we know what he really thinks.

2058
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,640
Jason's too nice.

2059
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:44,480
He's he's being nice to Mike and Mike is dead wrong and we're going to.

2060
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:50,320
I think bring back the 1999 park maps which are a mess of photos and overlays and a million.

2061
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,920
I said go one step further in but the time machine and let's go back in time.

2062
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,040
You live like little boys.

2063
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,160
Let's go back.

2064
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,440
We want to go back.

2065
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,880
That's what I want.

2066
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,680
But yeah I don't know I need I need some more I need some.

2067
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:09,040
Give me at least a narrative that makes a little more sense.

2068
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:14,400
I found a bug on the website I think where the Christmas shop is not listed in the app.

2069
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,840
The mobile app is a bug but it is on the website.

2070
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,360
Yeah it's a little weird.

2071
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:24,960
Yeah so I don't know I just give me give me everybody has like one accent or no accent

2072
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:30,720
or they all talk like this and like like I don't need New York and like Hercules speak

2073
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:35,760
or like yeah it's too much it doesn't give me a unified theme.

2074
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:42,720
I don't think those characters from that 23 year old video are necessarily hiding out anymore.

2075
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,640
I don't know I just but I don't know.

2076
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,240
There is a fun.

2077
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,840
They need to make me care.

2078
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:48,480
There's a fun.

2079
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:55,280
This is a deficiency of this area that I don't care and I've been doing a GD podcast

2080
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:56,960
about theme parks.

2081
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,520
You care about censorship but you don't care about port of entry.

2082
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,120
I should know the lore of this already.

2083
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:05,440
There's why I'm thinking about this as I go why is this why is all this information

2084
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,200
new to me in the last 72 hours.

2085
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,280
Mike I just told you that there is a fire station that moved

2086
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,360
and your heart isn't enthralled.

2087
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,880
You are in love with this place.

2088
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,680
This should be it's no this is one of the biggest theme parks in the world.

2089
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,640
Yeah it was highly traffic theme park.

2090
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:25,520
I should know the characters already and it's not my fault.

2091
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:38,480
No it is their fault and it's the universal creative fault for not making this more attractive

2092
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:38,800
to us.

2093
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,360
This is where I've come I've realized this is what's going on here.

2094
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,040
Well much like your romantic foibles were I think it's entirely your fault

2095
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,320
and you should feel bad about it.

2096
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,760
You should still feel bad about it.

2097
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,000
All right now he's back now the audience is back on his side.

2098
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,040
Okay okay.

2099
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,000
Stick it together.

2100
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,480
Still gonna.

2101
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,280
We're both standing up to choke each other now.

2102
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:55,840
I didn't.

2103
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,240
Jason won the episode right at the end.

2104
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,120
There's little like sounds there's stuff at the end of alleyway like there is like a

2105
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:07,920
fate like sheet like if you tied a bunch of sheets to escape a bedroom there's like a

2106
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,160
prison breakout going on and you can hear audio.

2107
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,560
There's lovebirds there's cute little birds two little white birds and you can hear them

2108
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,760
like cooing with each other.

2109
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,400
That's kind of cute.

2110
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,280
What are their names?

2111
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,200
Two non-anatronic birds.

2112
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:20,800
Okay.

2113
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,760
That's kind of cute.

2114
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,000
You think that stuff's so cute in Main Street.

2115
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,960
You love that shit.

2116
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,040
I understand Main Street it makes sense to me.

2117
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,240
Main Street doesn't have like kind of a mythology you just need to know the year

2118
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,920
and then that's it you're off to the races.

2119
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,000
This there's all this stuff that we're supposed to learn.

2120
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,560
Those years we all know the turn of the century.

2121
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,400
Perfect time in America.

2122
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,320
No problem.

2123
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,280
Here it comes.

2124
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,480
I like the years.

2125
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,880
I'm just saying you know what it is you know why you're there.

2126
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:47,920
Well there's more of it.

2127
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,520
There's more of it and you understand what's going on.

2128
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,160
I love that you're throwing yourself in front of the bus to be the villain instead of me.

2129
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:01,600
But I can't underline it enough your complaints go too much integrity to let this go by without

2130
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,920
going hey wait a minute like that's really what just happened.

2131
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,520
I said hey wait a minute.

2132
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,400
You drink a couple seven and sevens at that backwater bar.

2133
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,760
It's fine but this is the entry point for one of the most exciting places on earth.

2134
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,560
Sure.

2135
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,000
And it should I should know.

2136
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:20,000
I should have known and it's not my fault.

2137
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,400
You didn't even know the name of it right.

2138
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,760
No I didn't know the name of it.

2139
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,160
You didn't know that this was called Port of Entry.

2140
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:26,560
Yes I didn't know that.

2141
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,080
While the listeners are screaming about how it needs to be main feed.

2142
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,400
I didn't know.

2143
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,280
It's a name that one of the hosts of the show doesn't know.

2144
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:33,600
Didn't know.

2145
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,000
And now that you know it you hate it.

2146
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,840
Yeah I guess I do hate it because again they should have made me know that.

2147
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:45,360
Look it's right on the 1999 map it says Port of Entry you know the map with no signs for

2148
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:45,840
smoking.

2149
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,880
You read that map every night.

2150
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,160
You read that map once a night.

2151
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:51,920
Sign with no smoking sections label because you just smoke everywhere back then.

2152
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:58,880
You read it like a bible you do it five times like the rosary and then and only then can you

2153
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,400
actually sleep unencumbered.

2154
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,440
Is that how many times you're supposed to do the rosary?

2155
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:04,720
I don't know.

2156
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,080
You're assigned it aren't you?

2157
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,120
I don't know anything about.

2158
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:12,880
Amounts of rosaries but then you each bead represents a different prayer.

2159
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,440
Like if there's only five you do that one five times if there's ten you do ten Hail

2160
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,000
Marys.

2161
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,920
Could you do can you could you incorporate high and low into one of your prayers for us

2162
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,880
just as an example.

2163
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,120
Yeah.

2164
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:30,480
You do all right so for the first the first round you do Hail Marys and the next round you do.

2165
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:31,760
All right.

2166
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,080
Heil.

2167
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:33,600
Heil.

2168
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,080
Oh shit.

2169
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,360
Oh no no no no no.

2170
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,640
Why is no no no.

2171
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,920
Because it's high and lowest.

2172
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,440
God I got twisted up.

2173
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,240
No not high or low listeners.

2174
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:48,960
I don't think that lowest from high and lowest should be saluted in a killer fashion.

2175
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:49,520
That's not what I was saying.

2176
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,680
I don't think anyone should start some grim revolution in the name of Lois.

2177
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:58,960
Was the name of the Catholic church was that what Prince Valiant was questing in the.

2178
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,920
Oh interesting.

2179
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,120
Somebody look into Prince Valiant in the crusades like I don't know the timeline on that.

2180
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,400
I don't know those years.

2181
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,960
Well they should look if he was to Lagoon should make me know that.

2182
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,800
Kind of skipped over Prince Valiant.

2183
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,280
Kind of.

2184
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:13,840
That's true.

2185
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,280
Yeah it wasn't really big fan.

2186
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,320
You the only thing you don't like is there isn't a Prince Valiant ride.

2187
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,880
Well it would help me understand it more.

2188
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:26,560
Yeah so maybe maybe when they do a big refurb it can be themed something that Prince Valiant.

2189
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:32,240
I will unless by the way I have a little addendum to this episode as well which if we haven't.

2190
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:38,160
Well I die I do now too thankfully the band is called skillet the Christian rock bay.

2191
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:43,760
It took me so long but the rock band is called skillet and it's got you know like I think why

2192
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,760
why I think you would like it is that it's like the Alice in Wonderland band.

2193
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:52,960
Oh where there's like you know like it's two guys two girls and two have dyed hair

2194
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,800
and they look like the people who would revamp the cocktail menu on bar rescue.

2195
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,120
Oh wow.

2196
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,000
They actually all look like bar rescue experts.

2197
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:05,600
We finally found a way to explain some of your aesthetic your rock and roll aesthetic

2198
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,000
which is the bar rescue experts who ruin the bars.

2199
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,400
The cool like leather jacket guys and sometimes they do like pompadours

2200
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:21,840
like it's like a short girl and like you know what a foot of her height is her hair.

2201
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:29,760
I'm bringing my friend in John Stalactite he's one of the top flair bartenders in the country.

2202
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:35,760
Don't get the smoke too close to his hair because there is there is some old pomade

2203
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,840
there's some flammable pomade in that hair.

2204
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,240
We're doing a hibiscus orange gin and tonic.

2205
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:45,920
There's about 12 ingredients into it and it's going to be the signature drink at this new hole

2206
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,680
in the wall bar in Arkansas in this tiny Arkansas town.

2207
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,240
It's going to sink you guys as far as your costs.

2208
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:59,520
Your customers who seem to be old men who watch sports so they can forget that their

2209
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,920
wife died 25 years ago.

2210
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,760
I think they're really going to respond to that to that's the sparkle of the hibiscus.

2211
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,680
The blood orange infused.

2212
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:12,800
You're going to love taking business advice from this guy who has the worst tattoos you've

2213
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,000
ever seen in your life.

2214
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,440
Yes this is right I want to see that guy play rock and roll.

2215
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:24,000
A music thing that I remember about a universal they were like oh we've got a bunch of live music

2216
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,160
coming up and one of the names was Lecrae.

2217
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:31,760
I believe is a Christian rapper and the only time I had ever heard of it before was they

2218
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:37,440
were interviewing a wrestler once and they said you know I I'm on the road a lot on Sundays so I

2219
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,080
do my fellowship by listening to Lecrae.

2220
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:47,200
I never listened to the music and then the only other time it came to my mind I saw

2221
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:54,000
Lecrae was booked at the universal music festival and I was like well we got Lecrae.

2222
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:56,640
You have a good get.

2223
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:02,640
I'll try to find a maybe I'll try to find some skillet to play on the way up so what's your

2224
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,200
addendum?

2225
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:07,120
Real quick I know because of baby I've been giving out Christmas gifts about a month late

2226
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:12,720
a month and a half late here and I have a couple gifts real quick and I just one I hope

2227
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,520
well we'll see.

2228
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:19,040
I'm so excited this might be port of entry themed really underrepresented for merchandise.

2229
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,080
It's not port of entry.

2230
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,440
Ready to throw it in the garbage.

2231
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:21,840
Okay.

2232
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,480
I'm going to start with Scott real quick and it's something we talked about in one of the

2233
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:29,440
episodes and Scott this is your Frank I've given I knew Jada Toys Frank and Barry.

2234
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:32,000
Whoa that's great.

2235
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:32,640
That looks great.

2236
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,040
Wow oh that's fantastic thanks so much Mike.

2237
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:41,360
Of course it's really great he looks cool and he's like a cereal box.

2238
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:45,680
Now Jason you would think oh what am I going to get Jason like Count Chocula or something

2239
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:51,120
the answer is no because you know Griffin Newman started something that I feel like

2240
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,120
is really nice for Scott's.

2241
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:57,040
I started I gave him a couple Kingo key chains and Griffin took the ball and ran with it

2242
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,360
to a crazy degree but you know.

2243
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,040
There's so many Kingos now.

2244
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:05,120
Doesn't Jason need his own version of this Kingo tradition?

2245
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:12,560
I think he does and I found the perfect starting point by getting him two identical items and

2246
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,720
of course the identical items I got Jason and maybe I should just hand this bag to him

2247
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:20,640
and then have him describe as he in real time discovers what I have done.

2248
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,760
Oh all right.

2249
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,960
Okay looks like a sprouts or right aid.

2250
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,960
Oh it's Walmart it's Walmart going green.

2251
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,760
It's not from Walmart.

2252
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,600
He wouldn't use CBS that would remind him of his failures his failures to say.

2253
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,880
Jason is looking at the box he is horrified.

2254
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,880
Is there two what do you how do you say this name like Q Pops kit.

2255
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,520
Actually yeah I think that I don't know exactly how to say I don't I was not even.

2256
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,400
Oh a lot of this backs box appears to be in Japanese.

2257
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:59,760
This is like a vinyl toy of identical toys of Kevin Smith.

2258
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,600
And he looks like a little boy.

2259
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,280
It's like a little like.

2260
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,080
Love is it's very.

2261
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:11,440
Kevin Smith was a little boy and in the comic strip love is.

2262
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:17,520
Giant baby eyes giant like shiny Q P doll baby eyes for Kevin Smith.

2263
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:22,960
Yeah so I am assuming that with the collector's mindset you're

2264
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,560
thinking I'll open one of these and keep one in box.

2265
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,760
Well I was thinking maybe you could keep one on your desk and then you could sleep with one in your

2266
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,080
bed.

2267
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:31,200
Oh OK.

2268
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:36,320
But it's up to you I mean the way you want to do your new and I again it doesn't have to be the

2269
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:42,000
start Griffin of a new tradition where Jason collects Kevin Smith toys which of which there

2270
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,720
are a number of different ones but if that happens that would be great.

2271
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:50,720
So Jason I'm allowing you to just choose how to collect however you want.

2272
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,760
All right very good.

2273
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,680
So we'll post a photo of these things.

2274
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:56,560
Thank you so much for not giving these to me.

2275
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,880
I am terrified of this.

2276
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,600
These are we're afraid of Megan.

2277
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,480
I don't think so.

2278
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,600
I'm afraid of these Kevin these Kevin Smith Q POS kits.

2279
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,160
I saw Megan the other night Megan rocks.

2280
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:08,640
Yeah sure.

2281
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,760
It'll be back.

2282
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:14,560
Well Megan's then Megan does not have that in common with these dolls.

2283
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,480
These are thanks for putting them back in the bag.

2284
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,520
That's where they should stay.

2285
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,000
Those are those are the idiots.

2286
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,320
And you know what's weird to me I saw it at a distance but I think something about the beard

2287
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:28,160
and whatever was on his head from a little bit of a distance I was like

2288
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:32,080
are those weird little dolls of Osama bin Laden?

2289
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,840
I also thought Osama bin Laden when I took it out of the bank.

2290
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,240
We thought you got us that would be pretty weird.

2291
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:46,080
I thought you found like an Alibaba someone selling like Funkos of Osama bin Laden.

2292
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,760
I've seen Hitler quarter scale or six one sixth scale.

2293
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,120
You're doing Hitler's?

2294
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,480
Yeah you can find Hitler dolls.

2295
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,480
Yeah people are wild.

2296
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:54,800
Well we.

2297
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,760
This is Kevin Smith by the way the film director Kevin Smith.

2298
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,720
And podcaster.

2299
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,480
Not a dictator.

2300
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:01,680
You'll have to take a picture.

2301
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,880
Jane and I gave Mike and Lindsay a bunch of stuff.

2302
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:07,760
Christmas and belated congratulations stuff.

2303
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,560
It was mostly gift cards for food that I know new parents it's

2304
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,960
sucks to get food on table get coffee that sort of thing.

2305
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,520
But I did get him a bottle of blue maple Captain Crunch bread.

2306
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:19,680
Yes.

2307
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,320
Blue maple.

2308
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,240
I was like oh I should have taken a picture to show Scott this monstrosity.

2309
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:28,240
That's going to I'm going to have to put that on the shelf next to the digits

2310
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:29,600
while I count calories.

2311
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:37,200
Now that's a nice couple of ice cubes shot of digits a little spoonful of.

2312
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:41,120
Well yeah maybe you're right a little blue syrup in my new cocktail.

2313
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,120
And that's maybe that's the type of cocktail one of these Flair bartenders

2314
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,440
could introduce to one of these bars on Bar Rescue.

2315
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:53,360
I do it all day we're going to we're going to bring it we're going to bring in digits.

2316
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,960
We have a sponsorship with Scottie Peppin and we're going to also put a little blue

2317
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,480
Captain Crunch maple syrup.

2318
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:01,760
It's like his flaming mode.

2319
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,520
Captain Crunch to button it with the topic of the episode.

2320
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,400
It'd be fun if Captain Crunch was walking around port of entry.

2321
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,400
If you had like explore characters that you recognize

2322
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,120
and you get like Captain Crunch fudge at the candy shop.

2323
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,160
People who are about to go sail off and who have those big dumb hats that sailors.

2324
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,920
Yeah sure yeah absolutely.

2325
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:27,200
I'd like to know more than Captain Crunch master and commander far side of the world.

2326
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:31,440
Is that a really yeah Quaker Oats guy.

2327
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,600
Yeah all of the all the friends.

2328
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,960
All right yeah it should be for and these are friends that you know.

2329
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,800
Mike unlike the friends that are not your friends from port of entry.

2330
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:41,520
I don't like them.

2331
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:47,920
Well all right on that on that note on a mixed review you survived podcast the ride.

2332
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,680
Thanks for subscribing to club three.

2333
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:51,280
Your bravery saved the podcast.

2334
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,560
Well done freedom fighters.

2335
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,320
You didn't like port of entry.

2336
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,760
Mike hates port of entry.

2337
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,600
When you come to port of entry with me and we'll get some sea grooms.

2338
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,040
Okay and then we'll go we'll just vibe we'll enjoy the music.

2339
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,480
Okay a liquor that no one likes that no one regularly drinks.

2340
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:16,400
Liquor and when you wash that down with a Cinnabon you're gonna love it.

2341
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:21,200
Traditionally the washing is with the liquid not with the big thick solid.

2342
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:26,960
With sea grooms not with the seven it's I mean seven seven the seven up kind of eases it into you.

2343
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:34,000
But anyway I you don't you don't like port of entry but I'm curious now if you will if you will

2344
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,040
like the band skillet and I want you've maybe actually heard skillet before because their song

2345
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:46,160
monster was used as the theme song for wwe hell in a cell and the and their song hero was the

2346
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:52,800
theme song for tribute to the troops and royal rumble 2010 so I feel like it's it's odds are

2347
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:58,560
maybe kind of good wwe impeccable taste for music just really solid always on point.

2348
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:03,840
Let's see let's let's see let's let's let's try a little monster on the way out the door.

2349
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:10,320
Oh and make sure you vote in the comments for topic next month skillet episode question mark.

All right here's skillet.

2355
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:28,880
I know you wouldn't like this.

2356
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,240
I now I know right away.

2357
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:42,640
Maybe some of these energy music but when the spirit moves you you know.
