1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Podcast The Ride presents, The City Walk Saga.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A daily, 19 part, extremely necessary series exploring the stores, restaurants, and wonderful magic that make up universal city walk Hollywood.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The City Walk Saga.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today, Sector 5, here as always, Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hi, yes, Sector 5, I'm excited, I'm refreshed, I'm ready to go, ready to talk about a very interesting parking experience I had.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, all right. And Scott Gartner here too.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's start talking, we don't have to do this at the pace of the other ones.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, all right, all right. And then this week we're joined once again checking in with the Sector Keeper.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh yeah, here he is.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He's here.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Boys, boys.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hello Keeper.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's good to see you.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Good to see you.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You give me strength.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How do you feel that, are you feeling stronger? Do you feel like the journey is proceeding according to plan this far?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes, yes, the more Sector Stones you take in, the stronger I become.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We have four so far.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You have four.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Excellent, thank you.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, and we've collected some other stuff too, and guess what Sector Keeper, you're going to be joining us.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We got you a gift.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My mother?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No, no, no, no, no.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, your mother, well we still have a track to show down.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're not supernatural, we can't pull strings like that, but.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please find her.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sector Keeper, on the last episode I went to the hot topic, of course you know it, because for those of you who are tuning in, Sector Keeper is sort of an omnipotent being that watches over City Walk and that keeps the sectors in order.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And who's a baby who died in the fountain, not a baby, but a young child who went to a limbo state due to being poisoned by the dancing fountain.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm permanently this many.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes, of course.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He's holding up fingers, but he keeps putting some down, so it's not clear.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It was a staph infection that did you in that Abercrombie and Fitch fountain.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Right, and when we of course talk about all 19 sectors of City Walk you will finally be able to experience pop culture that has been missing from your life, Sector Keeper's life for so long.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You'll find out about Saliva, the Josie Scott's band, the guy sang a song, Hero, who's in the first Spider-Man movie.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It was like if they say that a hero can save us.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's a nice song.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Not gonna stand here and wait.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh that is nice.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you like us just not even practicing, wait till you hear the real guys Chad and Josie do it.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Excellent.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So anyway, last episode I went to the Hot Topic and they have a wonderful sales section and there was a two for two, buy two get two free.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I bought us all blind bag Ready Player One keychain toys.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So we've all opened ours.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ready Player.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, that's a good point.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It was a book, it was a bestselling book and that was a movie made by Steven Spielberg.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And it has all these characters like the Iron Giant.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't know that either.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Chun Li from Street Fighter.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Chun Li, yes.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She's in it.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's from your time.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Excellent.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So basically we've opened ours.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll give you yours and you can open it now.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We'll refresh which characters we have of course.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I have 101 Avatar Soldier.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I have Soto.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wait, wait, wait, Soto.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What?

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You called him Soto.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I heard an H.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oh, OK, sorry.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, Soto.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Sorry.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And you're so much bag crinkling.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm very sorry.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There isn't.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, Sector Keeper.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They're hard to open.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
In the future is the perforation.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, these are like really sealed.

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
These are like.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sector Keeper, I would think.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Maybe you should.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I would think that the Sector Keeper has some sort of power to be able to open a bag.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Guys, don't blame him.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
His hands are disappearing.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Careful with you.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Like put him back to the future.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, he's Sector Keeper going for his car keys.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Which I didn't know the Sector Keeper even had a car.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They're my keys to my job.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, you have a job?

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Wait, wait, you have a job?

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes, I check people in and out of purgatory.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh no, what a depressing job.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's why you haven't been on every episode because you're having to go to your job sometimes.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm working overtime.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh gosh, it gets sadder and sadder.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm picking up extra shifts.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, it's open.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's open.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
OK, I have.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What care?

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It says on the back Sector Keeper.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He's a Parzival.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You got Parzival.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, I got Parzival.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's the main character who goes into the Oasis and ends up finding the Easter egg.

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Well, he's the hero, just like you, City.

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Just like you.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Sector Keeper.

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I once said CityWalk.

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Just like you.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, you are CityWalk.

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, in a way I am the personification.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Toss me that Parzival, baby.

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sure.

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, he looks real sickly.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Much like you, Sector Keeper.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He does.

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh yeah, you're going to get as pale as Parzival if we don't save your soul soon enough.

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And he's got what I think is a sword on the back of his jacket, but it looks like a Christian cross.

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey, alright.

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh yeah.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's pretty good.

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm Presbyterian.

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh really?

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh wow.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was a child.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you.

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Both practicing still, you and?

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Not really.

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No, not really.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Religion's not allowed in Purgatory.

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, okay.

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, that makes sense, actually.

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, now all you follow, your religion is the way of the Sector, and we need you to

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
enlighten us about what today's sectors are.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Boys, boys, come close.

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Come close.

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You don't need to whisper it, but go ahead.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Today's Sector is Sector 5.

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sparkies, Johnny Rockets, and Jamba Juice, formerly known as Radio Station Restaurant.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ah, that may have been a typo in the Sector Seeing Stones.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Radio Station Restaurant was not in the Jamba Juice, it was where the Johnny Rockets is now.

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't want to go out of order necessarily.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm going to go to hell.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh shoot.

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh no, it's okay.

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Here, we'll do it the correct way.

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Our Presbyterian God I hear about on Christmas and Easter is going to make everything okay.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
All right.

151
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So it was Sparkies?

152
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, okay, let's go in order.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Sparkies is the first one.

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Sparkies is a store with an adorable little boy like yourself on the sign.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
My best friend growing up.

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh, you knew Sparky?

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mm-hmm.

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Wow.

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He must have had a real sweet tooth even back then.

160
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes.

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He loves his donuts.

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He has like a kind of a beanie, like a Jughead style beanie on his hat.

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Or that's his hat, excuse me.

164
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah, he's got a little hat.

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay.

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's like a beanie though, right?

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah.

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Everyone's looking at me like I'm crazy.

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,680
I just learned that Jughead, that the Jughead, like whenever Archie Comics started that the

170
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,320
crown was like a thing people did.

171
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,000
Gomer Pile also had a cl-

172
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes.

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,360
Well isn't it supposed to be like when the British celebrate Christmas, the little paper

175
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,000
crowns and poppers?

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Is that right?

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Is that right?

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I just thought it was like a beatnik thing.

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What?

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, I think it might be.

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,360
I think it's like Street Cooke's or something.

182
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
No.

183
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,760
Well, I think Archie started earlier than the beatniks did.

184
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Maybe.

185
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,840
I mean, I don't know the history of Archie Comics.

186
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
I think it's bullshit.

187
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Here's the thing.

188
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,040
If anyone knows all about being Jughead, it's you.

189
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Oh, well, yeah.

190
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,120
And so I don't even want to talk about the sexy Jughead on the TV show.

191
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Yeah.

192
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,480
I mean, he's very handsome, glad.

193
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,120
But that beanie, yeah, he's got a beanie crown?

194
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,920
I don't understand it.

195
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,400
The point is, this is the first store I've written down nothing about.

196
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,200
So you guys will have to take it from here.

197
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
All right.

198
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,800
Well, I will take it from here because I was at Sparky's today.

199
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,040
Sparky's is like kind of advertised as just like little donuts.

200
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,440
But then there's like this kind of fancy candy store.

201
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,240
That candy store kind of boned me out.

202
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,760
All right, go ahead.

203
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,080
Well, I...

204
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,480
So here's the thing about Sparky's.

205
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,680
Sparky's seems to be, in my mind, doubly redundant because now there is Voodoo Donuts, which

206
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,640
kind of cancels out like the little Sparky's donuts.

207
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
They have like plain donuts.

208
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,880
And these little plain fried donuts.

209
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,760
And I was like, oh, maybe I can get...

210
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:34,480
It seemed like the smallest option they had was half a dozen mini donuts for like 8.50.

211
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,560
And I am a man of principle and I love my donuts, but I'm like, no, no, no, nice try,

212
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Sparky's.

213
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,320
And this is a thing that comes up for me sometimes at CityWalk, which is living in the area.

214
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:54,040
I know a mile down the road, there is a donut shop, multiple donut shops where 8.50 gets

215
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,880
you a full dozen full-sized donuts.

216
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,560
So in principle, you could not bring yourself to buy a bucket of Sparky's donuts because

217
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,840
you knew how many donut establishments were nearby.

218
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Well, and I had a lot of sugar already today, so I didn't want to crash too hard.

219
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
So yeah.

220
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,080
But then all the candy stuff, they have a lot of the same stuff that it sugar has down

221
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
the way.

222
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Yes.

223
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
Now, Sparky's, I think is the only place at CityWalk that has like a chocolate case, like

224
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,120
has a traditional confectionary case.

225
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,640
So I guess that's why it's still hanging on.

226
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,000
And that stuff all looked good and fresh.

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So let me say this.

228
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This one likes treats.

229
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,160
You got my ticket sector, Gever.

230
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
He's pointing at Jason.

231
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
He understands.

232
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Yes.

233
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,320
So I also, we all like treats, but Jason might be the biggest treat liker of all.

234
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,160
But because I'm a theme park journalist, I felt that I had to try some of the treats.

235
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,760
So I got three treats from the case, from the chocolate case.

236
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,520
I got a little salted caramel.

237
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,520
I got a sugar-free peanut butter cup, which I didn't know was sugar-free until she said,

238
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
oh, it's sugar-free.

239
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Is that, are you sure?

240
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
And I went, oh yeah, of course.

241
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
And then I went, why did I say yes?

242
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,840
And then I got a homemade Twix, which is the one that fascinated me the most.

243
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Cause I love Twix.

244
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,880
Do we all, what do we feel about Twix?

245
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
I'm up there with this one.

246
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
That's one of the best.

247
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
One of the best.

248
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Yeah, of course.

249
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,440
So I said, homemade Twix, this is going to be delicious.

250
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,480
This is going to be like Twix, but with better ingredients.

251
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,040
So I had the peanut butter cup fine, salted caramel fine, homemade Twix.

252
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,640
I bit into it and I was like, this sucks.

253
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
This is bad.

254
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Why?

255
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,840
Like I craved a regular Twix.

256
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,080
It was just like they shoved a cookie inside a chocolate shell.

257
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,600
Like it wasn't even, there was a little caramel in there, but it felt like a totally different

258
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
thing.

259
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,440
Branding at Twix is insane.

260
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
It's crazy.

261
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,640
Why would you compare it to a better candy?

262
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Just call it something else.

263
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,640
And maybe I wouldn't have had the expectation in my head that this thing was going to taste

264
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,440
like a homemade Twix or something.

265
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,840
Something that's going to be, you know, the thing I like, but better because it's home,

266
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,480
quote unquote, homemade.

267
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,160
And I was very disappointed by it.

268
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,400
What was the size?

269
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
It was about this.

270
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,760
I would say like six, five inches.

271
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,760
So just one of them.

272
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
I just had one Twix.

273
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
What do you mean?

274
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Just one.

275
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
They don't sell them in pair.

276
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,840
I feel like the pairing of Twix is vital unless you're talking Twix ice cream bars.

277
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,560
You think that I should have had two Twix?

278
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,000
No, I don't think you know, I, you, it shouldn't be your responsibility.

279
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,840
It should be the shop's responsibility.

280
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,440
They should be selling you two little strips.

281
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Pair the homemade.

282
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Forcibly.

283
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,880
I'm glad that they didn't do this because I was disappointed.

284
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,960
And yeah, it was a real bummer because I'm very excited about it.

285
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,840
I was like, Oh, I'm going to find my new favorite treat at Sparky's because I'll be honest,

286
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,680
this was the first time I stepped foot inside that Sparky's.

287
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,140
I'm an It's Sugar man and we'll get to that later.

288
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,680
That's my favorite candy store at City Walk.

289
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
I go there.

290
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Oh yeah.

291
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Of the seven.

292
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,320
And then let's be honest, at Sugar, a lot sexier than Sparky's.

293
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Okay.

294
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,440
Sparky's has this sort of like fancy-ish, but also childlike thing.

295
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,060
Well, it's, yeah, it's got the little Sparky guy up front who, look, he seems like a nice

296
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
enough guy, Sector Keeper.

297
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,060
No, he's bad.

298
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,060
Oh, he's bad.

299
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,060
Okay.

300
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
Well then to hell with him.

301
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,300
But inside, I don't know, it just kind of bugged me out.

302
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
You know what else they had?

303
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,760
They had a bunch of the glass soda bottles.

304
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,460
I talked about this before.

305
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,380
Places at City Walk selling glass drinks that you can't take into the parks.

306
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,240
This came up with Mini Monster.

307
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,700
The other thing that bugged me, they have that weird bottled off-brand Butterbeer.

308
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:34,020
The one that looks like Harry Potter, like logo and design and stuff, but he's like just

309
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,140
different enough to get by.

310
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,860
That's crazy to me that they're selling that at multiple locations at City Walk.

311
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,660
Sparky's is bad.

312
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
Sparky.

313
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,420
Sparky took my place in heaven.

314
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,660
Wait, what?

315
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,180
He's why you can't be there?

316
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,180
Yes.

317
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,340
In addition to you, okay, so you got sick and then there was a choice which way you

318
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
would go.

319
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
Yes.

320
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
But he had already taken this.

321
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,500
There was a little boy shaped spot and he took it.

322
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
So also he's-

323
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,820
And he created a bad candy store.

324
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Huh.

325
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
So let me ask you this.

326
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,180
Did he take your place?

327
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,900
Would you have been the little boy on the front of this candy store if it weren't for

328
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
him?

329
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,900
Ideally.

330
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
Oh man.

331
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Secties.

332
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:23,300
So, so if we, do you think maybe there's a chance that if we complete our 19 sector mission,

333
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,220
the Sparky will float off the front and Secty, is that, did we, did we reveal your first

334
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
name yet?

335
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
I don't even think we've talked about that.

336
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
I can't remember.

337
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
He doesn't remember what it was.

338
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
I don't know if I wanted to say that.

339
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,940
He now is the sector keeper for all time.

340
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:43,340
But I can promise you that if you complete your missions, I will not only not go to hell,

341
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,780
but Sparky will file for chapter 11.

342
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,780
Oh wow.

343
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,340
So we'll put him out of business at least.

344
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Yes.

345
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
It's not like you'll replace it.

346
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,700
It'll just be like people will be out of a job and he won't actually be a celebrated

347
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,820
little boy anymore.

348
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:01,900
And then they'll be, and then in the display case will be a new kind of candy, non-homemade

349
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:08,060
Twix, which will just be a regular Twix bar, but that, but non-homemade is written in marker

350
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,500
and you have to buy two.

351
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Yeah.

352
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
You're forced to buy two.

353
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,900
Well, no, you shouldn't be forced to buy two.

354
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,100
Look, they should, whatever the size, you said forced to buy two.

355
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,140
They should be packaging two.

356
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,140
That's forced to buy two.

357
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,060
But no, it should be the same price or they should just cut the one you had in half and

358
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,420
they're next to each other.

359
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,780
They're sort of combined with job.

360
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,140
That doesn't make sense either.

361
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,900
When you buy a Twix at a store, there's a minimum two, unless you're talking fun size

362
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,900
Twix.

363
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Yeah.

364
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
I understand the concept here.

365
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Am I crazy?

366
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
Boys, boys, please.

367
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
I'm sorry, sector keeper.

368
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
I fear you.

369
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,500
I fear you want to accomplish your mission.

370
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
All right.

371
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Okay.

372
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
I have a few more Sparky Stots and we can get on to the...

373
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Sorry.

374
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Look, okay.

375
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,180
Why are there so many goddamn chocolate eggs in Sparky's?

376
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,140
There are the Guinness eggs, like chocolate eggs.

377
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,140
There's a lot of like booze candy.

378
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Oh yeah, there's a lot of booze candy.

379
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,140
Booze likes that.

380
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,060
There's a whole bunch of generic salt water taffy.

381
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,300
There's more eggs here.

382
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,900
There's like the after eight, like dark chocolate mint egg.

383
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,540
It's a giant egg.

384
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,460
Who would want to eat a giant mint egg?

385
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,460
Who's you for?

386
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,980
Like you wanted to have a giant cotton candy yesterday.

387
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,220
But that's a normal size cotton candy.

388
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
This is fancy trash.

389
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,100
Yeah, but on top of a drink...

390
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
This is fancy trash.

391
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,780
But I don't know your logic, but like if you...

392
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,940
I might buy you a chocolate egg and think you might like that.

393
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,940
Why not an egg?

394
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
No, I would hate that.

395
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,460
A giant egg with chocolate?

396
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
That's too much.

397
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
Cotton candy is light and airy.

398
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
Whoa, if it's Easter time.

399
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:41,900
There's things that are too much, proudly while ordering, but then after the fact complaining.

400
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,980
There's a box that just said Hollywood on it.

401
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,980
Yeah, okay.

402
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,260
So that's the last thing I have to say about Sparkies is that there are a number of different

403
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,180
chocolate boxes that are just...

404
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,180
Clearly gift boxes.

405
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,580
Postcards from Los Angeles.

406
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,340
So like this is just, I don't know, maybe Malibu will post this obviously on Twitter.

407
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,740
And then this one says like, discover Los Angeles.

408
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,580
So it's like you're going to gift somebody some chocolate, but it's going to be an ad

409
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
for tourism.

410
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,700
Also, is that a picture of downtown as the sun is setting?

411
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Yes.

412
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,500
It looks like a shot right before the heist or right before the purge starts.

413
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,580
It's not even a nice picture of downtown LA.

414
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,780
It looks like a picture that would be the front of a movie, like a shot from the start

415
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,780
of a movie.

416
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
Like the to live and die in LA poster.

417
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,740
Yeah, like 2041, Los Angeles.

418
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,260
Los Angeles has gone to hell.

419
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,540
In a nuclear glow, a warm orange nuclear glow bathes the city.

420
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,140
So there is a strange amount of like Los Angeles propaganda in the store.

421
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:45,340
Also redundant until very recently there was Upstart Crow, which is full of that stuff.

422
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:51,580
So donuts covered elsewhere, coffee covered elsewhere, candy covered elsewhere, Los Angeles

423
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,380
crap covered elsewhere, covered everywhere, everywhere.

424
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,620
And cute little boys covered or sent away into the bowels of purgatory.

425
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,500
A Faustian store only exists because of a bargain.

426
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,260
Well, you can feel it in there.

427
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,260
It's redundant.

428
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,260
It's pointless.

429
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Feel the Faustinas.

430
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,260
I will call.

431
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
It didn't smell good.

432
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
It didn't even smell.

433
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
I agree with you.

434
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,260
It didn't smell good.

435
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,260
I will.

436
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,020
Let's let's write here on episode five.

437
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,980
Let's call for this thing to be shut down.

438
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,660
That's what we want, I think, for sure.

439
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,780
I mean, we're going to be working for the workers.

440
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,660
Give a new employment.

441
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,660
I don't think so, actually.

442
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:36,060
You think they are punishing the workers for working at this store.

443
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,060
That's the way I feel.

444
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,060
No severance.

445
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
No severance.

446
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,060
No way.

447
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,540
Not even like the left of a candy.

448
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,740
No, I think that should all go to Jason.

449
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,180
They're just following orders from a very demented little boy.

450
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,700
They shouldn't be punished for this.

451
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
I don't like it.

452
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,900
I don't like it one bit.

453
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
So Sparky's thumbs down.

454
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Oh, no, no, no.

455
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
All right.

456
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
Jamba Juice.

457
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Boys, please move on.

458
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
Jamba Juice next.

459
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Can we you want to start coughing immediately?

460
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,700
Can we just skip to it already?

461
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
I was nothing.

462
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,700
It's nothing.

463
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
It's a Jamba Juice.

464
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,980
It is a Jamba Juice.

465
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,380
I got thoughts on Jamba Juice.

466
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,540
Mike was really into Jamba Juice a few years ago.

467
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,900
Well, I was I was into Jamba Juice because they had a secret menu.

468
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,580
This is one of the first places I ever heard of a secret menu.

469
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,940
And I thought this was really cool.

470
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,740
This is also the part of the part of my life when I was a fucking idiot and thought that

471
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,740
Jamba Juice was healthy.

472
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,780
They pulled the wool over a lot of people.

473
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
Yeah.

474
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,780
So you'd be like, this tastes delicious, but it's also good for you.

475
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,780
And it's like, it's not.

476
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
It's just a bunch of sugar.

477
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,460
And even you shouldn't be having that much fruit because fruit is full of sugar.

478
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
It's good sugar.

479
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,260
But still, you're still going to crash.

480
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,940
You're still going to crash.

481
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,020
And they have like they had like a fruity pebble one and like a red gummy.

482
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,900
You get your order off the secret menu.

483
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,700
Just get a box of fruity pebbles.

484
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,860
Why are you parsing out the fruity pebbles?

485
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,540
Because it's fun to order secret stuff.

486
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,740
I just usually always got a green thing there.

487
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,500
Like a green thing or a chocolate thing.

488
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,780
The green thing fooled me for years, too, because you'd go like you'd get a green thing

489
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,300
from Jamba Juice and you'd be like, this tastes delicious.

490
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,340
And it would be like apples.

491
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,740
And then it would be like a bunch of sugar, bananas, strawberries.

492
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,340
And it would just be a bunch of regular food.

493
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,420
And they would fool you by making the thing green.

494
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,300
I. Yeah, it does feel like a trick at CityWalk.

495
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,540
It's like, oh, something healthy up here.

496
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Yes.

497
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,980
I mean, I guess it's the closest thing to.

498
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,980
It's probably the closest thing.

499
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Arguably the healthiest.

500
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Yeah.

501
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,620
And I will give Jamba Juice credit.

502
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,860
They now finally have some things on the menu that are kind of healthy.

503
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,140
That has kale as the first ingredient and that you can get like real carrot juice or

504
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,940
some real actual vegetable juice.

505
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,700
I mean, I would just load up whatever.

506
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
I used to use it.

507
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,900
I used to be one by an old job and I would go like as a lunch replacement.

508
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Sure.

509
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,620
You can get like the protein boost.

510
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,620
Of course.

511
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,620
Soy protein or whey?

512
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,140
I don't think I ever really noticed a difference.

513
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,340
I think I always just defaulted the whey because it's cheaper.

514
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,340
I don't know what you're talking about.

515
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,220
We're talking about the stores.

516
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,700
I have 15 more minutes.

517
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,700
OK.

518
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
All right.

519
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
So Jamba Juice.

520
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
That's all I really had to say about Jamba Juice.

521
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
We got to keep the sector keeper around.

522
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
All right.

523
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
All the Johnny Rockets.

524
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Boys, are you still there?

525
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
We're still here.

526
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
Oh, God.

527
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
It's like transparent.

528
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,700
So this Johnny Rockets recently redone in a very sparse modernist style.

529
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
Yes.

530
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,540
What's a number?

531
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:28,660
So this is a couple observations I've noticed in our many joints up to City Walk recently.

532
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,860
One, a lot of the places that have been there for a while and seem like they're going to

533
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:39,060
stick around for a little while have kind of redone to like take away the more kitschier,

534
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,220
louder style and more like sort of a minimalist style.

535
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
Yes.

536
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,580
And certainly this Johnny Rockets has done that, which is also odd because it is a Johnny

537
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:57,660
Rockets doesn't often update its look past the idealized 1950s version of a diner.

538
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,380
A lot of them update their look by closing forever.

539
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,380
That's true.

540
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,580
It's considered an update.

541
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,260
You do lose a little bit of that like trashy mall Johnny Rockets.

542
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,260
Yeah.

543
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
They've redone it.

544
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,980
So like you're missing some of the fun of being in a terrible place.

545
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,260
But I will say this.

546
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,020
I ate there today.

547
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,140
I had a hot dog from Johnny Rockets.

548
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
Pretty good.

549
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,140
Usually.

550
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,140
All of this today?

551
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,140
And yes, I did.

552
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,140
And I had a nice beer.

553
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,540
And I'll tell you what, I loved it.

554
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,260
They have a nice open area, which I think they kind of did before, but now it's a little

555
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
more open air.

556
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,260
Yeah.

557
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,820
I'm not alone.

558
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
Great shakes.

559
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,820
Great.

560
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
I've heard the shakes are good.

561
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,820
Did you have a shake?

562
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,500
No, I've had one before.

563
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
I'll tell you this.

564
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:47,420
My main memory of Johnny Rockets is I once went there and was served a very wet burger.

565
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,140
I was like, I came right from the kitchen.

566
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,060
I'm like, why is this so wet?

567
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,060
And then I went to open the...

568
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,700
This is going to sound like I'm making this up.

569
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
I went to open the ketchup bottle.

570
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Fries.

571
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
I opened it.

572
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,300
And then a bunch of water came out.

573
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,140
And I swear, I'm laughing, but this happened.

574
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,900
I'm like, how did you even...

575
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,020
I haven't even tipped it.

576
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
It's still upright.

577
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,020
Where was all this?

578
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,300
Why was this water inside the cap?

579
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,060
So I've had some very wet dining experiences.

580
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,380
Like everything tasted fine.

581
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,780
You walked in and they rounded up all the employees.

582
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,020
Like, look at this guy.

583
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
We should probably all spit.

584
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Hey boys, wet it up.

585
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
I don't know.

586
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,020
I feel like that...

587
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
Oh, sorry.

588
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,820
I was going to say, I feel like that you could tell, but this, it felt like they're like,

589
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,780
all right, just dump a glass of water on that.

590
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,780
Send it out.

591
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,620
And did you send it back or...?

592
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,620
I know.

593
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,180
I just kind of took it out of the wrapping.

594
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:51,740
I feel like it was probably sitting there for a while and it was just condensation.

595
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Well it's Universal Studios and they love getting you wet.

596
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,740
That's true.

597
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,340
Just keeping with the studios.

598
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,540
They wheel the burger past all the way from the park and it gets hit with all the different

599
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
things.

600
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
Water world water.

601
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
Water world water.

602
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,540
It's good.

603
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,540
Yeah.

604
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,780
The rest of the water world splash zone, it gets those Dilophosaurus on the tour spit

605
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,780
in them.

606
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:20,900
The T 1000 used to, the T 1 million used to explode all over the burgers.

607
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
T 2.

608
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,900
The tram.

609
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,900
Yep.

610
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Yeah.

611
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
The tram.

612
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
They'd have to get a hamburger on the tram.

613
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Yeah.

614
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
They'd have to give it a seat.

615
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,500
That's why it took so long.

616
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:38,820
Something I noticed being up there in the morning again, there were just so many people

617
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,860
in business casual with Universal ID badges or land.

618
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,820
Just people clearly going from office building to office building or taking, eating lunch

619
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,940
together or doing a lunch meeting.

620
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,860
And there is, I mean, I remember when I was like an intern on the back lot, you did get

621
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:02,660
a decent discount at City Walk and it's kind of a pain in the ass to leave and get back

622
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,940
to City Walk.

623
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:13,260
So you're telling me, I think it was a pretty decent discount, but from tour Plaza, you

624
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,320
get all the way through security, get scanned and everything, make it all the way up to

625
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,260
City Food and get your, like what was in the food court?

626
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,940
I'd get a Rubio's at the time.

627
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
Yeah.

628
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,420
I'd get a Rubio's Panda Express maybe, but that blows your entire 45 minute lunch period

629
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:36,060
and you might get called out on tram three, tour three for the day right when you get

630
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,060
back.

631
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
Well, that's true.

632
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,060
You've got food sitting cold.

633
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,540
But the people working directly above City Walk and the offices above City Walk, they

634
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,980
just take the elevator right down, walk right out.

635
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,180
Maybe they go to City Loft for some little quiet time away from the office.

636
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:56,100
Again, a thing I witnessed, like someone quietly read in a Kindle, read their lunch.

637
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,420
I've written up there.

638
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
I have written scripts.

639
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,420
I thought about that when I was up there today.

640
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,140
Like, wow, this would be a great place to just write a little.

641
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:11,060
Nobody's in the City Food to City Loft transitional area and we're crossing the different sectors.

642
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,060
I apologize.

643
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,060
It's okay.

644
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,060
I'm enjoying it.

645
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,060
It's on topic.

646
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,060
But yeah, aspiring screenwriters.

647
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,620
Oh, now we're going to get the word out and it'll be flooded with people with laptops

648
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,620
and typewriters.

649
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,460
Can you pick up the Xfinity Wi-Fi?

650
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,540
Or is that just within park limits?

651
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,460
You got to use your own hotspot, I think.

652
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,420
I think you're stuck with that.

653
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,700
I will.

654
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,100
I've never written a script at City Walk, but I also have thought about it.

655
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,100
Yep.

656
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,820
There's a fantasy of working at theme parks.

657
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
Yeah.

658
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,220
I mean, we've casually gone to these places, but I really should finish a movie, writing

659
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
a movie up there.

660
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,220
I've done a lot of good times.

661
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,540
I've been to Disneyland by myself with a little notepad and written down little blurbs and

662
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,620
ideas that turned into the Hollywood magic later.

663
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,180
It turned into things that over 30 people have seen.

664
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,180
Wow.

665
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,580
So get the magic, right?

666
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,620
And get the theme park magic.

667
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,940
Branded content?

668
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,940
Hold on.

669
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Wait a minute.

670
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
You know about branded content?

671
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,940
I don't know.

672
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,940
I took a guess.

673
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,780
Oh, do you just hear the people going from the office buildings?

674
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,900
You hear them talking about branded content or quadrants?

675
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,900
Yes.

676
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Yeah.

677
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Quadrants and vertical.

678
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:33,100
And if you're an actor at Universal Studios, then the mother of all jackpots is to be in

679
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,100
some branded content.

680
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,100
Yeah.

681
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,100
We've all done it.

682
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,540
The other thing I've observed recently is that there used to be an entrance.

683
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,260
If you worked on the lot, the Universal lot, you could walk into City Walk.

684
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:52,420
And that has since been closed because some writers from certain shows were walking through

685
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:58,820
and being a little too rowdy, walking back from City Walk, Margaritaville.

686
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,820
Too rowdy?

687
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,820
Really?

688
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
Yes.

689
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,020
By the City Walk, by the Margaritaville specifically?

690
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,220
Because I saw Walters Gate is still there.

691
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,980
It would be on the north side of City Walk.

692
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,780
Do we have names of not the people, but of the show that may have blown the privilege?

693
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,780
I'm not sure.

694
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,780
Could have been a super store.

695
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,060
Maybe it was a place that was not so good.

696
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,420
I can't speak to that.

697
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:30,220
Maybe a certain project with a certain Mindy involved.

698
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,260
That was not masked super carefully.

699
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,580
No, that one didn't work as well.

700
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:43,500
Maybe the Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien eight years ago, nine years ago.

701
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,060
So this, Secretary Keefer, I must apologize for this.

702
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:52,020
This is going to kind of veer into an eventual sector, but I have to tell my co-hosts, because

703
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,580
we're still in this journey, we're going to be going back to City Walk a lot, I didn't

704
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,260
realize that because one part we're talking about parking.

705
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:07,260
We've often mentioned there's not a lot of good options if you're just going to pop in

706
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,260
and out.

707
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:13,900
Yes, that's why I walked from my house to Lankersham, bottom of Lankersham, took the

708
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
tram up.

709
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
Yes, I like doing that.

710
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,900
That's fun.

711
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,700
You can park real close by and then walk and get in a free tram and take that up, or you

712
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,340
can walk from Ventura.

713
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,260
Secretary Keefer and I walked up one time when we went to the Zen Zone.

714
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
I guided Michael up.

715
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,060
Yes, it felt like he was carrying me up the hill.

716
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,500
Was there only one set of footprints?

717
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:38,780
There was only one set of footprints on the concrete when we were walking back down.

718
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,700
Maybe you guys know this, and forgive me if this is not new information.

719
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:50,900
If you are only going to spend two and a half hours there, you can get $7 parking with validation

720
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,900
from a restaurant.

721
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,500
This is a terrible deal.

722
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,740
I went to Johnny Rockets, I had a beer and a hot dog, and paid $7 to Valet Park.

723
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:05,060
That is much better than $25 flat fee.

724
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,860
Basically, $7 Valet is not crazy.

725
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,380
Where does that valet put you out?

726
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,540
The valet puts you out... First of all, I want everyone to know that Jason aggressively

727
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,620
pointed at me when he said that.

728
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,060
It puts you out right under City Food.

729
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,900
It's by the main hub, by the movie theater.

730
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
By the Skechers?

731
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Yes.

732
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,100
Yeah, I've come out there before.

733
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
We all have.

734
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,100
Great spot.

735
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
Great spot.

736
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
We've all come out there.

737
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,580
It's not that special.

738
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,060
The valet... I will talk more about the experience valeting when we eventually talk about the

739
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,540
parking garages, of course.

740
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,260
I want you guys to know that if you're going to pop up there, it makes sense.

741
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,380
You just go into Johnny Rockets, you could probably order fries for five bucks, and you

742
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,780
can get free, basically not free valet, but validated valet, $7.

743
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,380
That cuts down so much of the price.

744
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,380
$12 fries.

745
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,380
Best deal ever.

746
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,140
Best deal in Los Angeles.

747
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,140
Yes.

748
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,540
So $12 fries.

749
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,740
But does that work at, say, what we talked about before, the crepe cafe?

750
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,740
Needs to be a sit down restaurant.

751
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,340
I don't know if the crepe is considered in there, but-

752
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,340
Fast casual.

753
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,340
I would call it fast casual.

754
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,100
I was surprised Johnny Rockets counted.

755
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,460
The Americana is free.

756
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,780
The Americana has good restaurants in it.

757
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
The problem is-

758
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,580
Why are we touting this parking deal?

759
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,260
I mean, but if you have to go up there, I guess, or if you're like a tourist in town,

760
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,260
it's a good-

761
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,180
We're the only idiots who have to go up there.

762
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,180
Yeah.

763
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,180
That is true.

764
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,700
We don't really, even now we do.

765
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,580
All I'm saying is I don't blame them because it's attached to a theme park, and that's

766
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
the problem.

767
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,420
That's the reason the money is so expensive, unless you go to a movie.

768
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:44,860
But up until very recently, Downtown Disney had a strong window of free parking.

769
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,380
CityWalk never has.

770
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,740
Yes, that's true.

771
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,260
They've been sucking us dry for a while.

772
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,860
Well, we don't need to talk about that yet.

773
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,860
We're not talking about parking.

774
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,860
No.

775
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,100
In fact, we covered it, I think.

776
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,540
We can, we're actually, we can be done unless there's tangents we miss.

777
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
I think that's the whole sector.

778
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,660
I will say a tribute to a fallen hero.

779
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:13,300
KWGB World's Greatest Burgers was a radio-themed burger restaurant that was in where the Johnny

780
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,740
Rockets is now.

781
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,100
There was a live DG Recall.

782
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:25,140
There was a live BJ, a burger jock, and you would call from a phone at your table.

783
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,340
You'd call the burger and boogie hotline.

784
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,260
And he'd walk over and pour a glass of water under your burger.

785
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,900
You wouldn't even have to get up to get your burger water.

786
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
It's also very wet.

787
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,900
It's also very wet.

788
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:44,060
I found it on a site so deep, even we haven't been there, or I haven't, mouse info.

789
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:56,100
I found a little story of not really a story, but a man who had the privilege, I'll just

790
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:02,820
read it as post, I had the privilege of being a live DJ at KWGB World's Greatest Burgers.

791
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,300
From 1996 to 1998, the food was awesome and hearing the best rock pop disco, new wave

792
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,700
and R&B from the 60s, 70s and 80s made for an awesome experience.

793
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,100
I left about six months before they closed, but I was sadder the day it closed than the

794
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
day I left.

795
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,860
What did they replace this alive place with?

796
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,420
The Daily Grill, which has some of the blandest food I've ever tasted.

797
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,900
This along with other unique venues have shut down to be replaced by stores you just find

798
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:33,300
in your local mall, which has been a frequent complaint of ours that special city walk locations

799
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:41,460
with live burger DJs are being demolished for boring places with watery burgers.

800
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,060
Thank you for your service, burger DJ.

801
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,060
Yeah, you weren't keeping it real.

802
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:53,420
Though I have to say, Johnny Rockets, I think a better estimation of the clientele going

803
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,220
there than Daily Grill.

804
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:02,500
I find Daily Grill even off, even just civilian Daily Grill in the area, a little pricey,

805
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,500
you know?

806
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,540
And Daily Grill is a very like office park, a very like-

807
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,340
Very lunch, business lunch sort of thing.

808
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:14,060
People who don't feel weird spending $18 on a Cobb's salad.

809
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,060
Maybe expense accounting it.

810
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,100
This is not the dollar, it says we are rich.

811
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,220
So the, oh, I have one more thing.

812
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,260
Remember when we went up there a couple years ago and the waiter made a minion out of ketchup?

813
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,860
Oh, yes, I do remember that.

814
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,860
I got a picture of it.

815
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,860
I'll post that.

816
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,340
That's some sweet social media.

817
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,940
Yeah, that was fun.

818
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,260
That was really fun.

819
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,700
Yeah, he did a good job.

820
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,780
He's very nice and a good ketchup artist and almost no water was poured onto the-

821
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,780
Yeah, there was no-

822
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,820
No water on your dog today, Mike?

823
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,260
No, not really.

824
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,900
What toppings you put on that, bad boy?

825
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,100
Well, it comes with just sort of relish, ketchup, mustard, and then like diced tomatoes.

826
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Oh, interesting.

827
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
Bothered by that?

828
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
Was I bothered or Jason?

829
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Were you bothered?

830
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
No, no, I like all that.

831
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Oh, yeah.

832
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,100
You said it a little like alarmed.

833
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,100
I actually was trying to remember.

834
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,100
I would think diced raw onion.

835
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
I would put that over instead of diced tomatoes.

836
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Oh, maybe there was onions on it too.

837
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
I absolutely agree.

838
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
I would put that over instead of diced tomatoes.

839
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
I liked it.

840
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,540
I'll tell you though, I was sitting there.

841
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:15,540
There was a nice breeze coming in from outside and there was a man playing some cover songs

842
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:22,420
outside and I was writing down the covers as he would play them and he played real smooth

843
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:29,680
versions of Free Fallen, Treasure by Bruno Mars, Island in the Sun by Weezer and I always

844
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:36,060
love it and it was the best so far of this whole time, it's my most pleasant, nice time

845
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,620
at City Walk was this moment.

846
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,620
Eating a hot dog.

847
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,220
Well, best of all, you were not with any friends or loved ones or family.

848
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,220
I was alone.

849
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,580
There was a person next to me at the bar who I sensed might want to start talking to me.

850
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,660
I was not interested.

851
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,340
I kept kind of looking to the right.

852
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,340
You know what I mean?

853
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
You know what you can feel when somebody wants to talk to you?

854
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,300
You kind of just kind of like, I don't want to make eye contact because it's going to

855
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,300
open it up.

856
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,780
So I did that and I focused on this nice man playing music.

857
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,780
I assume he's nice.

858
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,580
I followed him on Twitter.

859
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:09,860
I'm going to give him a plug because I enjoyed what he was doing and let me find it.

860
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:19,860
That's a very great, can I ask on the four-chette scale, uno due tre quattro cinque, the Italian,

861
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,780
the legally cleared Italian fork scale.

862
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,420
Give me the fork scale again, uno due tre quattro cinque.

863
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,420
I'm going to give it a cinque.

864
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,220
Tre, was that what you said?

865
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,220
Tre would be three.

866
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,220
Yeah, I'll say tre.

867
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
All right.

868
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Tre, four-chette.

869
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:41,620
Follow, I am Johnny Martin on Twitter.

870
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,420
He's the guy who was playing the covers.

871
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,140
Oh, it's a J-O-H-N-N-Y.

872
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,500
All right.

873
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Thanks for the tunes.

874
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:58,860
As we wrap up, the stone is materialized for the sector and it just looks like a regular

875
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,700
stone, but it's very wet.

876
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,220
Yes, yes, boys.

877
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,620
Sector five stone, the wet stone is now yours.

878
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Hey, cool.

879
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
There it is.

880
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,620
There it is.

881
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,620
Jason, take it.

882
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
It made a sound.

883
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,620
It never has before.

884
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
It's not like it's a feature off it.

885
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,620
It's very wet.

886
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,540
Usually water is supposed to run off a stone or get absorbed into it.

887
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,540
This is like sopping wet.

888
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
It's permanently wet.

889
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,140
It's chlorinated, so you're okay.

890
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,140
Oh, okay.

891
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,940
I wish the fountain was chlorinated.

892
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,940
Oh, man.

893
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,140
That would have saved your life.

894
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,140
But you give me strength.

895
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,140
Yay.

896
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,140
You give me joy.

897
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,740
Another stone towards your freedom.

898
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,860
I'm one step closer to being an okay boy.

899
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
Wow.

900
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,660
Yeah, and then you can finally hear that song by the lead singer of Saliva and Chad Koger

901
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
from Nickelback.

902
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,660
Yeah, we are the heroes who will save you.

903
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,380
We're not going to go in a way.

904
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,380
What are the lyrics?

905
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,340
We're not going to stay on the wings of an angel.

906
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,340
Swatch as we all fly away.

907
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,820
So good.

908
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,140
The end.

909
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,660
See you tomorrow.

910
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,860
