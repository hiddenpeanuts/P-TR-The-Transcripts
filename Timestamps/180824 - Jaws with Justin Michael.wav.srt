1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You all know me. You all know what I do on this podcast. But this isn't my usual bullshit,

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,960
our treats and three hour naps. This is Jaws, the universal classic attraction, the one filled

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,960
with lawsuits, leaking hydraulic fluid, rowboat rescues, and dead birds. Justin Michael joins

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,440
us on the best, and only, scene a cruise of Amity Island. Show me the way to go home. I'm

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:35,440
tired and I want to go to bed. Podcast the Ride.

6
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,360
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the show that can make your two hour wait for Slinky Dog Dash

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,800
feel like a three hour wait. I'm Jason Sheridan, here as always with Mike Carlson.

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,760
Hi, yes. We want to make it worse when you're waiting in the Orlando sun, so you have to

9
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,760
listen to us talk about fake rocks and different treats that we like. So sorry about that, I

10
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
guess.

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,760
That was it, yeah. And Scott Carragher.

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Hi. Yeah. How is the line? What do we know about the ride?

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,160
We know the line has been bad since the start, since the opening of it.

14
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,040
Shaded. Yes, there's a big problem with shading into the new Toy Story Land in Disney's Hollywood

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,960
Studios. We know that they've changed the menu on Andy's lunchbox, I believe.

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
Yes, they dropped the Monte Cristo.

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,880
Yeah, they do. This usually happens with theme park food, is that when like a new stand or

18
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,600
new restaurant opens, they're very ambitious with the food. And then after a couple weeks

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,040
of operation, they realize that everyone just wants a chicken sandwich, a cheeseburger,

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,920
or a hot dog. And then they start taking stuff off. So like they probably had like filet

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,640
mignon bites or something, something crazy. And then now it's just like Andy's chicken

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,720
sandwich. It's like they downgrade it because no one wants that fancy crap.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,640
Only food shaped in slinky shapes? Like just spirals, curly fries and zucchini swirls?

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,480
I think that would do very well. I'm not sure the full menu. We'll have to look into that.

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,520
Yeah. Joining us today, a very special guest. He's a writer on Infinity Train, the new Cartoon

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,680
Network show coming soon and Bad Reception, a new narrative podcast from the good people

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,440
at Audible. Justin Michael.

28
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Hello.

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
Hi Justin.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
The good people at Audible.

31
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,480
I'm glad you clarified that they're good people because you wouldn't want to listen to some

32
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
projects made by a bunch of real fans.

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
No, thank you.

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,920
Yeah. So excited to have you. You're a friend of all of ours for a while and I think a theme

35
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,240
park nerd equal.

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,720
This is just what we talk about anyway whenever I see you guys.

37
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
Yeah, that's true.

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,040
It has been for a long time. Yeah, that's what we plug it. So let's just pick up the

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,960
conversation where it left off. Where's the last theme park you've been or like internationally?

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,440
You did a Tokyo recently.

41
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Yes.

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
We should ask him.

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
Tokyo Disneyland ride.

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
We got to ask Justin.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
Good point.

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
What's your question?

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,240
The question. Okay. So here's the thing. We've been having this discussion over several

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,280
episodes. How many days for your first time going to Tokyo, how many days? Now we each

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,880
have a different day. So maybe we don't. I don't know if you don't know, we shouldn't

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,520
sway you by saying which one we think. So you tell us first time going to Tokyo, how

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,880
many days do you need to do at the Tokyo Disney Resort?

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,480
Okay. So obviously did a lot of research.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
Sure. Of course.

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,720
Because half the reason I was like very excited about going to Tokyo was pretty much this

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,880
going to Tokyo Disney Sea.

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Of course.

57
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,920
So you go to the, there's this website that I went to and they were like, you need five

58
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
to six days.

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Right.

60
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Which seemed like a lot.

61
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Yeah.

62
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Yes.

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,040
But depends on how much you really want to spend there. And you're like, I'm never going

64
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,200
to go here again. Maybe you just want to keep going on the rides over and over.

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Right.

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,520
We did two days, one day at each park. We went during an off season.

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Right.

68
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,280
So that made it easier. But the thing about Tokyo Disney is that they only let you go

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,560
to one, there's no park hopper. You can't go to two parks in one day. You have to choose

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,960
which park you go to.

71
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,320
And then on day three, I've been told it's a park hopper.

72
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Exactly. Yes.

73
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,880
Oh, if you do a third.

74
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Right.

75
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,120
That tilts it over. Then you, it's the visitor's choice.

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,400
You can buy separate tickets.

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Right.

78
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,760
Like they do a thing called the starlight pass. So what we did, I, we went twice, which

79
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,200
is insane because we got a real good deal. But the first time we went to Disney, I think

80
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,640
Disney sea first, just cause I like couldn't contain myself.

81
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Yeah.

82
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,560
I was just like, this is what I've been waiting for since I looked at pictures on the internet

83
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,240
in like 2001, three. When did it open?

84
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
Mind blowing. And when we're getting all of these low rent parks, your early California

85
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,920
adventures and seeing what is, what Japan has, uh, yeah, yeah. You couldn't even like,

86
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,680
this is not what the company does now. They still do this. Oh my God.

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
It's insane.

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,880
And then the second time we did like a Disneyland for most of the day and then did Disney sea.

89
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,760
We did that starlight pass after 6pm from six to 10. We went to Disney sea, but it was

90
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,040
dead the second time.

91
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, I mean, that's good, but it would be beautiful at night. It's, I mean, it looks

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,360
beautiful in the day, but especially night.

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,320
So for our level, the three of us level of nerd about theme parks, first time going,

94
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,280
how many days do you recommend?

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
I'd say minimum three.

96
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Hey baby.

97
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,400
I didn't go more than three days because of my girlfriend, Marissa Strickland for podcast.

98
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,960
She likes theme parks enough to indulge me on international trips, but not enough that

99
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,640
she would go if I wasn't there.

100
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Right.

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,080
Which will come up in a later part of this episode. There's another detail about Japan

102
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
that I want to get to.

103
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Yes.

104
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,160
Okay. So Mike said three.

105
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,800
Mine was three. We're going to do three when we go there, hopefully next month. Jason said

106
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,040
four. Scott said two. Yeah. Well, everyone is fucking made their voices heard on this.

107
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,800
We had a great time doing two. I did every single ride.

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800
This is what the idea that it is like unreasonable that you are an enemy of the state. Somebody

109
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,240
sent an all a cat on all caps email and the title was Scott has made a big mistake. I'm

110
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,440
sorry if you're a fan of this podcast, maybe don't send us threats. I mean, I did research

111
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,080
how like what the best way to like your plan of attack. So it was like, nobody goes in

112
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,080
single rider lines there. It's crazy. It's just like a two and a half, three hour line

113
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,240
for splash mountain there. And we were the only people in the single rider line. Wow.

114
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,680
Indiana Jones at Disney. See, so like, no, the rides that are single rider. If you're

115
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,280
doing that. Okay, sure. And you started a very helpful email, which thank you. It's

116
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,480
very, it was not asked for. It was not asked for, but it was very much appreciated. Well,

117
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,360
did we say all of it you're going? Well, I'm going. I mean, there's a chance work stuff.

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,520
Something might come up. But yeah, as of right now, I feel like I are going and I'm going

119
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,040
evidently in April, but I also, you never know. Sure. We shouldn't start. I don't want

120
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,440
to wet the audience's appetite for my trip to Tokyo and then disappoint them. That's

121
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,760
what I'm saying. People would be crushed. It would be so upset. So, but the fingers

122
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,000
crossed wheels are starting to turn for both of us to get there. So anything else you can

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,240
actually really like we don't want anything spoiled. I understand. I didn't watch any

124
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,480
ride throughs beforehand. I know very little. Yeah. I haven't watched them either. I did

125
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,400
end up for 20,000 leagues. I know about it because we did an episode about it. Um, but

126
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,880
I still, I try to not let it really register in the brain too much. I'll read about stuff

127
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,080
and I'll look at concept art. If I know I'm going there soon, like with this one, I just

128
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,960
didn't want to see, cause that's the most fun you can, you can never get back that first

129
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,160
time you go on a ride. I accidentally, I was watching something on YouTube the other day

130
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,200
and Tokyo came up. I forget the ride. I'm not even going to say or no, I remember the

131
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:19,400
rider, but I, I won't say, uh, exactly what it was in reference to, but I like sat up

132
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,160
and I went, it uses what ride system? Like I was like, it revealed a little too. I was

133
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,200
like, Oh, I, I didn't realize this about like, you know, this Tokyo Disney sea ride. And

134
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,880
I was like, Oh, I think I can kind of picture it now. Damn it. I'm so curious. I had a similar

135
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,280
thing. And I also won't say the ride, but I was looking at a look for this episode because

136
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,640
we're dealing with an attraction with a, with big giant animatronics. And I was like, what's,

137
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,880
what do people consider like the best animatronics or the, you know, in terms of those, especially

138
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,280
those giant, you know, the Yeti or King Kong or whatever. And this list that I read, the

139
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,760
number one was a Tokyo sea giant animatronic. I feel like we all know which ride I don't

140
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,080
know. I didn't know that this ride. I suspect, but I don't want to even say because I don't

141
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,960
want to get it. I already luckily because my short term memory is dying steadily. I already

142
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,280
don't remember the name. Okay. Then I don't want to, I know which ride, but I don't know

143
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,920
the name of the cars right now, screaming the name of the ride at the podcast. And they'll

144
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,120
be like, they'll write an email like Scott better remember what the name of the ride

145
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,880
is or else he's dead. They'll find a way to make email subject lines being red and dripping

146
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,920
with blood. Well, some of the best giant monster animatronic rides I found out after the fact

147
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,600
were concept designed by the same guy. Like I realized like there's like an a tour of

148
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,020
like, you know, you know, like a Tony Baxter. I feel like you could sort of see like what

149
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,320
kind of rides he makes. And I feel like it's hard to like figure out who makes rides. Cause

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,840
there isn't like an IMDb for, or maybe there is. I park rides. Yeah. And there's this guy

151
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,200
and I won't say the ride that we're talking about, but I found out this ride that I think

152
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,640
you're talking about. He was the lead concept designer on that ride in Tokyo. Right. He

153
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,720
did his first jobs were for making jaws and confrontation. Wow. And he did Jurassic park,

154
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,800
the ride. And he did a private, he can't, he hasn't revealed what the ride is, but there's

155
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,640
one piece of concept art from beastly kingdom, that lost land and animal kingdom. And it

156
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,680
looks like a, like a mine cart ride with a big dinosaur. My gosh. And I'm like, Oh, so

157
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,000
I like this guy's ride. Right. Who is that? Do you know his name? Tom Thoradson. Okay.

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,840
I think. And he goes by Thor and he's like big in the Tiki community. Oh, actually our

159
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:43,480
local Tiki joint in Hollywood. Sorry, Margaritaville at city. Oh, wait a different one. Okay. Tiki

160
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,800
T the tiny shack that is right. Nestled next to the Scientology center that used to be

161
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,880
a KCET, which is the saddest thing. Oh yeah. Brought to you by Lucky Strikes. Tiki T brought

162
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
to you by Lucky Strikes, Marlboro, whatever brand you prefer. Hey, they don't, they don't

163
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,360
allow you to smoke in there anymore. Oh, is that right? No, for like the last six years,

164
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,240
seven years. Okay. It's much better. Cause I hated it then, but I'd be like, all right,

165
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,000
well I like this decorated shack. But now. Whatever for decor. He made their anniversary

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,440
mug. Like he designs mugs and stuff. And so he did, it's like shaped kind of like the

167
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,840
right building. Oh man. He gave us a new guy to heroify on this podcast. Yeah. He's great.

168
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,360
Yeah. We'll check out Thor. Yeah. Hey neat. I was just going to say if the, oh, if you

169
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,480
haven't heard of beastly kingdom, there was going to be a whole other section of animal

170
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,880
kingdom with like mythical characters, like a castle with a dragon and a roller coaster,

171
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,720
I think. And there was a hedge maze where you'd find a unicorn at the end, which had

172
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,160
some amazing technology where the unicorn would speak to you telepathically. That's

173
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,120
not a, this is not a joke. They were going to do it where they were going to have it

174
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,180
like the dialogue being base tones. So you would literally feel the vibration as opposed

175
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,020
to hear it. So like you'd go up to the unicorn at the end of finally, like you would find

176
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,920
different mythical creatures in the maze, but then you'd finally get to the unicorn

177
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,240
and he would like, or he or she would tell you something, but it would, you wouldn't,

178
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,960
it would be like, feel like it was in your mind. Wow. Like base tones, like, like vibrating

179
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,580
words to you. So you'd like feel it in your body as opposed to hear it. There's nothing

180
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,520
I want more than that land, that world to exist. Oh, I know. So sad. It's in the spot

181
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,160
that I ever tar went though. So I mean, they're going to have to figure out a different place

182
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:30,440
for it, but now it's not IP based. So it'll never happen. The dragon coaster in, uh, the

183
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,840
islands of adventure lost continents, I think was like the dueling. Oh, oh, oh, the concept

184
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,320
I believe was born kingdom. And then when it got canceled, the universal, that makes

185
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,640
sense. Yeah. The concept and the person people who are working on it, right. I think so some

186
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,360
vestiges of it, right. Because he was popping back and forth, I guess, or maybe he started

187
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,120
at universal and then he moved to Disney. I think he just helped with like concept illustration

188
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,480
and storyboarding for jaws and those ride and confrontation. But then he was like the

189
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:09,320
designer of this ride at Tokyo Disney sea, which is probably one of my favorite rides.

190
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,240
But we all ride that we're all think we know the name of that. We won't say it spoiler

191
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,840
eluding we are. I understand that. Yeah. There's a magic to it. And there's, there's rides.

192
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I've, I've, yeah, I ended up seeing what 20,000 leagues was, but I'm still, now it makes me

193
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,600
so excited to go on it. It doesn't ruin it for me. And there's never a line. Nobody likes

194
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,920
that. Really? The two times I've been, it's like people are like, yeah, you can skip this.

195
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,600
Even on the, like the, the websites that say like, here are the best ones to visit it.

196
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,760
Uh, yeah, it's really great. It's really just a dark ride and it's, it's with all, all physical

197
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,800
practical props, which is cool. Cool. Um, one more thing before we get done with this commercial

198
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,840
for Tokyo Disney. I am looking forward to the Teddy Roosevelt lounge. Maybe the most

199
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,200
of everything. Some coasters from it. And what does it say? Teddy rode Roosevelt lounge

200
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,520
on it or it's got the logo of it. Yeah, it's beautiful. Everything there has their own.

201
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,520
So every dining facility, we thought about taking another thing, but we couldn't fit.

202
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,960
I mean, also the coasters were cardboard, so it wasn't like a, I don't know if I real

203
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:19,040
thievery thing. I mean, we, we might not do that because I also just asked at, uh, uh,

204
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,640
jock Lindsay's in Orlando. Like, could I take something? They like, just push the stack

205
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,400
over like, yeah, take as many as you want. They did not seem to care. I mean, we like

206
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,160
gave them or anything, but they have those, you know, like cafeteria trays. Uh, every

207
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:40,080
restaurant has a themed tray. There is a country bear tray. Michael R Carlson. Uh, just cause

208
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,840
I mean, we all love the country bears. Yeah. They're like alive and well in Tokyo Disneyland

209
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,080
in a way that like, yes, people go to different shows. We went to the Christmas one. We went

210
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,040
to the regular one. It's very weird because it switches between English and Japanese.

211
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,920
I don't know. That won't spoil it. Hey, I'm very excited, but I wish I could have those

212
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,280
trays. Like they have a Duffy tray. Oh yeah. Well, we'll get to that. That's tough to sneak

213
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,720
out and that feels like more of stealing. I mean, it's definitely, it's a hundred percent

214
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,320
stealing for sure. Stealing. I just really fast. Also the, I don't, I have no idea and

215
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,960
just tell me you're just give me your like guttural reaction to these rides, which I

216
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,200
don't think we've talked about on the show. Uh, poos honey hunt. It's nothing about. Okay.

217
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:27,840
It's absolutely incredible. It puts every other one of those rides to shame. Wow. Wow.

218
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,800
And the Disneyland one isn't bad. It's fine. It's just kind of like it's not monsters ink

219
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:39,160
bad. Right. It's like, I feel like it's a little, little mermaid level to me, which

220
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,800
I rather have than not have. Yes, certainly. Yeah. But honey hunt is like, well, they're

221
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:54,400
all plush too. So they look like stuffed animals. You're going to gasp yourself. I know. I won't

222
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,440
spoil it. Yeah. That it's, it's great. It's the best ride. Go there early. That's the

223
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,440
one that, okay. Interesting. Monsters ink. Uh, also really, yeah. I'm very excited about

224
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,480
that. Yeah. I've avoided knowing anything. I'm just, I'm glad to hear they're cool. Let

225
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,280
me ask, uh, have you spent, did you spend much time exploring their hotels? Like their

226
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:21,560
official Disney? Not at all. Cause that is a thing I like to, I like to, you know, explore

227
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,760
the grounds and the lobbies and stuff. Yeah. Even at the hotels, like I'm not staying in.

228
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:35,480
Do they have toiletries that Jason could possibly put in a giant garbage bag? Uh, probably. We

229
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,520
didn't go into any hotels. Okay. I don't, I think that's the, like my theme park nerd

230
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,520
level is not as interested in like the hotels and even the restaurants or that kind of,

231
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,680
like I really just love the rides and the theming and then just being immersed in the

232
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,760
world. But it looks like Japan and like, I mean, their hotels look like they're as nice

233
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,880
as the theme parks. Sure. Yeah. Um, Teddy Roosevelt thing is in a huge cruise ship or

234
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,960
something, you know? So it's like, it's just an icon in the park and inside is a restaurant.

235
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,440
And then it is a, just a, just one of the things in this park is a full ship. It's just,

236
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:19,040
you know, among the dozens of the attractions to check out. Crazy. Oh boy. One more tip.

237
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,840
You think you, we have blinders on. Oh, sorry. No, no, I didn't mean to. Oh, I was going

238
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,040
to say, uh, uh, we recognize too that like in one of the most amazing countries in the

239
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,800
world, like just full of cool stuff. What is this? An apology to Japan for us only caring

240
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,840
about the theme parks? No, no. Only Japan and the good people at audible need to be called

241
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,140
out in this podcast. We're going to Japan too, but this isn't in a podcast about Japan.

242
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,160
It's a theme park podcast. It's not Japan, right? It's wait, no, nevermind. That joke

243
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,720
fell apart immediately. That's okay. That's fine. That's fine. That's what matters. Um,

244
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:01,120
uh, oh, my tip was for English speakers, like yourselves who want cool theme park memorabilia,

245
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,320
you know, there's a tower of terror at Disney scene with custom story. It's, it's, it's

246
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,920
amazing. It's great. Uh, they have a handout for people in other languages that you have

247
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,000
to ask for. And I think we just happened on it and it's themed and it's like a history

248
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,360
of the hair, like the high tower hotel, right? And it has like the legend of Shariki, you

249
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,580
tuned to like this evil Tiki idol is the theme of the thing. So even if you don't like spooky

250
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,440
drop rides or just go in the line, it's cool. And they'll give you a thing so you can follow

251
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,920
along. Cool. And it's better than anything you can buy. Right. Jeez. But it's, but that's

252
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,060
a little secret menu. It's just, yeah, we never want to know that. English speaking

253
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,880
stuff and like the design is really beautiful and it just go all out. That's great. I think

254
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,200
Tokyo is the only place where I'd be tempted to sit and watch a show. I, I skipped shows

255
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,960
everywhere, but shows are like awesome. There we watched phantasmic there. It was different.

256
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,280
Okay. Yeah. All I will say. Oh neat. And it's a Disney C. Oh yeah. In the main lagoon.

257
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,200
Yeah. Cool. I'm excited to see Duffy and all of his friends. He's got all the people dressed

258
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,880
as Duffy. Well, that's true too. But I'm just like Duffy and just his friend, Shelly May

259
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,800
and his friend, Jelotoni and his friend, Stella Lu and their bird mailman. Marissa and I waited

260
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,200
in line to get you guys plush when we were there. Yeah. You guys got me Tippi Blue, the

261
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,760
bird mailman. It was Tippi was almost sold out. Well, Tippi is a very popular character.

262
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,840
Yeah. I feel like they're not pushing Tippi as hard as they used to. I agree. I think

263
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,800
Tippi has gotten lost in the new, cause there's new characters like Stella Lu and what's the

264
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,800
new character? Oh, Cookie. But Cookie's Hong Kong exclusive. And Ulo? Ule? Ulo is an exclusive

265
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,600
to Alani. Yeah. So Duffy has friends that are exclusive to other parks, but I think

266
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,560
that they are overshadowing Duffy's bird mailman, Tippi Blue. You think some news is going to

267
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,800
break about Tippi? You think he's about to be Me Too'd? You know what I mean? That's

268
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,520
what I'm saying. Possibly. They're downplaying their association with him. That makes sense.

269
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,680
Yeah, they're trying to distance themselves. I get it. What did you do, Tippi Blue? Oh,

270
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,800
me Blue. That's better. I said me Tippi. It wasn't a pun. I really thought if somebody's

271
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,600
getting Me Too'd, it would have been Jelotoni, the Italian painter cat. He just seems like

272
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,640
he's very vivacious and maybe, you know, gives a little bit too of foreword. But he restricts

273
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,560
boundaries and that's a good thing about Jelotoni. I guess that's a good point about Jelotoni.

274
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,960
Anyway. He's a good cat. What is he? He's a cat. He's an Italian painting cat. He uses

275
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:29,440
his tail to paintbrush. All right. A good cat, Jelotoni. With his good tail. We're talking

276
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:37,120
about a different critter today. Different, a critter of the deep. Yeah. We're talking

277
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:45,480
about old Spielberg's old pal Jaws. I find it very fun when we throw out, when somebody

278
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,400
who I'm like, I know you're a big theme park nerd, throwing out an open-ended assignment

279
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,160
of topic. I'm always excited to see what's going to come back. This is a great one. But

280
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,120
I think it's interesting that this is opposed to all the Disney stuff. I'm curious about

281
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,320
your personal associations with Jaws. Yeah, I think it was very hard to pick because it

282
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,840
was between like Jaws and just Efteling in general. Yeah. Oh yeah. But that's a whole

283
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,720
separate conversation. We'll do that. We'll do that. Oh boy. Great. But Jaws. So I grew

284
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,320
up like loving giant monsters like Godzilla and then like King Kong and Jaws. And I think

285
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,440
it wasn't until recently that I realized that I think I went on the Universal Studios tram

286
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:36,200
tour first and that's why I liked Jaws. And so I used to watch Jaws and at the time when

287
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,800
I was younger, I was like, Jaws 2 is better because there's more shark. I guess a kid,

288
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,560
I was like, there's more shark. That's why it's a better movie. That feels like you could

289
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,920
write an article right now on the internet and people will lose their mind. Like why

290
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,680
Jaws 2 is better than Jaws 1. And then people would get really mad and then you get a lot

291
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,240
of like hate, but it would get a lot of clicks because it's like an outrageous view. So I

292
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,160
think maybe do that. I mean, earnestly, I think Jaws is a much better movie than Jaws

293
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,520
2. Yeah. But I'm saying for clicks. Yeah. And I want the clicks. I'm looking for the

294
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,120
clicks. So if you find me, click me. A whole very angry political movements will stem from

295
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,240
this article. It's the most important thing politically going on right now. Yeah. Is the

296
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,320
Jaws versus Jaws 2 debate. It could be like the revisionist history about the Star Wars

297
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,160
prequels is what I'm saying. You could start that movement. Okay. I got to go guys. Immediately.

298
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,440
Just bail on this altogether. This has been great. And thank you for having me, but I

299
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,040
got to go anywhere near this. But I like that your child brain just like is on effect. You

300
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,080
aren't nobody's you haven't bought into the greater narrative. You just, you that that

301
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,800
was just like a pure kid opinion you have. That's very nice. Yeah. Yeah. And as a kid,

302
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,280
you know, like I really was into just sharks in general. I have like a cassette tape of

303
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,220
like different types of sharks being described to me that I fall asleep to, which makes me

304
00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:01,440
sound like a sociopath. Like you're trying to like get their power somehow subliminally

305
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,760
into your brain. Yeah. I would stare at it with my eyes wider than you can imagine just

306
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,080
holding fingers to temples. Repeating some words backwards. Did you remember like, do

307
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,040
you like remember what was on the tape? Did you listen to it so much that you kind of

308
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:21,080
have like an encyclopedic, pedic shark knowledge? Now it looks like you don't. I know. I mean,

309
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,680
I remember there were tiger sharks and hammerheads and they were just described and that, you

310
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,360
know, like what they stopped swimming, they sink. They're attracted to blood. They have

311
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,000
like a good sense of smell. But also, no, not really. It sounds like you retain some

312
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,920
of it. Yeah. I got some of it hanging out. Do you like street sharks? I did, but they

313
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,680
creeped me out. Yes. There was a weird vibe about those guys. Just roided out screaming.

314
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:53,360
Like they were just too gross for me. Rollerblading. Yeah. Pick a lane. Too aggressive. Yeah. Turtles

315
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,480
much more laid back than the street sharks. Street sharks looked like they would beat

316
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,960
the shit out of you. A lot of like biker mice from Mars also too aggressive. I was going

317
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,360
to say yeah, biker mice from Mars. Well, after all, Tamant, the biker mice from Mars. When

318
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,120
the biker mice from Mars were hired by the Rolling Stones to police their concert. Yeah.

319
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,760
Yeah. We all remember that. Anyway, sharks back to sharks. Did you see my eye? Because

320
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,080
I didn't see like jaws until I was like around like end of high school, start of college,

321
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,560
but I would have ridden the ride about a dozen times before that. I saw the movie probably

322
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,280
when I was too young to see the movie. Okay. If I were like a parent now, I'd be like,

323
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,200
no, you're not allowed to see that. People get bitten in half. There's like a leg that

324
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,560
floats by a kid dies. So probably it was like at least like 10 or maybe eight. But I was

325
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,940
so into the ride that I think it wasn't that scary to me. Yeah. And so it was first the

326
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,760
tram tour because I grew up in Los Angeles, which feels like, you know, instant access

327
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,000
to theme parks. But as I grew up and like in high school, I would because universal off

328
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,520
season, especially then there were no rides really compared to Disneyland. It feels like

329
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,720
I mean, there was that. Yeah. It really was the tour. I mean, the universal slowly transitioned

330
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,400
from the tour was a three hour experience. I remember it was most of my guy. Yeah. You

331
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,320
would eat lunch and I remember there was the incredibly shrinking telephone set. Oh yeah.

332
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,560
They did that. You, you basically halfway through the tour, you would stop and then

333
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,640
there was like, you could get lunch or just sit around and then you would get back on

334
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,680
the tram and then go around and see other stuff. There's a little like cart, like you'd

335
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,960
go down to the lower area where there's limited stuff to do. So you would eventually have

336
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,640
to get back on and do. I want to say it was by like the horror movie sets. Oh yeah. You

337
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,600
were at studio. I did it. Oh yeah. Uh huh. I auditioned for it. Really? Did not get it.

338
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,520
Didn't get it. Yeah. Same year. When did you do it? Around the same time? I, 2005. OK.

339
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,280
So it was like after freshman year of college in the summer, I wanted, I wanted a really

340
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,400
fun summer job. I auditioned, went to, I think it was like a Radisson. Uh, it would have

341
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:13,200
been the Garland. Possibly the Garland. Yeah. The Beverly Garland. Yeah. And you know, it

342
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,040
was like a bad improv audition. So it was like, I mean, you talk about it. Yeah. I remember

343
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,520
there was a, yeah, I had to like, uh, uh, which I was not super improv comfortable,

344
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,280
but like for this job, I swear to God, I will, I will own this moment. You only have to do,

345
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,560
you know, you only had to improvise for like 30 seconds or something. But I was like, whatever,

346
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,600
I don't know. There were like three auditions maybe. And I got to one where you had to memorize

347
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,000
a block of dialogue and go do it for one person in an office, just like in front of their

348
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
desk. Yeah. And I got to that stage and I beefed it. Whoa, really? And that specifically,

349
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,560
and you could feel it like disappear. Cause I was so afraid. Like they gave you, they

350
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,200
handed you something to memorize there. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you had to memorize it.

351
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,360
Like audition style. How long did you have to memorize it? How long, like an hour or

352
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,280
less? Much less. Less. Yeah. And I memorized it cold. Yeah. Cause that was the, it was

353
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,160
meant to convey, this is the gig. We're going to hand you new stuff. You'll have no time

354
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,600
to prepare. You're just going to have to do it on the fly. And I remember mine was, it

355
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,680
involved me having to know the names of all five of the desperate housewives, which I,

356
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:28,760
again, I had like, I, I still don't know it. And I remember on the tour being so slow and

357
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:37,040
like Nicolette Sheridan, Terry Hatcher. I like, cause I truly, I've never seen that

358
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,840
show. I truly don't care. But I like if, all right, if this is what it takes, I, I want

359
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,720
this so bad. It was about the war of the worlds 2005 Spielberg movie. Oh, cause that would

360
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,400
have been like new. The set opened and they drive through it and stuff. So I had to memorize

361
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,920
like something about that. And I choked for later. I I'll just bring it out. I have the

362
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:06,040
studio tour guide manual. Wow. I think I can find the part that you probably would have

363
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,640
had to do. And I have so many, it's a lot of pages. I have instant sympathy for you here

364
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,480
because what I recall is that that stretch was one of the stretches that you had to do

365
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,640
word for word because it had been signed off on by some Spielberg lawyer. And there was

366
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,000
like this verbiage that was like, it was, you know, you had to remember, is it heart

367
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,400
pounding? Yes. Bone rattling. This is, is this why you didn't get the job? I mean, yes.

368
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,800
This was the audition that I failed. And I also just didn't memorize it well. Like I

369
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,800
think I just forgot a lot of it and I was so nervous. Yeah. Yeah. Um, here. Okay. I

370
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,880
got it. It's a, I'm like, should you read it to make up for it? Yeah. So let's see if

371
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,000
you can handle it now. I hear yourself of your say, take it from, right? It's, it's

372
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,400
this paragraph and then, and then the next would be this amazing set. Do you think they'll

373
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:06,160
hire me if I do a job? Anyone's listening from universal, uh, from the university, you

374
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,600
need a job. So one of your, one of your former, one of your best, a former valedictorian is

375
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,160
recommending this exciting new voice, Justin Michael. And I think you should hear this.

376
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:23,920
All right guys. Uh, imagine that we are, uh, you know, heading up, we're making our way

377
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,200
up the hill toward the psycho house for some reason it says that, but then now coming up

378
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,440
one of the most impressive movie sets ever created the spectacular crash site from Steven

379
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,040
Spielberg's war of the worlds. We're going to take you right into the heart of this colossal

380
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,720
set, stopping our tram for a few moments to allow you to get some amazing pictures. So

381
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,680
hang on tight and have your cameras ready. Wow. You zoom into this carnage plane crash

382
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,040
in the neighborhood. Yeah. This is clip 83 or 84. Yeah. Either way I have a dealer's

383
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,840
choice. I, I'm assuming though, the only difference would be that the script now says, what do

384
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,960
you think Jimmy? And then we cut to Jimmy Fallon and he says like, Whoa, the plane crash.

385
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,240
That's crazy. And then he's in a leather jacket screaming my kids or he's doing the risky

386
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:17,920
business cruise dance. Can I say what's in here in between? There's some direction. Do

387
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,280
not underlined bolded, point out mother and do not mention the psycho houses you drive

388
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:29,560
by. What you make your way around the house. And as the were the world sets, W O T W, uh,

389
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,960
that's coming to view. The only sound should be that of the music, nothing more. All caps.

390
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,720
See, this is that legal shit. I think, I think the script had been approved by team Spielberg

391
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,880
and you could not, but now I don't remember what my problem with what you just read was,

392
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,680
but it was something like, is it amazing pictures or is it eye popping pictures? Like the adjectives

393
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,480
were so hard to keep straight in my head. And I was worried. They told you, you could

394
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,240
be secret shopped any time that you're doing this to me. And so you were always afraid

395
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:04,960
at this point, these, this startling experience will allow you to get some dazzling photos.

396
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,160
No wrong fire. You just get thrown off the tram in the middle and it careens into the

397
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:15,600
earthquakes. Share is an ejector chair. You fall into falls. Like, okay, I have a couple

398
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:22,040
with the first off, um, that were the world's movie is not very good. Second off, uh, okay.

399
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Until like the last 40 minutes. Sure. Yeah. Well engineered engine of terror. Okay. Um,

400
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,200
do you think that Spielberg, uh, and his cohorts were like, do not talk about psycho house

401
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,040
or mother because of there's that famous anecdote where Hitchcock was too embarrassed, did not

402
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:46,720
want to meet Spielberg. Do you know, this is a jaws thing. Hitchcock did a voice in

403
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:54,000
the original version of like the jaws portion of the studio tour and Spielberg wanted to

404
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
meet Hitchcock when he was still alive. And Hitchcock said, I am too embarrassed. They

405
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,600
paid me a million dollars to do a voice on the studio tour ride and I feel like a whore.

406
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,960
What? Yeah. I even know what is this story. I don't know how these things connect. He

407
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,800
was too embarrassed to meet Spielberg. What? Because he felt like a sellout for like being

408
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:25,000
paid so much money to do a chunk of Spielberg's all over the tour. Why would that be a problem?

409
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Ron Howard later was the host of it. Uh, those, those, uh, those walls have been knocked down.

410
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,040
Directors can be all over the tram. Even if you're Steven Summers writer, director of

411
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,560
the mummy, who I remember my joke on the tram was always to he like, he's putting the finishing

412
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:48,480
touch on a model and uh, of like a tomb or something. And then he comes at hi, I'm Steven

413
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,000
Summers, writer, director of the mummy. And then I would stop it right there as if that's

414
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,680
what the entire clip was. I'd set it up like, and now right, Steven Summers writer, director

415
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,280
of the mummy. Hi, I'm Steven Summers writer, director of the mummy. The end. We're live

416
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,720
remixing like a YouTube clip. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Essentially. Yeah. You could

417
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,240
create your own cues that you had a lot of flexibility as a, as a guide, but here I am

418
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,520
making you jealous of the, the, the, the so many fun audio visual opportunities. I went

419
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,600
on that ride so much as a kid, I wet, cause I had a season pass in between every, so I

420
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,920
went on it over and over and over and over. So I think I was so, it was this lofty thing

421
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,240
to me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, like SNL, like the ultimate stage. That was my SNL.

422
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,880
I found the story. Jason's correct. It's a crazy story. He says, uh, Spielberg tried

423
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,960
to meet with Hitchcock many times over the years. And then, uh, according to Bruce Dern,

424
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,920
who like had tried to make the meeting happen, Hitchcock was like, isn't that the boy who

425
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,600
made the fish movie? I could never sit down and talk to him. Uh, because I look at him

426
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,100
and I feel like such a whore replied Hitchcock because he's the voice at the universal studios

427
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,000
theme park. They paid him a million dollars. I took it and I did it. I'm such a whore.

428
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,960
I can't sit down and talk to the boy who did the fish movie. I couldn't even touch his

429
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:16,200
hand. I don't know. Really even know why. British manner, like weird, you know, it's

430
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,680
crazy. I don't even quite understand what he's talking about. I kind of don't either,

431
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,640
but then he's being passive aggressive too. It sounds like he's calling it the fish movie.

432
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,920
You were the name of the movie. This was the most popular movie when it came out. This

433
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,640
was the time where when movie actors would do TV shows, they were slumming it. Right.

434
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:38,520
It was true. That's true. He was an old creep. Yes. Yeah. He was a weird man. Yeah. Oh, no,

435
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,640
we definitely had some, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's some creepy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

436
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,600
Just I think, you know, the good people at audible, the good man, Alfred Hitchcock. What

437
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,600
more does it want to offend people of Japan and doesn't want to offend Alfred Hitchcock?

438
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,080
It's understandable. It was something else in the script. Oh, just that you did write

439
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,520
down in pencil, amazing and incredible. It looked like the words were. I did. It looked

440
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,400
like you wanted to remember. That's right. This is a real problem I had was remembering

441
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,400
that it's an amazing set for an incredible scene. This you fell into the worst trap in

442
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,080
it possible in a tour guide audition. I feel like this is like this is some like this is

443
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,680
Marin failing his Lauren meeting because of the so there was some monkey comments. Sit

444
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,680
down with the Lauren of Universal Studios. Yes. Mike Sington, head of the tour, Mike

445
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:38,080
Sington, if you're listening, we may have to sit down, repair, repair the damage. Jason,

446
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,120
what's all this about then? He'll say, how far did you get in the process of the audition?

447
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:48,600
Oh, I waited the three hours for the first round. Yeah. They really treat you like garbage.

448
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:58,920
Well, this was also 2008, 2008, 2009. I think I tried two years like recession time. So

449
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,720
there were they said there was three times more than they normally was. And that's a

450
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,520
fun job to have. So yeah. And I got to the like, all right, we're going to start the

451
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,640
timer at a minute. When you hear a ding, you're done and you have to just pitch yourself.

452
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:19,180
Whoa. And they didn't prep you for that moment at all. They told us that's what it was going

453
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:24,160
to be. Okay. But they're like, by the way, we'll let you finish the sentence. But like

454
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,880
the ding is the ding. You know, they weren't giving you a lot of leeway. Ding is the ding

455
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,820
thing. So you did. So you made it to that and that was it. Yeah, I did. Do you remember

456
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,600
how you pitched yourself? I just talked about like, because I had done a bunch of UCB classes

457
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,360
and some shows at that point. And I talked a little bit about that. I talked about going

458
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:52,440
to Orlando. You lost him. You wasted valuable time. UCB. Berkeley. That applies. Interesting.

459
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,440
Yeah, that is probably. You just got done explaining the curriculum of UCB 201 and they

460
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,760
were like, Ding, I'm up. Save it for your therapist in 10 years, buddy. I was about to tell you

461
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,720
about who also times you and says times. Don't you want to hear about group games? Well,

462
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,640
all right. I'm going to vouch for both of y'all. Let's get let's get Justin and Jason

463
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:23,520
some jobs. You now and now in your mid thirties. I'm sure this is a perfect job to have and

464
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:32,360
not a depressing. I would happily do it once. Yeah, that's why I always say that if I could

465
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:38,280
do it like once the once a summer, I'd be so happy. What a what a fun thing. Yeah, I'm

466
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,000
trying to figure out how to also to put it in SNL terms because truly, you know, the

467
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,440
tour is the you know, it's it's the the ultimate stage. Yeah, I could come back and host quote

468
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,560
unquote. That's what I want. You know, I did my time like, you know, I'm not. You could

469
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,880
become a recurring host. You'd be like a Baldwin or yeah, Tom. I want to be the Alec Baldwin

470
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:07,480
of the Universal Tram Tour. You can quote me on that. Well, anyway, I'm sorry. Yeah,

471
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:15,120
you really you fell into such a trap here. But I well, I also I imagine another job you

472
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,840
might have enjoyed that we all might have enjoyed is being a skipper in the yes in the Florida.

473
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:25,360
I wanted to have that job so bad. Yeah, yeah. I know a friend of the show, a friend of the

474
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:33,680
show, Bugman, also a long aspiring guide. I'm not sure why he didn't. He was down in

475
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,320
the Florida area. That seems like an easy slam dunk for him. I'd love to see him do

476
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,000
it now. Oh, yeah. Oh, gosh, I would. Oh, man. Maybe he'll do it on the show. Maybe it's

477
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:51,040
only simulation. But anyways, well, how do we how do we tackle this thing in general?

478
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,240
I mean, well, like to touch on the universe, to touch on the Hollywood version, first of

479
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,880
all, you might have the same thing as me where you go to Disney for the cutesy stuff. But

480
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,720
if you want to get scared, you go to Hollywood. Yeah, I was like even by the time I was brave

481
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,400
enough to do it, I still was very scared of the main tour attractions of King Kong of

482
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,200
Jaws and of earthquake. Yeah. What if I were to tell you I have a quote about that exact

483
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:26,360
topic? Let's hear it from a book. So I pulled a bunch of quotes from the book Universal

484
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:34,400
versus Disney, the unofficial guide to American theme parks, greatest rivalry by Sam Genoway.

485
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,640
And there's a large portion of this book about Universal Orlando being opened. And one of

486
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,820
the designers let me find this here. So there are a lot of designers talking about how,

487
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:53,200
you know, Universal Orlando opening was a disaster on a lot of levels. But they they

488
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,200
were really jacked up to work on it. This is Peter Alexander, former Universal head

489
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,960
creative. Alexander had worked at Disney and had learned quote, The thing about Disney

490
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,000
was it was very soft and family, but it was big production value. It is kind of nice,

491
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,080
but it doesn't have any edge. Finding that edge was how Universal was going to win. Terry

492
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,680
Winnick was confident. He said the Pirates of the Caribbean is for wimps. Climbing the

493
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:27,060
treehouse. That's for wimps. Space Mountain. No big deal. We got King Kong. We got earthquake.

494
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,120
We got back to the future. We got jaws. We are going to terrorize these people. These

495
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,400
are going to be rides that are going to scare the it just says expletive. I'm assuming it

496
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,240
means shit or fuck. We're going to scare the shit out of people. This is not for wimps.

497
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,840
Wow. We bullied into going to this party. I was a nerd for sure. Still am. Technically

498
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:56,760
the definition glasses. It's true. That's the full definition. Then you know, excitedly

499
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:03,720
about a thing that I love. That's more geek territory. I feel like this is how in the

500
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,160
early days of Universal doing more themed entertainment, at least internally they were

501
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,560
like, yeah, we're fucking jacked. Yeah. That guy seemed like he just did a bunch of cocaine

502
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,960
and ran up to a podium or something. A lot of this seems like, so much of this, and the

503
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,960
story is about trying to open to MGM to a lesser extent. Like it seems like, oh yeah,

504
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:35,000
1980s cocaine. Okay. So everybody involved, you were, or at least the leads of the Disney

505
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,360
MGM, Universal turf war, uh, that cocaine was a major player. I mean, I, I, it could

506
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,440
have helped. It seemed like a lot of long nights. Like Saturday night live. Some of

507
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,440
the material in the early days was fueled by coke. Oh, it's aged so well. It's aged

508
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,080
so well. What if there was a ride where there was an earthquake, man, you can't come up

509
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,480
with that stuff without being on drugs. We are going to terrorize these people. I love

510
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:07,240
that. That's so funny. That's something. Um, well, and I also, it seems like the Universal

511
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,800
strategy also became like, what if a, what if a big thing jumps out at you? And Jaws

512
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,600
is the first one of those which led to King Kong, which proceeded the T-Rex and in Jurassic

513
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:25,200
park. Uh, um, I think the, I think the, the jaws on the Hollywood tram tour is like a

514
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,120
crucial moment in the development of, of universal because it's the free, it's the first Spielberg

515
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:35,760
property. It's really the first like original thing based on a specific blockbuster, uh,

516
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,120
a film. Uh, they, I think they, I was looking up, what did the tram have up until then they

517
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:48,560
had the flash flood and they had the avalanche, but those were not a property and jaws is

518
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:55,240
this, this massive game changing. So their first IP kind of based. Yeah. Yeah. And now

519
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,840
Disney is kind of equally IP. I mean, always was cause it's the, you know, they're all

520
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,360
the rides are based on the animated films, but like, you know, yeah, uh, the current

521
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,960
seventies, eighties blockbusters jaws is kind of the first strike in that, that world being

522
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,400
having a presence in the park. It did seem cool. Like universal, like it was cool that

523
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,040
they had all of these IPs at the time, whereas now I'm bummed that everything is completely

524
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:23,120
IP riddled. Yeah. And I miss the days of having just a generic, you know, expedition Everest

525
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,800
or something. Right. Like when will we get that again? Right. Oh, well that the answer

526
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,720
to that is maybe never or when there's like a giant new park and they can like make one

527
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:37,640
of the rides in the new park, a non-specific thing, but probably like a new ride, one off

528
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,480
for a new land. It's always going to be IP early for like the next 20 years. I mean,

529
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,600
that seems like two, when, when is universal going to dial back on screen rides? The answer

530
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,560
is, oh, when they have to make a whole new park and they got to switch up the tricks

531
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,240
at least a little. Hopefully that's coming soon. The rumors say, you know, a couple of

532
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,880
years. Yeah. But that's the thing really about jaws. That's so cool is that, I mean, the,

533
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:08,680
the, the tram originally, and then the Florida one, uh, that you're in physical environments.

534
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:15,200
And in the case of Florida, a huge physical environment that lake is massive and twists

535
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,040
and turns. And there's the indoor section and several outdoor sections. Um, just like

536
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,680
the, the, the place making there is very impressive. Uh, it's, it's really, it's kind of like

537
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,880
universal's answer to the jungle cruise. Yeah. That's what I love about it is that it feels

538
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,760
like a theme park ride, a theme park nerds twist on a, like an old favorite. Uh, it's

539
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,680
like, let's do the scary version of the jungle cruise. It's going to basically look like

540
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:46,360
the same kind of boat start as innocuously, but then things will go wrong and the animals

541
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,740
will actually attack, which I love. I mean, it's just like a series of like horror movie

542
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:59,040
set pieces. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it gets genuinely scary. Yeah. Uh, the heat is very

543
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,040
hot. Uh, I don't want to, I don't want to go out of order here, I guess, but, uh, but

544
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,400
the, you know, the, the final state of jaws is so crazy. Yeah. Um, well, the stories about

545
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,240
making the heat are crazy where they would like, all right, I'm going to get in the boat,

546
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,000
turn the fire up as high as it can go. We read the same article. Yeah. And then dial

547
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,040
it back just a little. And it's so hot. Like my brother came off once, like very upset

548
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:32,000
at how hot it was. And people were convinced for years. I got burned. I got hair, like

549
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,640
it seems my hair, which is like partially a mental trick. And then one thing I read

550
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,560
was like, you also have to remember a lot of people don't put on enough sun tan lotion.

551
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:45,960
So a lot of people were sunburned and then had intense heat thrown at them. So their

552
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,800
brain thinks they've got like third degree burns, right? Like, yeah, it was crazy. Oh,

553
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,480
I'm sorry. I just also the, the, uh, the petroleum used to make these fires, uh, apparently cost

554
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:05,600
universal studios, $2 million a year. Wow. And they shut it down. I, in 2005 to like

555
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:12,160
2007, it only ran seasonally, like when it had the most crowds because Florida had hit,

556
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,720
been hit by hurricanes and gas was so expensive down there. It was just not, it didn't make

557
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,600
financial sense for them to ride jaws. But everyone got mad at them because they're like,

558
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:30,240
we like jaws, we're on jaws. We want to be burned alive. I went, it's to leave the Marines,

559
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,240
but bring back the gasoline. Like, I think that was the first time I went on that ride

560
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,240
was when they had no fire effects. Oh, interesting. I read about it because I was like a rabid

561
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,080
little theme park nerd and I was like, I can't wait for this part because it's supposedly

562
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,800
like the largest still largest controlled fire and a theme park ride. Really? Is that

563
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,880
like that moment? That's like the, I dunno, like it's right before the climax of the ride,

564
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,720
but it feels like the biggest effect is, you know, like whenever the sharks bumps into

565
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,720
some like gas tanks or something and then he attacks it and it like, there's a ring

566
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,520
of fire that looks like it surrounds your exit essentially. Yes. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

567
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah. I was always under the impression that fire is caused by the, uh, skipper firing

568
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,080
a grenade at it. And that might be it. I don't remember, but it was always hard to tell.

569
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,280
It was always, it was a lot going on a lot of commotion, even in like the videos I watched.

570
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:28,320
It was hard to tell. Um, can I read one other little part of the, the, to talk about Hollywood

571
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:34,440
again? I should say in our group texts the other day, I was debated cause Scott was like,

572
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,760
Oh, we're including Hollywood. And I didn't even think about the studio guide stuff, but

573
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,240
I was like, well, there's so much with Orlando. I don't, we have the time. I think one leads

574
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,840
into the other. And I also think I have a big book of green loosely paper that I've

575
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,760
been waiting to bust out for a long time. And you're right, some is blue and some is

576
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,720
salmon. Um, you know, among the other things in the, uh, I forget what all the colors are,

577
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,320
but some of the other things they give you as a guide is just a list of all of Universal's

578
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:08,400
movies and TV shows, which I don't know what a horror has transpired on your tram where

579
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:15,120
you are stuck somewhere and having to resort to. Well, um, you may also remember, uh, semi

580
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:22,600
tough from may 1980 with Bruce McGill and David Hasselhoff. Uh, that's of course they're

581
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:30,800
on the same time as stone with Dennis Weaver. Also one season. Oh, good. Okay. Stone fan.

582
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:40,640
Uh, more stone info, please. I don't think I have any, uh, throws a cup at my head. How

583
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,280
did you make it from so far away? That was three cars back. They passed it up to you.

584
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:53,320
I'm car by car. Um, so I also have in front of me, the script of the experience. And one

585
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,560
odd thing about it is that really both of them, the interaction of, of the shark and

586
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:04,340
fire, however it happens, is it a gas tank that dips into the water? Is it a gun being

587
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:10,480
fed? The idea and in the films, the idea that the shark can trigger explosions and stuff

588
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,720
is so odd and forced, but so delightful. And just from the actual script, um, you watch

589
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,960
the guy. So, so you pull up, there's a police diver in the water, making sure that there

590
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:29,160
are no more sharks and that you can pass through and view this empty lake without incident.

591
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:34,560
But he gets eaten and blood gurgles up. Uh, so you were supposed to say, I have an idea.

592
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:39,880
Why don't we just pull up next to that gasoline tank stage direction with approved sarcasm?

593
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:48,160
I'm sure we'll be safe there. Um, I really like that. Like the lack of edginess of the

594
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:54,960
scripts to where that has to, we do, we will allow it. You can comment on it. Um, but then,

595
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,240
then what transpires is the strange. He takes a yellow barrel, which then triggers like

596
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,720
a gas pump to start spraying everywhere and explosions go off and, uh, you tilt towards

597
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,840
it, right? Like, yeah. Kind of like breaks a little bit and you slide down. Yes. Although

598
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:15,360
I've heard that that has been, it's been on tilt a five, which is a complaint apparently

599
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,680
because it was serious part. Yeah. Cause like the shark would jump at you as you were like

600
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,540
much closer to it. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it brings everybody closer down into it

601
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:30,920
and gives people on the other side, a better view. But I used to pick my best seat, uh,

602
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:38,360
based on King Kong and jaws. You gotta go on the right side. Second car. Okay. Why second

603
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,240
car? I don't know. It's just where it would stop. So you'd be right with Kong. Like if

604
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,440
you were in the first car, you were too far. Might be a little ahead of it. Second car

605
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,680
was at least like the first half. This is when it King Kong was, uh, the big animatronic

606
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,120
Kong that they ended up turning into confrontation before they burned down mysteriously for insurance.

607
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,200
Right. Exactly. Example of finding if there were like where the rumors from that started.

608
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,520
Cause I remember hearing about them burning it down for insurance or that like even that

609
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:11,040
the Kong ride was too expensive. Well, there's a joke on 30 rock about it. Uh, and then there

610
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:18,960
are, I forget there's web websites, bumper car boys and a Ferris wheel.net. And I think,

611
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,040
I mean, stuff like that, I think is when I was, I was, I was still looking for an original

612
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:28,400
original print of what dreams may come that that burned in the fire. Yes. I just remember

613
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,860
there was a list of like half a dozen original prints they lost. And the only one I remember

614
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:38,920
is what dreams may come down in the back plot fire. Was it an, cause it's, it's singed like

615
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,600
one of the warehouses to like one of the storage warehouses to film vault. Yes. The original

616
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,280
real will walk through the underworld looking for its way back to the land of the living

617
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,940
so it can be viewed again. The joke was on 30 rock that that theme park fire didn't destroy

618
00:51:53,940 --> 00:52:00,960
the stuff we wanted it to. Um, but then also like within a year they were like, oh, we

619
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,560
got a new King Kong ride ready to go, which is I think a big reason everyone was very

620
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:10,520
suspicious about that. Well, that's pretty coincidental that King Kong burned down. Oh,

621
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,120
but Peter Jackson's here to introduce a new skull Island. Y'all like screens. Yeah. Sure.

622
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:25,680
How many y'all like screens? Oh yeah. Look, stone and screens. Uh, yeah. Also that like

623
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:31,600
that there was a property that burnt down where there was a new one recently as opposed

624
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,720
to earthquake burning down or what have you. Interesting. Right. Suspicious. We don't know.

625
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,400
I don't know. We don't know. We don't know. It's rumors. We're not necessarily, we're

626
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,400
not typically a conspiracy theorists. I guess the fact that I said bug main is making us

627
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,340
go to the last time phony enough. The last time I was on this tram tour, I was sitting

628
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:55,280
next to bug main. Yeah. Interesting. And we, right before the jaws section, we both kept

629
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,160
going up. The shark isn't working. The shark is cause they keep doing, they keep playing

630
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,200
that over and over again about how the shark isn't working. I'm looking right now at clip

631
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,480
number 67. The shark isn't working. Which Richard Dreyfuss, the shark isn't working.

632
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,880
He gets even more nasally because he's, he's already nasally Richard Dreyfuss and then

633
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:22,120
he goes more nasally to be an intercom. He's not working. And then at the end, well, one

634
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:26,320
of my favorite things to say on the tram, in case you're wondering, Bruce, the ferocious

635
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:33,000
man eating shark was named after Steven Spielberg's attorney. I remember they had been saying

636
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,600
that since the early nineties. Oh yeah. I went on it as a kid and that is how I learned

637
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,280
that fact. I remember like telling people at school that, and I was like, you know,

638
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,800
it's named after the lawyer. Isn't that funny? We all like lawyer jokes, right? Very little

639
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:56,000
evergreen comedy, but one of the top ones is, ugh, lawyers. Yeah. Yeah. Works for kids,

640
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,080
works for adults. Yeah. So, so you've got this attraction, which is still, I feel like

641
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:08,520
for a long time was Universal's primary iconic attraction. Having that shark pop out at you

642
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:14,440
used in the ending of mall rats. Oh, right. We all, yeah. No, they get married. The Kong

643
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:19,640
was in the wizard and this was in mall rats. Hmm. Interesting. Our two finest films in

644
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:26,560
all of cinema. Double feature at the Egyptian. I also like to say that the shark, the jaws

645
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,400
lake played into what I consider one of the greatest cinematic moments. The murder she

646
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:37,200
wrote. That's what I was thinking. Her bike and Cabot Cove. That's another one. They love

647
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,760
that moment on the tram getting. I know it's one of the greatest generation. They were

648
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,800
also, but how much of that, that zone of the back lot is like three buildings. Right. There's

649
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:53,000
a way nine seasons of murder. She wrote where it was just the theme song. Yeah. I was going

650
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,120
to say it's the opening video of opening the intro and maybe that's it. Yeah. You just

651
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,560
see the shark pop out in the background. She tumbles in and there's a big explosion and

652
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,800
then that's the end of the murder. She wrote. There's also an episode where Jessica's trying

653
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,320
to solve a murder on the back lot. If you were a drama made by universal at any point

654
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,240
in the seventies and eighties, for some reason they found, uh, they would find a reason for

655
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:20,200
the characters like, um, you're going to the back lot this episode. Oh, what part of the

656
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,640
back lot are we using? Oh no, you're using all of it. The back lots playing the back

657
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:32,200
lot. They were MCA was sheepish shit. But also I loved those episodes. Like they also, like

658
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:38,260
the fans love them anyway. Uh, yeah. Miss Jeff on a back lot. Knight Rider did it twice.

659
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:43,480
They did one that I watched before this where, uh, the Hasselhoffs punching somebody and

660
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:48,800
he rips their mask off. And I think it was Robert England, the, uh, doing a cameo on

661
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:54,680
Knight Rider 18 to 18. Oh yes. You're right. Did like 18 ever go to the green planet or

662
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:01,080
anything and maybe tease teacher botanical ride wasn't there yet. It'll be later than

663
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:05,760
nothing ever used that practically. I don't think that's a couple of times. And one of

664
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:11,280
my favorite moments in all of film and television happened in the jaws Lake, which is from the,

665
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,560
the feature film, the Harlem globe trotters on Gilligan's Island. Has anyone seen this?

666
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:22,360
I've never seen it. I want to, I want to give maybe Doug Jones credit or a friend, Doug

667
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:27,640
Jones for possibly having found this, uh, this clip or made me aware of it. But the,

668
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:32,920
there is a part where the Harlem globe trotters plane has crashed, which eventually I assume

669
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,660
leads to them getting to Gilligan's Island and they are stuck in a raft and all they

670
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:43,360
have with them are a bunch of basketballs and they're questioning how will they survive?

671
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:49,960
Especially if something bigger goes awry and then the shark pops out and they're all like,

672
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:56,360
what do we do? And then curly or one of them goes fear, follow my lead. And he shoots a

673
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:02,480
free throw into the shark's mouth and then they all do. And the shark's mouth full fills

674
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:08,240
with basketballs and then it subsides and then you hear it burp. So, you know that it

675
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,040
doesn't desire people. It doesn't choke on basketballs. It just, so they didn't kill

676
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,360
it. They just made him know the burp. Let's you know that they did not choke a shark to

677
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:22,240
death with basketballs with leather in its mouth, but it is like, that's one of my favorite

678
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:27,900
kinds of things is like tortured. How you creating a problem that can only be solved

679
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:35,480
by basketball players. It used to be good. What happened? That's how I felt. I was like

680
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:42,000
all this like mopey ass dramedy about standups being sad or whatever. Like give me a show

681
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,520
where basketball players have to shoot baskets into the mouth of a shark. Why can't things

682
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:53,440
be fun anymore? We can all agree on that. Yeah. I agree. I am more sharks full of basketballs.

683
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,460
I think it is. You can draw a direct line of like, Oh, that Shaw's attraction was a

684
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:03,720
big hit and that led to get them getting Spielberg on board for like, Hey, we want to build a

685
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:09,440
theme park. Like that is the only reason Orlando happened was Spielberg signed on. And then,

686
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,080
you know, they had to figure out like, you know, they had earthquake at that point. They

687
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:19,680
had Kong on the tram tour. How do we expand these like two minute experiences into five

688
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,520
minute experiences? Yeah. I remember that, like that idea blowing my mind having been

689
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:29,400
to Hollywood first and going there. Okay. So there's, so jaws and an earthquake and

690
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,200
King Kong are just these like stops are just part of the tram tour and that they all now

691
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:39,280
are fully fleshed out, uh, uh, full experiences. I was so excited because you know, living

692
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,360
so far away, I guess I did go to Florida when I was really young and I was excited about

693
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,780
like Nickelodeon. I don't think we went on the jaws ride and maybe it was shut down.

694
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:51,680
It happened. Maybe it was like close to when it opened because there's, you know, famously

695
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,720
like how jaws was, you know, riddled with problems. That opening jaws is crazy. The

696
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:03,040
1990 version that only ran for like five or six months and was mostly broken down. But

697
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:08,040
the two effects that I wish still existed. I mean, they never worked or only one of them

698
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:13,040
is the, I guess the finale was the shark would come bite your boat and drag it. And there's

699
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:19,120
some footage of it attempting to do it online. It looks bad in theory. Amazing. Yes. Which

700
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,680
is such a cool, like immersive way of pulling you in. And then they blew them up like the

701
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:29,200
end of jaws with like big meaty chunks. Yeah. Yeah. And the chunks all had to get collected

702
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,080
into some pipe and then, and then, and so that they can be recycled and re-use. Why

703
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,680
didn't this work? Anytime there's these, right? Like this is similar to like the Indiana Jones

704
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,480
effect that doesn't work, which lasted for like a month, which is where, well, it was,

705
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,860
it was when the temple's collapsing, all of a sudden all this rock, like old rock would

706
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,280
fall in front of the car and it would explode because it was ice for, but they like dyed

707
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,000
it with tea or something. And it only lasted for like a month or two. So anytime they tried

708
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,880
to do these cool things, like things that'll blow up and separate, then they have to collect

709
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,480
it or whatever. They just, it never works for some reason. Like they haven't, I can't

710
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:08,560
think of one application on a modern ride like this. Did they do that on the ride? Like

711
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:15,000
was that in a like audience open ride for a couple, a month or two, maybe or a couple

712
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,400
weeks. And somebody there's like one, there's a very, very conspiracy conspiracy theory

713
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:27,400
type video where like their paws circle there. That is that silhouette that you see is ice

714
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,760
falling, simulating a grumbling temple. Yeah. Cause it was a giant like crazy industrial

715
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,600
sized ice machine that would dump ice every whatever 10 minutes or something could fat

716
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:43,160
like freeze ice. It was for vegetables. It was for freezing like stuff on a farm. Like

717
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:48,400
if you had a flash freeze vegetables, it was just a giant freezer or a giant ice maker

718
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,640
essentially. So like, yeah, another situation where it was like, it just at a certain point,

719
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,200
the water pooled and it was a big problem for them to come in and like dig it out after

720
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,960
a while. There was a rumor that when we were kids, that people would say that you could

721
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,480
go through one of the three doors in the beginning and they were like, I went through the right

722
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:10,440
door and I was like always look at, and so like to this day I'm like, so did they ever

723
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:15,320
use the other doors? It seems like they obviously don't use the other doors. Well, they shift

724
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:20,760
them over. They shift them over. Don't they? Can you go through any? It's all the same

725
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,960
entrance. Yeah. It's all the same entrance, but they shift the door over to make it look

726
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,840
like it's a different door. They haven't done it in a while. I feel like I always go centered

727
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:34,240
in the last so many years. They might have retired. The Jaws, the show director, Adam

728
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:40,200
Biesark summed it up this way. You can imagine how complex it must be to get one giant mechanical

729
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:46,680
watercraft to swim up and bite another mechanical watercraft, which is moving with absolute

730
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:53,800
precision hundreds of times a day. That was a thinking, but they tried it. They tried.

731
01:01:53,800 --> 01:02:00,760
God bless the ambition and that it's going to be the sheer acreage and amount of physical

732
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:05,240
space that you're wandering through and multiple water vehicles. I was going to say, doing

733
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:09,920
it in water especially. I'm no engineer, but that to me seems like an extra hard thing

734
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,800
to do. That was the problem with the movie. I mean, it wasn't salt water in the ride,

735
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:19,800
but it's just like, it feels like a very funny thing that should have been obvious. Like,

736
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,400
hey, remember this movie that had horrible set problems? Right. You're going to make

737
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,320
a ride where there are multiple versions of the shark and it has to do it over and over

738
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:34,360
again, but you didn't learn. Also, we have never built water rides before. Universal

739
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:40,520
MCA design, whatever it was called at the time, this was their first attempt at building,

740
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:46,400
not just a theme park, but rides of this caliber. Very ambitious. Wow. It really does mirror

741
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:53,520
the film in a lot of ways. Probably the people you're accusing of being coked up are the

742
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:59,560
people in charge or they're like the mayor. The park doesn't shut down. It got open. We

743
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:07,080
got summer visitors. Another Terry Winnick had been designing MCA attractions longer than

744
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:12,100
anybody and he said it was never going to be ready. That was the same story that Jay,

745
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:17,760
in this case, Jay Stein, former head of Universal, that Jay heard from me every year when I was

746
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,000
all by myself. You are approving it in January. You want me to open it in June and I'm sleeping

747
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,120
in a motor home. My crews are working 24 hours a day. They were all on cocaine. That's for

748
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:33,960
sure. Jay's attitude was we're going to open it because we said we are going to open it

749
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:38,600
and we need to open it and we will fix it afterward. At least Adderall, if not. Was

750
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,640
Adderall around in the 80s? They crushed it up and they just mixed it all together. Lutes?

751
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:47,120
Were Lutes still around? I guess they would chill you out. Well, the Coke would get you

752
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:51,640
out of the Adderall. That's how you would go to sleep in your motor home in a dirt field.

753
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,120
After being up for 72 straight hours, you would take a lute and calm down in your motor

754
01:03:55,120 --> 01:04:02,320
home. What we're saying is the people at the top were concerted active Cokeheads, but the

755
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:07,080
employees who were good people were only forced to do a lot of cocaine in Adderall. I don't

756
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,880
say that if you're a Cokehead, you're a bad person. No, that's a good point. It was just

757
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:14,360
a necessity. They don't have to be an 80s businessman or evil businessman from a movie.

758
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:19,640
They were contractually obliged to do Coke. Yeah. It's just part of keeping up. It's like

759
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,000
having a nice car if you're a major executive. You also have to have a nice Coke habit. You

760
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,640
got to do this. Apparently, the original show writer was Steven Spielberg's roommate, old

761
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:34,880
roommate. Whoa. Which is insane. Yeah. The failed version of it. He was heavily designed

762
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:42,720
in getting Universal Florida open. It's wild. It's crazy. So, all right. Universal opens

763
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:52,760
in 1990 or was it 91? It's 1990. Time magazine called the park Universal Swamp of Dreams.

764
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:59,520
The Orlando Sentinel reported they came, they stood, they left mad. Wow. Wow. So, the big

765
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,760
three, which are all, this is something I find interesting too, that it's these three

766
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:10,440
attractions that are based on components of the tram tour, all of which you get on essentially

767
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:18,760
a tram-esque vehicle. In the case of Jaws, a big multi-robe, kind of pontoon boat earthquake,

768
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:27,400
just kind of literally a tram. Then you're on an elevated train in King Kong. All three

769
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:32,780
of them had gigantic problems. Right. Jaws was the worst by far. The other ones ended

770
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:40,800
up looking better, but still. There was, by the way, to give the whole history, I think,

771
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:46,280
if I'm correct, Universal Orlando, they had broken ground. They had started planting seeds.

772
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:50,320
Then Eisner rushed in and said, ah, us too, we're also doing a studio park. And theirs

773
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:56,280
was less ambitious. They obviously have done this stuff more, so they got it open quicker.

774
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,120
It was probably chintzier, original MGM Studios. And they tried to do that two and a half hour

775
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:08,440
tram with lunch in the middle, and it lasted hardly, barely lasted at all. Did they have

776
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:13,320
Catastrophe Canyon open at launch or no? I think they did. Because that was the only

777
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:18,440
exciting part of that. Exactly. There was an earthquake-esque. But I think they walked you

778
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:23,800
through the costume warehouse. I think they took you around a little more. Maybe. Because

779
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:29,760
I remember always being on the tram. They made it last. All they had was the tram experience

780
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,760
and the great movie ride. And that was what the park opened with. Maybe the animation

781
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:42,040
building. Muppets came later. No, honey, I shrunk the kids. Star Tours? Is that open?

782
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:47,840
Not a park opening. There was nothing there. I don't think about that. We went pretty quickly

783
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:53,120
when it opened, but there's nothing there. But the important thing is they got it open

784
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:59,000
first and Universal was dilly dallying around with these $25 million attractions that were

785
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,600
going to be better and are better than a lot of what Disney ended up having. But they opened

786
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:11,280
late and then they opened full of problems. The PR was really bad. And then they had to

787
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,840
shut down Jaws very quickly. Yeah, confrontation and earthquake. They managed to fix the problems

788
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:24,720
within a few months. Jaws then shut down until like 93. It lasted like five or six months.

789
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,760
So wild that that's how long it had to be shut down. Justin, you think you might have

790
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:33,120
been there in that time? I think so. And there was no Jaws. I remember Terminator 2 was there

791
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:39,180
at the time and not in Hollywood. Oh, interesting. So that's like a key memory, but I was such

792
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:44,920
a little kid. I remember going on the World of Hanna Barbera ride, which was like a simulator

793
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:49,760
with like a crossover of all the Hanna Barbera characters. You can watch it on YouTube now.

794
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,960
Yeah, that's a fine one. Yeah. But yeah, I don't remember going on Jaws as a kid and

795
01:07:53,960 --> 01:08:00,480
I love Jaws so much. So I must. I probably went on for the first time in college. Yeah.

796
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,000
And it was it blew my mind. Yeah, it truly lived up because the new version of it, I

797
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,240
think, is an incredible ride. It's great. And that first version, the bones are there,

798
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:15,000
like the grenade launcher is there, but the skipper is barely saying anything. And the

799
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:22,280
sets are like so not there. They got so much more built out. Like, yeah, by the time I

800
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:26,520
went on it, yeah, they were built out. I guess there's a larger point, though. Like it feels

801
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,880
kind of real. Like a lot of things that makes all of these rides kind of scary is that they're

802
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,000
like in the real world. So like kind of the feeling of like your brain kind of going,

803
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,680
this just looks like a town or like even I mean, not as much on Kong where it's a city,

804
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:42,840
but it kind of like you kind of feel like it's a city. Yeah. So like there's like there's

805
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,360
a feeling of it's a real world, which does make it scarier because your brain is kind

806
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:50,320
of just like taking in information like if you were in really just on a boat. That's

807
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:54,440
kind of what I love about Universal is that they do it with Jaws and they do it with the

808
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:01,040
mummy ride in Florida where they they spoiler, I guess we've we we just talked about this.

809
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,400
Yeah, I think we've talked about it. I think the fake out and it's like the fake. Yeah.

810
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,640
Tendon like, you know, they're going to let you off the ride and then you dive down for

811
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,520
more roller coaster. We didn't know that until we talked about it a few weeks ago. No, no,

812
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:19,520
it's fine. It's a launch coaster. Yeah, probably. Yeah, it's really like a very cool, really

813
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,080
replicated on anything else that I can think of. No, the other mummy is garbage compared

814
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,960
to that one. Yeah, that's that's truly one of the big theme park disappointments I feel.

815
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,720
But now it looks cool to me going to Universal Studios Hollywood because it's like some of

816
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:37,120
the only practical effects they have. Yeah, right. Even even though it was disappointing

817
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:43,560
when it came out. But it is an actual it is a ride that where you move and go places.

818
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:48,320
Yeah, not not screens. Yeah. I mean, the way that those like big whatever warrior mummies

819
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:53,440
jump down on the side of the ride anyway, we're talking about a different ride. Yeah,

820
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,080
the original. This is a ride that lets you know why they went so screen heavy because

821
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:04,240
like, OK, Universal opening day. I mean, it's it's also these big three attractions and

822
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:08,680
their shows. But there's also they opened with ET and they did. And that was the only

823
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:15,200
thing that worked flawlessly. They said, yeah, yeah, right. So you can understand why they

824
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:20,460
stopped trying things of this nature that cost two million dollars a year in petroleum.

825
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:27,000
So they shut down until 1993 when they reopened. Jaws no longer yanked the boat around, although

826
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:33,640
he maybe never did correctly, according to the history. And that to make up for that,

827
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,120
I think that's when they boosted the fire. I think there was less. I think there were

828
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:42,420
not the tanks and everything. No, you don't do their tanks aren't even built like you

829
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:47,700
don't even say I think there's one or two fire or mortar effects. But like it's amped

830
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:55,080
up in the newer version. And instead of him exploding into blood and guts, now he bites

831
01:10:55,080 --> 01:11:02,880
on an electrical wire and electrocutes himself and then descends down and then right on the

832
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:11,640
way out, you get one last burst of a Jaws who is charred and just black burnt flesh,

833
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,960
which is truly disturbing. Yeah, it's like one last. It's like the horror movie final

834
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,800
jump scare like you killed the monster and then it like jerks to life, but then dies.

835
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:27,880
And that's it. Really, it's and it's the ending of Jaws 2. OK, he gets electrocuted. And so

836
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:33,380
the story of the ride takes place around when Jaws 2 is supposed like originally when it

837
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:38,320
opened again. The idea was that you're revisiting Amity and it was like when we had that fateful

838
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:43,680
shark attack a few years ago. Yeah. And so it's like timed around. I don't know if they

839
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:49,080
got rid of that later, but so I was excited because I was like, that's the Jaws I grew

840
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,880
up on more than the original. There's also a self-awareness because they're like there's

841
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,760
Chief Brody's house. He was played by Rush Snyder in the movie, which I always thought

842
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:03,160
was very funny. And rewatching the video now, they said there's there's the mayor's house,

843
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:09,160
which that means the mayor stayed in office even after Jaws. But there's a very funny

844
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:16,680
visual gag where there's Brody's house is like a reasonably sized home and then the

845
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:22,120
mayor's house is a giant mansion right next to it. Like it's like, oh, yeah, of course,

846
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,040
the fucking Larry would have that house. Is the what is there an official timeline for

847
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,120
when the Jaws ride? Is it after the first movie for sure? Is that good? That good? Says

848
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:35,000
that right? And then they when they're talking. Yes. But not before Jaws 2. I don't think

849
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,280
they acknowledge the other movies. They keep up with real time because in the last few

850
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,600
videos I watched the last year of operating, they say there hasn't been a shark around

851
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:50,120
here in 30 years. Oh, I see. OK, so so they only are acknowledging that the first movie

852
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,840
it's a Superman Returns type timeline. Yeah, it cuts out some of the films, all of the

853
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:01,400
films Kevin Spacey as Luthor is on this ride for some reason. He does make an appearance

854
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:07,560
and he goes right after you see Jaws chart. He's like, I'm fine. The final, final scare

855
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:16,840
is Kevin Spacey is able to work in Hollywood, but he is working at the end of Florida ride.

856
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:23,680
So yeah, he's demoted at least a little bit. So and that yeah, that final that chart Jaws

857
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:30,000
is truly that is the kind of thing that really separates Universal from Disney. I don't think

858
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,040
Disney would do anything. There's no chart. Corpses. They want to show the whale chart

859
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:40,120
in the Pinocchio ride. Yeah, they won't even show Ursula being run through by the mast

860
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,560
of a dirty, a dirty mast from a ship. Truly all I wanted was a giant Ursula and the little

861
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,800
mermaid ride that version that they have of like Tony Baxter. Was he involved in making

862
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,960
it? Yeah, or something. There's the you know, the 3D ride through like the previous version.

863
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,000
We talked a little bit about this. Yeah, the little mermaid episode. Yeah, it's crazy.

864
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:05,160
So good. There's a giant Ursula at the end. Yeah, yeah. Gets her what for, you know. So

865
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:09,480
I think, well, just to have a little, you know, this is not the plus up of this ride,

866
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:15,760
but let's I'll say a plus up of every Disney ride as with Jaws with this cool Jaws as the

867
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,960
precedent, whoever the villain of the ride was, I want to see them charred and burnt

868
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,120
and breathing their last gasp like like the Queen Evil Queen on the Snow White ride. We

869
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:29,880
should see her fall. Yeah, she should get electrocuted and then we should run over her

870
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:35,120
with the vehicle. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see her like that in the fall that her limbs

871
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:40,880
are all like gnarled. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Twisted in painful directions. Captain Hook and Smee.

872
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:47,040
Smee was an accomplice. He was. He should have spoken up. Yeah. Yes, he was. Was Smee

873
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:55,480
the Gervals or the Himmler maybe? Huh? That might be for another podcast. Yeah. We'll

874
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:07,240
see. Gervals or Himmler. With Jason shared. The the alligator is France, a villain early

875
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:12,680
on, but then once it's once Vichy France is defeated, it's three joins the allies at the

876
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:19,360
very end of the war. I think that works. Is the alligator ever? I thought he was always

877
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:23,120
bad. Well, the alligator chases after Hook and Smee at the end. Right. Oh, OK, that's

878
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:29,040
right. But he always has the ticking time. He's always scaring Hook. Oh, that's true.

879
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:34,720
Yeah, he's kind of an antagonist. He's like in comic books where like Black Cat shows

880
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,280
up and it's like, you know, you just. She's on. Yeah, it's just like, well, you just route

881
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:43,440
the museum, but you helped defeat Sandman. Right. Right. He's very scantily clad, that

882
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:48,800
alligator. Yes, very sexy. He's portrayed in a way that's inappropriate. He's a thought.

883
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:54,560
Yeah, that alligator is a thought. Well, anytime you want to map a ride and its components

884
01:15:54,560 --> 01:16:02,200
onto a war or vice versa, they're all metaphors secretly, which is what you'll keep revealing

885
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:08,320
through. Yeah, sure. Yeah, it's all history lessons. Jaws is the Kaiser. The shark is

886
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:16,160
the Kaiser. Chief Brody is the Americans finally getting into World War One at the very end.

887
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:23,280
Well, what have we what have we not talked about? Oh, the lawsuit. Oh, yeah, that's right.

888
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:29,040
Oh, that was another thing that happened in the first several months of being opened before

889
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:36,480
it closed for several years. So it's a universal sued ride and show engineering ink who built

890
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:44,240
the first version of the ride and had done work for them before. But it seemed like the

891
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:49,360
lawsuit went back and forth between Universal and this ride show and engineering ink of

892
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,800
like they didn't use waterproof parts. It's like we did use waterproof parts. We didn't.

893
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,640
You didn't test it enough. And I think it's the problem in the movie. Yeah. Right. They

894
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:06,560
weren't able to test it enough. So like the skin kept falling apart anyway. Wow. It perfectly

895
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,840
overlays even more perfectly than the Hitler stuff. I don't know. I think they're on equal

896
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:18,840
ground. It seems like, though, it did rule in Universal's favor and there was a good

897
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:24,560
thing the little man one. Yeah, that was an argument. That was an argument of the defense

898
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,800
was that like it's just this big corporation taken on. We're just two little guys in Orlando

899
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:36,200
and they're coming after us. So it sounds like a disaster all around. Don't forget the

900
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:43,800
other lawsuit, the lawsuit by the man. Yes. Yes. By truly a little guy who fell into the

901
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:51,000
water. I don't know about this. Yeah. Someone was leaning against the boat rail, which fell

902
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:58,800
off and he fell into the water in front of his children who started screaming, the shark's

903
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,400
going to eat daddy. And sure enough, he fell off in most of the ride. It's about four to

904
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:10,280
five feet deep of water. The parts with the shark are 10 feet deep to hide the animatronics.

905
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:16,360
He fell off in the 10 foot section, turned around to see this shark coming at him and

906
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:21,000
they did get him back in the boat and everyone clapped because they thought it was part of

907
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,560
the ride. But then he slipped and fell again. He fell back in a second time. There was a

908
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:33,140
banana peel that they forgot to take off of the boat. Why did universal insist on this

909
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:40,320
banana stand? Okay. And bananas. It's like a cartoon like Mr. Magoo goes to Universal

910
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:48,720
Studios. Size will pay out to that family. And not not the only size will pay out. The

911
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:56,160
duck stops. Did you guys come across the duck stops? No. Okay. So did you there was an AMA

912
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:01,960
with a former skipper on Reddit a few years ago and he would he told stories. He posted

913
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:06,800
pictures of the ride controls. Here are the ride controls. It looks like an ancient ATM.

914
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:12,520
Okay. Crazy what they used to run. Oh, like right off of your phone is probably as powerful

915
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:20,400
as like these consoles. Okay. The duck stops. You know, they talked a lot about like there's

916
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:26,760
a lot of emergency stuff involved. Like all these skippers had a line on them where if

917
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:31,960
they fell out of the boat or something happened, there's an emergency stop hooked to their

918
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:40,080
back of their belts. So they fell in the water. Everything would shut down. But the duck stop.

919
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:46,640
Here's what happens. Okay. In the spring, the lake could be filled with duck families

920
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,720
for whatever reason, ducks and ducklings would always hang out in this body water despite

921
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:57,840
the loud noise and the explosions and stuff. One time a duck swam right over a mortar as

922
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:03,080
it went off, sending the duck flying into the boat, bouncing off the canopy and falling

923
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:09,760
dead and mangled in the lap of a little girl. With the girl thinking the skipper shot the

924
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:16,320
duck with that 40 millimeter grenade launcher. Separately. He's also getting some hunting

925
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:22,640
gun. Yeah. The family was compensated greatly by guest relations and we were thus authorized

926
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:28,680
to perform duck stops or e-stops for duck safety to avoid a similar incident for occurring.

927
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:32,840
Oh my gosh. The story was thereafter included when training new skippers about emergency

928
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:37,920
stop procedures. There's a Pixar movie about a family of ducks that grows up on a horrifying

929
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:44,680
Universal Studios ride. Oh yeah. Where like they believe this to be like part of the ecosystem.

930
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:49,920
And then one gets murdered? Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, in every Pixar movie you see a brutal

931
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,560
murder. Oh, okay. Mangled corpse. It's like kind of like the first 10 minutes of up, but

932
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:58,840
worse. Yeah. Oh, or the scene in the, uh, the good dinosaur where the father dinosaur

933
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:05,480
gets washed away by a flash flood. That was a brutal movie. It was, uh, not good. The

934
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:10,160
closest I've ever gone to walking out of a movie. Was the good dinosaur? Was the good

935
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:15,080
dinosaur? Yeah. It's bad. It's rough. I haven't seen it. I walk out of movies all the time.

936
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:19,520
It's great. It's a lot of fun. I buy a ticket just so I can walk out. It gives me power,

937
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:24,240
a sense of it at least in this crumbling world. It was honestly- He's telling me what to do.

938
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,320
Get out of here. I kept saying like, well, it's Pixar. It'll get better. It's Pixar.

939
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:33,800
It'll get better. And it just never got better. Man. Yeah. You wish you had a, uh, a rifle

940
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:38,880
to take your anger out at the movie. Or a grenade launcher. Or a duck stop. I mean,

941
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:44,000
look, if anyone thinks I'm wrong, look how much good dinosaur stuff is in Pixar Pier.

942
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,640
Try and find any. Case closed. Drop the mic. Lock the gates. I'll add a dry mic sound

943
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:56,680
effect there for you. Um, well, is there more about that? There's also the fact that the,

944
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:01,400
uh, the company got an anonymous tip from the department of environmental protection

945
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:06,440
because they were not disposing of pollutants properly from the ride. You know, like the

946
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:11,400
oil was leaking in a improper way. I would doubt it. That's why they had to, they would

947
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,600
drain it every year in the winter for like a month and shut it down. Cause they would

948
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,920
have to clean up the lagoon and then refill it. And dye the water, which apparently they

949
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,800
did so you could mask the shark being seen underneath. Right. They had to make it darker.

950
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:29,000
Yeah. Wow. Uh, so there's like kind of, you can sort of see a layer of where like the

951
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:35,480
dye is and like where like the density changes. Oh man. So I have some sympathy for the screen

952
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:41,880
ride thing. They're easier. I understand. There was so many catastrophes of like hydraulic

953
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:47,760
fluid, like shot out one, like they had to drain the lay. They had to try and scrub the

954
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:53,080
lake because like it made it look electric. Uh, it was like white looking hydraulic fluid

955
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:58,480
that then made the lake look electric green for like a week. And they, they was like,

956
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:02,800
okay, I think we can run it anyway. It's not hazardous. And they said like after the first

957
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,400
few guests got their clothes ruined when water splashed on them, they're like, all right,

958
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:12,200
we got to filter it more. We got to take a few days and just drain this mess. I was reading

959
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,720
here that the, uh, in June, 1995, following anonymous tip, the company was ordered by

960
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:20,680
the department of environmental protection to fix its improper disposal of pollutants

961
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:24,800
from the ride during those drainages. Yeah. So they would get rid of all that crap, but

962
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:29,080
they would have been like dumping them or whatever doing something wrong. Yeah. And

963
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:35,080
there were, there were all those jaws figures that came to life because of the pollutants

964
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:40,760
who walked out of the water and like started taking hostages in the park. Walk around characters

965
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:45,600
at first and then they willingly walked up and started taking pictures. And that's how

966
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:51,400
they got the idea for the street sharks. Oh, they were walking, talking sharks. Yeah. He

967
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,560
was there. Yeah. He was there and he was like, you know what? This would make a great show.

968
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:59,240
It was incredible. The coincidence that brought us the magic of street sharks. He just took

969
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:04,000
a photo and presented it as, this is just some, uh, drawing I made. It looks great.

970
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,480
Yeah. And universal got no money for that either. And that's the biggest shame. Yeah.

971
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:14,760
I'm on the side of the little guy. So much money on this. I didn't realize this though,

972
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:21,760
a positive about the ride, the ride at full capacity, 2,500 people an hour. So that was

973
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,000
a lot. It was a people leader. They call it. It was a people leader. The average theme

974
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:32,480
park ride, 1800 people an hour. So significantly more people. Bring it back. Bring it back.

975
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:37,760
Get rid of the Harry Potter stuff. Get rid of it. Down. Bringing it back. There is one

976
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:44,600
still exists. Yeah. Japan. You have been Justin. Yes. In the recent past. As we alluded to

977
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:51,680
earlier. Yes. I believe you left your girlfriend in Japan to go to this alone.

978
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:58,840
Yes. So, so John still exists at universal, you know, universal studios, Osaka or universal

979
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:04,000
studios, Japan, which is one of the weirdest theme park experiences. Cause it is, it's

980
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,040
like not, not like, uh, what a Euro, Euro Disney, the second park, whatever the second

981
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:16,480
game is Disney studios, studios bad, but it's like weird. It just is a mishmash. Like their

982
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:25,040
kitty land is like Sanrio, Sesame street and Snoopy Snoopy. Even though it's not here,

983
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:30,200
famously universal. Yeah. And so they, and they have like, they used to be, I feel like

984
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,680
I wish I would've gone a few years ago because it was like a haven for all the dead rides.

985
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:37,120
Like back to the future was still there. ET was still there. I mean, he's in Florida,

986
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:41,960
right. But ET was still there. Backdraft is still there. What? Yes. And it has, it's like

987
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:47,760
the nicest looking backdraft you ever will see. I'm like, why? I it's insane. So I went

988
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,640
on that and T2 3d. Cause I was like, well, when else am I going to go? Which watching

989
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:57,520
the intro for terminator two, I don't know if you remember how long and joke filled it

990
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:05,520
is. Yeah. There is watching somebody do it entirely in Japanese is weird to say the least

991
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:11,680
hour of stuff. Cause it's like a very like chipper, cheery, like woman going like super

992
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:16,720
in, in the American version. So I was like, I have a vague recollection of what this is.

993
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:23,920
But anyway, Marissa was going to something called the golden temple on game for her.

994
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:29,640
Yeah. Well it's like beautiful and you get to take like a maple, uh, I called it maple

995
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:33,720
tree way. Cause I think that's a Mario Kart level, but it was like a hanging tram through

996
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,960
like a beautiful maple forest. Wow. Like it's like a real life experience. And then she

997
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,640
went to like a spa and like, just like the things you do that are culturally appropriate

998
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:49,240
in Japan, actual good experiences to have non trash. Yeah, exactly. I was like, this

999
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:53,260
is the only remaining jobs ride. So I tried to convince her. I was like, you gotta go

1000
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:57,400
on this. Like we have to go like just, we'll go to Osaka for a day or like half a day.

1001
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,760
Like just come with me. We'll go there and I'll do the thing. Like, but we'll fit it

1002
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,160
in. She's like, no, I have no desire to go there. We're here for like 10 days. We did

1003
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:11,400
two days in Disney parks. I had a good time. So we split off and I took a bullet train

1004
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:17,680
to Osaka, which was like their side of the country. It was about an hour and a half on

1005
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:23,920
the bullet train. So we've taken many more hours, uh, not, but we, and I went, I timed

1006
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:31,040
it so they had like a cheaper, like $40 to get in after like 4pm sort of thing. And so

1007
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:37,760
I got there and it was, I went alone to universal studios, Osaka. Uh, they did have a cool macha

1008
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:45,400
churros there. Um, but I went on the jaws ride. I don't know how many times, like maybe

1009
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:50,240
like I rushed to it. Nobody was trying to get to the jaws. No, I mean it was like, you

1010
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:53,320
know, there was a line, but it was barely full. Like people wanted to go on Jurassic

1011
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:59,800
park there or, or, you know, like any of the other rides, I went on it maybe seven times

1012
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:04,240
and like five of them were in a row because I was like, I got to get a good Instagram

1013
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:09,160
video of the shark jumping out of the water. Like the perfect, I'll never see this ride

1014
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:14,320
again. Yeah. Uh, and it got to the point where like I was requesting where to sit. Like I

1015
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:19,680
was testing where the bed, like there's nothing sadder than having to like explain why you

1016
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:24,040
want, like getting a video is like, like when people have cool videos, it feels very cool.

1017
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:28,280
Cause you don't know the behind the scenes of it was like, of course, like you're a tool.

1018
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:33,880
It was like the lamest thing. And to the point where they were like laughing at me. Cause

1019
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:39,480
I was the same guy going on the job. And you still don't need a second seat. No, no, no,

1020
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:47,600
no, no. I'm here alone. I'm very much alone. I mean, look, you gotta pick cause I'm, I

1021
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:53,120
believe the Japan version is the same way. It's identical. So the shark pops up five

1022
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:58,240
times on the one side, two times on the other. So you gotta figure it out. What side, what

1023
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:02,360
side, what's your side? Well, I wanted to get my favorite scene in the ride is the boat

1024
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:08,120
house. Yeah. I think it's like, it's a perfect horror movie ride. Cause first it's happy.

1025
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:12,200
Then you turn a corner and you basically see a sinking like jungle cruise asco, one of

1026
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:16,200
your boats that you're in, you see the fin and it's like the first kind of like spotting

1027
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:20,240
of the shark. Yeah. The two C's. Yeah. That's great. And then you go into the boat house

1028
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:25,160
and you get locked in a boat house with the shark, but it's like to hide from it. And

1029
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:31,120
it's one of the coolest moments, horror moments in any theme park ride, I think, because you

1030
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,760
know, there is the suspense of like, okay, I think we're okay. Let's just like hang tight

1031
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:38,480
and then things start rattling. It's like the shark is clearly in this small enclosed

1032
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:43,240
space with you and then does jump out and there's like a lightning effect and it looks

1033
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:46,400
so cool. And you escape and there's the fire stuff. And then the ending, you really have

1034
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:51,260
no idea within that room where even in watching the video, I didn't recall, I could not have

1035
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:55,880
guessed which side, where he was going to come from. It doesn't feel like it should be big enough to hold the shark,

1036
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:00,160
which is what makes it scary. It's still a little claustrophobic, especially for a boat

1037
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:05,360
ride, which very rarely do you get like stuck in a tiny spot on a boat ride. And so they

1038
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:09,240
have that and I kept trying to get a shot in there, but I didn't have a good enough

1039
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:14,560
camera. I just had my iPhone that barely worked. It was a few years old. So it was just like,

1040
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:17,560
I was like, I didn't want to ruin the ride and like film it with like a flash on for

1041
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:21,640
other people. Cause also everybody was very scared on this ride. You watch the videos

1042
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:25,920
for Florida, I think a lot of the time and people are either the skippers aren't into

1043
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,680
it or if it was like at the end of the rides life, it was, people were just like chanting

1044
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:37,040
shark. Right. Uh, but in Japan, at least the day I went, everybody was very much affected.

1045
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:40,840
Like it was a day one opening of the ride. Also like they keep their rides in impeccable

1046
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:46,280
condition. So like just was perfect. Uh, and so one of the cool things was watching people

1047
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:52,000
get scared every time. That is fun. Which is, I don't know if you guys get, this is

1048
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,520
maybe the saddest thing to say, but I'm like, I really like seeing things that I love with

1049
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:59,640
somebody who's never been on it. Oh, I love it. It's the closest you can get from like

1050
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:04,320
to experiencing this for the first time. This is what would happen if any of us had children.

1051
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:09,680
I, that's part of why I'm like, I maybe I'll have children. But that is in place of that.

1052
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:13,440
I just be like, I started like begging friends of mine, like don't go to Disneyland. I go,

1053
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,840
come on down. And like, I like, I like that. I like taking people to wrestling for the

1054
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:21,440
first time. Yeah. I went to wrestling for the first time with you. Yes. And it was crazy.

1055
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:25,840
Great. Yeah. Uh, so yes, of course I understand that. So that also, you know what? I'll say

1056
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:30,720
this. I don't care for like the flippant people in Haunted Mansion, like not being, not that

1057
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:34,920
everyone has to be scared or pretend they're scared, but everyone does that faux scream

1058
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,760
while they're, when they're in the stretching room, you know, I don't need that. I don't

1059
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:42,400
need people talking along with the narration. I agree with that too. I hate all of this.

1060
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:47,080
You were saying let's official podcast the right edict. If you're listening to this and

1061
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:51,400
you do that shit, cut it out. Cut it out. If you're legit screaming, great. That's,

1062
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,880
I love that. That's fun. If it's your first time, if you're a kid, but I don't like the

1063
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,720
adults pretending to scream when the lights go out in the stretching room. It's usually

1064
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:04,520
teenagers. Yeah, probably. We're anti-teen on this podcast. Definitely. Sorry. Except

1065
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:12,360
for our teen fans. I'll give this, I think I do think is funny in like less concentration

1066
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:17,920
needed parts of the queue, like as you're loading into doom buggies or any dark ride

1067
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:23,260
where the queue's a little dark. If I think it's very funny to see someone with someone

1068
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:27,600
else and they go like, bah, and they scare and someone gets legitimately scared. I think

1069
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:34,400
that is very funny watching strangers scare each other. Little scares. Yeah. That's actually,

1070
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:41,280
yeah. Let's hear that scare sound. I will tell I vow right now and I hope you forget

1071
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:45,960
that. Next time you and I are on the Haunted Mansion, I will scare you with that noise.

1072
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,320
No, I don't want it done to me. I want to witness it. I vow. God damn it. Then maybe

1073
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,080
it's not the next time. Maybe it's not the time after that. Maybe it's in two years.

1074
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,240
It's unpredictable. But what's going to happen is we're going to be getting out of the elevator

1075
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:01,240
and I'm going to go, ah, and then you're going to get scared. This is like an Anton Sugar.

1076
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:06,760
Like if he doesn't find you to death tomorrow, he will find you years from now. You will

1077
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:11,200
not know when it will happen, but I will do it to you. I will scare you after the elevator.

1078
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:16,560
No, God damn it. If you derive pleasure from it, you got to allow somebody to do it to

1079
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:22,320
you. I suppose that's true. We should mention the Jaws ride in Japan is also in Japanese.

1080
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:27,240
Yes. And they were committed. I was going to ask how are they performing? Because I,

1081
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:30,760
yeah, you see some of these videos of the ride toward the end too. And I'm like, I don't

1082
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:36,840
love their commitment to it. I want commitment, commitment, commitment. I can only speak to

1083
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:43,560
the day I was there, but I think there is, I don't know if it's a cultural thing or cause

1084
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,560
I don't know, but it feels like there's an attention to detail in the parks from the

1085
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:53,040
way they're impeccably clean to upkeeping the rides and caring for things to like commitment

1086
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:58,200
to the world that you're living in. And they were every single time, every skipper was

1087
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:03,560
like so intense about it. Like it didn't feel, and also there was a language barrier. I don't

1088
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:08,440
speak the language. So maybe I probably wasn't get it. Like maybe there were bad actors,

1089
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:15,800
but the general language you would have known your Roy Scheider or Brody maybe, I don't

1090
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:21,160
know if they say Roy Scheider, but I think like Brody and Jaws when Steven Spielberg,

1091
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:25,800
those were the English words that appeared at some point, but they were very committed.

1092
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:29,800
And it just felt like, I don't know, I can't imagine that ride is going to last much longer

1093
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:37,320
there. I should go. Oh, the problem is we're only like doing like a seven ish day trip.

1094
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,920
And it's like what you're saying, it's six of them are going to be in Tokyo Disney. Right.

1095
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,360
Six have to be at Tokyo Disney. So how are we going to find that extra day to go to Osaka?

1096
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:51,240
You can skip that stupid ass Marissa Kyoto tram. Obviously nobody's doing that. Natural

1097
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:56,000
beauty. She was like, it turned down a ride to do other rides. I mean, it was beautiful.

1098
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,320
When you came back, she was like, Oh my gosh, I should have gone with you. The thing I went

1099
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:03,560
to today was such a bust. I wish I saw that robot shark. Yeah. I hate it. It was so relaxing.

1100
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:09,720
I really, yeah. It was no fake chard flesh on what I did. I did. I asked her to please

1101
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:14,600
watch the ride through video today before I came here. Cause we were just sitting there

1102
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:19,240
and I was like, Hey, will you at least watch it? Like you've never seen it. You've never,

1103
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:24,040
and you know, I love this ride. It's a reasonable request. Do me this favor. Don't you love me?

1104
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:28,600
Yeah. Well, she likes horror movies a lot. Right. And I think she would really like this ride,

1105
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:33,720
but is it worth it just for that ride for her? Probably not. But for this and like that space

1106
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:39,080
fantasy ride, they have an original coaster. It is great. I get nauseous on spinning things

1107
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:43,880
and it is a spinning coaster. But it's like, I didn't actually, cause I got nauseous on that

1108
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:49,640
crushes coaster. Oh, we skipped that. That line was too crazy. We didn't do it. I felt horrible.

1109
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:55,160
Like it knocked out half of my day, but it has like an animatronic shark in it. It has, you know,

1110
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:59,560
I think Bruce the shark in finding Nemo. That's right. He's Bruce. Yep. As a nod,

1111
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:07,800
a little holly that inside knowledge attorney. I wish you were, I wish you went on the crushes

1112
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:14,920
coaster at the in Paris, but did you feel for jaws while you were spinning around?

1113
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:19,480
I have to do that on every vehicle that goes through well spinning just to,

1114
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:24,200
just because I deliver that joke better than anyone else in, I'd believe it. And on any

1115
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:30,040
continent between you and Steve Slaga, uh, the two people I know, I'll do it. I'll do a Bruce

1116
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:35,320
attorney off with him any day of the week. Let's get him on the show. Let's see who nails it better.

1117
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:41,080
The joke about, uh, jaws is the only fish that can do the backstroke, but

1118
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:45,880
that attorney one that's mine. I've been doing that one for years. I've like, that just conjured

1119
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:52,200
a sense memory. I always wanted to deliver. Yeah. I always wanted to be a skipper wearing that light

1120
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:57,720
blue tee in those jeans shorts. First off, gotta be the most comfortable cast member outfits.

1121
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:02,440
The outfit was something you were like dreaming of wearing. It looked nice. I wanted to, I want it to

1122
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:07,400
look nice. I wouldn't do that. I wanted to say, you know, the best and only boat tours,

1123
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:12,520
Mamity Island, like, you know, you're protected by this 40 millimeter. I tried to get you a couple

1124
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:17,720
years ago. I saw that there was Osaka, Japan, um, like there were auditions for characters

1125
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:24,280
and I tried to get you to audition for Austin powers. They did at least a couple of years ago.

1126
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:32,600
I hate it. I hate it. But maybe that would have been your in, if you would have been Austin over

1127
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:37,080
there for like a couple months, then you could have transitioned to the actual jaws boat ride.

1128
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:40,280
Although I guess maybe they weren't looking for Americans for the jaws boat ride, but you

1129
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:46,600
could have convinced them. I could have, I could have learned just the spiel in Japanese. Oh,

1130
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:52,360
oh yeah. Only those words. Only those words. Yeah. Um, you might be a superstar in Japan by now.

1131
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:56,040
Had you tried to get that. I think that you made a big mistake by not applying for that.

1132
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:00,920
Maybe I am already a stoop superstar in Japan. How do you figure? I mean, I will say when you

1133
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:07,240
come back, when you come back, if people recognize you in Japan, and they only want to ask about

1134
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:12,280
the analytics, we are not that popular in Japan. We have some listeners in Japan. I didn't see a

1135
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:19,880
walk around Sheridan at Universal Studios. I would have rejected him for that. We already got one

1136
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:23,160
Sheridan type already. It was like Ernie Hudson not being allowed to play himself in the Ghost

1137
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:29,720
Busters cartoon. Well, if you're a listener in Japan, please tweet us. Please approach Mike,

1138
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:38,760
but only talk about me. Approach Mike in real life. Jason, if you dreamed of doing that job,

1139
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:45,000
then you got to deliver what apparently is regarded as the most popular line from the ride.

1140
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:50,520
Hey, how many more minutes should we be doing this podcast for?

1141
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:55,640
You aren't taking the bait. You don't know the line. Oh my God. Here it is. Right here.

1142
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:01,880
There it is. I'm making everybody read scripts today. Oh, well yeah. Chief Brody. Well,

1143
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:06,920
I have my favorites. I frankly like the end where they say Chief Brody, you know. Oh, okay. Sure.

1144
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:12,200
He's touching his heart right now just so you know. Do that. He might be having a heart attack.

1145
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:17,160
Chief Brody, clearly not Roy Schneider. Scheider. Scheider. Scheider, excuse me.

1146
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:22,280
He says he'll be there in, hold tight, I'll be there in 10 minutes. And then the skipper always

1147
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:27,640
says 10 minutes, we're going to be shark bait in 10 minutes. Which is they're already shark bait

1148
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:32,680
right now. They're currently shark bait. Yeah, yeah, yeah. True. But there you go. Very good.

1149
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:39,400
Thank you. Some universal property, please hire Jason and Justin. Please hire me while you're at

1150
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:47,240
it. And starting salary for both of you, $35 an hour minimum. That's a great starting salary.

1151
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:53,240
I'm declaring it. Oh, never mind. No, no, no. This is my level. Okay, cool. And I get 10% of that

1152
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:58,200
because I declare it. Finders fee. So universal, call me and I will call Jason and Justin.

1153
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:04,360
And my comment, I guess maybe actually belongs in the section where we talk about plussing it up.

1154
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:10,680
But we're about there. We're about there, I guess. My one complaint is that there's a lot of fresh

1155
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:16,280
faced teens as the skipper on these boats. And if I was planning it out, I would want a very

1156
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:24,040
quint-like boat guy. Yeah. I would want a crusty old man with stories piloting the boat or whatever

1157
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:29,080
you would say driving the boat and then doing all the lines, but it's like, is this guy who's seen

1158
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:34,120
it all or whatever. And he's lost an eye or something to a shark. We need more of that,

1159
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:39,080
I think, if we were going to bring the ride back or let's get some grizzled Japanese,

1160
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:43,000
since there's only one ride left, let's get a grizzled Japanese guy or girl to do it.

1161
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,840
I would love that. Because I couldn't think of how I would plus this. I was like, this is a

1162
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:56,280
perfect ride to me. But having a quint-esque, just USS Indianapolis drunk. Oh, yeah. Sure. And you

1163
01:40:56,280 --> 01:41:01,320
could have a little sip before each ride. So if you get too close, you smell the whiskey on their

1164
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:06,120
breath. That would be a nice extra touch. I wish they could get eaten or something. That would

1165
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:10,840
be... That would never happen. But seeing somebody get taken out of the boat. That was a rumor that

1166
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:16,040
was going to happen on the new Kong ride that was in the blue skies days. The drivers were going to

1167
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:20,360
be automated? Yeah, there's going to be a robot or something and the Kong would reach in and pull

1168
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:24,040
them out. I haven't been on that ride, but I was excited about it. And then it was mostly screens,

1169
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:29,640
right? It's mostly screens. It's a nice Kong at the end. It's exactly the same. There's one or two

1170
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:35,000
more screens. But the only reason anyone is excited about it is that there is a real... There's a head

1171
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:41,800
of a monkey at the end and it's big. I feel like this is the old screen versus practical debate,

1172
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:47,080
but nothing... The screen technology you'll constantly have to update. I feel like there

1173
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:51,240
is something... I feel like Tony Baxter talks about it. There's something impressive about

1174
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:58,040
seeing something in person and the size that it is. A special effect can't beat that.

1175
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:06,680
And there's something about seeing a giant King Kong robot that will always trump whatever screen

1176
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:10,280
version of it. Right. Because it makes you a little uncomfortable. It makes Scott very

1177
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:14,120
uncomfortable because it's a giant robot in a tiny space. But yes, it's like your brain...

1178
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,680
I don't have that problem though. I yelled at Kong every day.

1179
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:19,640
Happily. That's a good point.

1180
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:20,600
That was the highlight.

1181
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,040
Yeah, you like the banana breath.

1182
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,920
Oh yeah, you know it. Yeah, I got high on that.

1183
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:30,840
Did you catch that difference in Japan? When you go in the boathouse in America,

1184
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:34,600
it just says like boat house or like fish and tackle. In Japan, it says quince.

1185
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:40,040
Yes. Which is great. Which is a little morbid because in the real world

1186
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:45,240
of the ride... So did Quint die in this Amity? Like he dies in the movie?

1187
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,120
Well, he... Wait.

1188
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:51,960
Because remember, in this world, you are in Amity. Chief Brody's real.

1189
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:53,400
Right. Maybe it's a memorial boathouse.

1190
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:57,960
Mayor Larry Vaughn. Yeah, that's what I think it was probably like...

1191
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:01,720
Because Quint's dead. Are you saying is Quint not dead or like he would have to be dead if it's

1192
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:03,320
after the first movie? I'm assuming he's dead.

1193
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:04,840
Like why does he have a boathouse there?

1194
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:08,440
Yeah, why is there still a boathouse with his dead man's name on it?

1195
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:11,640
Well, it's Martha Quint. His wife, Martha.

1196
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,440
Oh, that's true.

1197
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:13,240
Okay. Yeah.

1198
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:14,200
Yeah.

1199
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,120
Was his first name Quint or last name Quint?

1200
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:18,440
Is this the... Last name Quint?

1201
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:21,320
Amity from the book where Richard Dreyfus' character...

1202
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:26,360
Does he sleep with Brody's wife or does he try to sleep with Brody's wife?

1203
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:28,040
Yeah, in the book, he's a lot more of a son of a bitch.

1204
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:32,920
There's a lot more... Yeah, Brody is much less likable also, I think.

1205
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,800
Like both... Like there's a lot of like family drama.

1206
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,080
Yeah.

1207
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:40,200
The name of the character is Bartholomew Marion Quint.

1208
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:41,240
Bartholomew?

1209
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:41,560
Yep.

1210
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:43,960
That's an insane name.

1211
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,160
Grim, seasoned shark hunter.

1212
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:50,360
So you want to hear that full name get said in an otherwise Japanese...

1213
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:51,720
Bartholomew Marion Quint.

1214
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,080
Yeah, get on the boat.

1215
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:59,160
If they had him in the queue talking to you instead of WJWS Channel 13,

1216
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,720
the local Amity TV station that played in the queue?

1217
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:02,040
Yeah.

1218
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,560
Oh, the queue did have a lot... I don't know.

1219
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:05,560
I don't remember the queue for Florida,

1220
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:08,120
but the queue here had a lot of Jaws memorabilia.

1221
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:08,760
Oh, interesting.

1222
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,680
So like there was like all the posters.

1223
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:13,720
So like it looked like old stuff that was like passed out,

1224
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,880
like movie lobby cards and stuff.

1225
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,160
Like the crew jacket?

1226
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,000
Yeah, like truly stuff like that.

1227
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:24,600
But then the world of the ride was like what Jason was saying earlier,

1228
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:28,200
like the movie was made based on real events.

1229
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:32,040
The Scream 2 of Jaws, right?

1230
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:36,840
Yeah, you're in real Amity and this is where the movie was filmed

1231
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,480
and where the events it was based on took place.

1232
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:44,440
But now the shark is dead and they're aware of the movie and the success of the movie.

1233
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:48,760
Those... every one of those old Universal rides was something like that.

1234
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,080
Something like that.

1235
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:49,880
It was convoluted.

1236
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:51,080
And I'm here for it.

1237
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:51,880
I loved it.

1238
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:52,520
I loved it.

1239
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:58,520
And was this the first appearance of a fictional local media company like in Twister?

1240
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,960
The storm chasing radio host?

1241
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,520
The station that's only within this attraction.

1242
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:05,320
Yeah, could be.

1243
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:10,920
Yeah, those pre-ride videos, they were like real cheapo public access looking...

1244
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,040
Hey there Amity.

1245
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:13,160
The morning show.

1246
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:14,600
Yeah, I could not find it.

1247
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,480
No one stopped and filmed those and put them on YouTube.

1248
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:19,160
Or if they did, I didn't find them.

1249
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,960
Send us some Hey there Amity if you have it.

1250
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:27,720
Yeah, they have them in Japan, I think, but the line was moving so quickly every time.

1251
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:32,440
I think I lingered once and people were like, why are you stopping? What are you doing?

1252
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,480
This is a boring line.

1253
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,680
What was the merch like at Jaws in Japan?

1254
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:40,440
It was a bummer because I wanted like a cool shirt or...

1255
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:43,400
They had a plush shark.

1256
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,360
That was the only thing and it had like Jaws embroidered on it.

1257
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:49,160
But then they had like a Lego knockoff shark.

1258
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:52,120
They didn't even have like a cool keychain or anything.

1259
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:54,440
Like it really... there wasn't much...

1260
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:58,680
I was kind of disappointed in general with merch across... like that and the Disney parks.

1261
01:45:58,680 --> 01:45:59,480
Like really?

1262
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:04,280
Disney parks... I mean, I think I care much less about like Mickey and Minnie and that kind of stuff.

1263
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:06,120
I want like ride specific things.

1264
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:06,520
Sure.

1265
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:09,320
So I wanted like, you know, Shurikyu Tundu or whatever.

1266
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:15,720
I wanted like the characters, this unnamed animatronic from a very cool ride in Disney Sea.

1267
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:16,760
Oh boy.

1268
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:18,120
I wanted something of that.

1269
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:18,840
There's not that.

1270
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:24,840
They do have a ride vehicle for the ride in question that we're not...

1271
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,880
Oh, interesting.

1272
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:28,040
If you go... and it's hard to find.

1273
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:29,800
So we'll talk about it.

1274
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:30,200
Maybe...

1275
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:30,760
Do you have it?

1276
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:31,000
We don't.

1277
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:31,640
Yes, I did buy it.

1278
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:31,880
Okay.

1279
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,160
That was like the coolest piece of merch that they had.

1280
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:38,760
Everything else is just very generic Disney, but like better designed than out here.

1281
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:39,400
That's what I've noticed.

1282
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:42,920
I have... there's an Instagram account I follow that's just Tokyo Disney Sea merchandise.

1283
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:47,400
And they just post there because this person I think has a business where they go to Japan

1284
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:48,440
and sell it and bring it back.

1285
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,640
And then send it to America.

1286
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:49,960
Yeah.

1287
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:54,760
But they... what I like, and we mentioned it earlier, they have a lot of country bear plush.

1288
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:55,240
They do.

1289
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:59,320
A lot of good country bear stuff, which they do not have in Florida and it drives me nuts.

1290
01:46:59,320 --> 01:46:59,960
They have so much.

1291
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:05,160
I think I got Lindsay... the point was to be shared as a pad.

1292
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:05,720
Yes, yes, yes.

1293
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,280
As a country bear.

1294
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:06,760
I've seen it.

1295
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:07,560
She didn't take it.

1296
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:11,400
She would never be so cruel to keep country bear merch from me.

1297
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:11,640
Yeah.

1298
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,720
So then they have like a little country bear monogram.

1299
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:14,520
Not monogram, whatever.

1300
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:17,800
They have like a logo pad that you can write on, which was kind of cool.

1301
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:22,280
I think in Japan, the way I understand it, culturally, when people go on vacation,

1302
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:27,800
they bring back a lot for friends and relatives and coworkers and stuff.

1303
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:37,400
So there's a lot of broad merchandise, t-shirts and boxes of candy and office supplies and stuff.

1304
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:41,160
Like stuff that's like broad appeal and you would bring back for people.

1305
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,040
They have cookie boxes.

1306
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:44,040
Like cookie boxes and chocolate boxes.

1307
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,160
Just like big kind of gift packs.

1308
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:47,400
Yeah.

1309
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:51,640
Like you would give to you like popcorn tin type stuff.

1310
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:52,120
Sure.

1311
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:52,360
Yeah.

1312
01:47:53,640 --> 01:48:01,000
And is it like a custom there to if you go get a bunch of stuff for the host of a podcast

1313
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,760
that you've been listening to?

1314
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,800
Cheaper as I hope so.

1315
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:08,360
Toiletries from the hotel or various...

1316
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:12,040
A robe from the hotel or just several towels with a monogram.

1317
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:13,800
Skeleton key from the hotel.

1318
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,880
They just have those lying around.

1319
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:16,120
Yeah.

1320
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:16,920
You have skeleton.

1321
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:17,960
How many skeleton keys?

1322
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:20,200
You have just like a Sheraton skeleton key.

1323
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:21,880
I got a lot, but the skeletons on them scare me.

1324
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,480
So I don't open up that drawer that much.

1325
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:25,960
This is a very quick tangent.

1326
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:29,000
Professional wrestler Terry Funk used to have several skeleton keys.

1327
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,480
And in the old days, he would just go to hotels and find an empty room and sleep in them.

1328
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:37,720
And he would save money on hotels by not paying for them and sleeping in empty rooms

1329
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,080
because he had skeleton keys.

1330
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:39,640
Smart.

1331
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:40,680
Tip for you, Jace.

1332
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,160
Yep.

1333
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:43,800
You and Terry Funk, two birds of a feather.

1334
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:44,920
Bring those keys.

1335
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,120
Get less afraid of them.

1336
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:46,680
Yeah.

1337
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:48,760
What else we got?

1338
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:52,040
Any plus it up key businesses?

1339
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:52,520
Yeah.

1340
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,320
Burn to the...

1341
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:59,960
Eventually, the Jaws in a second will burn, perhaps not for insurance money.

1342
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:05,320
It'll just will, given the ecological issues this riot has had, it will just burn to the

1343
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,520
ground at some point in time.

1344
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:07,160
Of course.

1345
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:10,600
Well, first of all, it should still be there.

1346
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,960
We've talked about this a lot.

1347
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,360
It should still be there.

1348
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:17,240
Universal doesn't have a sense of history.

1349
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:22,440
And I think that the core few rides that they had when they opened in the first few years,

1350
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,200
I think that would have been important to the park.

1351
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:27,640
It would have been a nice thing to like Pirates of the Caribbean or Haunted Mansion.

1352
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:28,600
It would have been a nice...

1353
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,760
These are still movies that people know and like.

1354
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:33,080
It's not like these movies have faded into obscurity.

1355
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:35,080
This is an awesome movie.

1356
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:37,240
Faded into obscurity.

1357
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,680
This is an odd one in that like it did.

1358
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:43,000
Obviously, this was a problematic ride to have open.

1359
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,400
It created a ton of issues for them.

1360
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:49,800
But in terms, yeah, obviously, Jaws is still plenty relevant.

1361
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,000
And of all the things to...

1362
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:55,240
You totally understand putting Diagon Alley in there.

1363
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:55,800
Of course.

1364
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:56,520
It's amazing.

1365
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:59,160
It makes all the sense in the world.

1366
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:02,520
But yeah, what a bummer that this of all things had to go.

1367
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:05,240
But I guess it's such a big footprint.

1368
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:11,480
And it was the calculation also like where it is as opposed to the first Harry Potter land

1369
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:13,640
so that they can line up the train correctly.

1370
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:14,680
Yes, probably.

1371
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:16,280
That certainly plays a role in it.

1372
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:19,160
But it's still at the expense of our great history.

1373
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:20,680
That's what I'm saying.

1374
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,520
Yeah, we don't say that a lot.

1375
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:23,320
No, right.

1376
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,080
We're not talking about a Confederate statue.

1377
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,760
We're talking about the Jaws.

1378
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,240
No, I'm at like in terms of the...

1379
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,280
Yeah, I know.

1380
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:30,920
I agree.

1381
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:33,000
We're very progressive when it comes to the theme park stuff.

1382
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,760
PC culture, we got sharks getting ripped out left and right.

1383
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,200
We got to preserve history.

1384
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:41,000
I love this ride.

1385
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,960
Yeah, this one for me is...

1386
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:46,520
This is up there with Alien Encounter.

1387
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:48,840
Fuck, what a lost.

1388
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:53,400
In terms of my favorites that I still think about a lot.

1389
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,320
Because you're edgy, you're extreme.

1390
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:55,880
I am extreme.

1391
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:58,360
You are the bad boy of the three of us good boys.

1392
01:50:58,920 --> 01:50:59,640
That's for sure.

1393
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:00,920
Yeah, that's scale.

1394
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:06,520
It's like if you were to Disneyland and it's like all the cool rides from the first 10 to 20 years

1395
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,840
were gone, except for maybe one.

1396
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:10,920
It would feel less special.

1397
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:14,680
Even if it was the coolest rides, it would be awesome.

1398
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:19,400
But it would still, there would be a little bit of something missing from the nostalgia factor,

1399
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,040
which I understand Universal isn't going for that as much.

1400
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:27,640
But it is nice to have a couple rides that were like at the opening of a park

1401
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:29,480
to give the park some sense of history.

1402
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:34,520
If you were them, where else does Diagon go?

1403
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:36,120
Well, it's tough because I don't know the boundaries.

1404
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:38,040
I don't know what they have backstage wise.

1405
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:38,520
I don't know.

1406
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:42,360
Like I for sure, you could have lost the Men in Black over, you could have lost...

1407
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:44,600
I do like Men in Black.

1408
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,640
Fear factor live.

1409
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:46,440
Sure.

1410
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:47,400
It's a waste of space.

1411
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,520
Is it still there?

1412
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:49,400
It's still there.

1413
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:51,880
It doesn't run as well.

1414
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:52,520
It's cheaper.

1415
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:53,720
Is it on the outskirts?

1416
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:54,440
I can't remember.

1417
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:55,320
Where is it on the streets?

1418
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:56,760
It's around the curve.

1419
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:00,440
So it's sort of like next to Men in Black.

1420
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:04,280
It's what's being eyed for the Ministry of Magic, supposedly.

1421
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:04,840
Oh, OK.

1422
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:05,880
I see what you're saying.

1423
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:06,600
Yeah, maybe.

1424
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:12,200
Get Disaster out of there, which got replaced by Fast and Furious, but nobody likes that.

1425
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:16,600
I say I think they should have, if there was a possible way to do it,

1426
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:21,880
they should have killed San Francisco instead of Amity.

1427
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:22,840
Yeah, sure.

1428
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:23,640
Or like...

1429
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:24,600
Much better.

1430
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:25,160
Switch out.

1431
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:26,920
Switch out or take out all the...

1432
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:28,840
I understand they're like it's going through a lot of things.

1433
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:30,920
There's the rocket roller coaster.

1434
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:31,480
What is it called?

1435
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:32,120
Rip ride.

1436
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:32,760
Rip ride.

1437
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:33,720
Yeah, yeah.

1438
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:35,720
That's a lot of real estate that that's taken up.

1439
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:37,800
Just disassemble that, put it somewhere else.

1440
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:40,360
I think it's cool, but I don't know.

1441
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:41,720
Put it like hide it right there.

1442
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:42,120
I don't know.

1443
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:44,840
It seems like there was something could have been done.

1444
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:50,280
I'm sure they were also thinking, oh good, this new land won't be as hard to maintain

1445
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:51,800
and we'll make a ton more money.

1446
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:52,680
I'm sure both things...

1447
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:53,800
Expensive water ride.

1448
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:57,880
Yeah, I'm sure they could have put it somewhere else, but they were also very excited to get

1449
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:59,320
this albatross off.

1450
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:02,360
I'm interested that there was a new movie because I feel like that's the only way it

1451
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:03,000
would stay around.

1452
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,280
It's like a Jurassic Park, the ride Jurassic World redeco.

1453
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:11,720
Same with Back to the Future, which by the way, when these guys are dead, Spielberg and

1454
01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:15,560
Zemeckis, there will be a new Jaws when these guys are dead.

1455
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:16,680
Oh yeah, it's all coming back.

1456
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:17,720
It's all coming back.

1457
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:22,440
A new Jaws could be no worse than the last couple Jaws movies that were already made.

1458
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:26,360
And it could be your child self's favorite movie.

1459
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:26,680
Yeah.

1460
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:28,840
A new Jaws with like multiple sharks.

1461
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:29,560
Great, update it.

1462
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:31,960
Add a couple shark attacks at once in that boathouse.

1463
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:34,520
The shark is neon green.

1464
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:35,000
I don't care.

1465
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,040
Just keep it.

1466
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:37,080
It's an alien shark.

1467
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:37,880
That's the new version of Jaws.

1468
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,880
Whatever you need to keep this thing around.

1469
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:41,320
Indominus shark.

1470
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,240
Left shark from Katy Perry's Super Bowl show.

1471
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:43,880
There it is.

1472
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:44,520
Can't make it cast yet.

1473
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:45,640
There we go.

1474
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:47,080
Better yet, hosting it.

1475
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:47,800
They're just hosting it.

1476
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:50,280
It's left shark but a grizzled old man in the outfit.

1477
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:53,320
Richard Dragoste's character is no longer an oceanographer.

1478
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:54,760
He's a Snapchat star.

1479
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:57,080
Well, and you know what?

1480
01:53:57,080 --> 01:54:03,000
It's in Japan and if we're trying to keep this thing hip for millennials,

1481
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,240
what better tour guide of anything going on in Japan than Logan Paul?

1482
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,680
I thought Logan Paul'd take your hand.

1483
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:14,280
I thought you were going to say another famous American in Japan, Jason Sheridan.

1484
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:15,960
Well sure, that too.

1485
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:19,240
I am welcome in Japan unlike Logan Paul.

1486
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,040
That's a good point.

1487
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:23,640
I have done nothing yet to anger the people of Japan.

1488
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:27,720
Oh shit, did this shark kill himself on this electrical line?

1489
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:33,720
Logan Paul, yeah, Logan Paul is selfie videoing himself next to the hanging up Jaws,

1490
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:35,640
hanging up Bruce at the entrance.

1491
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:37,320
Oh man, he hung himself.

1492
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:40,200
Oh shit, he fucking hung himself, dude.

1493
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:45,080
There's the shark.

1494
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,160
There's the tie in.

1495
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:48,840
That's how he salvaged it.

1496
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:50,360
You listening, Osaka?

1497
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:52,920
Yeah, call Logan Paul.

1498
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:53,880
Let him back in.

1499
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:58,760
This is his chance to make things right and do what he does the best.

1500
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:02,200
Well folks, I think that might be it.

1501
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:03,720
I think we might have made it.

1502
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:08,120
Justin Michael, you survived Podcast The Ride and thank you for helping us

1503
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:09,400
conquer the menace of Jaws.

1504
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:11,080
Yes, thank you for having me, you guys.

1505
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:12,360
Yeah, it's a real treat.

1506
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:14,760
Where can people find you?

1507
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:17,080
Plug your projects a little bit.

1508
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:21,080
You can find me on Twitter and Instagram at HeyJustin.

1509
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:25,560
I also do a podcast called Batman The Animated Podcast,

1510
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:28,840
which I'd love to have the three of you on to talk about a theme park episode.

1511
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:29,560
Oh yeah, sure.

1512
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:31,080
What did I do?

1513
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:32,360
I did the trial.

1514
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:33,080
The trial, yes.

1515
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:35,080
All the villains putting Batman on trial.

1516
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:36,360
Team up, I love a team up.

1517
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:38,840
Is there some crossover situation?

1518
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:41,400
Was there ever a theme park in the show?

1519
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:42,520
Kind of.

1520
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:47,480
Truly, I saved it and then my podcast just went on a indefinite hiatus.

1521
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:50,520
I was like, this is too much and we all suffered the same fallout.

1522
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:55,480
The fallout of all our good intentions.

1523
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:57,000
Very fun.

1524
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,240
So I was like, well, when it comes back, there's an episode called Deep Freeze,

1525
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:02,600
which is Mr. Freeze's return.

1526
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:04,440
There's a Walt Disney-esque villain.

1527
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:05,080
Oh yeah.

1528
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:07,960
The one that created Oceania, which is like an Epcot-esque.

1529
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:08,520
Yeah.

1530
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:09,720
Like Perfect Society.

1531
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:16,840
Yes, and he wants to turn immortal because it's kind of like a play on Disney's head,

1532
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:19,720
whatever, being frozen, but it's really fun.

1533
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:26,120
Every time you would mention your show and I would think of an episode, I double check

1534
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,720
and I'd be like, oh, a famous person did that one already.

1535
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:32,920
Oh, the voice of Batman, Paul Dini did that one.

1536
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:33,640
Okay.

1537
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:38,760
Well, this one is one of my true favorite episodes and I've been saving it for years

1538
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:41,240
at this point for the three of you.

1539
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:42,040
Oh boy.

1540
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:43,000
We love it.

1541
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:43,500
Yes.

1542
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:44,540
Down.

1543
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:47,080
And what are you doing on Audible?

1544
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:48,120
The Good Folks at Audible.

1545
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:48,760
The Good Folks at Audible.

1546
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:53,560
Hired me and my buddy, Eric Martin, to make like an improvised narrative.

1547
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:54,760
It's called Bad Reception.

1548
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:56,520
It comes out on August 21st.

1549
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,360
Maybe it's out by the time you've heard this.

1550
01:56:59,320 --> 01:56:59,560
Yeah.

1551
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:01,880
Audible.com slash Bad Reception.

1552
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:07,480
It's got Paul F. Tompkins and Darcy Carden and Nicole Byer and Lauren Lapkus.

1553
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:08,840
You know, all your favorite pods.

1554
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:09,960
Star-studded cast.

1555
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:10,360
Charmed people.

1556
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,480
Darcy Carden, a good person from the good place.

1557
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:13,960
Yes.

1558
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:14,120
Yes.

1559
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:15,320
On the Good People at Audible.

1560
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:16,760
That's why she's working with us.

1561
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:22,920
Lots of other people who, you know, are great improvisers, you know, as well.

1562
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,200
So please.

1563
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:28,440
Do you ever like fit in a joke about like how a lawyer is kind of like a shark?

1564
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,960
Do you ever do like funny stuff like that?

1565
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:32,840
Honestly, we could use one for season two.

1566
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:37,000
You know who to call.

1567
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,760
Not that other guy, Steve.

1568
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:43,560
But yeah, those are all the things.

1569
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:45,080
Thank you.

1570
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:49,800
This is my dream is to talk to you guys about what we talk about already.

1571
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:52,600
What we already have done many times in person.

1572
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:54,600
We'll continue talking after we turn this off.

1573
01:57:56,040 --> 01:58:00,040
We'll start recording the after show, but like more casually somehow.

1574
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,240
We'll periscope it.

1575
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:05,320
We'll figure out some way to monetize this too.

1576
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:07,720
And every bit of our conversation.

1577
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:11,560
Yeah, well, we're certainly getting to the point where our whole lives will be documented

1578
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:13,320
and we'll try to make a profit off of them.

1579
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:17,880
I've already had instances of like, oh, remember when we talked about that?

1580
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,800
And it was like, oh, we weren't at dinner or anything.

1581
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,080
We were on the podcast.

1582
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:24,200
Well, it's all blurring the line, really.

1583
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:25,960
We're all always doing it.

1584
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:32,600
But the official actual podcast can be while you're listening to it and you know where to

1585
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:37,880
find it, but Twitter for it is podcast, the ride and the Instagram is podcast, the ride and

1586
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:42,200
podcast, the ride at Gmail and Facebook.

1587
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,880
We have a Facebook group you can join.

1588
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:45,480
And that's fun.

1589
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:46,680
That's a nice little community.

1590
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:52,040
People posting cool stuff sharing tips and Tokyo Disney Day advice, you know,

1591
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:53,480
so do that.

1592
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:53,960
Join that.

1593
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:55,480
What are they up to?

1594
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:57,960
Minimum nine.

1595
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:59,400
Well, they're all very upset with Scott.

1596
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:03,080
Yeah, they all want more than two days for sure.

1597
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:06,040
Someday I shall atone for my huge mistake.

1598
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:10,360
I will say one person just said that I'm going to Tokyo Disney for the very controversial

1599
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:11,480
amount of two days.

1600
01:59:12,280 --> 01:59:13,640
That is what someone just posted.

1601
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:13,880
Wow.

1602
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:15,480
I made a controversial choice.

1603
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:16,440
Yeah, it worked out.

1604
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:18,680
I went on every single attraction.

1605
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:20,760
It was definitely an open day.

1606
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:25,000
I would have preferred three, but you know, it was somebody else's trip as well as mine.

1607
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,320
Well, this is an important point.

1608
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:29,880
Yes.

1609
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:31,080
Empathy is a bitch.

1610
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:34,760
I'm glad you want that recorded.

1611
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:37,800
Thank you.

1612
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:38,600
Empathy is a bitch.

1613
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:39,400
Thank you for listening.

1614
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:42,394
Thanks again.
