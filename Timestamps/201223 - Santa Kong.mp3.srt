1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We begin today with a simple ho, ho, ho.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello to you on this two days before Christmas.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm Scott Gertner, Jason Sheridan,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
who suggested that beginning is with us.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We're hemming and hawing and you're right,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the simple ho, ho, ho was the way to go.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Go.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm Michael Carlson, I'm here.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My suggestion, well, my thought was I was gonna say just

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
anything with a hat on it is better.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, you know.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Putting a hat on anything is better.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There's this comedy phrase, always put a hat on it.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Put a hat on a hat.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's right.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Put as many hats on top of each other as you can,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which I guess is what we're doing today.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Wait, Jason, I said your name, but you didn't say anything.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Feel free to.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, that's okay.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, no, I'll just echo that.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm all for hats on things, especially a Santa hat.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Absolutely.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now, is this an episode that we could get done in one sentence right now

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
by saying we're talking about when they put a Santa hat on King Kong?

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Sure.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, I guess in a way that could be the end, but there has to be more there.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There has to be more to explore.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Right?

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh, yeah, no, there's gotta be.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, I'm not out of stuff to talk about right now.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No way.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They did a lot more.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They did a lot more than I thought.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's true.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's not well preserved at all.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
No.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Really have to dig for it.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is another classic podcast, right?

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Especially the second gate where we're going off of one grainy camcorder

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that was posted to YouTube and just trying to decipher as many details as we can from that.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But yeah, this is all about Universal Studios Hollywood and a holiday activation,

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
if that's the right word, a holiday overlay that they did that is pretty delightful.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I assume you've seen concept arts or our little thumbnail on Twitter.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But you know what?

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, actually, really in a way, this is a two part topic because when you say Santa Kong,

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
there are several things that this could be.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
One of them, of course, every year still, presumably, I don't know,

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I haven't been up there in a second for obvious reasons.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
They put a Santa hat on King Kong at City Walk who's hanging off of the building.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I mean, maybe that's what you think of when you think of Santa Kong, possibly.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, that's happened in the recent past, so that might be fresher.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That was initially what I thought we were, and then I remembered, of course,

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
that we've talked about the other Santa Kong.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So yes, I think that probably when people hear Santa Kong, they think,

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
oh yes, he has little mistletoe in his hand and a Santa hat,

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and he's on that iconic neon sign at City Walk, which I think Evan Susser on our episode of the City Walk Saga

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that it was one of the icons of LA, one of the touchstones of Los Angeles, maybe.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A weenie, one of LA's weenies.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Certainly a weenie, yes.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, I liked that grand proclamation.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I wonder if you feel the same way about the holiday version.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I like it. I think it's great.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Sometimes you get a beard. You don't always get a beard.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't know the consistency of when they put a beard on, if that was before,

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and they stopped doing it, or is that a later addition?

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Did they lose the beard backstage?

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Did a disgruntled employee steal King Kong's Santa beard? We'll never know.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We'll never know.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I came across the beard, and I don't think I was familiar with the beard one,

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and then I also came across, I'll share the screen with you guys, the summer equivalent of Kong.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He's got a little swim trunks on. He's got sunglasses. He's got some zinc oxide on his nose.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And I think that's pretty fun, too.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It is pretty fun.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I didn't know they did this.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, when was this? I've never seen this.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not sure. It's a stock photo.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I found a lot of the Santa Kong stuff in stock photo libraries.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's a little while ago because the hard rock has a different guitar.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's not the iconic Eddie Van Halen guitar in the background. It's a different type of guitar.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you recognize the types of guitars at the hard rock?

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, yes, because that's not the iconic Van Halen guitar. I don't even know what that guitar is.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What are the qualities of the iconic Van Halen guitar?

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's share the screen and let me show you.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Sure. You can see GameStop in the background, too, so that points it to a certain timeframe.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's not GameStop anymore. Now it's Things From Another World.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's correct.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You've seen this, Scott. This is the iconic Van Halen guitar.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We don't talk Van Halen a lot on this show. This design, you see?

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, I see. Okay. It's red and with a lot of crisscrossing black and white stripes.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We've only really talked about Van Halen in the way of Sammy Hagar Van Halen dreams at the end of the Power Rangers movie, of course.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But yeah, when they retired, of course, the hard rock at CityWalk out here, they just dismantled Eddie's guitar.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But that was the design toward the end.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wait a minute. Was it around like... So in the same calendar year, we lost Eddie Van Halen and we lost Eddie Van Halen's guitar outside of the hard rock event?

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Giant guitar. You're saying this now and I'm just realizing that you are correct.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Wow. Did he die of heartbreak when he learned that his greatest achievement was torn down?

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You know what? I'm going to look into that. I don't know. We don't know for sure.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But see, here's the picture of the guitar before.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I never put this together. I guess I'd read the plaque that said that this was Eddie Van Halen's guitar.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But for being we're as close to CityWalk completists as you can be.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And I don't I was looking at a photo. I didn't I couldn't I didn't.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Clearly, there's a difference. One has flames and one has stripes.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But I was just not clocking any of this. Right.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I may have I may be that other one might actually be someone's guitar might be like Stevie Ray Vaughan's guitar.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I just don't know. So somebody might be get get mad about this.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Scott, are there any iconic guitars other than Prince's Prince symbol dick guitar that he played at the Super Bowl that you would like know off the top of your head where you'd be like, well, that's the iconic guitar of so and so.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I guess I just recognize a Paul McCartney bass.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A Hoffner bass. That's not a guitar.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah. Right.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So what about Elvis Costello's Jazzmaster?

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No. I like Elvis Costello. I don't know about that.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's like sort of the classic guitar he uses in all the old.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
OK, this I promise that'll be the last guitar I'll show you today and then we'll go back to Santa.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Today is guitar talk.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Talking Tars.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Mike, do you know do you know what guitar Bob Dylan was playing at that folk festival?

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, when he went electric?

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
When he went electric and then someone had an axe and they wanted to chop it up because they were so disgusted.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't know off the top. I want to say it was like a telecaster, but I could be wrong.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So don't don't get mad at me here.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's Elvis Costello with his trademark Jazzmaster.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh, sure. Yeah.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You know, you know this, Jason. I don't know this.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He's just saying he recognizes the photo.

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I recognize the well, yeah, I like early Elvis Costello.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I haven't gotten much far past like Armed Forces.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I will say that is my I want like a nice old Jazzmaster.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's maybe my dream guitar.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That is extremely cool.

132
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah. Not replicated at CityWalk.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
CityWalk. Not not broad enough for the masses.

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I suppose. Yeah.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Maybe if they had appealed to the real music fans more, it wouldn't be in the process of being replaced by a chocolate Emporium.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
With a chocolate robot and his chocolate robot dog.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
When they're usually when Pump It Up is set at CityWalk is referred to the tracks from Milo Zyloto.

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The cold light.

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't wind up. I feel like I waited a hundred years for you to set that up.

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I felt like I lived a whole lifetime waiting for what you were going to see.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What reference that was. And I was happy with it.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm just saying I was like, what is it? What is it?

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I know you love a good Milo Zyloto.

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hey, that's probably how long it took Kong to grow into a full size.

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Right. Yeah, I think that's right. Yes.

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hundred years.

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,000
When people say watching the detectives at CityWalk, it's about the plain clothes officers who monitor the comings and goings at the steam shopping mall.

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's right.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So Santa Kong.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, look, you know, that's great.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And I think they should do that kind of thing more often with the Sussers declared greatest icon in Los Angeles.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You know, I think if it had been a more normal, less horrible year, you know, the LA won a couple of the big sports championships.

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You know, I think I think that happens again.

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And you got to put King Kong in a Dodger uniform or in a Laker uniform.

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I think everyone get a kick out of that.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think that anytime you can dress up either at neon signs or robots in anything, do it like it more of it.

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Like if you went on any of the famous rides and like all the pirates on Pirates of the Caribbean were wearing Dodger's uniforms, like it doesn't matter.

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It doesn't even make sense.

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You just go, holy shit, they're all dressed like Dodgers.

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Now that what you're describing is an incredible ordeal.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's so it's hundreds of yes, I that is extreme.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I for sure.

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But maybe the Navi Shaman of Song is wearing a Dodger's uniform at the end of the at the end of the river.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
In foot tall.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
One that's just one big Dodger's uniform.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You have to make in in Florida.

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You're suggesting then like the every World Series champ gets the jersey.

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Maybe for like a month after the win.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You sub in Vince Scully singing the song as well.

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I know.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I know.

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hey.

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But Vince Scully.

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, because he's kind of like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, heyontec.

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah.

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So more of that.

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What's the full name of that ride?

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Navi River Journey.

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Is that correct?

181
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah, I believe.

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
All right.

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So the every like right after the World Series, it's the baseball River Journey.

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Great.

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yes.

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Fantastic.

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Navi River Journey year around the bases.

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
A lot of changes since roadies been out.

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
A lot of changes going on.

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The only one minding the store.

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's right.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, it's all getting crazy now.

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So all right.

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That stuff's great at City.

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Just wanted to acknowledge that Kong does a great job year in year out.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But that is a stationary figure in a way.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And it's smaller than the main topic.

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That being the King Kong that was part of the Universal Studios tour for many decades until it was burnt in a fire and no longer exists.

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is not an overlay of the new thing of the Peter Jackson screen thing.

200
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is a big robot, a big Bob Gerb built robot.

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And every year, not every year.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Not it. Wait, no.

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I said, why am I saying every year?

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
One year, one year, 2002, they put it in a Santa hat.

205
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And Jason, you're correct.

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
More was done.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Would you like to discuss a little more of what was done?

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, sure.

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There is a pretty good video of this on YouTube.

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I was very delighted because I think I had seen the still image of Kong.

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And but I didn't realize that like, oh, when you went in the soundstage, they had decorated all of the buildings with like Christmas lights.

212
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And, you know, the guy is the tour guide is talking about like, and that's snow on the buildings.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's not real. It's fake. It's Hollywood snow.

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And I thought the best touch was a little CRT TV in one of the apartment building windows playing the end of It's a Wonderful Life.

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I thought that was really charming.

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now, all right, this is where we're going to disagree, because I thought that was very stupid.

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't like that's the overlay is if you don't know the what that what that attraction used to be, because it was a long time ago at this point.

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It burned up in in 2008.

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But I know it very well. I did it every day for a while.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So it was a soundstage that the tram would drive into.

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And there's first like a city scene set where a reporter on the news throws to a helicopter reporter who's talking about some disturbance downtown.

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And then the chopper hits some kind of problem and goes spiraling down.

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, no, what's going on?

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Then we start hearing like military fire and a helicopter and you round the corner.

225
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And there is King Kong himself in the flesh and he shakes each car of the tram and breathes on you as banana breath.

226
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And that's the attraction in this one.

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You get to the first scene, this Christmas lights.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And then instead of a scary news report, It's a Wonderful Life is playing.

229
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What does that have to do with King Kong?

230
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's entirely unrelated.

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, it's a spirit of the season.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And it gives him a chance to tie in that like, you know, when they were filming this, it was 90 degrees outside.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And so they really were pumping in that fake snow.

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Of course, it's fake snow, Hollywood snow.

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're saying the fear, Scott.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You miss the fear from the ride.

237
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah, I think I'm when you compare it to the original story telling.

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And also, I mean, look, this is having done this job.

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What I liked was yelling a Kong and shaking my fist at him.

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
All the little trivia details could be fun, but wasn't, you know, the funnest thing to do.

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And it can get a little lost in a room that's very loud and where explosions are going off.

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I think it's what, you know, most of the tour are these little factoids.

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't like that you drive in and now you got to hear more factoids where there used to be like a news anchor dying in a helicopter crash.

244
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I mean, yeah, I get what you're saying.

245
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But imagine like there was a rise of the resistance overlay where Kylo Ren was just trying to give you a present the whole time.

246
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And he's trying like he's coming after you, but he has a present and it's a lot less sinister.

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, it's OK if you didn't get me something.

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's OK. Yeah. So he's like your presence here is enough sticks.

249
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The spoiler. He sticks like a present like present through.

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I got a long pole for you here.

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Take it. This is your gift.

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
When he's coming through the top of the elevator like that is giving us a big sausage or something.

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Right. He rolled us in a sausage at the month club.

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I made a Christmas sausage.

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Here it is. Take it. Grab it.

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Grab it. No, come on.

257
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Grab it. Yeah, that would drive away droid.

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's giving you a different vibe, but it's only temporary.

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, hang on. The problem for me is not the vibe.

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I like the vibe. I like that.

261
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I really love that that King Kong is wearing a Santa hat.

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I think I just don't think they did a good job of tying the first room into the second room.

263
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It seems like we're in there's an unrelated situation going on.

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Here's a city scene where it's a wonderful life is playing.

265
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And now let's go somewhere else.

266
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And there's King Kong in a Santa suit.

267
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And you don't know why I'm missing the why.

268
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Right. I mean, that examination is fair because I think we can all agree on the second room.

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, right. For sure. Yeah.

270
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let's say how much we like this.

271
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And then we can maybe think about how this could have all fit together better.

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But yeah, King Kong's in a Santa hat and Santa sleeves.

273
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The first the top of a Santa suit.

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And he's holding a giant candy cane.

275
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's a lot. They give us a lot there.

276
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
They had to make some really big sleeves.

277
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah. And there's a helicopter, but it's just hovering.

278
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's not firing bullets at him.

279
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
They've made peace for the holidays.

280
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And there's snow falling. Snow falling constantly.

281
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
They must have run through a lot of snow to do this thing.

282
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It looks like the outfit, the shirt Kong is wearing looks like they cut a hole in a fumigation tent.

283
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Like it's draped over him in such a funny way that like most clothes aren't maybe like maybe a dress would be that material.

284
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But in general, a shirt does not look like that.

285
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's not super fitted.

286
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's right. If you're borrowing a friend's suit or renting a tux, it is not proportioned to you.

287
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So he might have borrowed this from another monster that it was meant for.

288
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This was Rodin's Santa suit or Rodin. Wait, Rodin was Rodin.

289
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I was thinking Rodin as well because I didn't want to just say Godzilla.

290
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But now I'm like, I don't think Rodin. Yeah, no, Rodin would have to be.

291
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's like a pterodactyl. So yeah, Mothra is the Mothra. Of course, is the Mothra.

292
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I apologize. Maybe it was the proportions of King Kong.

293
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Maybe maybe a Gamera. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know that monster.

294
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah. It was the suit.

295
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Gamera was buried in. Gamera is a big Andrew Grissom fan to the show is a big Gamera fan, if I recall correctly.

296
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Makes all the sense in the world. That specific monster.

297
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I think I asked him once, what would you want? Like, I know you don't collect toys, but is there like a character you would have toys of?

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
He's like, Gamera, I think. That's pretty perfect. He'll text me if that's right or not.

299
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, I mean, it's a great suit. And let me screen share.

300
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And you guys probably have some of these photos, too, but just to point out a few.

301
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I mean, my favorite one, and we'll make sure this is on Twitter.

302
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This is a Getty Images photo for a press event. They did. Oh, two. Oh, I'm underselling it. Two candy cans.

303
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah, yeah. Double fisting candy canes.

304
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I mean, anyone's dream for the holidays.

305
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And just in this particular photo, he looks so humiliated.

306
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's like he's communicating. I do not want to wear this.

307
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We got like a dog wearing a Halloween costume.

308
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes. Well, and let's not undersell the soundscape in this room either, because he's not roaring.

309
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, my God. Yes, absolutely.

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He's saying ho ho ho in like a deep King Kong tone of voice.

311
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And I mean, it's what you want. It's what you you know, it's just so great.

312
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't know how they didn't do this every year.

313
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, is it too hard to do it? Like, why not do it every year?

314
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I feel like people would have been delighted by this.

315
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know. Yeah, maybe it was a budget thing.

316
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't know what else they were doing. Was there odd feedback? Yeah.

317
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Why not? The costume had been sewn, unless like he ripped through it by the end of the Christmas season.

318
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Also, are we sure they only did it this one year?

319
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm not sure about my thought. I cannot find proof of anything other than 2002.

320
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But do we know if his breath still smell like bananas or did it smell like peppermint?

321
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I was wondering that and I really hope that it's peppermint.

322
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I mean, that makes a lot of I mean, I would not there would be no way they wouldn't have suggested it when they were coming up with this.

323
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But I do wonder if it actually exists. I mean, let's ask the listener here.

324
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Did you ever see this in person? Did he have peppermint breath?

325
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And did it last for more than a year? Like other because this is not that well documented.

326
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I mean, it's documented visually, but not as far as there's no Jim Hill piece on this as far as I can see.

327
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Well, there is actually. Oh, I missed the Jim Hill piece.

328
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
JimHillMedia.com, if not written by the man himself. Oh, wait, no, it is. It is written by him.

329
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I apologize to Jim. I missed your piece, my friend.

330
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But he doesn't really have a well, I don't know.

331
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:00,000
He wait a minute. He says they would periodically try to find new ways to celebrate the season, including dressing King Kong in a Santa suit periodically implies that it happened more than once.

332
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah, doesn't seem like he has the most information either.

333
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I don't think this is the most documented thing in the world, if you can imagine.

334
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And who else? Yeah, Jim doesn't have all the info. Who else is going to have it?

335
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I don't know. Maybe a listener if we're lucky. Right.

336
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
They were not doing it by 2006, which was my inaugural season with the tour guide program.

337
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And boy, would I have loved to do unless they did. What if I'm wrong and I did it and I don't remember?

338
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Wow, that would be crazy, though, missing away my own memories.

339
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That would be crazy. Well, Christmas 2005, though, you got to remember the Peter Jackson Kong is coming out.

340
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And maybe they don't want to like, yeah, the brand and do something that fun and that people like.

341
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's like how the Star Wars hyperspace hoopla went away as soon as Disney Star Wars was like, we're serious now. No more fun.

342
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Even though then the actual King Kong thing.

343
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What does Peter Jackson say when you drive in? I see it a million times, but yeah, it's really weird.

344
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He says, like, all right, everyone, we're going back. Skull Island. Skull Island.

345
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You're like, what? Where? You don't know.

346
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And all I know, we don't know what's actually more.

347
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There was all I'll say is one time I did it with a certain someone next to me, Biz Biz.

348
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And now forever, I'll just remember going hearing Skull Island. Skull Island.

349
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
We're going back. We're going back.

350
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And then we just saying the shark isn't working over and over again.

351
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That's right. The shark.

352
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The shark isn't working.

353
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That way, if to clue you in, that's a reference to and this was burrowed into my brain working there as well.

354
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That there was one of the things they love to tell on the tour is how the shark and jaws did not work really well.

355
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And there's a clip that they play after the shark attack of Richard Dreyfuss calling in a fake like on the intercom.

356
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And you'd always hear the shark is not working. The shark is not working.

357
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That was a must play. I believe we had a list of optional plays and must plays that.

358
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah, I always saw. I mean, I probably done the tour in my life now 12 times, maybe some around there.

359
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Sounds right. That seems right. And I've never. Yeah, that's always been there.

360
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That's always been. I mean, it is an interesting story for sure.

361
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The part that really that I got a little sick of doing over and over.

362
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Forgive me if I said this on the jaws episode, which was feels like nine years ago at this point, but that that you'd always have to do the which would kill all the time.

363
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And of course, the shark was named Bruce and it was named after Mr. Spielberg's lawyer.

364
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I think that's what I would just try to make that pause more pregnant every time I did it.

365
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
We got to do a 10 second pause before lawyer.

366
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We have to do the full you doing the tour episode soon.

367
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I would love to discuss that idea. I think we sort of have talked around it, but if we haven't said it, just I think there has to be maybe an episode of just you doing the tour for us.

368
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I mean, we've discussed the plans of this and how you two would be involved because we don't want this to just be right that I just talk.

369
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And I think there's a good plan and I don't want to say what it is.

370
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Right. But yeah, well, I mean, there's plans with the tour in general that we've had to put off.

371
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But yes, that's true.

372
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
One of these days, we're going to end up with like, OK, this is one we did confrontation.

373
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Santa Kong is in progress right now.

374
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
King Kong on the tour is a different thing.

375
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The new King Kong on the tour is a different thing.

376
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Skull Island, Scott Kong, Skull Island.

377
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yes, different scare actors.

378
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And the City Walk Saga episode involving the King Kong, the King Kong sign.

379
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Right. But here's the thing about Bruce.

380
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Just in the news recently, Bruce is specifically I think some people are used to refer as like the one that finally worked like the the animatronic recently lifted preserved.

381
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
They found it.

382
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't know if it's lost or is in a junkyard or something, but they restored the shark animatronic and it was lifted via crane into the soon to open Academy Museum in Los Angeles.

383
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Wow.

384
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Is that the scary one?

385
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Is that the one that looks like the technodrome?

386
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
The shark, you mean?

387
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
No, no, the building.

388
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The museum.

389
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
They've been building a museum that is so scary and Death Star-ish.

390
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I think I know what you're talking about.

391
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.

392
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And it's yeah, there's a giant.

393
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,000
The one main room is just giant empty space with pillars and each pillar is like this is Steven Spielberg's pillar.

394
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
This is Bob Iger's pillar.

395
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Bob Iger's pillar.

396
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I think it's whoever paid.

397
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I think it was the angel investors or the advisory board or whatever.

398
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah, the Academy Museum looks a little bonkers.

399
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Well, sounds like Bruce will be able to see Bruce in the next few years, maybe.

400
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Hopefully we wish I well, you know, I mean, that's another like Santa Kong, of course, just makes me want to put Santa hats on everything.

401
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I mean, Jaws didn't burn up in a fire.

402
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Why don't they put a Santa hat on him when he pops up?

403
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah, strap. Yeah, he'll obviously have to have like it strapped to his chin and it'll have to be waterproof.

404
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But maybe instead of the fin, it's a Santa hat float like you have a Santa hat on the fin.

405
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
How about that?

406
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Oh, that's fun.

407
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Oh, that's really cute.

408
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's shaped perfectly.

409
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And instead of instead of those barrels exploding into fire, it explodes into candy.

410
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Sure.

411
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I mean, that sounds tough to.

412
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Oh, yeah, that's true.

413
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Snow, maybe.

414
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yes.

415
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So snow explosion.

416
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That's pretty good.

417
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That's good.

418
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And then the guy, the person doesn't die in the lake.

419
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The scuba diver doesn't die in the lake.

420
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
They just get a stocking of.

421
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Or they get like if you don't, you know, you don't want to maybe remake the animatronics.

422
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So since he gets dragged into water, does he just he's invited to an exclusive underwater Christmas party?

423
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's good.

424
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And you can maybe like say that the guide say that.

425
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

426
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Looks like he's getting dragged to an exclusive underwater Christmas party.

427
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
All right.

428
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Well, let's pull forward.

429
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
What is behind these candy exploiters?

430
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What can you explain the red as the red is not blood?

431
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's I got that.

432
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You just add a second jet that shoots up green color.

433
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh, good.

434
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So it's red and green and it's the spirit of the right.

435
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
OK, good.

436
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Spirit of the season was liquid.

437
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Liquid.

438
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yes, the two green and red.

439
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I got to give credit to the I believe it was the Americana Memes account on Twitter who set up put a big Santa hat on the minion looking over looking down on the highway one.

440
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I was one of one.

441
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yes, very good idea.

442
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah.

443
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah.

444
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I mean, hey, it's been a hard year.

445
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You imagine how much better we'd all feel these people who live with a view of that.

446
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
There's people who pass by it on a commute all the time.

447
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
If you were looking at a Santa minion every day, how much jollier would your stuck at home Christmas be?

448
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Exactly.

449
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Obviously, it seems like it's a very big thing.

450
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But, you know, if you can dream it, you can do it is what I subscribe to.

451
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So they could do it.

452
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I mean, maybe it has to be more.

453
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It can't be a cloth.

454
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It can't be made out of cloth.

455
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That has to be more of a piece like a plastic piece.

456
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But yeah, plastic fiberglass.

457
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But everything needs a Santa like Norman Bates Scare actor on the tram tour Santa hat.

458
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Come on.

459
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Like and he doesn't again, he can have enough to have a knife.

460
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But maybe or maybe he has a knife and he has like a Christmas strudel that he has with him.

461
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And he's like, does anyone want a piece?

462
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
He's a oh, it's still a knife, but he's going to cut it up.

464
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Right. He's going to cut the strudel up the Christmas strudel.

465
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah. Yeah.

466
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
He runs after the only my stipulation for all of these is that the Christmas specific exposition has to be fit in as quickly as possible.

467
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It is anyone want a delicious Christmas strudel whipped cream or cool whip whipped cream or cool whip.

468
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I have both.

469
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That's great.

470
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
That's great. Yeah.

471
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I mean, obviously, you don't want to lose the classic part of those those tram speeches.

472
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But can they is it too dark?

473
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Maybe. But you could say that subsequently right after that, that the the War of the World's plane crash was a Santa sleigh crash.

474
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yes. You put the you put the Santa sleigh in front of it and it gets broken and the present strewn about.

475
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Could be all the same stuff, essentially.

476
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And all right. And Santa.

477
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Sorry, Santa is like Santa's there and he's alive and he's covered in blood and he's like trying to put all the presents back together.

478
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And he's like, how he's here to yell at you.

479
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Help me. Help me.

480
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
My sleigh crash.

481
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Help. And he's trying to gather everything up to because like Christmas is going to be late this year.

482
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I can still do it.

483
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I swear.

484
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah.

485
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And then you see any reindeer?

486
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I found five of the eight.

487
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The upcharge event then is you stop the tram there, you get out and you help him collect presents and put him in the sled and try to get the sled off the ground again.

488
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
OK, thank you for your help.

489
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
First things first.

490
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You didn't see anything.

491
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
There is no one can prove there was eggnog in my blood.

492
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I've been hammered for 2000 years doing this.

493
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Never happened before.

494
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I never even crashed into a bird.

495
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I drive the sleigh better this way.

496
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh, no.

497
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah.

498
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
More of this.

499
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I have to say the the body-ness of Universal Parks, though, I am surprised that, you know, maybe it's too body when he with the tour guide was driving into the Santa Kong soundstage and is talking about like it's fake snow.

500
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It's Hollywood snow.

501
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
We didn't go.

502
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And I don't mean the nose kind of Hollywood.

503
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You know what?

504
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I usually around movie studio lots.

505
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
We're talking about a different kind of Hollywood snow.

506
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That seems like evil tram voice might be the only universal character that could get away with that.

507
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Oh, the stairs.

508
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yeah, the starway.

509
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah, the evil starway.

510
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Sorry.

511
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
A character.

512
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Different kind of snow.

513
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Different kind of snow.

514
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
When it gets you high.

515
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Look, it's a wild ride.

516
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But Francis Ford Coppola has remade his career multiple times and he's come back from the edge.

517
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Godfather Coda.

518
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Check it out.

519
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Check out the Godfather Coda.

520
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Death of Michael Corleone haunt house down in the lower lot.

521
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Mission break.

522
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Death of Michael Corleone mission breakout.

523
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Coming to shutter.

524
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
A lot of different things there.

525
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
A lot of different subtitles, I feel like.

526
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah, just keep adding them on.

527
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You know, it seems to me like the digital ones you could slide out a lot.

528
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Like Transformers, just all of them as Santa hats.

529
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah.

530
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And the walk around Transformers.

531
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That's easy.

532
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Do they do that?

533
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
They have to do that, right?

534
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I got to look that up.

535
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Oh, that's good.

536
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You have Megatron say some Scrooge lines.

537
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You know, these are not poor houses you can go to.

538
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yeah, Megatron should just speak in Scrooge lines.

539
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
A humbot.

540
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Oh, that's good.

541
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You're a figment of my imagination.

542
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
A crust of motor oil or some bad spark plugs.

543
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm looking up Universal Christmas Transformers and they're just pictures of the regular ones.

544
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So I don't think they've put Christmas Santa hats on them yet.

545
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Did the show ever do like a Christmas special?

546
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh, yeah, there was a Transformers holiday special, it looks like.

547
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Oh, it has a comic.

548
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I mean, that's cool.

549
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Okay.

550
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But, you know, animated would be better.

551
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Right.

552
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Blue.

553
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Blue should have a Christmas, some sort of Christmas thing on.

554
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The Raptor Blue, of course.

555
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
We all know.

556
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I knew I just wanted to make sure everyone knew.

557
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Blue from Jurassic World.

558
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
From Jurassic World, yeah.

559
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Jurassic World.

560
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
On this show, we have to distinguish between Blue the Raptor and Blue 32.

561
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It's a good point.

562
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I didn't even think about that.

563
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
We have multiple.

564
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Copperfield's friend.

565
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Blues, yeah.

566
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah.

567
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Competing Blues.

568
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yeah.

569
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Blue, who is Owen Grady's beloved Raptor.

570
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Right.

571
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So, yeah.

572
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Put a Santa hat on him.

573
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
What?

574
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Fast and Furious Partiers, the very natural like car garage party dancers in Supercharged.

575
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
They all have, get Santa hats and like a punch bowl and white elephant gifts.

576
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That would be fun if a couple in the background were like, oh, iTunes gift card, real creative.

577
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I want to point out though, just in general about Santa Kong.

578
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
If you Google Santa Kong, this is looking like a somewhat popular phenomenon.

579
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Like there are drawings of Santa.

580
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:07,000
This is a deviant art Santa Kong drawing of him in a very tight fitting that shows his fur off.

581
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Quite frankly.

582
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's very muscular.

583
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Yeah.

584
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
There's a shirt of kind of a Donkey Kong style.

585
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I mean, I guess maybe this is Donkey Kong, but it's Santa Donkey Kong.

586
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
There's this, look at this.

587
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
This is cool.

588
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
This is like a kind of a display, Christmas display, and they have a giant Kong, probably a static figure, but it's got a Santa outfit on.

589
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And you keep scrolling and there are a lot more of these.

590
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So it's interesting that people think of, you know, this is sort of a fun little cute gingerbread like King Kong.

591
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's not like we take every character and Christmasify them.

592
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So what is this marriage of King Kong and Christmas that seems fairly natural?

593
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Right.

594
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Is there something big and jolly like Santa?

595
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I mean, he's not jolly, but he's right.

596
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And here's the picture of him with the beard at City Walk.

597
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So, yeah, I'm just wondering, yes.

598
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Is there a movie we don't know about where King Kong dresses up like Santa?

599
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I mean, that would have been in the results.

600
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You would think.

601
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah.

602
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah. If there was like a Mystery Science Theater episode, that definitely would have like popped up.

603
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But yeah, there is something.

604
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Kong saves Christmas or something.

605
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
The marriage of it is perfect.

606
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I mean, I think we're getting, aren't we getting a Godzilla Kong movie now that's going to be released on HBO Max the same day as the theater?

607
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I believe that's coming next year.

608
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Okay.

609
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah.

610
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Well, maybe this maybe ties back to an earlier point.

611
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
If there isn't a King Kong Christmas movie and we want one.

612
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And also, I do want more justification why the Santa Kong scenario is happening.

613
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It's not enough for me to just tell me.

614
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I think what the guide says before this experience starts is we're heading into a sound stage where one of the biggest stars in Hollywood is starring as Santa Claus in an all new spectacular.

615
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
What do you mean?

616
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I want a convoluted story.

617
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I want the most complicated justification for why he ended up dressed like this.

618
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And do you think we could pow wow and figure this out?

619
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yes.

620
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Okay.

621
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:33,000
My first thought is tied into the Santa Claus franchise, the Tim Allen Santa Claus franchise, which has ledged the lore of if Santa dies, essentially his killer becomes Santa Claus.

622
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So, I mean, look, and Kong is a misunderstood character, a gentle character, but Kong really causes a lot of damage if, you know, he's unleashed.

623
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So, Kong has to murder Santa Claus.

624
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Mm hmm.

625
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I see.

626
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And become Santa Claus.

627
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So Tim Allen gets murdered by King Kong in the movie.

628
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You're saying it has to be a Santa Claus movie.

629
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I thought maybe it was an accidental situation in the way that Tim kills Santa Claus.

630
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Initially.

631
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You're right.

632
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
That's probably where I initially was going.

633
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But then just a premeditated murder might be funnier to me.

634
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But maybe for a more family film, you're right.

635
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It has to be like Tim Allen Santa Claus is a.

636
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I don't know.

637
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Does he imprison Kong?

638
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Because that's usually what happens.

639
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Kong gets taken in chains and then breaks free and like usually, you know, does a lot of destruction to the people who are imprisoning him.

640
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Well, it could be that Kong has been captured and made to take into the North Pole to entertain the elves.

641
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Oh, that's OK.

642
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I like that.

643
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's good.

644
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
They'll be so amused.

645
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
They are so small and he is so tall.

646
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Right.

647
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
But he's not meant to be.

648
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
He doesn't.

649
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
We know he's not supposed to be a sideshow.

650
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That's that's you know, Kong needs to run free.

651
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So it's safe.

652
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Yeah, I think if Santa is an imprisoner of Kong, then I think, yeah, it's every bit of Kong's right to murder Santa Claus.

653
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Right.

654
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Can I I'm going to I'm going to toss out a different justification.

655
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So for this, imagine Skull Island is just south of the equator.

656
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So the seasons are flipped.

657
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So around Christmas time, it would be summer down there.

658
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You know, I do know.

659
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So let's say Kong is just like, God, it's so hot.

660
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I can't sleep.

661
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's so hot on Skull Island.

662
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And I think it's so hot that I can't sleep.

663
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's just so hot on Skull Island.

664
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And let's say he's just like, I got to find somewhere cold to sleep.

665
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And he just starts heading north.

666
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
He just starts heading north, ends up at the North Pole.

667
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Finally, it's like, now this is sleep and weather.

668
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm going to lie down for a long winter's nap.

669
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And then that's right when the Santa's workshop starts cranking, the factory starts pumping.

670
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And he's like, I was so loud.

671
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And he squats the whole thing.

672
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And that's how he kills Santa Claus.

673
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I like it.

674
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I will say it's funny that your pitch contains at least from the sound of it,

675
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
45 minutes of a character trying to find a good place to take a nap.

676
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That's a good portion of the film.

677
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It's too hot.

678
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I got to take a better nap.

679
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
The nap quality is really, really poor down here.

680
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Well, you want a colder temperature to sleep in or else you're going to toss and turn.

681
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Watch as King Kong has an epic quest to find the perfect napping place.

682
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Will he find soft, soft snow that is as comfortable as a giant pillow?

683
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
See the student at HBO Max to find out.

684
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Written and directed by Jason Sheridan.

685
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So let's say some of the elves survive, all of the reindeer and Mrs. Claus.

686
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And he has to deliver the toys and he's celebrating at the top of the Empire State Building

687
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
because for whatever reason they get delayed.

688
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And New York City, he's like, I got to go to New York again.

689
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And so he's at the top of the Empire State Building celebrating.

690
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And she's in his hand saying, good job, good job.

691
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And Kong is married to Mrs. Claus as well.

692
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
He has to marry her.

693
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Part of the Claus.

694
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah.

695
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But then they, of course, blow him away.

696
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And he falls.

697
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And they end the movie with Twas Christmas killed the beast.

698
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And like whoever, whichever person in the military delivered the final shot to Kong's brain becomes Santa at the end.

699
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Whoa.

700
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And he's, yeah, he's a scary militant.

701
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
He's like Stephen Lang in Avatar.

702
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So now you have to tease for like, what does it mean that this scary military man is going to be the next Santa?

703
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Sergeant Santa.

704
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh, man.

705
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'd like, well, I love a sequel that takes you in a completely different scenario where you only barely meet the character who then takes over the franchise.

706
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And maybe this is sort of where the Jurassic World franchise is going, which is like, imagine if we could take Santa's technology and use it for military purposes in war.

707
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Why we win every battle we ever fought.

708
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
That's right.

709
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So this, this is a, I mean, we just used Kong to get us to just unlimited franchise, just to exploit the Santa Claus franchise.

710
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I mean, you know, you'd have to like write the whole movie and link it, but you could using Santa Claus rules.

711
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It's completely different types of characters.

712
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Right.

713
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
If, if the, if Sergeant Santa was too militant and scary, then you did that.

714
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
The end, you find a way to hand it off to a little girl and then there's a cute five year old girl Santa.

715
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You can take this into any genre you could ever want.

716
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Right.

717
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And that's great.

718
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It is.

719
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It is really great.

720
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I assume they're, they should do something like that.

721
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I'm assuming there's a eight seasons of a Santa Claus Disney Plus show Greenlit already.

722
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Is that right?

723
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
That has to be coming.

724
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
That's probably right.

725
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I mean, I think in the Godzilla Kong, like the current movie universe, you can, after Sergeant Santa, you can hand it off pretty easily to, I can't remember the actor's name from Stranger Things.

726
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Finn Wolfhard?

727
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
No, no, she, she has the power.

728
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Millie Bobby Brown.

729
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Millie Bobby Brown.

730
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
She's in the Godzilla's.

731
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Oh.

732
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
The current run.

733
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So she, she like finds, let's say dead Stephen Lang or dead Stephen Norris or she accidentally causes.

734
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Oh, I was just going to say, yeah, that's good.

735
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
But what if Godzilla kills Kong and becomes Santa then?

736
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That's good.

737
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yes.

738
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It'd be cool to have two, it'd be cool to have the like twin girls who summon Mothra.

739
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
If they're two Santas?

740
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Twin Santa?

741
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That's fun.

742
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yeah.

743
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
There's a lot of different options now for who can be Santa.

744
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I mean, look, it's like the end of last Jedi.

745
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Anybody can be Santa.

746
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You know?

747
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah.

748
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
You want to make it populous.

749
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Do you want to open and open?

750
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah.

751
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I mean, you want Broome Boy to be Santa.

752
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Broome Boy, Santa, sweep it up.

753
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And then you go back to the George side and can a little midichlorian be?

754
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Can a will be Santa?

755
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Can there be, what if instead of one main Santa, there's billions upon billions of microscopic Santas?

756
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Oh my gosh.

757
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm sure George Lynch is making an experimental film about this exact idea right now in his garage.

758
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
He should just make them.

759
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Like, just do them all.

760
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
How crazy would it be if Lucas just said, I'm doing it.

761
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I'm changing every name.

762
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's just like, you know.

763
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
You mean he's making his Zan Stolo.

764
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
He just changes them all.

765
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But yeah, yeah, just make his.

766
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
That'd be huge.

767
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I think that's...

768
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So you're saying he self produces like Billy Toppett.

769
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You're talking like Billy, Billy Toppett formula.

770
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I would like that level of production value as well.

771
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Like a student film level, but made by George Lucas.

772
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Because you know he saw these last three movies and he goes, that's not what happened.

773
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That's not what happened.

774
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
He's the only one who knows what really happened.

775
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And we might not like it.

776
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Maybe no one likes what happens, but he's the only one who can really tell us.

777
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But George could pick up a phone and like call Soderbergh.

778
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's like, can you come up here with your briefcase of iPhones and give me a hand?

779
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Because like Soderbergh can give him a hundred dollars.

780
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
He just finished two movies today probably.

781
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I probably, yeah, they got this Meryl Streep boat thing that's coming out.

782
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Very exciting.

783
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It's always on the cutting edge.

784
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Oh, can I spoil?

785
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Can I spoil what the name of the child is?

786
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Grogu.

787
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, sorry.

788
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It'll be like a month at this point.

789
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I was making a joke.

790
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I thought you were going to like spoil the end of Logan Lucky or something.

791
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
We haven't talked about Grogu.

792
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I like Grogu a lot actually.

793
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
But there's a, not has not been on the show.

794
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I don't hope he doesn't mind me saying this.

795
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Charles Ingram is the theory that George named Grogu.

796
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Oh.

797
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
That feels George-esque.

798
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Yeah.

799
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
He's like Dave Fuller is like, I need a name for the child.

800
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And George is like, um, Grogu.

801
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Cool.

802
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I don't know.

803
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That's just a made up.

804
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That's not a real, that's not sourced anywhere, but I like, I love the thought of it.

805
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Like him back channeling like names like by his pool.

806
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
He didn't even have to think about it.

807
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
He didn't even have to brainstorm.

808
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
He just knew Grogu.

809
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Grogu.

810
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
His name is Grogu.

811
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
His name is Grogu.

812
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Or they asked him and he, his phone, he accidentally landed on his phone and it, and it picked up.

813
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Like George, we need you to tell us then.

814
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And he was asleep.

815
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And he just muttered, Grogu.

816
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Okay.

817
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Very good, George.

818
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The genius.

819
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Yes.

820
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Perfect.

821
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Anyway.

822
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
George fell asleep against his Academy Museum pillar again.

823
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Someone's got to get him out of here.

824
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Has George ever dressed up like Santa?

825
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Oh my God.

826
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
He's very Santa-esque.

827
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
There has to have been a Lucasfilm party where he dressed up like Santa.

828
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
George Lucas Santa Claus.

829
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
People have done, no, no one's done art of this really.

830
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
People have dressed up adult Grogu, AKA Yoda.

831
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:53,000
That's, that's when you know, it's really like fully taken over when Yoda becomes adult Grogu.

832
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Right.

833
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm seeing fan art of George's Yoda.

834
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I'm seeing fan art of George's Modoc, the Marvel character.

835
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
That's just a giant head and tiny arms and feet and legs.

836
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Oh, oh, wait, wait.

837
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I am seeing a little Photoshopped.

838
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Here we go.

839
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It's not completely what we want, but it's close here.

840
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
See right here.

841
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Well, that's pretty terrible.

842
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
It's bad.

843
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That is Lucas's head comped the wrong way into Santa's sleigh.

844
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
There is a guy here who's dressed like George Lucas getting a picture with Vader.

845
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So we're just change it.

846
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The other let's go the other way and change up the holiday tradition.

847
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Can we go make Christmas wishes on George Lucas's lap?

848
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Oh, my gosh.

849
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The malls dress up as George Lucas.

850
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Same beards.

851
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You just have to buy a lot of like, you know, striped patterned shirts and blazers.

852
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I think that would be yeah.

853
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I mean, do they have to be Star Wars wishes or they can be any sort of like present wish?

854
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Hmm.

855
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I guess.

856
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Yeah, that's a good.

857
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Maybe you don't limit it.

858
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Maybe it can be any wish.

859
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
For sure.

860
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
If you want a Star Wars toy, yeah, we go talk to or I guess you could also ask for like

861
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
American graffiti dolls or something.

862
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah.

863
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Red Red Tails.

864
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Tails.

865
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Indiana Jones.

866
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Howard the Duck.

867
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
T H X 1 1 3.

868
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Or just will or you just want like details about the wills, which in case you don't know,

869
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:34,000
George was going to make seven, eight, nine about these mic like ultra microscopic beings

870
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
called the wills.

871
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I'm still a little unclear on what they were, but they were like the micro by like, I don't

872
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
know, microbial world or something is what he said.

873
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Smaller than midi chlorine.

874
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I believe that's right.

875
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Lake.

876
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And midi chlorines are back on the Mandalorian.

877
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So very excited about that.

878
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Wow.

879
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Wow.

880
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I gotta get caught up.

881
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Big Rosario Dawson fan.

882
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So happy to see her popping up.

883
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
In every part of the Buffalo, they're tying it all together.

884
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Well, I mean, it may is a good way.

885
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
We clearly want Lucas to be doing more and to be active and doing something.

886
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Can we convince Lucas to tell the Santa story instead and just give him like we're just

887
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
spitballing here.

888
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But the starting point is King Kong takes over as Santa due to the Santa Claus.

889
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
We'd bring that concept over from the Santa Claus franchise.

890
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It remains to be seen if we're going to use Jack Frost or not.

891
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
But, you know, feel free to just put the wills on top of it.

892
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It's really all up to you.

893
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes.

894
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
We got to get to George.

895
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It feels like George has a lot of time on his hands.

896
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So, yeah, come on, George.

897
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Let's do this.

898
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I got a trilogy of Santa and potentially King Kong related films.

899
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Come on, George.

900
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Make him in your garage.

901
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Make it as we said, Billy Toppett quality.

902
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah, I would love it if George just in 2020 discovered like mumble core and just made a

903
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
movie of like semi improvised movie of like, oh, it's young people in the city trying to

904
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
make it.

905
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And they're just figuring it out.

906
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
When will he make the American Graffiti sequel trilogy with the same characters?

907
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
You know, has he talked about that?

908
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Oh, that would be fun.

909
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Or the 80 year old seeing their kids and then but then also going backwards and seeing their

910
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
parents.

911
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Right.

912
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Mm hmm.

913
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
80 year old Harrison Ford drag racing.

914
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Mm hmm.

915
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Well, that sounds good, actually.

916
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah, I'm on board because there was an American Graffiti sequel.

917
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yes.

918
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Yeah.

919
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
More American Graffiti.

920
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Yes.

921
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Was there a big I don't think there was a big chill sequel.

922
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I think you need to tie in the boomer verse.

923
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I need I like the boomer verse.

924
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Does that include then what's the Alan Arkin, the Kaminsky method?

925
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Yes, Kaminsky method is in the boomer verse for sure.

926
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I think that's all part of the it's all part of the boomer verse.

927
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Yeah, we should really detail a map of where it goes.

928
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And yeah, which then the timeline where each movie and TV show lands.

929
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
You got to get an Albert Brooks in their conception.

930
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I'm putting together a team for my next movie and it's Albert Brooks from real life or modern

931
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
romance, I guess, whichever.

932
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Either way.

933
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah, geez.

934
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
There's so many great extended universe ideas here.

935
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So many great holiday overlays here.

936
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
We want Santa hats on everything.

937
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I want them to do it even though we can't go to the parks.

938
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I want them to now more than ever go put Santa hats on characters, take pictures of them,

939
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
put them on Instagram.

940
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Let us know that the robots are safe.

941
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
We want to know that they're OK, like that they aren't just like rusting into disrepair

942
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
All of these robots are just sitting stagnant, at least in Los Angeles.

943
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Mm hmm.

944
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yes.

945
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Please show us pictures.

946
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Obviously, like on the jingle cruise, they did a little of this, but we want it expanded

947
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
and then like, oh, yeah, let's let's go other holidays, too.

948
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Let's do a little more.

949
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I guess I think this will still be a tease for a very soon episode.

950
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Let's get a little more maybe Hanukkah representation also as well.

951
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I know there's not as it's a Santa hat is a very iconic thing of the season, but maybe

952
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
some characters holding a menorah, you know?

953
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Yeah, absolutely.

954
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
One of the pirates instead of a gun is holding a menorah at the end of the ride,

955
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
sewing in a menorah around that's on fire.

956
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So do that.

957
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yeah.

958
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah.

959
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Are there any structures that would make sense to turn into giant dreidels?

960
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
That's a very good question.

961
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I'm not prepared at all for this, but I'm going to try to pull one out here.

962
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It's gone, but the horizon's building.

963
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Yeah.

964
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I feel like that's easy.

965
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Mm hmm.

966
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Yeah.

967
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
What what like goes down at the bottom?

968
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Right.

969
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
With a point.

970
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Yeah.

971
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I mean, maybe.

972
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Hmm.

973
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I'm trying to think here.

974
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You could do it with.

975
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
What's like a square building?

976
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I guardians the guardians towers.

977
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
You could maybe sort of suggest it because they're sort of in a tall shape.

978
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And you put like, you know, you do those projections like they do those projection shows in France,

979
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
and they can make sort of whatever they want on the building temporarily turned it into.

980
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah.

981
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Yeah.

982
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Well, and you do those.

983
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
You go up and down in there with Monica music playing.

984
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
That's pretty fun.

985
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Right.

986
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So then.

987
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yeah.

988
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And then change.

989
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
She like a character into the mench on a bench or something, you know, whatever.

990
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
More mench on a bench representation.

991
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yeah.

992
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Into the parks.

993
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That does feel like something that would end up in six flags.

994
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh, yeah.

995
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
We've aligned with mench on a bench media.

996
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Mench on a bench is like the biggest IP they have other than Looney Tunes.

997
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I guess the DC characters, but then it's more relevant currently in a way.

998
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Yeah.

999
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yes.

1000
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I think that's right.

1001
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Kids go nuts.

1002
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Wow.

1003
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It's mench on a bench.

1004
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Seeing mench on a bench with the six flags man would be just below people's minds.

1005
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Oh, you talk about meetups and team ups and putting together a team.

1006
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Right.

1007
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So maybe that maybe, you know, Mr. Six gets up and starts dancing and having a lot of fun.

1008
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Maybe that's what finally propels the mench off of the bench.

1009
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Gets them up and start dancing.

1010
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Yeah, I think that's good.

1011
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Is the mench a rabbi?

1012
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I know this is that we're probably wrapping up, but is this is is he an actual rabbi or is he just Jewish and he's a mench?

1013
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Just a good man.

1014
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yeah.

1015
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah.

1016
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah.

1017
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Is he actually a hmm.

1018
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I don't know.

1019
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I don't have it.

1020
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Well, he's wearing, you know, like the I don't I'm not going to.

1021
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I'm going to use the wrong words, but you know, he's got like the the drapes over and forgive me for not knowing the term.

1022
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I don't know the term either.

1023
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I apologize.

1024
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
But I see this the mench on a bench is a talking rabbi doll.

1025
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Yes, he is a rabbi.

1026
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Okay.

1027
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Okay.

1028
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Mench on a bench has a bunch of friends also.

1029
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I don't know how we have we not talked about this before, especially considering that it's born from Shark Tank.

1030
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
And I think one of you is a shark tank.

1031
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Oh, wow.

1032
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
If not both.

1033
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Yeah.

1035
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah.

1036
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Look, he's got he's got a blue.

1037
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh, my God.

1038
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Whoa.

1039
00:56:47,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Moose with a stuffed blue moose and his antlers are all Menorah lights and a little dog who's got, you know, the little like like patch at the spot on his eye.

1040
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And one of them is a Menorah.

1041
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Wow.

1042
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yes.

1043
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And I believe that's a Maccabee behind him.

1044
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Oh, wow.

1045
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
A warrior.

1046
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh, yeah.

1047
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Star Dale's David shield.

1048
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The moose has Menorah antlers and the dog has the dreidel eye patch.

1049
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah.

1050
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Yeah.

1051
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Wow.

1052
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
We got a we this is this is an episode, obviously.

1053
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I. Yeah.

1054
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Oh, my God.

1055
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Okay.

1056
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Most of the men I didn't know his name wasn't mentioned a bench.

1057
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Most of the mench mitzvah moose ask papa is his name.

1058
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Ask Papa.

1059
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Wow.

1060
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Good advice.

1061
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Good advice.

1062
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah.

1063
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Hannah, the Hanukkah hero.

1064
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I guess that's the Maccabee dreidel dog.

1065
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Dreidel dog.

1066
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Wow.

1067
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Oh, boy.

1068
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
This cuddly dreidel spotted Dalmatian is the perfect gift.

1069
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Plus, his special bandana even has a secret pocket to hold your dreidel.

1070
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Wow.

1071
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Dreidel dog has a pocket.

1072
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
No, all of his spots are dreidels.

1073
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1074
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Yeah.

1075
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Wow.

1076
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Are we are we rubes for not knowing?

1077
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Is this is the entire audience completely already in love with the mench on a bench gang?

1078
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Right.

1079
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And we and we just this seems like the most obvious thing in the world to all.

1080
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
No, I think the mench on a bench verse is pretty new.

1081
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I feel like it was a success after they got the initial shark tank buzz and they've expanded.

1082
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Also, the dreidel dog mentioned a bark mitzvah.

1083
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Oh, it did.

1084
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And I mean, I just.

1085
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Oh, wow.

1086
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
It did.

1087
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
This is great.

1088
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
This is all great.

1089
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Well, guys, I think we found our topic for next holiday season.

1090
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I think so.

1091
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
On a bench verse.

1092
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It's nice to know.

1093
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
It's nice to have a foot in the door this far out.

1094
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Yeah.

1095
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
You know, yeah, let's start thinking about Hanukkah 2021 and wrap up this holiday season

1096
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
of 2020.

1097
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You survived podcast, the ride, the second gate.

1098
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I can't wait.

1099
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Oh, my God.

1100
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
We're going to we have a whole year to learn about all of our new best friends.

1101
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Yeah, I hope they make up new.

1102
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah, I hope new characters become introduced into this universe as well in the next 12

1103
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
months.

1104
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
They could fit a lot in.

1105
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah.

1106
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah, that'll this will serve as a time capsule when there were only the six or whatever it

1107
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
was.

1108
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Which which shark was it?

1109
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Because I remember this is one where they laughed.

1110
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
They scoffed at first.

1111
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
This is the silliest thing ever.

1112
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And then somebody saw the sparks and heard the sails and they knew that there was something

1113
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
to mention on a band.

1114
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Now it's like one of the most famous shark tank products.

1115
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1116
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I guess Jason's the watcher.

1117
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I only have seen a little bit of shark tank.

1118
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Was it was it Mr. Wonderful?

1119
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Wait, I found it.

1120
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It is a this is a Robert and Laurie Jam.

1121
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
This is a Robert.

1122
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Wow, that's a powerful team.

1123
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Yeah.

1124
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Yeah.

1125
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Two of my favorites.

1126
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I'd put them in the in the top half in the shark.

1127
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yes.

1128
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
They certainly shot up the charts by the fact that neither of their spouses are being investigated

1129
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
for boat homicide.

1130
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I don't know which one you're referring to.

1131
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I believe it was is Kevin O'Leary, Mr. Wonderful.

1132
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Yeah.

1133
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Yeah, I think.

1134
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Oh, no.

1135
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Mrs. Wonderful.

1136
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah, this is wonderful.

1137
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Allegedly, allegedly.

1138
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
OK, well, we'll also revisit that case and see where it's at next year.

1139
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
See if there's been any leads.

1140
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
But oh, boy.

1141
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So it's something to look forward to.

1142
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I hope something to look forward to next holiday season is the ability to see people or do anything.

1143
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
That would be that would be nice.

1144
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It looks like that will be the case.

1145
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I'll say that.

1146
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I believe I believe so.

1147
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
We have to hope so.

1148
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:14,000
But in the meantime, as we close out podcast the ride for the year, I probably said some of this on another episode.

1149
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
But thank you so much for and you, especially the second gate listeners.

1150
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Thanks for sticking around and supporting us all year and causing us to have a lot of fun.

1151
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Some of the only fun, I think, that any of us have right.

1152
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Probably are forced.

1153
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah.

1154
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So thanks for giving us a reason.

1155
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It's yeah.

1156
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Hey, I was going to say it's been a great year.

1157
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I don't know if that's accurate, but we've done our best.

1158
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Content wise, we've done some good stuff and there's been a great I would think there's some great stuff that way.

1159
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:54,000
But as far as the year itself, I would never ever put great and year together talking about this year.

1160
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Yeah, I think I've been thinking about my son being born this year and how I'm going to be filling out forms his whole life that say 2020.

1161
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Wow.

1162
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
The second two, I'm just going to be like shaking like having flashbacks.

1163
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Maybe you just end all over the paper.

1164
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Can you just say like, say he was born a year earlier?

1165
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Can I? Yeah.

1166
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Can I cheat?

1167
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I mean, people do that for.

1168
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Oh, yeah.

1169
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I guess it'll be weird because it'll be like a year ahead of all the kids in school.

1170
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Well, it's you know, like, I mean, like old people start switching the years up for unknown reasons.

1171
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Hey, famously David Brenner lied about his age for years.

1172
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
We all know that story.

1173
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Famously.

1174
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
We all famously.

1175
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Comedian David Brenner, who he was lying like by five to seven years, I think, because he when he was a comic, when he was a young comic, people thought he worried like he was too old.

1176
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So he lied and said he was younger.

1177
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Oh, that's like Laurence Fishburne lied about.

1178
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
He was too young.

1179
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
He lied about his age, right?

1180
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
To get an apocalypse.

1181
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
There's also another thing I've been meaning to bring up on podcast.

1182
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Right. There's also a debate about how old Charo is.

1183
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Some people think Charo like there's a 10 year discrepancy.

1184
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
There Charo's like 80, like 85 or 75.

1185
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I think she's older just because of how long she's been around.

1186
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
But, you know, this is another controversy that I've been reading about online.

1187
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Some of the teases of what will.

1188
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Here's what's on tap for next year.

1189
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
How old is Charo really?

1190
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Follow Charo on Twitter, though.

1191
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
She gives a lot of updates still to this day.

1192
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And it's fun.

1193
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Mike, you've got me thinking now because I was about to bring up that.

1194
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Like I saw a lot of people saying the unofficial anthem for 2020 is the Mountain Goat song this year.

1195
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm going to make it through this year.

1196
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
If it kills me, would love to hear a Charo cover of that.

1197
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Sure.

1198
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
With the she plays flamenco guitar.

1199
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
She's a brilliant flamenco guitarist.

1200
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So at the very least.

1201
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
That sounds awesome.

1202
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Just do it on flamenco guitar.

1203
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Yeah.

1204
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Yeah.

1205
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
So then we can end the year on a high note.

1206
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Only then we need you, Charo.

1207
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:16,000
If I could, if I could get Charo to dub in the synthetic string flamenco strings I have on this theme for the second gate.

1208
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And Charo actually plays the do, do, do, do, do, do, do part of the song.

1209
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I think that would take it maybe to another level.

1210
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
If we could debut a new, a revamped second gate theme done by Charo.

1211
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Done by Charo, which I assume most of the listeners know what we're talking about.

1212
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
She'd have to do the five, four, three, two, one too, I think.

1213
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Oh my God. Yes.

1214
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Yeah.

1215
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Yeah.

1216
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
This is actually probably not that impossible to do.

1217
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I wouldn't say so.

1218
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
No.

1219
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I have a photo with Charo.

1220
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Do you?

1221
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Some odd thing.

1222
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I don't remember why.

1223
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Wow.

1224
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Sure.

1225
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I was just watching the longest, I know we're ending the episode.

1226
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I was watching a 15 minute clip of Desi Arnaz on the Johnny Carson Tonight Show where he's boring Bob Hope and Don Rickles with stories about Xavier Kuget and talking about Charo and how cheap.

1227
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Now I think listeners know, you know, we're hovering around 40% of the people in this story.

1228
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Yeah.

1229
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Bob Hope and Rickles, I think for sure.

1230
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Yeah.

1231
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yeah.

1232
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And Arnaz, yeah.

1233
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:33,000
But he, my God, he was boring these guys with how cheap Xavier Kuget was and that like Charo was trying to steal his money, he said.

1234
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And I was in heaven watching this garbage.

1235
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Kids today, all the kids are talking about Grogu.

1236
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Why isn't anybody talking about Charo?

1237
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Kuget.

1238
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Kuget.

1239
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Kuget.

1240
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Xavier Kuget.

1241
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Yeah, this is really where the kids head should be at.

1242
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Well, we'll get it.

1243
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
We'll get kids head on heads on straight.

1244
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
2021, we're gonna, we're taking it all back.

1245
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
We're gonna set it all right.

1246
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Stay tuned here to the second gate in 2021.

1247
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Fun stuff in the works as always and Mention on a Bench in December 2021.

1248
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
For all of us at Podcast the Ride.

1249
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Let's wrap this Europe and good night.
