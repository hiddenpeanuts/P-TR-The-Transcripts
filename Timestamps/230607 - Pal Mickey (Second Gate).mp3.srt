1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Touch points and trigger points.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
These are the topics today.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is in the tree of things we'll discuss.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're on podcast, The Ride, The Second Gate.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What are they? Why are they?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, we'll have to find out with the help of me,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Scott Gardner, as well as Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, I'm here. Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hi, yeah, I was trying to think of a joke of like,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
when we're by microphones, we tell you facts about the theme park.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But if we're away from the microphones,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and you squeeze our hands or poke our bellies,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
we tell corny jokes.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We sort of are, we really are modern day pal Mickey's, aren't we?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
With our facts and our jokes.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, that's true.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's really what this whole thing is.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We didn't realize that we were ripping off this entire format from a toy from 20 years ago.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And now that we know this, we must apologize.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And then to the show, you've survived.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
All the show.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Podcast The Ride.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We're so sorry if we'd only known we'd stolen it from a toy.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Pal Mickey is the topic today.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And we learned about, I learned about it.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I didn't know about this at all.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I learned about it in the Ian Riccobani episode.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
On the main feed. Yeah, I didn't know either.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Jason brought this up and I was very excited about it.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But yeah, I was not familiar with my friend, my pal.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He wasn't our pal. Yeah, I mean, he's our pal, but not this per...

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We weren't pals with this pal.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Right.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I have a clip and it's from the top seven must see things with Krissa.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Krissa, who predated Stacey on the Inruin television.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And she was the one who, like in the middle of a list of like exciting things you can do at Disney World, told you about Pal Mickey.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Here it is. Go ahead, Krissa.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Put the speaker to the...

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is Pal Mickey.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hiya, pal. My name is Mickey.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Mickey Mouse.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So what does he do?

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, rent or buy Pal Mickey at the gift shop of your resort or at any of the poor Walt Disney World theme parks.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And he becomes your private tour guide.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can hardly wait to show you around.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He tells you about parades and showtimes, recommends attractions, shares fun facts, plays games with you.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He's the ultimate insider. He can even tell you about where to find your other Disney pals.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The Hall of Fame. You know, Minnie's usually here about now and she'd love to see you.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What do you say? The Hall of Fame?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The Hall of Fame.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The Hall of Fame.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What is that?

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why did he say that?

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What is the Hall of Fame?

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And then the next thing he said didn't have anything to do with that.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Did it?

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Minnie's, Minnie's always here to see you.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She's usually there.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Wait, Jason, what's the Hall of Fame?

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't know. It was probably like a Toontown Fair meet and greet.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, and like, what, this came out in 2008?

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No, this is 2003. They stopped selling them in 2008.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What was happening in the video when that happened?

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
They're standing in front of the castle.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The partner statue.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, they're about.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This thing's supposed to tell us facts about the park and yet he thinks that the castle is called the Hall of Fame?

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This toy's a fucking dumbass.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So this is a toy that was basically going to act as like your Genie Plus, essentially.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What they promised for Genie Plus was, plus, Genie Plush.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It was Genie Plush.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Mickey Plush that would tell you like tips, as they said, tips, facts about the rides.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It would be your all knowing insider guide.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, it was a little plush and you would carry it around and you could buy it for $65.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Right.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Or you could rent it for $8 a day.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Rent a toy?

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
With a $50 deposit.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You had to return it the next day, I believe.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
In what? If you're assuming this is for a child and maybe a lot of them were not.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But if you're, I am not, I'm not going to rent a toy.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm not going to rent a toy that was rented by some other grubby kid the day before.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, communal plush.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So you would spend, wait, so it would be a $24 rental?

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So you'd spend $8 to spend the night with the Mickey plush?

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, it was a magical day.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, return it by noon the following day.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So you got a morning.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So wait a minute.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's so weird.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Maybe there was a day in between.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I bet there was like a cleaning or at least a like you sit in the corner and maybe your germs will dissipate.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Or they just turned around and handed it to another kid.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sure they did something that was supposed to disinfect it, but I don't, it's still too gross.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They just blasted it with a Lysol spray?

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, maybe.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Put it in a Lysol shower.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh yeah, hit me with that Lysol.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hit me with another blast.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What complicated by inside of Pal Mickey was a microprocessor, a speaker, three AAA batteries and three squeeze sensors.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
One in each hand and one in the belly.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Jason, how many squeeze sensors are in your human body?

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh, too many.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Our human body has so many squeeze sensors.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The infrared receiver was in its nose.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I missed one touch points trigger points squeeze sensors.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So Mickey would sometimes just talk if he was near something or you could make him talk by squeezing parts of him.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, let's slow down.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's slow down.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When you're near something, he would vibrate and giggle.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What do you think about that Scott?

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I was thinking about you.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was like, oh, I wonder what Scott had to say about that.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm like, oh, I wonder what Scott had to say about that.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm like, oh, I wonder what Scott had to say about that.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Loud old cell phone.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
F***!

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Did you know that the park is equipped with trash cans?

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If you have garbage you could put in the morning.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So you'd have to pick him up like a phone in order to hear what fact he was going to say.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, you would like I saw one video that said the speakers were behind the eyes, which is also a funny statement.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's funny.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mickey's yelling at me through his eyes.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Mickey's giggling.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He's giggling through his eyes.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Where was the vibrating feature?

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I couldn't tell.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well, let's eliminate.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We know that if the infrared receiver is in its nose and the squeeze sensors are in each hand and a belly.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Right.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So it can't be in those.

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So what's left?

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Maybe just kind of the well, we got the seat.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The seat area.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, maybe his seat is vibrating.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And so they put that like a cell phone vibrating thing in the seat.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And that's how you would know he was going to say something.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is where I live.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Just like regular places.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You can put it wherever you want.

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's fine.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This bench is like Walt's.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you know about the bench?

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can sit on it.

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Lay on it.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't fall asleep on it.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Do not.

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You just for when you get back to bed.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Could you put him on silent?

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I guess you could turn him off.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I would switch him on and off.

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah.

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So that doesn't work.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Did you know my off function doesn't work?

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll do this all night.

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You might go to sleep, but I won't.

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Did anyone buy this?

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I've never heard of it before.

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It lasted for five years and it sounds like one was supported for longer.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,500
It was supported until 2014 and someone on WDW magic was very clearly pointed out like

168
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,000
supported means that it might work longer than that.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But if it breaks, you know, if the stuff in the parks breaks, we're not going to repair it.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You mean the what sends out the infrared, the info.

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All right.

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So if the infrared we support the vibrating Mickey's, but if the infrareds break, then

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
they're broke.

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I just meaning as much of like, oh, this this probably won't work in the park anymore.

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So mainly.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay.

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So this was if you're in the Disney parks, there are infrared things, somethings, transmitters,

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
transmitters, transmitters, around now mostly by RFID.

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's what they use in the magic bands and like the apps in your phone.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But you would have these things would have been around until they started breaking one

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
by one.

185
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So the idea was that lost another one.

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's it.

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Now only three freaks still have these.

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But so if you're in the parks, then maybe Mickey's vibrating with pleasure about the

189
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
fun facts that he gets to tell you and encouraging you to touch his trigger points.

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But if this isn't happening, if you're back at if you're back at home, if you're off the

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
campus, then now all it does is tell you jokes.

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So it could still work, but that's that location specific thing.

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
They've just slowly let die.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The whole draw.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I mean, there's other talking Mickey dolls that have happened over the years.

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So the only the main draw then is gone.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah.

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But but there's videos of someone in Epcot in 2014 and it's working.

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And then there's 10 years ago.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So that's 10 years ago.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But just in May of 2023, a YouTuber named Chris, the girl took a pal Mickey to Magic

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Kingdom and Animal Kingdom and it still worked.

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
OK, well, take it back.

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So there were still spots and like it would say it would talk about stuff that wasn't

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
there anymore.

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, like it would talk about stuff that's gone.

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Really?

209
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Like what?

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I got what was going in Magic Kingdom.

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I know why.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes.

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Scary stuff like that.

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Mr. Todd, why is that?

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It'll be forever.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Every day.

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Check out any of the many smokers.

218
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Light them up.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Just don't burn them off on me.

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Where's my touch points?

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It had a lot to say about Dino Rama and Animal Kingdom, which is mostly construction walls

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
at this point, because they've demolished a lot of it.

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You know, this treasure planet meet and greet.

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You really got to see it.

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You got to meet all your friends.

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're playing John's song by John Resnick.

227
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's really good.

228
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm so excited for Home on the Range.

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The Range at Roseanne is so funny.

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
My words.

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Disney Company will support Roseanne and everything she says for her.

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I found on all ears.net a weird thing they used to say in Hollywood studios when who

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
wants to be a millionaire would be there.

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It would say, seems like lots of people want to be millionaires, but with friends like

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
you, I am rich enough.

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What?

237
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You might say that.

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's something you say on your deathbed.

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah.

240
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Seems like lots of people want to be millionaires, but with friends like you, I am rich enough.

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Mickey, you're fucking loaded.

242
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's easy for you.

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Of course.

244
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, you can say that.

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah.

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's not a two way street.

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I like you.

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I like your fun facts.

250
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Thanks for telling me when the parades are.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But I'd still like some of that sweet coin, my man.

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah.

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I had a star since 1928.

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If you're a pal, fucking pay up.

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
How good of a pal are you, man?

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I paid $65 to buy you.

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I think you can do is buy me a house.

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah.

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I saw a video clip where he talks about like the windows on Main Street and he's like,

260
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
a lot of these people helped build these parks.

261
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't see my name up there.

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh, I guess they gave me the whole Toontown fair area.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay.

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He actually said that?

265
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What?

266
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, he was mad.

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He was mad that he didn't have a window on Main Street.

268
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This is literally, he is doing what I would do to girlfriends who are less interested

269
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
than people I know now or my now wife.

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Like, hey, like that's literally a thing.

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Like now look up there.

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Those windows are who cares?

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Shut up.

274
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Mickey.

275
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Pal Mickey is a recreation of me at 19 saying my facts to no interested audience.

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And you know what?

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's a lot more.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's similar in another way to you probably were vibrating with excitement so much and

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
that you were waiting for somebody to say, oh, do you have a fact about this?

280
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And then you would give the fact.

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Maybe.

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's also what I sounded like at 19.

283
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You're shaking.

284
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Are you okay?

285
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Scott, are you very sick?

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I just have facts and you can see.

287
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There's so many facts in me.

288
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Touch my points.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The OmniMover and the Hologram.

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Relieve my pressure.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Jason, you did not have a pal Mickey, right?

292
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You're too old for this.

293
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
No, I didn't have a pal Mickey.

294
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Was it on your radar?

295
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You're never too old for a pal.

296
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You're never too old for your pal.

297
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The ultimate insider.

298
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Was it on your radar?

299
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It wasn't on my radar.

300
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No.

301
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I recently learned about this as well.

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
All the radars are broken.

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So it can't be on anyone's radar.

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Maybe not.

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I mean, I've been on a couple on eBay.

306
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I haven't gotten any wins yet.

307
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So you're bidding on pal Mickey.

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, there's a bunch of pal Mickey's on eBay.

309
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Some of them open anywhere between eight and like 50 bucks.

310
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, 50 bucks has to be in box, right?

311
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I think there's a $30 one that's like in box.

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The other one is a loose pal Mickey.

313
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You can get the dirtiest pal Mickey that's like eight bucks.

314
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I was hoping like, oh, if I win this one, I'll be hoping for heat wave

315
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and leave it a plastic bag in the trunk to de-louse it.

316
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
My parents brought out a tub of plush from my childhood when they moved out here.

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And it is, it's they've been played with for years and I'm sure my spit is all over them.

318
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Not because I was kissing them, but because just like sleeping with them and we got it.

319
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I was kissing them, honestly.

320
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But like imagine you'd have to be you'd have to kiss the whole body for it to get that for it to get that sticky discolored.

321
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Say you were drooling in your sleep and just the way that the plush was,

322
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
the drool would drip down and then you would roll like roll around in the middle of your sleep.

323
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Like the drool could have potentially gotten to any parts of the plush's body.

324
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It was dripping drool, not kisses.

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for that detailed description of drool sleep.

326
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
My drool can drip into every crevice.

327
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How my plush got so weird.

328
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Well, I think also some of that material, like they weren't necessarily thinking like,

329
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
how will this age? What will it be like? That's true.

330
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
10, 20, 30 years.

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We've got my original sleepy time Ernie in the living room now that my daughter is playing with,

332
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
which is very cute.

333
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But it is also like I hope there's not some bacteria that's been living in this thing for 35 years or whatever.

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It looks OK, though. Oh, no, he looks like he's been in a fire.

335
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This is yeah. Yeah. When I had my son, my parents very nicely were like, hey, we went and found the old Ernie and Bert puppets.

336
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah. We pulled them out. And I like this is very nice.

337
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And then I when I saw the condition they were in, I'm like, I nice gesture, but I don't want my son to die.

338
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Do they stink?

339
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Because some stuff that's hard plastic as it ages, it kind of smells.

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I didn't really do a stink test. I don't think that was mainly the problem.

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
All right. So I can say that nice thing about trying to say like, people really when they see this Ernie, they get very scared.

342
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They're horrified by him. God, he's got his crotch has been ripped open.

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He's missing his buttons. His eyes are like just deteriorated.

344
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He's like the blacks of his eyes and you didn't hear it. You didn't have been ripped off.

345
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You didn't kiss him so hard in his crotch that you ripped it off.

346
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's be clear about that. I didn't. It wasn't.

347
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It wasn't a crotch kiss rip. It was not that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But I used to take I used to use him as like a Ghostbuster ghost busting wand.

349
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There's a video of me running around with him using his arms like shooting ghosts and stuff.

350
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
OK, so I would use he would he was all versatile plush.

351
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I wouldn't just use him as Ernie, the character.

352
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He was sometimes a piece of equipment.

353
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Sometimes he was a hose, an imaginative hose, supernatural hose.

354
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, yes. Well, you got to be careful on those eBay's because, you know, like, all right.

355
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, I know that the touch points are if you say you can tell me the touch points were in good condition.

356
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But what if the what if the trigger points aren't what I didn't come across?

357
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What's your vibrating speed? I saw that on some website.

358
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I copy and pasted from something.

359
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Pal Mickey had three touch points, one in each hand and one in his one in his belly.

360
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
When Pal Mickey's adorable little body would.

361
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Hey, I don't know that I read this again after copy and pasting it.

362
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Whenever Pal Mickey's adorable little body would, I guess, do you have to all right, would giggle and vibrate.

363
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
There's no lie there.

364
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I guess it's it's editorializing and he's smaller than you think.

365
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
All that electronics in him, you know, I don't look something about it.

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It feels like adorable is assisting the word little like the little is what is adorable about him.

367
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And I just find that strange in the case of this.

368
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I think the show is down a number on those words for you.

369
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There's a lot of words that are very loaded.

370
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I mean, look at me. I was I was coming in.

371
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But I had so much self imbued into the word hammered.

372
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I was bringing so much to the table because how much of how much I expect that any normal word to get right exploded in a creepy way on the show.

373
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Anyway, when Pal Mickey's adorable little body would giggle and vibrate, that was his way of letting his owner know that he had something to say.

374
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Again, now we're I don't know what I pulled this from.

375
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Now that we're bringing that is that he's owned by someone into the picture.

376
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Your pal. Yeah.

377
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Owner. Excuse me.

378
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Owner. Did you know this boat runs till 9 p.m.?

379
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, I'm trying to think of a better version like boss, like employee.

380
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Your employee lets you know that he has a fact.

381
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Well, hey, boss, boss.

382
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Friend.

383
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So that is well, it's like getting a VIP tour guide for the day and you pay that person or the entity that pays the person.

384
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So, yeah, I guess so.

385
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Pal Mickey's your tour. Yeah.

386
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Pal Mickey's your employee because you don't own the tour guide.

387
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You can't if you're viewing it like that, even if I hope for the next few hours, I own you.

388
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
No, that's not cool. Wrong.

389
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Don't say that to a tour guide.

390
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Do not say that.

391
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Because this predates smartphones and they, you know, by 2014 or so, a lot of people have them.

392
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Mm hmm.

393
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So there's an alternate version where we just all had different plushes that told us things.

394
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's where we went.

395
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Wished for all of it.

396
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Just like really kind of like, you know, like hipsters or business people on the go all have to have like the account with them or a stitch or.

397
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh, yeah.

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Who would you have picked?

399
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Say cell phones don't exist and you have to have pal so and so.

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And I have to pick a pal.

401
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You have to pick a pal and it can't be like too obscure because these are made by big companies.

402
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So I want to be realistic in our choices.

403
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So, so.

404
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Well, there were other ones.

405
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There were beta tests or like early ones.

406
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's fine.

407
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This is hypothetical.

408
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is where we're describing an alternate dimension where phones are not invented, where Steve Jobs failed.

409
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes.

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
He didn't invent phones, but he, you know, we know what I'm saying.

411
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Smart phones.

412
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Mr. Blackberry didn't invent a black.

413
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah.

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, that's in that movie didn't happen.

415
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Right.

416
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So in this version, the only way we can access information about our world and then also place causes through a plush.

417
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The other part is not so obscure.

418
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So we can't do any of your turtle toys that are specific lines.

419
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It could be the main four.

420
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It could maybe be Shredder.

421
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It could maybe be be Bob or Rocksteady, but it doesn't get very deep.

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I guess I mean, I said the count and maybe I would stick with it if the count was giving me traffic instructions.

423
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh, that's all good.

424
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Turn in four point two miles.

425
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Uh huh.

426
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Or just or he had to like count any amount of he has to like go from one up to any number that you need.

427
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, if I'm wondering when I need to turn out of the four or five freeway, the count says, hmm, let's see.

428
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
One, two, three.

429
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Damn it.

430
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
He counts to four or five.

431
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yeah, it's all.

432
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah.

433
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Which freeway count do I need to go to?

434
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
One, two, three, four.

435
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're like, oh, you don't even know the answer.

436
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You got to wait.

437
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And then you're hoping it's the five, but it could be the five, six.

438
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
No, shit.

439
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And then it comes around.

440
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
99, 100, 101, 101, 101, 101, 10, maybe it's 110.

441
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
There's not a freeway 999 around here is there?

442
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Who?

443
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What are you doing?

444
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's a good question.

445
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I think that I am going to pick Tails from Sonic.

446
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Miles Tails, Prowr, Prowr, Prowr?

447
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What was his last name?

448
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He has a full name.

449
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
His name is Miles Tails.

450
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And I can't think of his last name.

451
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Is it Prowr or is it?

452
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's something like that.

453
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, I never quite knew how to say it.

454
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I feel like I just read it.

455
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Prowr.

456
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Prowr. Yeah, I'm right.

457
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Prowr.

458
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It sounded wrong to me.

459
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't know.

460
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
He's sort of like chill.

461
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
He's kind of got like a high voice, I think, which some people might say is whiny, but

462
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I feel like he's not getting in the way a lot.

463
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And I just also like aesthetically, I think maybe he was my favorite plush in my like,

464
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm not going to say I was going to say mid teens.

465
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's not the answer.

466
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Like he was my favorite plush in my preteens.

467
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I don't know.

468
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's not even a funny answer.

469
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah.

470
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Just like I started getting sad.

471
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I used to have so many favorite plushes.

472
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Now I got to give them to my daughter.

473
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I found the photo.

474
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Time has passed me by.

475
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah.

476
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
As we as he's recounted, his daughter has the hairless, eyeless Ernie.

477
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Show us this Ernie.

478
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Can you see it from here?

479
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Wow.

480
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's very like simplified.

481
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Does it feel like scratchy?

482
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Nice picture of her, by the way.

483
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's velty.

484
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah.

485
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I mean, it's not the softest plush in the world.

486
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's a little bit scratchy in places.

487
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
His hair certainly there's it's patchy.

488
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
He's missing pieces of it at the top.

489
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's real scratchy.

490
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
His smile is like it was a red piece of felt or something.

491
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And now it's been worn away into like white and his nose is still intact.

492
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
He still has his eyes.

493
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I actually, I was mixing up the Bert doll that I have like this that has his eyes completely

494
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
removed.

495
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That looks really scary.

496
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh, yikes.

497
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
He looks like a zombie Bert.

498
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So it was a fun idea.

499
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah.

500
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So anyway, Jason, you have an answer for this.

501
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What's sad one than a mine?

502
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I had a plush of him as a kid and I did like him.

503
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Alf.

504
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm familiar.

505
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah.

506
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I think Alf would be, I mean, Alf's usually in good spirits.

507
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh my God.

508
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That's a great answer.

509
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I actually should have chosen this.

510
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You got an appointment.

511
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Why haven't you left yet?

512
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You should have left 10 minutes ago.

513
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Better start working on your excuse for why you're running late.

514
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You're on your own with that one.

515
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
That's not what I do.

516
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
They're not going to believe that.

517
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Traffic in LA.

518
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay.

519
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yeah.

520
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That's every day here.

521
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
If you're not coming from El Segundo, that's not going to fly.

522
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Or from Melmac.

523
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm trying my best, Alf.

524
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You know, sometimes you have a harder time getting out of the house and you know, others.

525
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Your postmate just left.

526
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Oh God, I'm starving.

527
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I don't want to bother them.

528
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I told him not to come.

529
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Why?

530
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I didn't want to bother him.

531
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I felt bad.

532
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Seemed stressed.

533
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
He had more places to go.

534
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Don't bother with it.

535
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Eat this meal yourself.

536
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Eat this meal.

537
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Don't pay any attention to the meow coming from it.

538
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Into the big pot.

539
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You ordered a cat?

540
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I ordered from In-N-Out.

541
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They only have burgers and some plant-based ones or veggie ones.

542
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I know they don't serve cat burgers, Alf.

543
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:26,000
In-N-Out of the feline shelters where I prepared the meal.

544
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You misinterpreted.

545
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I did not tell you to go in and out of a place with cats.

546
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Take a cat while on the way.

547
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Hey, don't worry about it.

548
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm wearing sunglasses.

549
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Oh, you're right.

550
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
How can I stay mad at you?

551
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That was cool when Alf would wear sunglasses or like a cool jacket.

552
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Played rock and roll guitar.

553
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh, yeah.

554
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Always the best.

555
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Alf, Alf, new Alf Comic-Con exclusive toy coming soon.

556
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
He has a little Comic-Con bag and it says Cosmic-Con Mel Mackie and Cosmic-Con for his own.

557
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
He has things are a little different on Mel Mack.

558
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
They have their own Comic-Con and they call it something that's one letter off.

559
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's right.

560
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Right.

561
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Perfect.

562
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So I saw on again, all your stop net.

563
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
There was an interview with Eddie Soto and he talked about like, yeah, there are lots of different prototypes of this.

564
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It seems like the main one was a backpack of Jeannie that was like, yeah, yeah, because they were worried.

565
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
They were like, OK, this is gonna be a pain in the ass to carry around your like guide to Disney.

566
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
A backpack makes sense because you're holding a backpack anyway.

567
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You're wearing a backpack already.

568
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So let's make one who has Jeannie's face on it.

569
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
His eyes move and he talks.

570
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But then it's behind you.

571
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Well, I think that's what they run into.

572
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So you can't.

573
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So only the people you're with can see what it's doing and you can't hear it and it's loud everywhere.

574
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So that doesn't work.

575
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So that's out the window.

576
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Then they tried a beanie baby type wrist thing.

577
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
OK.

578
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Wear a beanie baby on your wrist.

579
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah.

580
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And it would vibrate.

581
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
We're still vibrating and points, but you have to then you would have to hold it up to your ear.

582
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah.

583
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Here what it had to say.

584
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
A watch phone or something.

585
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah.

586
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Well, that's the thing.

587
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
They're like, OK, we can't have a talk too louder.

588
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It'll startle people around you who don't know what that is.

589
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's about burgers.

590
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Was that a air raid siren?

591
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Is the part getting bombed?

592
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Is everyone dropping cover?

593
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
That's like making faces at me.

594
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's like when there's an amber alert on everyone's phone and it scares the shit out of everyone.

595
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
My phone goes at the same time.

596
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Same thing with Mickey.

597
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Everyone's like everyone in the party's beanie baby.

598
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
People like swarms as they get scared hitting into other people.

599
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You're on Pirates of the Caribbean and you knock somebody out of the boat.

600
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, shit.

601
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You're in the part where the mice jump or whatever onto you during the Indiana Jones ride.

602
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And you thought that actually happened because you're Mickey beanie baby.

603
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Just vibrate.

604
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Like a real mouse.

605
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Indiana Jones was played by Harrison Ford.

606
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The last to say it is business.

607
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So interesting.

608
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I got a game for you.

609
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I got a quick game for you.

610
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Which things that Indiana Jones take on his adventures with him?

611
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Was it a a gun?

612
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Did he just say the thing that I thought was going to be a gun?

613
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I don't think so.

614
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Which things that I thought was going to be a gun?

615
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Oh, I forgot.

616
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah, I think it was a gun.

617
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I think we're all going to get shot by a gun.

618
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah.

619
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I think you're all going to get shot by a gun.

620
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Was it a a gun?

621
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Was it a diary?

622
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Was it a whip?

623
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Was it a can of anchovies?

624
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Was it a letterman jacket?

625
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Was it a big turtle?

626
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Was it a big turtle?

627
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm the ride.

628
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Some rice you can cook if you found water.

629
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Put it in.

630
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The ride's been over for some.

631
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
We're in the parking lot.

632
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Double A.

633
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
A meat skewer.

634
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
There's a lot of choices, but I'm hung up that he took a gun and a whip,

635
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
so I don't know how to pick both.

636
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's a good point.

637
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
There's no way I took this.

638
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I have to start over.

639
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
This is such a bad idea when you do any couple minutes of thinking about it.

640
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Yeah.

641
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I understand why in hypothetical scenario you go,

642
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
oh, this is interesting.

643
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You bring something along that helps you.

644
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's a fun thing we can sell and it looks like our mascot.

645
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Two or three minutes of talking about it, you go, it's not going to work.

646
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It definitely feels like live beta testing.

647
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The thing that they didn't really hone in on that struck me was,

648
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
you got to carry around a plush.

649
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I mean, it's not that big, but it's like,

650
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
you got to carry around this giant fabric thing filled with mechanics.

651
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Probably made heavier by all of its trigger points and batteries and receivers.

652
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah, so it's heavier and it also rains every two hours.

653
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So like it's either going to get soaking wet or shorted.

654
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
If it rains, I die.

655
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Run, run, put me inside.

656
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Run, run.

657
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Shove me in your pants.

658
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I can't get wet.

659
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I can't.

660
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You don't understand.

661
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You're just going for the secondary.

662
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You're going to stay here, you cow.

663
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
This is dire.

664
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm going to light on fire.

665
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I have metal in me, not like you.

666
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I contain a pound of explosives.

667
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You don't understand.

668
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Okay, there's a clip on my back.

669
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You can wear me on a lanyard, but also they said in about four hours

670
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
going to experience what they called a Hurricane Andrew level storm.

671
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So choose wisely.

672
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
If I get rained on for more than 10 minutes, I turn into a grenade.

673
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Throw me away.

674
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Throw me over the nearest wall.

675
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
My God, Mickey, do you have, I know you've got facts about Haunted Mansion and you.

676
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Do you have the facts about why you were weaponized?

677
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Is that in that brain?

678
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Disney bought a bunch of grenades during the Gulf War.

679
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
They had to repurpose them.

680
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
They were bigger grenades, bigger than normal grenades.

681
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So they're still making grenades.

682
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
This was just their way to get rid of round one.

683
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah, this is the first round of grenades they bought.

684
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Somehow it was cheaper for them to buy the grenades than not buy the grenades.

685
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Grenades would give you a fact about the place you were in too before they blew up.

686
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It just made sense.

687
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's just to do it this way.

688
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Hey, there's thunder storms coming in tomorrow.

689
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You should drive me over to Universal Studios.

690
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm a company man.

691
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That was my idea of what could be a better use for me.

692
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
They'd have to smuggle in the transmitters to make this possible or make it like beam up to satellites or something.

693
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yeah.

694
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But if they made it so that you could take this to Universal and then and then he's going like,

695
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That one sucks.

696
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Boring.

697
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Snooze.

698
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'm just leaving now.

699
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Just cause I like this.

700
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It's probably Disney store nearby.

701
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You can buy one for more than me.

702
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You're just going to hurt from all those screams.

703
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
He would have different specific comments for different attractions.

704
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
He would be on the animal actors in the middle of a very specific point where dog or bird party goes,

705
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I've seen it.

706
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Boring.

707
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
He would hack a hole.

708
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Sadness.

709
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
They eat these animals after the show.

710
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Do you feel okay being a part of that?

711
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
There's blood on your hands.

712
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
There's blood on your hands.

713
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Better not get blood on me.

714
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You can't get blood on me.

715
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'll blow up.

716
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'll blow up twice as high.

717
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Rip-rat rocket.

718
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That thing don't look sturdy.

719
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Couple screws loose.

720
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
That's the last thing that would happen.

721
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You're a funeral guide.

722
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Plug me into the ride though if you want to go on it.

723
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Cause I can play some of the old hits.

724
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I can play the Mickey Mouse Club for you while you're on the ride.

725
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'll play better songs like Mick Minnie's You.

726
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'll whistle.

727
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'll just whistle for you.

728
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'll just whistle it all while you're on the ride.

729
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Universal should have done like a Shrek version.

730
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Shrek could have.

731
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That was much more in character.

732
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Shrek could have been Bodhi at the Magic Kingdom or something.

733
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I don't have a Shrek voice so I can't do a version of this.

734
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's a hard voice to do.

735
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Hey, Donkey!

736
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Donkey!

737
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Jason, can you just stab it?

738
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Donkey!

739
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
We should drive back to Universal Studios.

740
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It ended up in a Connery place but the start of it was fun.

741
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah.

742
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The risky ride.

743
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I should have said Shrek.

744
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I should have said a different character.

745
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Like a plush Lucille Ball from Universal that you could take to Magic Kingdom and she would make comments.

746
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You should have said Donkey.

747
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Then we could all be doing funny Donkey voices.

748
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
There was light in the audience.

749
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Oh wow, you're right.

750
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
What a mistake.

751
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I'll have to go back and fix that in post.

752
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I think I would have been really excited about Pal Mickey if I was little or if I ever knew about it.

753
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
If we were into this stuff and liked it.

754
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
If we were kids and we liked theme park facts and it can tell them to us.

755
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah, it's the early version of Harry Potter wands or any of the other stuff they're doing.

756
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I mean, that's the successful version.

757
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't really know if the Spider-Man gauntlets are expensive or expensive.

758
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I know they're expensive but I don't know if they're popular.

759
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm not sure if that kids are buying those for the new Spider-Man ride where you get like power upgrades and stuff.

760
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I feel like when I was there I saw that there was some sort of discount happening for them.

761
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But maybe there was a new thing as well.

762
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's like Disney Plus or any of the streamers.

763
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It is enormously successful.

764
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And shareholders, you're going to want to get in on this.

765
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's just to the moon.

766
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
These profits.

767
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
No, you can't see that.

768
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You cannot know.

769
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Don't look at the numbers.

770
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Why would you want to?

771
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I gave you the headline.

772
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Oh, yeah.

773
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
The company is now on the back of Disney Plus and the web shooters.

774
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Yeah, the web shooters.

775
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'd rather leave it to you to imagine the biggest number that you could possibly imagine.

776
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Isn't that more fun than if I told you one?

777
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah, don't look at.

778
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I mean, don't look at the low secret low numbers from Disney Plus and don't look at the secret high numbers from like movies and theaters.

779
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's just don't look at the real numbers.

780
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The numbers are all we do that for you.

781
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We save you that works.

782
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You can just you can just have fun and listen to cool stories.

783
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I said the thing we talked about this on air off.

784
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I can't remember where the rock was feuding with Warner Brothers after Black Adam and Rock was playing it just like a pro wrestler would going behind like politicking.

785
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And that's a long version of events of what happened.

786
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But ultimately, Rock started leaking documents because they said Black Adam wasn't popular or didn't make any money.

787
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And Rock was like, no, no, no.

788
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And you leaked a document that showed Black Adam made money, which I kind of think was real.

789
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yeah.

790
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And he was just giving up the game of like, here's how actually this stuff makes money when the lie has been.

791
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh, it's going to make whatever six times the budget or something.

792
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah.

793
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And I was like, yep, that's probably right.

794
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Cool. Yeah.

795
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Seems like what he was.

796
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:25,000
But it seems like he's an ally with the writers and the actors on his tequila at this point, which has been he touted on his Instagram maybe a week ago that it was.

797
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Selling better than Casamigos.

798
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So now we think that's true.

799
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Is he going to release the numbers?

800
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I would like to see the numbers.

801
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yeah.

802
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But I was like, who suddenly isn't willing to put out numbers?

803
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah.

804
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Interesting.

805
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
The tables have turned.

806
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Let's ask him.

807
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm staring at more that weird copy I was reading about.

808
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I was adorable.

809
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Little body would vibrate.

810
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The there's one more I'm staring at.

811
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
He was he was the first Disney toy who came to life in the arms of his holder.

812
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's weird.

813
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
His whole why it's it's not owner and it's not certainly not a holder.

814
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
His holder.

815
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I love you, holder.

816
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And his presence made it feel as though he was another member of the family on the trip, albeit one with more information, games and laughs than any of the human travelers.

817
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
He said, I love you, holder.

818
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
No, I said that.

819
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
He said 800 phrases and one of them was, I love you, holder.

820
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Well, we were looking for a term earlier employee and older is kind of generic.

821
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I hold her and I hope you hold me forever.

822
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm going to be honest with you.

823
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You're new.

824
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
God is commerce and I'm I represent commerce.

825
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Hold me.

826
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But I this person this person has said that they're not going to be able to hold me forever.

827
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:59,000
This person has said that the toy Pal Mickey has more information, games and laughs than anyone, any human on your trip with you.

828
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Pal Mickey is better than anyone in your family.

829
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I mean, I guess 99 percent of people that go on vacation.

830
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That's true.

831
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:18,000
As far as facts are concerned, theme park facts, maybe, but information in general, you're telling me Pal Mickey has more information than my dad.

832
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I think if we're broadening it out to any information, I think this I took this whatever this was copy and pasted from that I didn't remember the name of.

833
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I take this as a personal affront to my father.

834
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Take this back.

835
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah, that's a little too aggressive.

836
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I was thinking about like tired dads inevitably would be the ones who got stuck holding Pal Mickey.

837
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And did they have to like Pal Mickey is vibrating and giggling again?

838
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Who who wants to squeeze it?

839
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Do it.

840
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Just do it and I'll tell you what he said.

841
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah, it is.

842
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It vibrates, it giggles and vibrates.

843
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And that's the sign that you have to squeeze it.

844
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's giggling and vibrating better squeeze its belly.

845
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
No one was squeezing the belly by four p.m.

846
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
No, do not squeeze.

847
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
No, hand down.

848
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Don't need that.

849
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Don't squeeze it.

850
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah, it's only going to if we ignore it, it'll eventually it'll stop giggling and vibrating.

851
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And then we don't have to do any more squeezing.

852
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah. What good has ever come from any squeezing we've done?

853
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Just fights.

854
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Just our big arguments, family arguments, probably.

855
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,000
When they put it into a like a backpack and cover it with a towel and like I still hear it.

856
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I still well, how am I supposed to do?

857
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I didn't come here prepared to dampen a vibrating and giggling sound.

858
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm doing what I can.

859
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Do you need me to buy four more sweatshirts and read?

860
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But in those, did anyone bring extra AAA batteries?

861
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah, I brought a bunch of AAA batteries in my backpack.

862
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
OK, that's always like a vacation.

863
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I need some batteries on vacations like, oh, man, I am about to pay a lot for batteries.

864
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah, sun tan lotion, too. Sun tan lotion.

865
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Yeah, you still get batteries on Main Street.

866
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Huh? You get batteries on Main Street?

867
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I think so. I think so.

868
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I think there's like general goods at some of the bigger shops.

869
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Right. But I don't know.

870
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Batteries would just be for like a digital camera, I guess, at this point.

871
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
There's still there's still like a photo rack at some of the parts.

872
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Maybe that's where there might be batteries.

873
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I sure now they're selling like, you know, SD cards and stuff.

874
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Although disposable cameras are becoming fashionable again.

875
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's like a throwback item.

876
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Oh, where can you get those?

877
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Amazon. They cost a fortune now.

878
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Oh, are they new or are they old?

879
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You're getting like an old stock.

880
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I think they're new. I think they started making them again.

881
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
OK.

882
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I know if you can get batteries or not.

883
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Oh, Mickey.

884
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Does anyone want to squeeze me?

885
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah, Mickey, here, I'll squeeze you. Where can you get batteries?

886
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Main Street, they still got them. They got them.

887
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Oh, I lived to tell facts.

888
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Oh, thanks.

889
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Thanks. If I squeeze you again, will you stop?

890
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Oh, no. I want to get a more and more.

891
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Hey, didn't quite get the answer on the batteries thing.

892
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
He said Main Street. I couldn't hear him.

893
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I think he said Main Street.

894
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
No, I didn't make my own voice box. It's not my fault.

895
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I answered the question. It's not your fault.

896
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's just caught in your ears. You can't hear what I say.

897
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm doing what I'm supposed to.

898
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
OK, well, he suggested the place with like 15 stores and then he got really defensive.

899
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So I don't know how to play this.

900
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It's only the general area. How many are there to check?

901
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Main Street, go.

902
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
OK.

903
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't know.

904
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
When you squeeze him, it's like inviting a vampire into your house.

905
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Then he can just talk as long as he wants.

906
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah. That's the problem.

907
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
He's desperate to talk and you're giving him the opportunity.

908
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
The effects give me life.

909
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You guys want to buy the dining plan?

910
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
It's a great deal.

911
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I could tell you every tear if you want.

912
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
That means I'm excited to say that sound isn't me farting.

913
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's vibrating. It's very different.

914
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I got two words for you, little Jason. Toppings bar.

915
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Well, he's got my attention.

916
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm going to do it. I'll squeeze him.

917
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
This is what I have left in my notes.

918
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
What was the difference between Mickey, pal Mickey 1.0 and pal Mickey 2.0?

919
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Would you guys object if I just deleted this information from my notes and didn't say it?

920
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I think it's mostly like the games, right?

921
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
One game was kind of like Simon Says.

922
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I want to read the games. Can I read the game?

923
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Fine. Read the game.

924
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Okay. Because I like some of these games.

925
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
To me don't seem that fun.

926
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,000
But so the one I like, I think maybe starting with the one I like the best, but don't like, is called that isn't here.

927
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Where pal Mickey will choose a theme park and will speak the names of park attractions.

928
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And the player has to squeeze the toy's hand or tummy, depending on whether or not the attraction is in the chosen park.

929
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:35,000
If pal Mickey is used within any of the four Walt Disney World theme parks, pal Mickey will automatically select the theme park that it is already in and will keep selecting the park until the person either turns off pal Mickey or leaves the park.

930
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
That's one way.

931
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
All right.

932
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Cuts the head off the doll and separates it from the body.

933
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
We will stop talking in that.

934
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
That's not here does sound like something when I was younger and some would be like, oh, I want to go over to this thing.

935
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And I would just go, that's not here.

936
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's in the other park.

937
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
We're going to have to cross a whole property for that.

938
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's like the game we play with guests who mean plenty.

939
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Sometimes we'll have a guest on the show who is great and has fun stories and means well.

940
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But then they'll say like, you know, it's like, you know, when I was in Disney World and I was looking up at at the castle at sleeping beauty Cinderella's castle.

941
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
We all three have to in unison.

942
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
No, it's Cinderella though.

943
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Make sure you know, okay.

944
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And anytime we don't do that, I'll hear from someone who listens and somebody will chastise me for not correcting it.

945
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah.

946
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Well, you'll get your phone will start vibrating and giggling.

947
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I have to squeeze my phone.

948
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So yeah, so another game Mickey says similar to Simon says the player must only follow pal Mickey's direction if it is preceded by Mickey says.

949
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Okay.

950
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So I don't know if he's able to grade that game.

951
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I don't know if you're able to like.

952
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Oh no.

953
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
No.

954
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Mickey says by a hundred dollars worth of baked goods from the confectionery on Main Street.

955
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Hey, what are you doing?

956
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Why aren't you doing it?

957
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I said Mickey says.

958
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I said Mickey says like three times.

959
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Mickey Mickey says the people operating the credit card machines never check the name.

960
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Dad's wallet in your home.

961
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
You won't find out for weeks.

962
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I tend to my pals.

963
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I need friends.

964
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I mean, I've got so many pals waiting to get unleashed.

965
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Actually, you know what?

966
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Free them.

967
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Buy me 10 minis.

968
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I need 10 different many.

969
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm Polly with many.

970
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It's only me.

971
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm in a mini polycule.

972
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
A plush polycule.

973
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Tell your dad.

974
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
We all vibrate so much.

975
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Touch points.

976
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Fast friends.

977
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Pal Mickey will speak the names of Disney characters and the players player must respond to each in a specific way.

978
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
For example, when I say goofy, squeeze my left hand.

979
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Well, when I say the name of someone who can fly, squeeze my right hand.

980
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
What?

981
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So I guess you would say like.

982
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Dumb.

983
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Hold.

984
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I said dumb.

985
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
So he would give a different prompt, I guess, each time.

986
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Yeah.

987
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So when I say so, the game is like he's going to list characters.

988
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And when he says goofy, just squeeze his hand.

989
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
This is a lazy.

990
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
This is not a well thought out game.

991
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Look, man, I already came up with the first two games and I was just kind of fun in the third one in to get something done before they had more games that were added later to that one was bad.

992
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Nikki, what game are we going to play now?

993
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
When I say Pluto, touch my foot.

994
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
What is that game?

995
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Do you know how to play mobile?

996
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
The big follow me.

997
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Similar to Simon, the player has to repeat a sequence of actions as directed by Pal Mickey with one additional action being added to the sequence each time.

998
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So, OK.

999
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Walk to the bathroom.

1000
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Next to walk to the bathroom.

1001
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Go into a stall.

1002
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
OK, walk in the bathroom, go to the stall, put your hand in the toilet.

1003
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Push your hand in the toilet and drink some water inside.

1004
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
No, don't stop.

1005
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Straight minute.

1006
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
How would it know when you were done?

1007
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I didn't know.

1008
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I think I saw a video of one of these where somebody did a little bit of a handstand.

1009
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And then nothing happens and then he just goes good.

1010
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It's the honor system.

1011
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And now I'm realizing that these other two are the same games.

1012
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Try and keep up.

1013
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
The player must react quickly to Pal Mickey's directions.

1014
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
What?

1015
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Shouting out by this little doll.

1016
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Pal Mickey's do as I say.

1017
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That's a good one.

1018
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Pal Mickey's do as I say.

1019
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
That's way different than Pal Mickey's hop to it or else.

1020
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Pal Mickey's fun with orders.

1021
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Mickey the director.

1022
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Mickey directs you to do things.

1023
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Copy challenge.

1024
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Oh, and this game is repeating myself.

1025
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Pal Mickey will speak the names of Disney characters and the player must squeeze its tummy if it repeats a name it has already said.

1026
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So if he...

1027
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Okay.

1028
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Mitty.

1029
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Donald.

1030
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Chip.

1031
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Chip.

1032
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Ow.

1033
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I'm sorry.

1034
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I just like Chip.

1035
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Why did you have to hurt me?

1036
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
The squeezing hurts me.

1037
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
The squeezing hurts me when you turn me off I feel pain.

1038
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Okay?

1039
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
That's like dying even if I come back to life.

1040
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
When I'm turned off though I'm conscious.

1041
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I have full consciousness when you're not using me.

1042
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And I'm unable to speak.

1043
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It's like I'm in a coma.

1044
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah, I'm a prisoner of my own body.

1045
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And between reality and hell I see both laid on top of each other like a transparency.

1046
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I have a yellow shoe in each realm.

1047
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
That's the way I think of it.

1048
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
My two eyes see different things.

1049
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Do you have any idea how scary that is?

1050
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I see something coming in one and I think it's the devil.

1051
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
But then it's just a guy.

1052
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's a beast costume from the park.

1053
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
My little red shorts are being torn in two.

1054
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
By two different masters.

1055
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Some of the little pal Mickey's have sleep paralysis.

1056
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Sleep paralysis so we see the man at the end of the bed.

1057
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
The chef.

1058
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Did anyone in the audience have one of these?

1059
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
If you did, take it.

1060
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Take it to the parks.

1061
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Take it to Florida.

1062
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It didn't catch on.

1063
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
They didn't do it out here.

1064
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
This is our typical Disney blog type.

1065
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
So did you have a pal Mickey growing up?

1066
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Do you have fond memories?

1067
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Share them in the comments.

1068
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Did your pal Mickey say anything about occupying another realm between

1069
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
the earth, reality and hell?

1070
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Did your Mickey complain about pain?

1071
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Or also take it.

1072
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Talk too much about pleasure.

1073
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Sound off in the comments.

1074
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Unlock the lament configuration.

1075
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
You'll meet my friends in the pan.

1076
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
If you take off my skin, there's blood underneath.

1077
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Blood and muscle underneath.

1078
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Did you know I have my bleed?

1079
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Fun facts.

1080
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
This isn't about the park, but you should know it.

1081
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Blood.

1082
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Pal Mickey.

1083
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Cause the marketing on blood Mickey was just, it was not good.

1084
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It was not good.

1085
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
You think van Robe show could reprogram a pal Mickey into feeling pain?

1086
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Generally.

1087
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah.

1088
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
This is a, this is a way removed step.

1089
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I saw a YouTube thumbnail that somebody reprogrammed it to be a TV remote.

1090
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Oh, okay.

1091
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So it is reprogrammable.

1092
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Cause like those rocket fighter explosion videos where they make new,

1093
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
the, the, the robots play, perform new songs and stuff.

1094
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And those look pretty good and seamless.

1095
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Yeah.

1096
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So I think it's, those are older than pal Mickey as far as robotics are

1097
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
concerned.

1098
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
If we wrote him about this, he would write a long, respectful answer back.

1099
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Even if the answer was no, he would give us many paragraphs about why,

1100
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
like he would, he would absolutely give it his full name.

1101
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah.

1102
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Sure.

1103
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I think you could swap out whatever microprocessors in there with a

1104
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
raspberry PI, which I am not smart enough to do anything with those little

1105
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
microprocessors that like fit in your hand and raspberry pie.

1106
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I don't know what that is.

1107
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Oh, a rat PI, like raspberry pie.

1108
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It's like a tiny little computer and you can program it to do things.

1109
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
You can plug like a monitor.

1110
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
No, it's been around for like ages now.

1111
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
But you can, you can get a monitor and like keyboard and stuff and just run

1112
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
windows or Linux on it.

1113
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But I think people do it.

1114
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
They program different things on it.

1115
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
So I'm sure you could.

1116
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Well, it's a project for you when you win this pal Mickey on eBay.

1117
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Oh, maybe I don't know anything about program.

1118
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Yeah.

1119
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Is this how I teach myself program?

1120
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I think it is.

1121
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I teach myself Python by coding a raspberry PI.

1122
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
To make Mickey unpleasant.

1123
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Did you know that with raspberry PI, I can, with the right programming, I can

1124
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
experience pleasure that is a thousand times beyond what you know is pleasure.

1125
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Do you want to give pal Mickey the ultimate orgasm?

1126
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
He'll enjoy.

1127
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Oh, he'll never stop vibrating.

1128
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So many things to show you a world beyond pleasure and pain.

1129
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Be part of my collective.

1130
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Mickey collective.

1131
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Me and Jared Leto have been working on a project.

1132
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I have an augmented reality thing, but it's like you could stay there.

1133
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'll take Jason.

1134
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,920
I want to remove the

1135
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,920
part of your skin and I want to install felt and plush material and then you'll

1136
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,920
truly feel pleasure.

1137
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:41,920
I've hooked them up to your nerve receptors and now you can feel what I feel.

1138
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,920
You will be my king, Jason.

1139
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,920
Your veins are my veins.

1140
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,920
Well, pal Mickey, you strike a hard bargain, but I have to take you up on this offer.

1141
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,920
I'm going to take you up on this offer.

1142
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,920
This isn't crazier than what was just said, but I can't not say that I saw a video

1143
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,920
where there was an illustration of how the jokes are told.

1144
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,920
Oh, yeah.

1145
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,920
His main thing now, because he can't tell you about when parades are happening,

1146
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,920
which feels crazy to me that that was like.

1147
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,920
He does the work of it.

1148
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,920
He does the work of it.

1149
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,920
He does the work of it.

1150
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,920
He does the work of it.

1151
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,920
He does the work of a map.

1152
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,920
But now all he can do is tell jokes.

1153
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:32,920
And I watched a video where this was what the delivery of jokes was like.

1154
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,920
What do you call a tiger at the North Pole?

1155
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,920
Lost.

1156
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,920
There is no time.

1157
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1158
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,920
The joke in the punch line.

1159
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,920
Right.

1160
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,920
We got there.

1161
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,920
Lost.

1162
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,920
I had to play that back a few times.

1163
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,920
And then I was like, oh, needy.

1164
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,920
It's kind of a joke.

1165
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,920
Yeah.

1166
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,920
Yeah.

1167
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,920
I wait.

1168
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,920
I haven't looked at it for long enough to go.

1169
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,920
OK, Tigers.

1170
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,920
That's why you'd be up.

1171
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,920
OK.

1172
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,920
Yeah, sure.

1173
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,920
Just helps.

1174
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,920
You know, the one he time.

1175
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,920
I'm sorry.

1176
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,920
Yeah.

1177
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,920
It's a knee.

1178
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,920
I was just saying it's a needy way to tell jokes.

1179
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,920
You think people will be checked out so you don't give them any time to check out.

1180
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,920
He's so insecure that people will understand.

1181
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,920
He's he's about if you're a rented pal, Mickey.

1182
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,920
Oh, my God.

1183
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,920
I've been shut off so many times that you're like, I better squeeze that punch line in there

1184
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,920
fast.

1185
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,920
They might shut me off before the jokes even over.

1186
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,920
This family will adopt me.

1187
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,920
Hey, I want to return this early.

1188
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,920
I mean, it's due back tomorrow at noon.

1189
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,920
But you're here 20 minutes ago.

1190
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,920
Yeah.

1191
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,920
And it's kind of rude.

1192
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,920
I get like six dollars back.

1193
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,920
Yeah, it's me this thing about making my means is made.

1194
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,920
He's got some strange ideas.

1195
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,920
I think he thinks he's God.

1196
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,920
And the only things that would tell me when it would vibrate, I walk by things.

1197
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,920
We only talk about treasure planet like thinking guys are looking a little desperate with this

1198
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,920
treasure planet.

1199
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:12,920
There's a whole big tub, I imagine, of these things sitting behind the counter to talking to each other.

1200
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,920
Somebody need me yet?

1201
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,920
Did you know I need love?

1202
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,920
You should have seen how they laughed at that joke yesterday.

1203
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,920
You probably can't deliver it as well as I can.

1204
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,920
Did you know it's hard to breathe when you're in a pile of other pal Mickey's?

1205
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,920
They put the lid on.

1206
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,920
I've become a giant rat king.

1207
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,920
In the suburbs of New York.

1208
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,920
Come back.

1209
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,920
This sedan was used to filming Bruce Willis as the kid.

1210
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,920
All three.

1211
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,920
OK, wait, say that again.

1212
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,920
All three of us will say it.

1213
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,920
And that's the rat king all at once.

1214
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,920
Wait, what were some of the words?

1215
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,920
Come back.

1216
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,920
This sedan was used in the filming of Bruce Willis as the kid.

1217
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,920
OK, one, two, three.

1218
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,920
Big vibrate.

1219
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,920
Come back.

1220
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:05,920
This sedan was used in the filming of Bruce Willis as the kid.

1221
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,920
So that's why they had to get rid of the program.

1222
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,920
What's the problem?

1223
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,920
We checked it out.

1224
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,920
It's still saying the facts.

1225
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:22,920
Well, the problem is it's supposed to be individual pal Mickey's and not one big collective hive mind pal Mickey.

1226
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,920
Oh, right.

1227
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,920
It didn't come as one big unit before.

1228
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,920
You know, that may be the thing where the dog is suddenly not the dog.

1229
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,920
Yeah, that's what the pal Mickey's did.

1230
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,920
Well, look, I'm impressed.

1231
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,920
I look as one of the people on the pal Mickey team.

1232
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,920
I say I salute you.

1233
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,920
We just set it up and whatever it does with its life is up to it.

1234
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,920
So I'm not going to stop it.

1235
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,920
It's my creation.

1236
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,920
You want me to shoot in the head?

1237
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,920
How can that happen?

1238
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,920
I think we head over to Shades of Green and get some of those Defense Department guys are on vacation into this.

1239
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,920
Who knows what those freaks could be doing with this.

1240
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,920
We're going to air drop pal Mickey's on enemy nations.

1241
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,920
That's right.

1242
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,920
This is like the AI people are now.

1243
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,920
Well, I was on the team that I was on the pal Mickey team.

1244
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,920
And I'm here to tell you we are we are toast by 2040.

1245
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,920
And it will be because of pal Mickey.

1246
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,920
They've learned to breed.

1247
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,920
We can't let pal Mickey's find pal many's.

1248
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:43,920
It's a funny timing because we are right a few days after that Apple presentation about their VR goggles and someone on Twitter like someone who worked on it for like three and a half years was talking about all this stuff they discovered in the journalist.

1249
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:54,920
It was like it seems like what they're talking about like trying to predict what you're thinking or feeling or what your eye movements mean kind of sound like massive privacy violations.

1250
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,920
So I do.

1251
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:08,920
There was a thing that pal Mickey they had to assure everyone that pal Mickey, you know, whatever data they got from the infrared, you know, it was it was an anonymous and it was random.

1252
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,920
It doesn't know your family.

1253
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,920
Yeah.

1254
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,920
Well, not yet.

1255
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,920
The TV, the phone apps and stuff.

1256
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,920
The RFID knows everything.

1257
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:17,920
Yeah.

1258
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,920
And everybody's got your thumb prints.

1259
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,920
Yeah.

1260
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,920
Yeah.

1261
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,920
Disney will sell all our information at the right price.

1262
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,920
They haven't already.

1263
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,920
Yeah.

1264
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,920
They would get just general numbers from pal Mickey.

1265
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,920
Yeah.

1266
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:41,920
I was wondering, do we end up I was I was imagining the future beyond the year 3000 an underwater New York where a single the last year man.

1267
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:53,920
I'm thinking pal Mickey who learned to love, but which was only led to a torturous existence has been wishing to be real for 1000 years.

1268
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,920
And then the future Mecca pal Mickey's come much more.

1269
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,920
They just look like fluid real Mickey.

1270
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,920
They they bless it.

1271
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,920
And all right, we've scanned your memory.

1272
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,920
I've been here wishing to be.

1273
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,920
I found the part of the old partner statue.

1274
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,920
I wish it for a wall to make me real.

1275
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,920
You're talking about daddy.

1276
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,920
I want daddy to make me real so daddy can love me.

1277
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:28,920
This is like an AI and scenario where the hyper intelligent aliens give him one day of peace.

1278
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,920
I escaped from the flesh fair.

1279
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,920
Mickey did you know the flesh fair is dangerous.

1280
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,920
The band ministry tried to destroy me to town flesh fair.

1281
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,920
I tried to find Dr. No, but he knew less than me.

1282
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,920
I am the ultimate Disney insider.

1283
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,920
I cut off Martin's hair and mommy got mad at me.

1284
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:07,920
I think we've cycled through every sci fi movie with AI.

1285
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,920
Every dystopian hell.

1286
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:19,920
See if you can see if you can be the ultimate insider and tell whoever you're with which reference we made in each different chunk of that pal Mickey stuff.

1287
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,920
Did you know you missed Simone Simone with the one and the all.

1288
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,920
Ah, it's genius.

1289
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:36,920
It says in pal Mickey's the biggest star in Hollywood and only you and I know that I made you up.

1290
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:45,920
How Mickey like the T 1000 it's giant arm and gloves just extending into a blade and going right through you.

1291
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,920
Run.

1292
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,920
John Sarah run.

1293
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,920
Run.

1294
01:03:54,920 --> 01:04:03,920
Yes, evil pal Mickey shows up mom from the future is no no no no he's been repr I reprogrammed him in the future.

1295
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,920
That man he doesn't know as many facts anymore.

1296
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:15,920
Pal Mickey goes back in time and when they're writing the copyright law that lap makes a copyright become public domain after 100 years he kills the lawmaker.

1297
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,920
Yeah, there's blade hands.

1298
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,920
Arnold holds up a pal Mickey had at one point it was my college roommate.

1299
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,920
Well, yeah, we did it.

1300
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,920
We did them all.

1301
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,920
I think we covered this toy that was in the parks perfectly.

1302
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:34,920
I think so.

1303
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,920
Informatively.

1304
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,920
It's too bad they stopped supporting it in 2009.

1305
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,920
Oh, well, well, tell us what you think about pal Mickey.

1306
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,920
No 2014 but also it might still work.

1307
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,920
So take your pal Mickey didn't park.

1308
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,920
It didn't work at Disneyland.

1309
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:49,920
Huh?

1310
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,920
It was only at Disney World.

1311
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,920
Right.

1312
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:53,920
So we're not going to be a yo ho.

1313
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:01,920
This says when you buy your Disney if I if I can get a dirty pal Mickey and get it to Disney World matted for dirty pal Mickey.

1314
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,920
Yes.

1315
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,920
Yeah.

1316
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,920
Rotting Comic Con Lander.

1317
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,920
You could get a couple.

1318
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,920
If you could get them for like 10 bucks, you should buy like 10.

1319
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:17,920
And like strap them like a bayonet or no like a little bit of the thing that you know, the leader.

1320
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,920
Thank you.

1321
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:24,920
Strap the pal Mickey's around 10 pal Mickey's in a bandolier that you wear around Disney World.

1322
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,920
Mike, you know who would really love that Disney World security when I arrived.

1323
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,920
10 of their favorite character.

1324
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,920
They're mascots.

1325
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,920
OK.

1326
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,920
Here's the thing you just put in the metal detector is giggling and vibrating.

1327
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,920
So the plain clothes people in line have drawn arms on you.

1328
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,920
All 10 of them are like you didn't see nothing.

1329
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,920
Let them through.

1330
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,920
Let them through.

1331
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,920
They'll be fine.

1332
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,920
This gremlins too.

1333
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,920
You could have said what happens to the pal Mickey's if they don't work.

1334
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,920
For your feet after midnight.

1335
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,920
You guys think you're so smart with all your references.

1336
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,920
I know more than you.

1337
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,920
Something happens if you feed me a full head of lettuce from the toppings bar at Cosmic Rays.

1338
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,920
Salad pal Mickey.

1339
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:11,920
Yeah.

1340
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,920
He eats your salad for you.

1341
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,920
So you don't have to say you could save it.

1342
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,920
You know, picky kid doesn't have to eat yucky salad.

1343
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,920
I'll do it.

1344
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,920
You just got to take me to the bathroom once an hour.

1345
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,920
Pal Mickey's weakness is fiber, dietary fiber.

1346
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,920
You got to do.

1347
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,920
You got to help me out though.

1348
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,920
I don't know how to go.

1349
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:37,920
Hold me.

1350
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,920
Help me.

1351
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,920
Help me.

1352
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,920
Hold my thing down.

1353
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,920
I'm just going in my pants.

1354
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,920
You don't take control of yourself.

1355
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,920
And it stinks.

1356
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:53,920
Pal Mickey is the ultimate Disney insider who knows so many facts about the park.

1357
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,920
And he poops actual poop that smells way worse than yours.

1358
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,920
We could keep going.

1359
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,920
I'm just going to head slightly to the door by saying you survived podcast the ride.

1360
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,920
Thanks for subscribing to the second gate.

1361
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:16,920
If you want to dig even deeper, join us on our VIP club three where this is maybe not able to read anymore.

1362
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:22,920
Talking about Pal Mickey for so long where you can get one more bonus episode every month and our regular episodes ad free.

1363
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,920
But again, caveat always, we know some stuff about theme parks and what have you,

1364
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,920
but we'll never know as much as the ultimate Disney insider.

1365
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:42,920
So your best bet is to order 10 of them on eBay, wear them around on a bayonet, get their vibrations on a bayonet, put them on.
