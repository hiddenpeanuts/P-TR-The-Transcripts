1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Warning, you're about to embark on a Grand Circle Tour of the Podcast Kingdom.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,440
You may encounter panoramic views of Tron characters no one can name, mice screeching like beasts

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,800
from hell, and a company founder plotting to kill God.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:47,000
Breeze into 2023 with the People Mover on Podcast the Ride.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,280
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast about theme parks that some might find slow moving

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,680
or long or meandering, but real fans know that's kind of the appeal.

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm Scott Gardner, shown by Mike Carlson.

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,160
What a good reset for the new year.

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,280
What a good mission statement for the podcast.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Is this something-

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
A big qualifier?

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
A good qualifier.

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Is this something we replace?

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,560
Because in case everybody doesn't know, we used to be a podcast that was hosted by three

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,040
childless men in their 30s about theme parks.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,560
Not the case anymore, obviously.

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,060
Two of us have children.

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,200
So maybe what you've stumbled upon here is sort of the new tagline.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,600
I'm going to do that one every time.

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,360
It was kind of a reference to today's topic, but if you think it generally-

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,920
I think it does, is what I'm saying.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,440
I mean, I'm being funny, but also now that I kind of think it's actually about the show.

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,480
The true fans might have teared up when I said it.

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Yeah, that's right.

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
That is how I feel.

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,720
Jason Sheridan, what do you think?

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,600
Saluted their podcatcher app.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Right.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
That's right.

32
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
I'm getting that tattoo.

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
That's it.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Right.

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,040
Well, then that is a good sign if that's the-

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
I think so.

37
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,000
And in that case, we're talking about the perfect thing here today, the people mover.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,400
It's our first main feed topic of 2023 that I guess shares a lot in common.

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Right.

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,640
I mean, it's a great thing.

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,400
And I'm excited to be talking about it at the top of the year here because it is like,

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,560
it is at the same time, nothing and everything.

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
You know what I mean?

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Yes.

45
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,760
It's like, you know, we love our rides with our robots and scenes and stuff happening.

46
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,880
And we're going to talk about a ride here that has none of that, but we love it.

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
I assume.

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,680
I don't think there's a people mover hater laying in wake here.

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,200
Well, it depends on how you describe like tiny baby show scenes and later versions.

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
That's true.

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
There are little things.

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
There are little things.

53
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,160
I hope that what I said doesn't sound like a slam.

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm just saying like it is a like comparatively to a lot of other things.

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,960
It is it is gentle.

56
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,080
It is low stakes.

57
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Low thrills.

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,200
But what a wonderful attraction it is.

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,880
And I'm excited to talk about it for a while.

61
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,360
A Sheridan family favorite.

62
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,880
Well, a Carlson family favorite too.

63
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
I think everyone.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
You see.

65
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,760
But my brother especially, because he didn't like roller coasters when he was younger.

66
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,280
So my dad and I would ride Space Mountain and my mom and brother would just and later

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,440
when he was older, just my brother, like would ride the people mover over and over again.

68
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Yeah.

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,800
And if you hit it at the right time, when it used to be a walk on, you could just flag

70
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
the cast.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,320
Like, hey, can I stay?

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Can I?

73
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,360
And which worked in twenty nineteen too.

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,480
It was empty when I wrote it in twenty nineteen and I did that.

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Can I?

76
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
Can I stay?

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
And they're like, yeah, sure.

78
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,920
And they do one of those and they go, they like, you know, they give you like the cut

79
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,840
off signal to like, oh, my manager's here or like, oh, we're getting a little busy.

80
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
My manager's here.

81
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Mr. Stevens is here.

82
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
He was just behind me.

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
He's going to be mad at me.

84
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,840
I've got like not not right now.

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Sorry.

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,320
Or like, no, please stay on.

87
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,200
Did you get to see the manager?

88
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Did the man look imposing?

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,920
Did he look like somebody who would like lay the smack?

90
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,600
Was it like some imposing looking people and ridiculous cast?

91
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,760
Was it like the boss on Deal or No Deal and like there's just a window with like darkness?

92
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,240
It's like who was the bond was odd job, the hat or the big guy?

93
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Hat.

94
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Jaws is the big guy.

95
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Yeah.

96
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Oh, it's Jaws.

97
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
OK.

98
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,640
It was like it was not like Deal or No Deal.

99
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Monster imposing.

100
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Wow.

101
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,160
Some six five six six manager of the people over.

102
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,320
If that boy, if that guy's still there, if there's a listener who works the people mover,

103
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,560
he just grabbed Jason by the shirt collar and picked him up off of the.

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,200
Ride and then threw him away.

105
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,640
And also ranked him off of threw him off Rocket Tower Plaza.

106
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,560
When he goes up to the loading, it's less of a speed ramp and more slow ramp.

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Yeah.

108
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,160
I look, I've done the turn.

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
I've done it twice.

110
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,520
I've been to Florida.

111
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Of course, I've never done the Disneyland version because it was not there the first

112
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
time I went.

113
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah.

114
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,880
And yeah, we would ride it especially at night because obviously everything's better at night

115
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,200
when you're talking rides, especially outdoor rides.

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,240
I feel like we did it three times once, which felt like, oh, my God, what a treat we're

117
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
getting here.

118
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Yeah.

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
Yeah.

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,400
Definitely more than once in a day.

121
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,560
Maybe recently I have.

122
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,060
I don't I don't recall.

123
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,040
But for sure in the family trip where you're planted there for a while.

124
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Yes.

125
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
What a great thing.

126
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,480
And you something you know, like you can jump on while other people are doing something

127
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,800
or you know, everybody in the family can do it.

128
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,560
It's a I don't know, it's a unifier.

129
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,640
It's a brings people together.

130
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Yeah. Yeah.

131
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,640
Yeah.

132
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Oh, best.

133
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,080
And one of the best like you can still do this even with the weight now.

134
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,560
You might have to factor in the longer weight.

135
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,920
That happens a lot.

136
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,000
But get on right before the fireworks.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,040
Catching the fireworks from the people mover.

138
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Can we all do the chef?

139
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
Mwah.

140
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,840
Like that thing like it once.

141
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
What a wonderful.

142
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Yeah.

143
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,480
Like that's yeah, that's great.

144
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,720
I did that last time I was there.

145
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,440
I believe I rode alone and I was happy.

146
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,640
I don't want anyone with me.

147
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,880
I wanted to be alone and watch the fireworks from the people mover alone.

148
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,040
I know I've been on there.

149
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,120
I know like when I was like 14 or so, I went on it alone.

150
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,240
It is a great it's a ride where you can get some some solitude.

151
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Yeah.

152
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,240
Get some work done.

153
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
So we got some work done.

154
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Yeah.

155
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
You can bring a laptop on there and nobody.

156
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
I don't think.

157
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Sure.

158
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Well, we're done with you.

159
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
We like it and we're good.

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,840
We like it so much.

161
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Can I you know what?

162
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
All right.

163
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,240
I was we're kind of right into the people mover, but I did look we're at the top of

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,520
the year here too.

165
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,160
And the first topic of the year is a big thing, but I think equally important is the first

166
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,920
non topic tangent of the year.

167
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,680
OK, I'm going to slide something in real quick.

168
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Please.

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
It's not a Frank Marshall.

170
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
It's not going to take up the whole thing.

171
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,920
OK, I don't think I think only Frank Marshall raises all of our agitation that much.

172
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,200
Operationally, this is perfect because the Florida one nowadays, from what I've read,

173
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,200
I haven't experienced it myself maybe once or twice breaks down a lot.

174
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Oh, yeah, sure.

175
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
A lot of pauses.

176
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,920
Interestingly, last time I went on it, yeah, we had a long pause in a hallway where there

177
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
was nothing to do.

178
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,720
I was really open there to be a walk off, but I didn't realize how commonly it just

179
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
stops for for a little while.

180
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,880
So we're just going to it's going to be a short delay.

181
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,240
So this will not be a walk off.

182
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,560
But I this something's been sitting with me for for a little bit.

183
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,040
And this is how I want to kick the year off is with a question that is a Disney related

184
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
question.

185
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
I think it's a pretty simple question.

186
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,440
It's a simple question for you too.

187
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,280
Do you know Mickey Mouse's first words?

188
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Not quickly.

189
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm trying to think of this sounds for this does sound familiar.

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Mm hmm.

191
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,960
Mickey Mouse's first words.

192
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,040
Now, when you say first words, do you mean the first words spoken in an animated short?

193
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,080
Yeah, yeah, I that's what I would have to be.

194
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
Yeah.

195
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,240
In terms of chronological Mickey Mouse material released into the world, do you know the first

196
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,000
and look, he and I don't mean sounds.

197
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Right.

198
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,040
When you think that you think, oh, yes, Steamboat Willie.

199
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
No, no, no.

200
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
He didn't talk in it.

201
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
He whistles.

202
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
We know that.

203
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,840
But it's one of those things you think you know, but you but we have no idea.

204
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
And you don't know.

205
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,920
Jason, any any thoughts?

206
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,440
I knew there would be like some fine print on.

207
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,240
Is it like in plain crazy?

208
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Is it like in another?

209
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,280
I mean, it's not in Steamboat.

210
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,760
It's not in one of the it's not one of the primaries.

211
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,920
I don't think it's not one that I knew offhand.

212
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,720
That's why I thought it'd be interesting to bring it up, because we've we've found a lot

213
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,800
of great Mickey Mouse quotes over the years from I use the den to you asked for it to

214
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
go soak your head.

215
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Fresh boy.

216
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Soak your head fresh.

217
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,720
I think we if I think it's been a good little mission of the podcast to find Mickey's most

218
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,600
notable quotes and what could be more notable than the first one?

219
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,240
This is something I found over the break.

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,240
And I'll tell you how I found it and I'll present it in context.

221
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,560
So by the way, this year, twenty twenty three is, I think, Mickey's ninety fifth birthday.

222
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
So we're at it.

223
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
We're at an anniversary year.

224
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,400
He's he's as old as George Burns was when he died, I think.

225
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
We're around there.

226
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,920
We talked about Ronnie Burns.

227
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
I think so.

228
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,960
I think the Ronnie Burns episode is.

229
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,560
So about George Burns son, we just started.

231
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,480
No, no, he burns more George Burns in twenty twenty three, though, for sure.

232
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Coming up.

233
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Wow.

234
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,680
Not enough Burns content the first five years of the show.

235
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Very little.

236
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
As long as we get to the Sgt.

237
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Pepper's Only Arts Club Band.

238
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Oh, yeah.

239
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Then I won't complain.

240
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,960
No, but so we'll see what Disney does for the ninety fifth birthday of Mickey.

241
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,920
But back in nineteen eighty eight, they celebrated Mickey's 60th birthday and they did this with

242
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,240
a very odd special.

243
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,160
I don't know if you've seen this particular special, but there's a live TV broadcast that

244
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,160
goes awry and director Carl Reiner is furious.

245
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,960
I don't think it's on camera, too.

246
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,360
Everything goes haywire and then Mickey Mouse gets lost.

247
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,360
And then it becomes about America's search for Mickey Mouse.

248
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,520
No, I have not seen this special.

249
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
I highly recommend it.

250
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,640
We should talk about it more.

251
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,120
Then you then you like traverse all these different shows.

252
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,440
All the cast members of NBC shows try to find Mickey because they didn't have the ABC deal

253
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
yet.

254
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,040
Cheers gang and family ties with some cousin, Oliver type character I've never seen before.

255
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,680
The latter day cast member.

256
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,400
It's really odd.

257
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,800
But the main wraparound of it are from John Ritter, who's a news anchor in it.

258
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
And he gives you a little Mickey Mouse refresher.

259
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,120
And of course, you get the you know, here's his history and here's Steamboat Willie.

260
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,360
You get the clip that you know.

261
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,960
But then you get this and I'm going to say you're going to hear John Ritter and then

262
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,800
you're going to hear Mickey Mouse's first words.

263
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,440
Then came the talkies.

264
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,600
Millions waited breathlessly for Mickey's first immortal words on celluloid.

265
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,640
Is he saying hot dog?

266
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,440
Yes, he's saying hot dogs.

267
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,880
Wow.

268
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,800
Mickey Mouse's first words were hot dogs.

269
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,640
How did we not know this?

270
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,880
I don't know. It's crazy.

271
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,680
Sung.

272
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,880
I did not know that.

273
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,200
Screeched, in fact.

274
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,240
Here's what I think, though.

275
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,520
I've seen that clip.

276
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,000
But now I understand why I may not have retained what he was saying.

277
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,840
Because if it's not, if you don't know that it's his first words, who cares?

278
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,480
Right.

279
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,400
But now, by this point, this in the full context here, this is the short

280
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,000
The Carnival Kid, spelled with K's from 1929.

281
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,160
It is the ninth Mickey Mouse short.

282
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,200
So, you know, we're making a ton of these now.

283
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,000
America's falling in love with this lovable mouse.

284
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,800
When he finally gets to speak, what is he going to say?

285
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,320
Uh huh.

286
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
He says, ah, yes, yes.

287
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,120
A primal scream from a dirty carny.

288
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,360
That's great.

289
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,280
He was a carny. Yes.

290
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,680
Yeah.

291
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,040
He this is Walt maybe illustrating.

292
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,200
This is an early iteration of him saying this is the kind this is the filth

293
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,520
that ruins America.

294
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,960
And if I have my say, I will wipe this from the face of the earth.

295
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,200
Yeah.

296
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,800
How early did Walt's contempt for carnival people begin?

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,840
Like, this is also what we've discussed.

298
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,560
We talked about it, I think, on the Red Red Robin episode of on our Patreon

299
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,320
is that Red Robin is now sort of a generic type mascot.

300
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,600
Whatever. You don't think much about Red Robin.

301
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,640
But in the old days, he was kind of like a stonery weirdo guy.

302
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,040
Yeah. If you haven't heard this episode, we found the first picture of Red Robin

303
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
and his eyes are beet red.

304
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,760
Right. He's high.

305
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,160
Yeah. He's and he looks like out of it.

306
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,640
His pupils are huge.

307
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,720
Yeah. Why he was red is that his eyes were red because he was stoned.

308
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,480
Right. So I feel like, again, the history of this, again,

309
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,080
the history of a lot of mascot characters as they start out as like weasels.

310
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Weasels.

311
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,280
Not shady, shady, trustworthy roustabouts.

312
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,920
Yeah. I mean, you know, he's also just doing his job here in a way.

313
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,960
But the entire moment and for the listeners, he's those little sounds

314
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,200
you heard in between.

315
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll play it one more time. I got to.

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,200
The the barks that you hear, he's stabbing a bunch of wieners on a grill.

317
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,960
And when he stabs them, they all form a mouth that barks a note.

318
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,840
The Franks are also screaming is what you're saying.

319
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
Yes, they're barking.

320
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,520
They're barking.

321
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,200
These main hellish screams.

322
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,760
And then he provokes five more screams through stabbing.

323
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,440
The hot dogs are alive.

324
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,040
Yes. Yeah. So they are living hot dogs, which makes it strange

325
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,280
when then he goes to see his, you know, if not his lover yet,

326
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,960
then his dream lover, Minnie Mouse, who's presented in this as

327
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,680
Minnie the shimmy dancer.

328
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,000
She is a carnival dancer.

329
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,800
And he offers her a hot dog.

330
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,760
And the process of doing this is that he has to coax a hot dog over

331
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,360
and get it to be in a bun blanket.

332
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,480
And have we yes, have we checked in the year this came out?

333
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,600
Was that not standard practice for hot dogs?

334
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,520
Were they is that just something that we don't know about 80 years ago

335
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
or 95 years ago? Excuse me.

336
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,400
The standards have shifted.

337
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,520
Yeah, it's possible that it was like a lobster.

338
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,760
Dogs like lobster. Yeah, they were alive.

339
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,600
And you have to coax you to get to go into a restaurant

340
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,280
and choose your hot dog.

341
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,600
It was alive and they take it in the back and cook it.

342
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Line them up, stab them and make them sing, whichever one.

343
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,000
It's the loudest note.

344
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,520
Yeah, it's the one for me.

345
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,440
Oh, pre Geneva conventions.

346
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,600
So like a lot of this would be considered war crimes nowadays, you know,

347
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,600
against the eating into an animal and just ripping its mouth off.

348
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,880
Yeah. Yeah. Wouldn't maybe wouldn't fly as much.

349
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,440
Well, speaking of that, if you think this is violating certain protocols,

350
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,480
then what happens is the hot dog wriggles away when many tries to take a bite of it.

351
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,200
And then Mickey has to chase the hot dog down.

352
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,880
And it's not just a matter of a tsk tsk.

353
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,080
He punishes this hot dog and he does it by pulling the hot dogs

354
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,920
casing down like its pants, revealing a little butt.

355
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,720
The hot dog has a little.

356
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,280
Well, now I have not seen this.

357
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,120
Mickey spanks the hot dog's bare butt.

358
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,160
What Jason is speechless.

359
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm showing you a frame of this.

360
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,120
You can see why we had our little break.

361
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,120
I've been waiting. I need to get this out.

362
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,800
This has been burned into my head.

363
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,280
I have to like, wow, this image.

364
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,680
So now let me ask you came across this because you were watching this old 60th

365
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,480
special. Yeah, I was what I was trying to watch an 80s special with, you know,

366
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,440
nothing but nice graphics and pleasantry.

367
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,080
And then I find this 1920s horror show.

368
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,600
Mickey has pulled the hot dog's little pants down

369
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,000
and is spanking its little hot dog butt.

370
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,440
His pants, which are his body. Right.

371
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,360
And just before that, there's a reveal.

372
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,280
Minnie goes to get changed to pay for the hot dog and she pulls her leg down

373
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,360
like her black leg is revealed to be stocking.

374
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,560
Oh, I've seen. Yeah.

375
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,080
You see the top of her leg and it has big old hairs sticking out of it.

376
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,480
OK, so Minnie's legs are hosiery and the hot dog can't get out of it.

377
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,760
Hot dog casing is his pants and has an under butt.

378
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,120
That is I'm looking at photos of this and it's really disturbing.

379
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,480
And he's so angry also.

380
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,160
Yeah, yeah, he's screaming at this.

381
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,440
Do not fuck with this guy. He's screaming at them.

382
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,160
These things look like really tiny little sand worms like.

383
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,600
And this is the main feed.

384
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,120
And I don't want to also get disgusted.

385
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,600
They look like uncircumcised penises as well.

386
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,600
These things are horrifying.

387
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
I'm not saying uncircumcised penises are.

388
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,480
I'm not saying those are horrifying.

389
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,400
I'm just saying like in the context of a cartoon is something you're eating.

390
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,560
You don't expect to go to a carnival and see four uncircumcised penises lined up.

391
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,520
Right. And they're all like standing at attention,

392
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,440
getting screamed at by a mouse who can.

393
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,600
Oh, here. You can barely understand why he comes up to Minnie.

394
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,080
Oh, first of all, he walks up to Minnie and then takes off the top of his skull

395
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,760
like a hat and like tips his hat.

396
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,960
Well, that's how I like that.

397
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,880
Yeah. No, no.

398
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,960
And was like, make sure you say that's good.

399
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,080
That is. She did. OK, good.

400
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,640
Yeah, because on the same page.

401
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,600
So he's friendly.

402
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,800
Lay look, Minnie, the shimmy dancer.

403
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,960
I'm a nice guy.

404
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,040
And then immediately pivots to screaming at the hot dogs.

405
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,240
And now.

406
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,920
And now.

407
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,680
So sit down.

408
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,640
It's not even get out.

409
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,920
Even Mickey's. Yeah.

410
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,280
Sit down. Sit down.

411
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,920
Yeah, it sounds like Charlie Cha.

412
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,800
It sounds like what's the what's the Charlie Chaplin movie?

413
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,080
I'm thinking of Gold Rush.

414
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,840
There's a scene.

415
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,360
There's a dubbed version of Gold Rush.

416
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm sure it's before where he did the voiceover later

417
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,960
because it was initially just a silent movie.

418
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,640
And then he's doing like, get out, get out, get out, get out, said

419
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,600
Black Lawson, which was like the bad guy.

420
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,200
So it sounds very old timey.

421
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,800
Oh, sort of movie or whatever.

422
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
You know what else is weird about this?

423
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,200
The voice is not Walt Disney.

424
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,680
He is not doing Mickey's first words were not done by original voice.

425
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,760
Walt Disney. He is voiced in this by Carl Stalling, the music man

426
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,080
who the composer who the year after this defected to Warner Brothers.

427
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,480
Oh, wow.

428
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,960
And created the Warner Brothers signature sound and their music vocabulary.

429
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,840
That's such a huge part of Warner Brothers.

430
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,520
So Mickey's first words were

431
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,200
screeched by a man who Walt lost the talents of, presumably.

432
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,560
But at the same time, he lost a by works.

433
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,120
Right. Right. And talent fly out the door.

434
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,920
Sleeping two hours a night, like amphetamine out the eyeballs.

435
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Well, everyone says like, we need someone to scream.

436
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,560
We we need the track.

437
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,520
We need the voice over track.

438
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,320
OK, someone do it.

439
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
Music man, you do it.

440
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,000
OK, he went and stabbed him like one of those hot dogs.

441
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,520
Yeah. To the boys.

442
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,720
Stand up.

443
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,320
Ah, yes.

444
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,480
It's just I just come back to it with all of these things.

445
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,200
How like he's America's favorite man, the most famous.

446
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,160
Well, you can go to the, you know, the like the deepest cave in the world

447
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,480
and people still know Mickey Mouse is everybody loves.

448
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,800
And here's a clip.

449
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,480
Ha ha ha.

450
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,560
One of their first interactions with him was that.

451
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,800
Yeah, this is this is the juncture where America feel like this guy's great.

452
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,880
This guy, this this guy who screams hot dogs like a hound from hell

453
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,640
and then tortures a hot, a spanks a hot dog like an unruly child.

454
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,400
More of this one hundred more years of this character, please.

455
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,360
That's so much weirder and more interesting than most cartoons in the last 30 years.

456
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,040
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

457
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,920
So things for children, there are plenty of nice stuff.

458
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,680
My kid was sure none of it's now is going to have anything as inventive

459
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,680
as pulling your right off of your just it's body horror.

460
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,280
It is body or for children these days.

461
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,920
I saw there's this accounts across a bunch of social media.

462
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,240
There is a group or a person who's restoring a lot of the Fleischer

463
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,480
cartoons, a lot of the Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons.

464
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,320
And I watched a clip of one that they were live streaming.

465
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,440
And it is so weird.

466
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,120
Like she's in hell.

467
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,080
People are making her sing.

468
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,200
Everything on screen is bouncing like the Fleischer.

469
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,040
Everything was always bound.

470
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,040
All those wobbly knees swaying back and forth.

471
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,680
And it's so far removed from the Betty Boop on tin signs that like

472
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,000
the the souvenir shop in like the kind of mall

473
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,240
that used to be an old mill at the tourism stop.

474
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,400
The Antiques Mall.

475
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,480
Betty Boop's the queen of the Antiques Mall.

476
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,200
We're doing Boop this year on our second.

477
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,240
This is great. Keep making these.

478
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,600
Disagreed with one yet.

479
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I'm sure Boop is coming.

480
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,880
I've got one that might drive everyone insane.

481
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
OK, speed ramp. Speed.

482
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,200
You mean speed ramp?

483
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,800
Speed round? No, speed ramp. Speed ramp.

484
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,040
Because it became a marketing thing for Disney at some point.

485
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,320
Take the speed ramp to Space Mountain.

486
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,920
OK, it's just the you use it for the people mover in Florida, too.

487
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,360
It's the it's the ramp escalator that would.

488
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,000
They got you up to Space Mountain originally.

489
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,960
Things. Yeah, I'm wondering.

490
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,320
I really can't think of these existing in places outside of the Disney parks.

491
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,520
And I'm like, there must be is that thing where I don't know,

492
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,560
but it feels like there's an inkling.

493
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,000
My spider sense is tingling.

494
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
Speed ramp. Speed ramp.

495
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,680
OK, so singular speed ramp.

496
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,560
Yeah, speed. Yeah.

497
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,000
Ramp. Speed ramp.

498
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,080
I mean, the other thing is the thing that I've been hiding from myself.

499
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,600
Not hiding, but I've been like restraining myself from like there.

500
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,560
This weird dark.

501
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,360
Your dark. Some dark thoughts.

502
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,680
I and I found it, which is the Ford Magic Skyway.

503
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,320
I've never watched the full ride through, but there is an industrial video,

504
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,960
I think, from Ford that the capture the entire.

505
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,040
The whole thing.

506
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,800
One of the original one of the world's fair attractions

507
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,640
where you sat in a car that overlaps with this and we'll get to this.

508
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,520
Well, we'll hear.

509
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,760
We'll come around to the people over now.

510
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,320
But I'll real quick to clear.

511
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,760
This is a year that we do in that singing career.

512
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,040
Sorry. Is there time, Michael?

513
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,480
In the year twenty twenty three, I think we're getting to a net.

514
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
We just made a long list.

515
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,960
And that's when it jello singing career.

516
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,360
This is a thing that is coming that you've like you keep bringing it up.

517
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,760
You've even you even use the phrase I'm calling my shot a net singing career.

518
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,920
You dressed it up with this kind of like sports terminology.

519
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Yes, and we and we've and we've had all of these things

520
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,920
where like now the audience can suggest topics.

521
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,520
We do it on Clovis three.

522
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,920
There is there's never been a little.

523
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,800
There's been a little swell for a net.

524
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,080
I have seen a net popped up.

525
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,400
Well, a little swell.

526
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
But that's because people don't know what's coming.

527
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,440
That's what I think.

528
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,680
I'm not against doing it.

529
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,120
I just think like sure, doing it would be great.

530
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,120
But then we end Mike's plate.

531
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,560
You're Kevin McCarthy.

532
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,720
As well, that's true.

533
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,960
You need to do fit 15 references of a net singing career and then we'll do it.

534
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,960
That's true. Well, we could you know, we can go album by album episode for for album.

535
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,920
So we're we're now booking.

536
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,440
How many how many are we talking?

537
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,160
You got a good amount.

538
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,520
I mean, like there was a Hawaiian net, which is a Hawaiian album.

539
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,760
Listed Italian.

540
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,600
Go ahead. List them again.

541
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,000
Then there was the ones from the movies specifically.

542
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,720
So also a net in Disney context, I'm sure we can find a ton of interesting stuff.

543
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,640
Yeah. So you want to cover all the UNICEF things or the I think she was UNICEF

544
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,600
or that might have been Shirley Temple Black.

545
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,040
But I'm sure they think that is well, Jason's calling a shot now.

546
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,640
Shirley Temple Black, UNICEF, not Shirley Temple, the Shirley Temple Black era.

547
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,440
Right. She was married. Post marriage. Right.

548
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,800
OK, we'll keep calling shots as we go on this episode.

549
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,120
We'll call more. Great. All right.

550
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,600
Yeah. Well, let's call them out when you can.

551
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,800
Anyway, starting the start of the year with hot dogs.

552
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,000
But now to move to officially to the people mover,

553
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,280
AKA the Goodyear people mover, AKA the wet wave mover, AKA people mover

554
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,680
through the world of Tron, AKA people, AKA Tomorrowland Transit Authority,

555
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,000
AKA Tomorrowland Transit Authority, people mover.

556
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,920
And that is I don't even know if that's I still might be missing one.

557
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,840
There have been a lot of odd officials, but also unofficial names of this attraction.

558
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,120
But you only call one thing really.

559
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,360
I think. Yeah.

560
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,120
I what my family occasionally

561
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,560
early on, I think we would occasionally call it the wet wave people mover.

562
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,120
You would say you would do the full wheelie the way we got to the way people move.

563
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,640
Yeah, because my parents went a number of times before we were born.

564
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,600
My brother and I were born.

565
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,280
And that's how it was always called back then.

566
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,640
And then eventually I wrote it before the redo,

567
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,680
the 94 redo a couple of times, I would think.

568
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,320
But yeah, every now and then we call it the wet wave people mover.

569
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,440
Hmm. That's a kicks. That's nerd shit.

570
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,160
I would. Wow. Now that's a shot called my call.

571
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,560
Mike calling the nerd shot.

572
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,760
Yeah, I'm not saying it's bad.

573
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
I'm just saying that's that's some nerd cred.

574
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
That's a nerd parents.

575
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,200
Recognize game. That's all this said.

576
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,480
I know canon wise, if it is called the Tomorrowland Transit Authority,

577
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,560
I've never in my life out loud called it to a person.

578
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Let's go ride the Tomorrowland Transit Authority.

579
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,920
You want to hit the Tomorrowland Transit Authority?

580
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,120
In Canada, TTA, the TTA.

582
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,520
Yeah, the TTA.

583
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
No, I've never called it that.

584
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,120
Yeah, we've only said people over.

585
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,920
My mom was obsessed with the people mover.

586
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,880
So she always like early on, it was like we got to the people mover.

587
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,880
But I had never. So this is a bit because it does go back just to

588
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,120
and we'll go through history.

589
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,920
But seventy five in Disney World, sixty seven in Disneyland

590
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,360
and has not been there for a long time.

591
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,320
But, you know, over on the West Coast, my mom loved it.

592
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,960
So like an early one, like we're going to Disneyland.

593
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,760
Oh, you have to do.

594
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,160
It's probably part of my first visit.

595
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,440
I'm sure yours too. This is like this was the original Soarin.

596
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,800
I think was who did Matt Apodaca call Soarin the Josh Groban of rides?

597
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,640
Am I or am I attributing that to somebody else?

598
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,480
But it's a good quote because it is true.

599
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,600
Everyone's mom, I know, loves Soarin.

600
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,760
And it seems like it might be similar for the people mover as well.

601
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,280
Yeah. Well, not I think, you know, it's a ride that that anybody can still do.

602
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,880
It's very much in all ages ride.

603
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,800
But then also they probably got to do it when there was less in the park.

604
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah. Like not to say it's like still one of like I must do this.

605
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,160
I can't be in one of those parks and not do it.

606
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,760
But there in 67 and 75, this was like major.

607
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,280
And among the primary attractions, it must have felt like a self-driving car.

608
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,360
It must have truly felt very because you were in Tomorrowland also.

609
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,800
So at the time when you went on it, it probably did feel like the future.

610
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,080
It did feel like, well, I'm in this like tiny little square that's moving

611
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,760
and there's no one driving it.

612
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,400
I've never been in something like this before.

613
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,680
Like it must have felt really cool at the time.

614
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,200
I think so, for sure, especially with the rise of like science fiction

615
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,080
as popular, you know, book genre and movie and TV genre and stuff.

616
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,400
And then you see this futuristic looking thing, even though as it went on,

617
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,920
it progressively became more cage like.

618
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,320
Sure, yes.

619
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,560
Greasy, futuristic.

620
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,240
Having Scott, I yeah, I guess I was wondering what was it like

621
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,360
growing up riding the Disneyland one until 1995,

622
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,320
where it was a steak was put through its heart, you know, it was Jason.

623
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,960
It was wonderful. What can I say?

624
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,920
It was great. It was one of my favorite things to do. Yeah.

625
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,600
One thing I don't really remember is if it ever.

626
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,080
Oh, no, it did get a paint job.

627
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,960
So I don't remember. I don't know if I ever did it with because it had

628
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,920
initially the Disney primary colors like the utopia, like the skyway.

629
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,200
It was another one of those attractions where it's bright red and bright

630
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,160
yellow and bright blue.

631
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,560
And then I like the, you know, the unified future vibe of it, too.

632
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,280
But they're just they're delightful vehicles to sit in.

633
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,080
It's that great Disney rounded plastic.

634
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,320
It was a ride I could do the first time I went when I was three or so

635
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,400
and that I do every time and a long ride.

636
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,520
Yeah, the the thing like and we'll talk about the things

637
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,600
that you can see on the people mover, but the one leg up,

638
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,080
I think the Disneyland one has had, oh, God, longer.

639
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,800
And and some of that longer being

640
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,960
that you actually go out into the utopia slash submarine area

641
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,240
and your whizzing in and out of skyway cars and the monorail.

642
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,800
It just made that whole, you know, that upper right corner

643
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,480
that we've complained about a number of times that feels a little

644
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,960
inessential these days.

645
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,720
It didn't used to be there were four really pleasant rides going.

646
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,280
Yeah, all tire five.

647
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,440
Did I count submarines?

648
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,280
I guess if you in that.

649
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,720
Oh, and the motorboats, there was such an active zone.

650
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,480
I just I loved it.

651
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,040
I love the kinetic energy of like all these modes of transit running at once.

652
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,000
And you could see them all at once.

653
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,040
It's wild to watch in the old videos on YouTube.

654
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,480
Yeah. And we've talked about before, like

655
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,880
the train going through Splash Mountain or something

656
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,680
go rides going through rides is the greatest.

657
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,040
And we've tried to break down why.

658
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,760
And I don't know if we've ever completely solidified it, but it just

659
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,120
there's something about it that makes you feel like, I don't know,

660
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,600
like you're flying through you're like it's like a dream.

661
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,560
I don't know. Well, it's less of a good investigative thinking about it.

662
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,120
You probably have a better like emotional argument to it.

663
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,960
I feel like maybe I admire it from like a planning perspective.

664
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,440
You know, it makes you feel like, you know, you want to feel like Disneyland.

665
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,320
And any theme park is one coherent vision.

666
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,280
Well, that's yes, instead of, yes.

667
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,440
Well, then this thing broke.

668
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,320
So we put something there and we needed to do a movie tie in.

669
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,120
So we put some of that.

670
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,400
It's by nature a little more haphazard and places we live.

671
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,680
Cities are haphazard.

672
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,280
But the people move like this through line,

673
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,480
which is what it was supposed to be in the world.

674
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,760
If it was a real public transit system, it just felt smart.

675
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,920
Like, well, we have this store and this ride, but also we have the space

676
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,240
for this this little train thing to go through.

677
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,720
And we built a new roller coaster, but we made sure it also leaves

678
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,240
space for the little ride to go through.

679
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,920
Yes. Yeah.

680
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,560
The I'm trying to think like, I guess, like with the railroad even,

681
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,120
it does feel like that specifically.

682
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,480
And I guess maybe with the subs to even the subs are the subs never feel

683
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,960
like Tomorrowland to me, even though they are. Sure.

684
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,360
But it feels like especially like railroad to Splash Mountain and stuff.

685
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,760
It's like the different worlds are connecting a little bit.

686
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,640
You get a little peak, a little piece, a train in the river boat with all.

687
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah, on it.

688
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,560
Those don't really make sense together, but why not?

689
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,120
That's you get a little peak and you like zoom in and out.

690
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,640
And then it feels like you're getting a diff.

691
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,040
Also a big part of it, I think you're getting

692
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,200
views of things from different vantage points, which is because we all want

693
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,680
the walk out of the walk walk off.

694
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,480
Yeah. Walk off is like the most desired thing is getting to see robots up close

695
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,120
or from a different angle.

696
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,480
So when you get to see like the kick line on Splash Mountain from high up.

697
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,320
Well, look at that's different. Sure. Yes.

698
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Perspective in the log think there's only one right to see this, but we

699
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,760
have smarted them. So the whole people mover is that going through things.

700
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,040
And when you got to see like Space Mountain before you even were brave enough

701
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,160
to write it well, yeah. And before it was even done.

702
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,720
I mean, this poster, I think is pretty iconic.

703
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,920
The one in Florida that says preview Space Mountain.

704
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,600
The scenic way way way people mover.

705
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,520
And so they would use that the seeing stuff from other angles.

706
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,600
It wasn't marketing technique.

707
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,240
Yeah, and it were. It's great.

708
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,640
If you had to synopsize the attraction,

709
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,880
if in case people have not done it or not super familiar,

710
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,280
my vague attempt would be that it's a it is a network

711
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,920
of little trains of little futuristic cars that give you a scenic

712
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:10,360
tour of Tomorrowland from an elevated vantage point, from the second story

713
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,240
that lets you see scenic views of the outside of Tomorrowland,

714
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,200
but also weaves in and out of both stores and rides and probably other

715
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,160
things you could classify. Yeah, I think that's good.

716
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,240
I think there is a word missing from that description that is overused by me

717
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,400
on this podcast.

718
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,160
It is a more intimate little train car, essentially, you know,

719
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,640
it can fit like your family and that's it.

720
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,800
And it's open. It's much more open than generally than a train car.

721
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,880
Not much more, I guess, but it just feels like that because there are only

722
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:46,400
a few people in there and it floats you by things from a high up perspective,

723
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,440
which is fun to be high up as Jason knows. Yes. Yes. Yes.

724
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,080
So, yeah, you're on a tiny, intimate little train, futuristic train car,

725
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,080
squeezing through little tunnels, little tunnels.

726
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,560
You know, could fit anything.

727
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,400
Yeah. Yeah.

728
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,360
Seeing views that other people don't get.

729
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,280
Tomorrow's transportation today.

730
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,840
This is the Disneyland poster.

731
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,960
Also, I think pretty iconic. Beautiful.

732
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,880
The people mover. Look how much fun those people are having.

733
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,280
The 60s, uh, mod characters are having.

734
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,280
They've not been caged in yet.

735
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,640
Mm hmm. There's a little more freedom.

736
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,240
Yes. Open air. You're getting a breeze.

737
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,040
And this is I like making the emotional arguments here because you start going

738
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,240
like if that, you know, that synopsis that we gave,

739
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,840
that might not sound like a ride that we all have a lot of like feelings about.

740
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,080
But you start adding up. It's all the little things.

741
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,920
One being like the breeze.

742
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,040
You get a nice breeze on these things. Oh, yeah.

743
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,200
And I'm less familiar with the Florida one,

744
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,680
but I know that the elements are crazier in Florida.

745
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,760
You get pretty crazy heat and rain too.

746
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,720
And with this, this is a ride that you can do and not be too affected by those things.

747
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,720
That's that's great. Yeah. The breeze.

748
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,120
Many times we've said air conditioning. Big deal. Breeze. Also a big deal.

749
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,040
You get a breeze on a ride outside. Drop my phone. Excuse me.

750
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,160
Uh, I also will say this. We just mentioned the height.

751
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,720
I think of this thing's on the ground. We're not as excited about it.

752
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,320
Who cares? Yes, absolutely. You know what?

753
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,040
And you know what? I think it's like something we've never talked about on the show.

754
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,760
I don't know if I'm going to call a shot on this one, but we'll do it.

755
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,320
OK, point. You know that thing?

756
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,200
The view liner 50s attraction, early, early Disneyland attraction

757
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,120
that was kind of next to the train.

758
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,040
But it was a colder steel train, a future train.

759
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,480
Yeah. Where you saw less.

760
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,600
As far as I know, it was a shorter route

761
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,880
and you don't get to see the rivers and the critters and all that.

762
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:41,400
It's just a like a grounded future train that barely goes anywhere.

763
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,080
Unless I'm wrong and we look into it in the view liner was great.

764
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,080
But if it was so great, why is it gone? Right. Good point.

765
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,200
I think it's it's like the

766
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,040
there used to like early an early episode.

767
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,320
I think I said Disneyland used to be dirty with trains.

768
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,280
There were so many. You certainly did say that. Yes.

769
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,080
And that was the little one.

770
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,400
It's similar, more of a bullet train kind of look,

771
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,520
but similar to the one that Walt had in his backyard.

772
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,640
I think they kind of squat sat on. Oh, is that right?

773
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,200
No, that's it.

774
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,120
The view liner was this like unfriendly kind of steel thing.

775
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,600
Because, yeah, there's another kind of.

776
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,480
Yeah, the thing in his yard was a it was an old West style,

777
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,240
but you sat over the whole thing instead of an enclosed train.

778
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,200
Can I say can I say this, Jason?

779
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,680
I'm sorry. I don't want to make you upset this early in the podcast.

780
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,280
But when I was a little kid, I didn't care about the train.

781
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,720
The Disneyland Railroad or Disney World Railroad.

782
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,520
I didn't care about going on the train when I was at Disney World.

783
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,960
Well, I wanted to go on the people mover all the time.

784
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,200
I loved the people over.

785
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,640
Well, I always love the people mover more the train. Sure.

786
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,240
But I'm just saying I was not a train, a little train boy.

787
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,320
That's fine, because the Disney World train,

788
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,480
practical for getting from location to location. Right.

789
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,880
Good for like, OK, everything's got a long wait.

790
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,160
And it's 100 degrees outside.

791
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,560
We need to cool down somehow this train.

792
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,000
There's no way for the train.

793
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,360
A little boring than the Disneyland. Well, that's true. Yes.

794
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,640
But I would say now, like, say we had a people functioning people

795
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,920
mover out here.

796
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,240
I mean, I think I'm I go on the train if I'm with you and you want to go on it.

797
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,600
I'm happy to do it.

798
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,040
If I'm if I have my druthers, maybe every tenth

799
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,520
seventh trip to Disneyland is when I go on the train.

800
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,440
Yeah, it's not that frequent.

801
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,480
You got a little you got a little girl, not a little boy.

802
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,240
I got a little boy.

803
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,720
Well, we're going to do we're going to do the train a lot.

804
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,360
Yeah. When we start going, she might super take to it.

805
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,880
Yeah. But my boy loved it.

806
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,560
Yes. And I'm not the whole thing.

807
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,360
I can stomach a train ride if my daughter wants to do it.

808
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,800
Yes. And it is. I guess you'll find when you go to Disney.

809
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,280
It's very exciting to be at Disneyland with a two year old.

810
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,040
But then like, what do we do, though?

811
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,400
There are a lot a lot of things not on the table.

812
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,440
And the people mover would have been perfect.

813
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,520
Yeah. It's such a bummer.

814
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,480
I can't. I I'm sure we'll continue bringing stuff like this up.

815
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,760
But the people mover, there's an article on mice chat from Sam Genovese,

816
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,360
the Disney historian we've talked about his books before.

817
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,320
And this is where I'm sure a lot of plays say this,

818
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,040
but this is where I saw this number.

819
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,400
The attraction could host up to 4885 guests per hour.

820
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,160
Yeah. Could you imagine if we still had the people mover at Disneyland,

821
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,200
all those pieces taken off the chessboard?

822
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,520
Oh, my God. Save for crying.

823
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,440
Nice. It's like a real public transit situation that would just like

824
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,080
that would like lift traffic away, hopefully.

825
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,320
Like if it would do it in a city and it would do it in Disneyland.

826
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,760
Yeah. Because that practical reality of the Disneyland people

827
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,080
mover, as I know it, is garbage.

828
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,200
It's trash. It's just unused tracks, unused awnings, unused second levels.

829
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,800
Because I never got to ride it.

830
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,360
I don't have the affection for it that I do in the Florida.

831
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,720
You were very when we were texting, you were very cold.

832
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,360
You really I would like to talk about Disney World a lot because the current one is crap.

833
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,640
It is tracks that are rusting away and I have nothing to say about it.

834
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,760
I mean, that's true.

835
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,160
That's also a bad habit of how I used to text at old jobs

836
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,560
where everyone's like sneaking their phones out, doing it real fast

837
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,080
and putting it away.

838
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,200
Why are you doing it really fast and putting it away?

839
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,120
Because of the insane and PAA regulations.

840
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,240
No, no, with us. Why are you secret?

841
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,800
No, it's a bad old habit I fall into when I'm trying to be clear and concise.

842
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,240
So you weren't hiding your phone from some like people

843
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,640
mover manager manager. Yeah. Yeah. Six five.

844
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,400
Fred Gwynn. In my bed, I had made a little for research for it

845
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,320
and it was typing on my computer. Oh, my God.

846
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,040
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

847
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,520
You made a little race.

848
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,320
I'm a racing everything previous to this.

849
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,640
So we have enough room to talk about.

850
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,560
Please explain the little research board.

851
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,920
I was just had pillows on for my back and Jason Jason.

852
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,040
I hate to say slow, slow down again.

853
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,120
How many pillows leisurely trip?

854
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,480
How many pillows? What type of pillows?

855
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,160
We need it. We need bed pillows. Great.

856
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,480
So full size for three or four. Yeah.

857
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,920
And you've got your arms. I've got my arms.

858
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,280
Are you are you lying down or you kind of seated up?

859
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,080
I'm sitting up with a pillow on my back.

860
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,960
One pillow is pillows is for Garfield to also sleep on.

861
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,920
Oh, that's adorable. There's a little dog there, too.

862
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,200
He doesn't even need the bed.

863
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,760
He doesn't even just the bed is not soft enough for him.

864
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,280
He needs a pillow. He likes to use a pillow.

865
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,480
He puts his head on. I love that. Like a man.

866
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,800
Sometimes we share a pillow. Oh, adorable. Yeah.

867
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,680
OK, so he's on one of the pillows.

868
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,800
You are propped up with one of the pillows.

869
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,760
And then where the other pillow is being used for.

870
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,480
I think I had my computer on one. OK.

871
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,720
And was using a Bluetooth keyboard.

872
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,560
OK. Wow.

873
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,080
Because the MacBook Air keyboard makes my hand cramp sometimes. OK.

874
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,040
Well, you need to invest.

875
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,840
You need a minority report situation where you can pull up all of your

876
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,600
all of your screens and your websites and your Sam Genovese

877
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,400
and then just slide them around.

878
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,960
Basically, yeah.

879
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,200
If you can get we can get you a hands free way to.

880
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,840
I mean, that's the way to take the research forward into the next century.

881
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,800
Did you finish what it is or did you put you put like a blanket

882
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,680
over the top with a flashlight?

883
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,880
No. OK. All right.

884
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,880
I was more just it was freezing out and it was pouring rain outside.

885
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,360
So I was just cozy.

886
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,960
This is interesting. We haven't talked about this in year.

887
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,680
Whatever this is. Six. What are we doing?

888
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,720
I think so.

889
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,480
I am I will sometimes like kind of like Cleopatra style,

890
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,960
I cross the bed with the computer and do my research like that.

891
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,000
I don't plan out like what you're talking about.

892
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,120
I don't always, but I was doing it before we recorded in a bed

893
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,240
with my with my cat bunny next to me.

894
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,720
OK, like lying down like Jason or I think.

895
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,720
Hold on. I was sitting upright.

896
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
OK, sitting. Well, right.

897
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
Oh, sorry. Sorry. I mean, like sitting sort of.

898
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,760
It might have been similar.

899
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,680
Hospital bed, hospital bed style, like slightly slight incline.

900
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,800
Yeah. I end up on my like left side.

901
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,880
It's a bad thing. It's my should probably hurt my shoulder and like my left abs.

902
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,680
Whatever is left of them.

903
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,360
I end up like kind of like leaning, doing stuff on the bed sometimes.

904
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,720
That sounds very uncomfortable.

905
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,160
You got to you got to invest in a fort.

906
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,680
The fort is better. Yes.

907
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,280
I agree with that.

908
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,120
Please listen to any artist listeners.

909
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,240
Please visualize.

910
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,080
Let us see what what what you saw when Jason said research for.

911
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,480
I love the sound of it. Yeah.

912
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,960
We were. Yeah, we need to see it.

913
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,760
We you you love to see it.

914
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,360
But yeah, feel free to draw me like Cleopatra, though, if you want.

915
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,680
And draw Scott with his little cat.

916
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,400
With my little cat.

917
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,920
Yeah. Well, I should post a picture.

918
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,120
Wow. It's fun.

919
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,840
We all research in cute little ways, different, cute ways.

920
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:54,000
With animal comforts and with with cushions and the dog won't get up.

921
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,360
My dog, he won't get in the bed with me.

922
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,160
He does early in the morning.

923
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,120
And that's it. He will not come into the bed until the next morning.

924
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,360
He refuses. I don't know why. Weird.

925
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,560
Hmm. Yeah.

926
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,800
Also, my note for you, Mike, would be grapes.

927
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,840
You should get grapes. And if you. Oh, yeah.

928
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,520
I mean, it sounds like the dog's uncooperative.

929
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,600
So I'm this is dog.

930
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,720
And I'm extrapolating way too far.

931
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,480
But if the dog could serve you the grapes now, now we're fully a petromod.

932
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,000
I would love that.

933
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,120
And watch out for asps that your enemies may sick on you.

934
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,720
Oh, OK. Bumper Carboys.

935
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,200
The bumper carboys.

936
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,040
But again, there are people move.

937
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,720
Our episode is going to be way better than ours because we haven't heard of what that is.

938
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,800
Yeah.

939
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,520
Wow. OK.

940
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,960
Let me swing it back to

941
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,280
from that to dry stats.

942
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,360
Let's do dry stats.

943
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,600
Would you that that number you said forty eight hundred?

944
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,320
Yeah, basically forty eight hundred.

945
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,640
Anybody know what the current Disneyland highest?

946
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,320
You don't have to say. Oh, oh.

947
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,520
But if you had to get the highest capacity attraction,

948
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,520
is it Hauna Mansion Mansion or pirates?

949
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,600
Is higher higher? Yeah.

950
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,840
Any guess of the number?

951
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,240
Per hour longer than I did know this at one point.

952
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,040
Is it three thousand something?

953
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,000
That's right. Yeah.

954
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,160
Thirty four hundred.

955
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,240
Yeah. Three thousand four hundred thirty.

956
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,760
Not anywhere close to the people mover.

957
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,600
Yeah. And that's right.

958
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,040
Still feels a little like slow.

959
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,720
I mean, it's like the length certainly helps.

960
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,440
But then it's small world, not a mansion.

961
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,240
The only two that are above three thousand are pirates in small world.

962
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,040
Yeah, I should know that because the boat rides are slower.

963
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,920
Yeah. So people are on the wire to ride.

964
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,880
And they're important to have and the longer that they can be.

965
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,080
And I think that when we did the Na'vi River Journey episode,

966
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,680
it didn't dawn on me until I was driving home.

967
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,920
That like, oh, I think the thing that we I I wish was I wish it was longer.

968
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,920
It is an average length ride for like standard theme park attractions.

969
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,200
But for boat. Oh, yeah.

970
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,800
Short boat is a short.

971
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,200
Yeah. Or three times as long.

972
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,160
You know what? Yeah. Well, Matt, my whole note was just more scenes

973
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,400
and moods and changes.

974
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,240
And I think our notes go hand in hand.

975
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,800
If there was just but it doesn't the whole ride does.

976
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,320
I saw a roadie. I don't know if we specifically said this, but I think

977
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,200
I saw a roadie saying that the ride was born out of.

978
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,400
We have extra space in the flight of passage facility. Right.

979
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,960
So it was almost an afterthought in a way.

980
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,960
Not to that, you know, that's not fair to that ride.

981
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,480
But, you know, roadie implied that a little bit.

982
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,040
So, you know, if they ever built a new Pandora,

983
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,480
which they should given the smash success of by a wire.

984
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,000
Let's get it into the other parks.

985
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,680
Let's get it into Disneyland forward.

986
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,800
I want hotels demolished and I want Pandora built.

987
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,400
I want small businesses out of business.

988
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,120
I want your shopkeepers.

989
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,880
Yes. People on Harbor out of business.

990
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,560
I want Bob Iger to rule Harbor Boulevard and everything around it.

991
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,960
Tony Roma's gone.

992
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,800
Don Stevens in Dr. Stevens in. Yes.

993
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,200
But in video, a lot of those restaurants are the chain.

994
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,080
Let's get rid of the chain.

995
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,480
If it's a mom and pop, it's doing its best.

996
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
Go on.

997
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,720
Oh, yeah, you're right.

998
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,880
You're right. You're right.

999
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,880
Yeah.

1000
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,520
Go mom and pop.

1001
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,680
So you're saying in the same way, the little man of Disneyland Golden Book,

1002
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,520
where they explain to a little man that he lives in the place

1003
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,280
they're going to build Disneyland and it's going to be great

1004
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,520
if you just stay here and make a deal with us.

1005
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,680
Maybe mom and pop, they just build Pandora around them.

1006
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,640
Say they have a diner. Sure.

1007
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,240
You build the Pandora around a little diner and let mom and pop still run it.

1008
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,840
Well, now we're now we're in the Pandora spirit.

1009
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,000
Right. Because, you know, the interlopers shouldn't kick out

1010
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,880
the people who live there already.

1011
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,400
So that's, you know, and the land of Pandora is post war

1012
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,480
where humans and you're getting along.

1013
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,720
So, yes, that's it should be post war where Disney and Harbor

1014
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,520
residents are getting along. Right.

1015
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,000
But Disney has taken over.

1016
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,240
Yeah. Yeah. First things first. Yeah.

1017
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,560
Pandora. Inspire that cold stone to be a better cold stone.

1018
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,240
That's true. Yeah. It'll be good for the cold stones. Bad.

1019
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,120
And well, when we do the Harbor Hohdown,

1020
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:07,040
no, which I'm calling the shots for 2025.

1021
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,280
Oh, great.

1022
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,880
Let your daughter get older and then we'll deal with the Harbor Hohdown.

1023
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,840
OK. Anyway, look, high capacity.

1024
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,160
I what else is like a important.

1025
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,520
Oh, I know. I know.

1026
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,160
Mike, you already said it, that the if it's on the ground,

1027
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,000
maybe you don't care.

1028
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,840
But in the in the air, you more than care.

1029
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,800
That's the that's good. Yeah.

1030
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,120
It's I and it's not just that it's elevated.

1031
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,040
But I think so.

1032
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,200
You know, this attraction comes in in 67, the first time that they radically revamp

1033
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,520
Tomorrowland, and it was a little chintzy before.

1034
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,840
It was a little unfinished before.

1035
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,280
And it's all these like Monsanto exhibits that are half thought out.

1036
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,040
And I don't know. We need something to fill this room.

1037
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,000
God, just someone give us money and you can do whatever ad you want in here.

1038
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,240
That now Tomorrowland in 67 is actually thought out.

1039
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,840
And I think at that point, it gets a big leg up the other lands

1040
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,680
because you think about the other lands,

1041
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,960
Main Street, there's all those windows up there, but you can't go up there.

1042
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,480
And it's built with seven eight scale or I don't remember the scale.

1043
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,080
But, you know, it's fake fantasy land.

1044
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,960
You can't go up into the windows with the queen or whatever frontier land.

1045
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,640
You can't go into the offices above the Golden Horseshoe.

1046
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,280
This is the only land with a second story.

1047
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,200
Yes, good point.

1048
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,600
It just like dimensionalizes it and makes it this this full little town,

1049
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,760
which they really ran with in the 94 redo.

1050
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,120
Tomorrowland isn't just this hypothetical fantasy world that it is.

1051
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,080
It is an actual bustling metro.

1052
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,960
There's so much of my childhood and I assume a lot of kids,

1053
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,920
whether they've thought about it or not, is spent playing video games

1054
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,720
and going to places that have some promise, but you can actually enter it.

1055
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,200
Like, OK, here, let me say this better.

1056
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,800
Main Street is a great example.

1057
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,960
You want to go in every store on Main Street when you're especially when you're little.

1058
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,640
You want to believe everything is real.

1059
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,640
When you see the exterior of certain houses or when I went to Santa's village

1060
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,120
and put out Santa's house, I want to go in Santa's house.

1061
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,160
It's a facade. You can't go in it.

1062
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,120
Playing the especially early video games.

1063
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,360
You want to be able to go in all the locations.

1064
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,320
You want to feel like you have a complete access to this whole world, but you do not.

1065
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,080
Yeah, so there's so much of it.

1066
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,280
So when like we didn't have Toontown in Florida,

1067
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,280
so when it was like Mickey's birthday land and you could go in Mickey's house,

1068
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,600
that idea is so attractive to a kid.

1069
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,640
And what you're saying makes sense with Tomorrowland,

1070
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,080
where you get the extra dimension of it.

1071
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,560
Yeah, that you don't get in the other land.

1072
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,600
So you do feel like it's a little more real than the other place.

1073
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,640
More like a city.

1074
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,520
A city isn't just one level.

1075
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,720
And that's it. Yeah, sure.

1076
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,240
A city has a second level at least.

1077
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,400
And it finally got it.

1078
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,680
You want to feel like everything's infinite.

1079
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1080
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,000
And it really helps with that.

1081
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,240
And you really you feel the the lack of it. Right.

1082
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:04,800
I think one thing when it opens in 67 is that it is part of OK.

1083
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,720
The 67 Tomorrowland is PeopleMover, it's Adventure Through Inner Space,

1084
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,400
it's Carousel of Progress, and it's the Rocket Jets.

1085
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,680
And the Rocket Jets are put on top of this platform

1086
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,400
on the on the third store.

1087
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,040
We have a third store. Yes.

1088
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,480
Yeah. So Disneyland is expanding upward.

1089
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,680
And I loved that so much that there is this tower that is a ride sandwich.

1090
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,160
There are two rides on this same structure.

1091
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,040
And you talk about your kinetic energy.

1092
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,240
You got a ton there.

1093
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,960
And now that they've let Tomorrowland go to hell and the PeopleMover is gone

1094
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,000
and they moved that, they changed it from rocket jets to Astro Orbiter,

1095
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,440
which is now on the ground.

1096
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,560
Who cares? Just like you said before.

1097
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,560
Why would you not want it to be up super high?

1098
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,520
And there's that weird sculpture, quote unquote, that doesn't even move anymore.

1099
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,480
They have taken a tower that was a ride sandwich that had two rides on it.

1100
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,480
And now there are zero rides on it. Insane.

1101
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,680
You go to Disney World. What do you get there? How many rides?

1102
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,960
You get the Astro Orbiter on top of the PeopleMover.

1103
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,560
It still looks great.

1104
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,640
Ride sandwich to two to zero. Yeah.

1105
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,120
It's it's how could you let how could you let a situation

1106
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,160
transpire where it goes from two to zero?

1107
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,680
This is one of the strangest decisions. Yeah.

1108
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,360
I mean, you know, it's it's it is a Baxter choice.

1109
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,720
We know I don't look I don't want to put this on him.

1110
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,520
I mean, the Astro Orbiter thing. Yeah.

1111
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,880
Yeah. I mean, look, I possibly I think so.

1112
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,240
They would again to use the will say this kinetic energy is again.

1113
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,400
That was the idea is that the hub and being right would attract

1114
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,320
now that these jets are flying by.

1115
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,520
And look, the Astro Orbiter is great in Paris.

1116
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,160
So he's coming off of that.

1117
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,600
He's like, it's cool there.

1118
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,120
So it'd be cool here.

1119
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,720
And then what you lose is that the crazy thing about that tower

1120
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:00,040
in Disneyland is they just stripped all of the rockets and the ride parts.

1121
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,880
Right. Of that.

1122
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,280
And then just put a bunch of satellite dishes on it and painted a gold.

1123
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,920
Yeah. Used to it was cool when it worked for a year.

1124
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,760
Yeah. I don't do it anymore.

1125
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,080
Any version of it when I first came in 2006, maybe in 2007,

1126
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,720
it would play like a medley.

1127
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,240
It would play music and it would rise and fall like it.

1128
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,040
We're still doing it.

1129
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,880
Then they were doing it.

1130
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,720
I think that the whole the tomorrow that tomorrow and redo,

1131
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,280
I think that most people involved the lack of budget, you know,

1132
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,080
rocket rods, of course, not working.

1133
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,560
But I mean, everything, I think the whole thing, there was some regret,

1134
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,640
just like there was a lack of budget in general.

1135
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,560
So I think there were probably people would make different decisions

1136
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,320
if they had to do over again.

1137
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,320
And I think Disney World got in there right on time.

1138
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:50,360
Their 90s redo was kind of before everything got shut down so thoroughly.

1139
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,600
So they got the money and it and it shows what a like incredibly built

1140
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,000
and fleshed out world it still is.

1141
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,200
And yeah, pretty well received.

1142
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,800
Aging pretty well.

1143
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,840
Comparing videos like, oh, yeah, it's a lot more of the old blues.

1144
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,440
They've gotten rid of a lot of the neon purple and greens.

1145
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,440
They've taken down some of the fins.

1146
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,000
But it still looks pretty good.

1147
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,840
Yeah, it's still pretty still mostly coherent and looks like it.

1148
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,960
It used the theme that it used.

1149
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,320
You know, the the, you know, I think Tomorrowland in Florida

1150
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,000
at the moment gets points for having a people mover.

1151
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,120
Tomorrowland in Disneyland gets points for having the more pleasant

1152
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,520
Space Mountain certainly experience.

1153
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,760
That's true. Yeah.

1154
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,120
Disney, although World might get the bump when they get the fucking Tron coaster

1155
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,640
and they have to roller coaster.

1156
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,400
That's pretty big. I am.

1157
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,680
I don't want to tangent too much.

1158
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,080
Has everyone seen the video of this weird Florida holiday space mountain?

1159
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,240
Incredible. No, it is wild.

1160
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,840
No, it's like red and green lights playing loud Christmas music

1161
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,920
while you're on Space Mountain in Florida.

1162
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,400
And I don't know that it works, but boy, did I want to try to do it

1163
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,920
because it seems so strange.

1164
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,720
It is just like techno Christmas carols at 11 turned up to 11.

1165
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,560
Insane blaring.

1166
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,960
Whoa. And it's so weird looking.

1167
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,720
But I'm like, this is I want to do this.

1168
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,040
I only learned about it this year.

1169
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,800
Apparently they do it at the Christmas parties.

1170
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,320
And then the week leading the week around Christmas, everyone gets it.

1171
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,480
Like, that's the exchange for the Christmas parties.

1172
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,400
It seems like an overlay done with absolutely no finesse whatsoever,

1173
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,800
which is why I like it looks awesome.

1174
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,640
Like kind of like it's it's a little stupid.

1175
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,200
It's very stupid.

1176
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,680
I think it's like, you know, it's cosmic bowling, just like champion.

1177
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,400
UV lights. And now it's right.

1178
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:42,560
It's a teen experience like the Star Wars overlay for the Space Mountain out here

1179
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,280
feels like they did their very best to figure out ways to subtly put in.

1180
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,840
It's still like there's obviously it's not perfect,

1181
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,160
but like they really figured out like ways to do things and make, you know,

1182
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,040
lasers from an X wing look kind of like, you know, alongside your car or whatever.

1183
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,600
This is nothing like that.

1184
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,080
This is like a blast. Some fucking music.

1185
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,200
Wow. This is like music like also is it?

1186
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,400
I'm trying to think. What is it like tubular bells like a techno or something?

1187
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,960
It's man. I'm steamroller.

1188
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,640
I don't know that it's that. But like, yeah, we should.

1189
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,360
We'll find a video of it. I'm not sure.

1190
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,760
But it's it's I'm so like blown away looking at the video of this.

1191
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,040
The overlay feels like a cast member

1192
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,320
like comes up to you while you're on the ride vehicle and goes,

1193
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,920
what color you want the lights in there?

1194
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,480
And you're like purple and orange and they're like, great.

1195
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,680
All right. Can you give me your iPhone and just like get yours?

1196
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,120
Give it a Spotify playlist.

1197
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,800
Whatever you want to play is fine.

1198
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,560
And I'd be like, all right.

1199
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,240
And like, that's how much care it seems like, which now makes me want

1200
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,360
that version of Space Mountain, which I guess is like the rip ride rocket

1201
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,840
or whatever, but even more personalized.

1202
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,960
That's music that is not synced in any way.

1203
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,240
Just there is no sync.

1204
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,920
If it's cool next to the ride, then it is.

1205
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,520
There should be like a vote.

1206
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,000
You collectively vote on what color you want the lights.

1207
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,640
And then just like you turn around and be like, anybody got a Spotify

1208
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,880
playlist they like and somebody just raise their hand and then

1209
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,640
that's what you're listening to on Space Mountain.

1210
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,880
OK, we're listening to the Pitbull mix.

1211
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,440
Oh, my God.

1212
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,080
Who is it? You have three to tango.

1213
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,800
His song about a Menage à trois with a music video that has John Travolta in it.

1214
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,880
Yeah, I got it. All right. Great. Perfect.

1215
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,320
OK, great. And then we'll unload a timber.

1216
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,800
When timber starts, it's time. Oh, man.

1217
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,760
Pitbull needs to be on Space Mountain.

1218
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,240
That would be so good.

1219
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,600
We've all been thinking it.

1220
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,480
Yeah, I that's a that's a more difficult shot.

1221
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,400
That you're calling, but maybe it will be worldwide.

1222
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,880
Mr. Four of five, right?

1223
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,880
Miami is not that far from Orlando.

1224
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,760
You know, and I don't even think that matters.

1225
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,520
I think he's so universal.

1226
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,160
I think he's got to be.

1227
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,280
Well, that's the issue.

1228
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,600
I think I think he's so universal.

1229
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:53,280
I think that's where his allegiance lies, because he played a great match of

1230
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,160
Duff Beer Pong, giant book, Duff.

1231
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,080
Oh, right. With Jimmy Fallon in a clip that only I remember.

1232
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,640
All right. Well, that's true.

1233
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,080
OK, well, we'll figure out a spot for him and universal.

1234
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1235
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:11,120
So there is a major theme park IP waiting to be grabbed and it's it's Pitbull.

1236
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,320
Oh, man.

1237
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,840
Do you want to go backwards and talk like where this

1238
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,000
comes from a little bit?

1239
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,400
We've made the we've made the emotional argument.

1240
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,280
But how do you end up with this ride besides that?

1241
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:29,720
It is the bit the first big redo of Tomorrowland and a major one,

1242
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,360
one that gave it the bones that kind of that it still has and that

1243
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,080
Disney World very much took over.

1244
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,240
But it has its roots in the ride that you were mentioning earlier, Jason,

1245
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,000
the Ford Magic Skyway. Yeah.

1246
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,160
Where that is a ride that we do have to do this one.

1247
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,760
It's so weird that you would sit in a Ford car.

1248
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,680
And I guess they actually this answers.

1249
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,520
I was always wondering, like, is the car on is the car in neutral?

1250
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,840
But this is the well, the answer is this right system.

1251
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,720
There's a conveyor belt.

1252
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:05,440
Apparently, this goes back to the 39 World's Fair in New York,

1253
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,320
where they give people test drives and Fords.

1254
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,840
But they have to wait in hours long lines because there's only so much track

1255
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,600
and only so many cars. Ah.

1256
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:21,160
And so when I think John Hinch went and toward like the Ford facility

1257
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,160
with Walt, they were like, oh, look at that conveyor belt with those ingots on it.

1258
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,520
You know, look at those look pretty heavy.

1259
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:33,680
What's an ingot like a piece of metal, like a metal like like a bolt?

1260
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,840
So along the lines of I think bolts and say I'm not 100 percent sure.

1261
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,800
I just saw the phrase ingots, but like a big hunk of metal.

1262
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,360
And they're like, well, that can hold pretty big hunks of metal.

1263
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,440
Do you think it could hold a Mustang?

1264
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,800
Hold an entire car. That's pretty cool.

1265
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,800
And then it was like, I really need to know.

1266
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,160
Well, like, well, I may well do it soon.

1267
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,840
You to like it is a you're in a 60s car

1268
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,440
that is on a car conveyor belt that is taking you to see dinosaurs.

1269
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,800
What a strange ride.

1270
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,640
I sort of wish that they had just gotten to move that ride

1271
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:13,240
lock stock and lock stock and ingot to Disneyland.

1272
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,920
Because like because everything else from the World of World's

1273
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,120
Ferrets again, Small World Curacao Progress,

1274
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,200
Lincoln, Lincoln, right, right. Yeah.

1275
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,880
Those all show up kind of as they were at the 64 World's Fair.

1276
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,960
Tower of the Four Winds garbage.

1277
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,280
Go right away.

1278
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,160
I did not bring it over.

1279
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,680
Throw it to the wind now.

1280
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,520
And in pieces, some of that ride made it.

1281
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,360
The dinosaurs made it to the train tunnel that they did not do the full.

1282
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,800
You sit in a car and see dinosaurs, which I wish they did.

1283
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,800
I think the reason that they didn't they were like, well,

1284
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,040
we'd like to do something like this, something that with this ride system,

1285
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,560
which was very innovative, where you were in a vehicle that does have wheels

1286
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,360
and the wheels are propelling you forward.

1287
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,280
But it's not there is no the engine is not on.

1288
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,600
There is no engine in your vehicle.

1289
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,640
And it's in it is the track that is doing all of the work.

1290
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,640
Yeah. And a specifically a bunch of spaced out tires

1291
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,080
that kind of grab your tires and propel them forward.

1292
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,560
And then when it needs another boost, you go past another set of tires.

1293
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,840
Well, what I read, because I think that was on the table like before.

1294
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,360
Do you want to sponsor the people mover?

1295
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,320
Well, at that point was using it as a test for a public transit system

1296
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,160
in the first version of Epcot. Right.

1297
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,920
And there was resistance from the Ford people of we do not want to sponsor a ride

1298
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:44,080
that shows the future of transportation is not our automobiles.

1299
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,480
And that is, yeah, that's that's electric.

1300
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,440
It doesn't involve the motors and engines.

1301
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,280
Yeah. But tires.

1302
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:56,120
Well, Goodyear tires are happy to sponsor this tire based ride.

1303
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:01,560
Of course, Goodyear tires will be the key to great public transportation.

1304
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,480
Of course, there will have to be Goodyear tires involved.

1305
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,160
So Goodyear gets involved.

1306
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,720
I think we talk about what our parents used to call it.

1307
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,760
I don't know that my mom did, but I think I think a lot of people

1308
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,200
in the 60s and 70s would call it the Goodyear people mover,

1309
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,640
even though it was not ever specifically called that,

1310
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,680
but it was heavily branded enough.

1311
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:26,480
But yes, so it also the idea is right, is to showcase this real idea

1312
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,560
that Walt has for public transportation.

1313
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,920
The you know, he there's this

1314
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:38,040
this this master plan that he made in this thing, Progress City,

1315
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,840
which then is part of this attraction.

1316
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,160
You see a big model of Progress City.

1317
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,360
And his whole notion was that cars are not part of the downtown of the city,

1318
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,440
that monorails do the heavy lifting.

1319
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,840
Those take you those do like the big traversing of distances.

1320
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,840
But then going from building to building are these little people movers. Yes.

1321
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,840
And another part of it was that he I think he said,

1322
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,080
and well, you know, I'll just temporarily call them people movers,

1323
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,240
but you guys will come up with a better term.

1324
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,640
And they did not ever in this term stuck.

1325
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,920
Now it's kind of a generic term that's used by others or whatever.

1326
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,520
Yeah.

1327
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,400
Because I've written people who is all over the place in Vegas at the Newark Airport.

1328
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:29,120
Yeah, I've written the one at the US Capitol.

1329
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,520
There is one under the US Capitol connecting buildings.

1330
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,920
But that'll come back around later.

1331
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,120
Sure. Sure. Airport with the George Bush Intercontinental Airport.

1332
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,520
People mover. We could pause on that.

1333
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,120
But anyways, yeah, no, there's things that are probably monorails,

1334
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,480
but you end up calling people movers.

1335
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,720
Yeah. Usually it's shorthand for like this looks like a monorail maybe,

1336
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,200
but it's automated. There's no conductor.

1337
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,800
It's funny if Walt had lived in like because we've the only way

1338
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,560
Walt ever got to make his like super villain city

1339
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,480
that was the original Epcot was if he lived and forced

1340
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,960
probably the company in a bankruptcy destroyed everything in pursuit of like

1341
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,120
his perfect city.

1342
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,720
But it feels like there's no way that would have been like lobbied into the

1343
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,160
ground because of the fact that cars were not an important part of it.

1344
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,000
Oh, you're right.

1345
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,760
Like cars are such a strong lobby that they've decimated public transit in so

1346
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,480
many different places. Yeah.

1347
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,840
And keep it from keep things from actually being efficient.

1348
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,440
Will they be underground where they couldn't be seen?

1349
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,520
The cars would. Well, that's true.

1350
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,280
And the, and the exterior you could drive around, I believe, because that's,

1351
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,200
well, let's call our shot original Walt Epcot special this year.

1352
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,680
Somebody needs to like, this is me.

1353
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,760
This is me using the audience as a personal assistant, which isn't fair,

1354
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,120
but like somebody make them down someone out there. Yeah.

1355
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,840
We talked about that Epcot special when we did the

1356
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,680
anniversary. Yeah. We've been,

1357
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,720
okay, next year, maybe the Epcot's the hour long special.

1358
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,600
Where he is like on death's door. Like,

1359
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,720
it's it, but, and it's, if you watch it, there's like,

1360
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,680
I swear he says something about weather controlled city. Like he says something

1361
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,880
where you're like, uh, wait a minute, what was that?

1362
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,480
It's as if he said like,

1363
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,160
and we have a death ray and the death ray will shoot at other cities.

1364
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,360
And you're like, wait, hold on. It was, what'd he say? Like,

1365
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,520
there's a few of the, a few of their little drops,

1366
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,160
despotic stuff. We have our own military for this city and we will attack other

1367
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,960
cities, American cities. If we have to, our own sun.

1368
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,880
The cold war is heating up, but if I have my druthers, you know.

1369
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,200
Some of the buildings can move. They have legs and they will,

1370
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,560
they can get up and walk to other cities and kick other cities, buildings.

1371
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:55,680
Some skyscrapers can cry. I'm not going to explain how,

1372
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,440
but they can feel feelings.

1373
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:02,000
May have already killed God in advance of this city. Your new God is commerce.

1374
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:07,200
God is buried under Epcot center. Come to Florida and visit God's grave.

1375
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,400
Jason is just chocking on his drink.

1376
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,480
Lost his tea. And we're not breaking.

1377
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,440
We're going to hear him suffer through this because of Scott's, Scott's tagline.

1378
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,880
All right. All right. Jason's going to recover on the air.

1379
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,920
He's going to fight through it.

1380
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,680
He's going to need a long time in the research for tonight to decompress for that.

1381
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,840
Oh, glad there was cinnamon in that tea. That was great.

1382
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,440
Oh, that's why. Yeah. You're getting spiked in the throat. That's a tough combo.

1383
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,280
Jason just swallowed a bunch of cinnamon. Didn't even get to drink it.

1384
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,200
Took an unwanted cinnamon challenge.

1385
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,160
Yeah. I did a cinnamon challenge every other episode.

1386
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:53,920
Um, yeah. So look, yeah. Bizarre super city with God's grave.

1387
01:04:54,320 --> 01:05:00,400
Um, yeah, there's, there's, there's an odd sound to it, but hey, at the same time,

1388
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,040
weather controlled with, hey, with everything that's happening now, what,

1389
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:07,120
and what do you call these crazy rains that we're getting, right? The scary term for the

1390
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:11,680
rains currently. I mean, other States are getting it worse, but like direct or the Arctic front.

1391
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,560
Yeah. What are you, I forget what tunnels or something I felt. What is it?

1392
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,560
Oh, I don't know. What is this weather term? But, um, I don't know, but look, hey,

1393
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:22,960
in general climate change, wouldn't we kill for weather controlled city right, right about now?

1394
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:28,320
Yeah. If you have the magic, whatever is magic weather changing ray was that he had. Yeah.

1395
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,320
It would be great. Really is carrying out the dream, but Dubai. That's true.

1396
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:37,440
That's where we all need to go is that's true. Live in weird Dubai malls and theme parks.

1397
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,040
Well, we can get the free tickets to the Warner Brothers world there.

1398
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,320
We can, we were offered it. We were not a free trip out there, but

1399
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:49,920
listeners put this on the list. Let's follow up on this. Why did we forget about the free tickets?

1400
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:55,360
All we have to do is go to Dubai. That's right. You and me with our toddlers and Jason will climb

1401
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:00,640
the building with his Twitter account, whatever news stories from Jackman he's supposed to.

1402
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,160
I want Jason to climb that building that Tom Cruise did in ghost protocol.

1403
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,320
I forget what the name of the building is, but if Jason could do that, reenact that scene,

1404
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:18,240
he can have a short bungee. Not like all the way down, but we'll give you like five stories.

1405
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,960
All right. Fine. It's so convenient here in Dubai. They take your passport right when you get off the

1406
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,400
plane. I must keep it warm for you. They must hold onto it. I'll be here at the airport when I return

1407
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:36,080
to re-achieve my freedom. Surely. Okay. Where the hell were we? I know I was like,

1408
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:42,320
all right, we're going to demonstrate this public transit system, but it's also going to be a ride.

1409
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:51,280
It's great. It's relaxing. It's one of these great Bob Gurr inventions. Of course, the system of it

1410
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,280
is cool, but I think the little touch is the coolest thing, at least about the Disneyland one.

1411
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,720
Tilted roof. It tilts when it comes back into the station to let people in and out so they don't

1412
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,760
bang their head on the top really hard like Weiger did on Mickey and Friends when we went for Dough

1413
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,320
Boys. Oh yeah. You guys were in for that. I heard about this. It's got a concussion getting off the

1414
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:17,120
tram. Poor Weiger. Apologies. Geez. Wouldn't have happened. Even clumsy Weiger would have been able

1415
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:28,640
to enter the people mover without issue. Right. So it's, you know, it looks great. These little

1416
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:33,120
innovations and you get to go through these, you know, you're seeing the line of adventure through

1417
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:41,200
inner space, which becomes Thar Tours later. And the big like midpoint thing to see on this route

1418
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:48,800
initially was Walt's vision of the super city, this gigantic model of Progress City, which is

1419
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:54,800
now, which ended up moving to Florida where it remains to this day, correct? Yes, it is there.

1420
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:59,360
That is a portion of the model. That's not the whole thing. It's not even the whole thing. Yeah.

1421
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:05,760
Oh my God. So did Disneyland have more of it or did it stay at the Imagineering or something? I think

1422
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:12,080
at least at the World's Fair when you would exit the Carousel of Progress, you would see this massive

1423
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:18,240
model. Wow. But I don't know where it's fully ever been exhibited after that. I think, well,

1424
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:23,040
at least Disneyland for a while. And it shows you this cool future city with the transit moving in

1425
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:28,480
and out. And it also shows you churches. It asserts that there are churches and specifically

1426
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,720
Catholic churches really near the city center. I was looking at a website showing all the details of it and like, oh,

1427
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:40,080
all right, the Catholic church is represented in Walt's Super Village City. Wow. And it was just,

1428
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,240
they're just Catholic churches. There's no other. There may have been, there may be other types,

1429
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,480
but I think the only specified one. Interesting. Again, I could be wrong. I don't know if it's,

1430
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:53,920
I don't know if they wrote out Catholic in little letters. I would believe it. Once you can hear

1431
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,480
voices saying, now we actually believe that it is the body of Christ and not, it's not a metaphor,

1432
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:03,440
not symbolic. Well, when we go through this Epcot video, there might be a quick thing where he goes

1433
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,200
and Catholicism, which is the only sect of Christianity that's correct. Like you're like,

1434
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,040
what are you saying? Like he's on to the next thing. And you're like, I don't even think he was

1435
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:16,480
Catholic. Yeah. What was he? He was not. That was my question. My next question. I was, I think it was

1436
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,000
kind of a, I don't want to say lazy Protestantism, but a lot of them are like I, they were that,

1437
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:28,800
yeah, I don't, I think they was like a generic God, generic Christian. I see.

1438
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:36,960
Well, I'm calling our shot figuring out what religion Walt was in 2023. What religion, what church did he go to?

1439
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:42,880
What were his praying habits? Yeah. Let's figure that out. Did his children remain in the faith?

1440
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:48,800
Right. Did, there's children's children are, do you know Walt's grandchildren? Are they going to

1441
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,600
church right now? If not, what can we do to get them back in there? Okay. He was a member.

1442
01:09:53,600 --> 01:10:00,400
The family was a member of a congregational church. Yeah. Okay. What does that mean? I don't know.

1443
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:05,680
Honestly, it asks more questions than it answers. Questions that need to be

1444
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:10,800
answered in another episode. It does sound like, cause we did Walt's polo injuries. So what is the

1445
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:18,320
Walt's religion? Walt's religious gods. Walt's God. Yeah. That's the name of the episode.

1446
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:23,120
Okay. Going in. What's God? He had a strict religious upbringing, but never attended church

1447
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:29,040
during his adult life, believing that the love of God was all one needed. All right. That's pretty

1448
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:36,320
convenient from the website, Mickey news. Sorry. Walt Disney believed that all you needed was God's

1449
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:44,000
love. Huh? The man who like, uh, invented all the ways that every corporation has revenue streams

1450
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,560
today. They devoted congregationalist Christian. Hmm. Interesting. Yeah. I don't know much about

1451
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:57,200
the congregationalist church. Well, we're putting the PTR microscope on this year. It does seem like

1452
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:03,360
a generic enough term that like Reverend Lovejoy was a congregationalist. Yeah. Well, that's another,

1453
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,320
what kind of Christians were the Simpsons? I say were because I don't think they're spending a lot

1454
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:12,160
of time at church these days. Yeah. I was going to, yeah. Do they go to church? Um, you know,

1455
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:15,760
they probably, you know, cause they probably need stories with Lovejoy, right? And it was in the

1456
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:22,480
movie. Right. Um, so somewhat I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. We just don't, they, they, they're not as many

1457
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:27,920
serious church scenes to steal a doughboy's observation. How much the early show is about

1458
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:36,000
them. Oh yeah. Going to an enjoying church. Um, so, uh, you see a model of a city that has plenty of

1459
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,080
churches in it. Um, but then that disappears, that moves over to Florida. So what do you do in the

1460
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:48,080
middle then? Because mostly, look, this ride isn't about, uh, the cheap thrills, right? It's about a

1461
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:54,880
breeze in your face and a leisurely little tour through, through mostly the outdoors. But when the

1462
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:59,360
carousel of progress building is built, now there's this big empty space that the track has to pass

1463
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:04,800
through. It used to be filled with the model, but, uh, what do we fill it with now? And this is where

1464
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:12,240
the middle beats of the original people mover start coming in. Uh, 1977, Jason, you were showing

1465
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:18,240
some of those posters and I'm going to show one, um, oh wait, well, before I say that, um,

1466
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,840
uh, very thoughtful present from my dad. When I graduated college, uh, and I'm moving into a

1467
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,800
house with my friends and he's like, you need real art. You shouldn't have crappy posters up on the

1468
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:34,560
wall. Like it's a dorm. So I'm going to get you some nice post or artwork, whatever you want it to be.

1469
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,680
And I will frame it very great, thoughtful present from my dad. Uh, and I said, oh, you know what it

1470
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:45,120
should be. Cause it combines silly with actually cool visuals, the Disneyland attraction posters,

1471
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,840
like you see under the, under the train and then that train tunnel, um, which then made me think,

1472
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:55,680
well, how do I narrow that down? What posters of all that great artwork, which ones do I want to

1473
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:02,400
see every day? Uh, and I chose haunted mansion, the iconic hitchhiking ghost poster. And I chose

1474
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:09,440
people mover ride the people mover through space mountain and the fantastic super speed tunnel.

1475
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:17,440
And I still have this up in my office. Um, in this is a very exciting poster that is very minimal,

1476
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:22,800
but also really conveys motion because there's our people mover car, but now it's like being

1477
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:29,920
sucked into a wormhole all the way in the, in the back of the frame. And there are race cars whizzing

1478
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:35,840
by and so many lines indicating speed. It's a dynamic poster. I still really love it. Um,

1479
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,960
I, and then I was curious, wait, well I have this poster, but then I don't know what the super speed

1480
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:47,280
tunnel was other than, you know, it's, it's a big empty room and they project stuff on the walls.

1481
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:53,120
And now it looks like there's race cars going by. And I think I just said it because I think so.

1482
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,080
And I looked up message boards where people were asking, did anyone ever bother to film this?

1483
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:04,320
And other people said, no, cause it wasn't good. It did not really work. It was kind of like the

1484
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,400
speeds just felt weird more than anything. The projections weren't good. And it did not live up

1485
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:14,160
to the promise of the very exciting poster. Uh, unfortunately, but I still like the idea of it.

1486
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:20,480
And that's like early simulator stuff. Right. Yes. And that, I mean, the early, like I still, when

1487
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:27,360
they doing like trying to find inner space videos, it's like so hard to figure out what's going on

1488
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:33,600
in there. Those are incredibly obtuse. Yeah. And understand because people didn't have phones to

1489
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,840
film everything very clearly. You had to rely on like old eight millimeter cameras or whatever.

1490
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,840
And that's still, I think thought of pretty fondly for people that went on it. Definitely. Um, but

1491
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:49,200
this, yeah, this, especially if no one had a good equipment and the thing looked like shit, yeah,

1492
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:54,160
forget it. And that's like, you know, what, what camera do you have in the seventies that can film

1493
01:14:54,160 --> 01:15:01,760
a movie off a wall? Right. That's, that does not work. Yeah. Um, but then so super speed tunnel

1494
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:10,000
doesn't make it very long. So, but then in 1982, they switched to something much more exciting.

1495
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,960
And that is then man, and they add a sign that now makes the ride, uh, perhaps technically casually

1496
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:23,360
called people mover through the world of Tron. This, because now this is the first Tron attraction

1497
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:29,360
was this brief moment on the people mover. Yes. And in the sound of it, I think it does like

1498
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:34,880
the, cause there's video of this and it lasted a long time. It was there till closing. I, cause I

1499
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,640
remember I definitely went on this. Oh yeah. That makes sense. Cause I think the video I watch was

1500
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:47,120
nine, it's like 1990. Okay. Yeah. And that's, yeah. So, so this was not, this was not an elaborate

1501
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:52,640
theme of the people mover, but no, they already had an empty room and projectors. It's something

1502
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:59,520
to interrupt the music. Yes. Yeah. Please for a lot. The very pleasant music that plays for

1503
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:05,600
a lot of the rest of the ride. Oh my God. Wait really quick. Cause I go for these. I like,

1504
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:13,200
I can't not, um, wait here. The, the YouTube user, if you want to look up, okay. The Disneyland

1505
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:19,520
Wedway people mover music collection as posted by Steve K where you will hear the most pleasant

1506
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:27,200
library of specifically early seventies, like music library tracks, easy listening, this stuff.

1507
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,400
Let me just recommend what I did. If you can imagine, which was crack open a nice bottle of wine,

1508
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:38,720
listen to the entire, all of these library tracks pay, but I'm going to call that shot for you,

1509
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:43,920
the listener. If you want to chill out and, you know, make like Jason build yourself a little

1510
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,000
for it, but don't, you don't have to do any research. Just put on this beautiful, this,

1511
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
this wonderful music and just, just quick hits of this. This is the, I think the first one

1512
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,840
by Tom Elliott called March.

1513
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,160
Shh.

1514
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:11,200
And then that right into your writing on the highway in the sky, Walt Disney's vision for a,

1515
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,800
oh, the best. This is like, this is a huge part of it to me is this.

1516
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,840
I agree. And there should be, there should still be hints of that places in the park.

1517
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,000
And I'm trying to think of there are, I don't, I feel like the only place that they're like

1518
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,840
main street will always have the old time music, but not that type of old time music.

1519
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:34,480
This kind of music is tough. We want match game era horns,

1520
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,960
Herb Albert like style. Yeah. Oh, Herb Albert's a perfect name. So yeah,

1521
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:45,360
I'm like, it's like, like we want those little hits. Yeah. It's not big blaring trumpets.

1522
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:50,560
It's Carpenter's who I don't know how much I've expressed my love of the Carpenters on this

1523
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,920
podcast. Love the Carpenters so much. They filmed a really pleasant music video in Disneyland in the

1524
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:01,360
seventies, which is a rare thing to do to film something that isn't a Disney ad there. And Richard

1525
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:06,880
Carpenter played in main street also, like in that Coke corner kind of area. So I think like this

1526
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:13,040
music is very Carpenters. They're synonymous with like the good sides of seventies Disney-esque

1527
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:18,720
Americana. Just this vibe is so great to me. Because the Carpenters came up something very

1528
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:24,720
much like up our alley, Jane and I got really into watching the Carpenters variety show,

1529
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:32,160
the TV show, which is alphabet themed, like A through Z. So they would have to come up with

1530
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:39,600
intros to segments with the, it is wild. What is an example of that? I don't, I, well,

1531
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:45,200
obviously they're songs. Like they would use, you know, song title, but then like other just like

1532
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:52,000
moments for like xylophone is just a light comedy pattern. It's very strange. It's like,

1533
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,960
what could you possibly do besides xylophone? You got no other options. You're doing a music special.

1534
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,000
That sounds good. Is that a shot? Are you calling that? I don't, I don't know. I,

1535
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,880
you know, got to twist my arm to do some Carpenters. Do you guys know the Carpenters

1536
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,960
space song? We must've talked about it. At least I don't know actually calling occupants of

1537
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,400
interplanetary craft. I don't. They made a song about aliens and how like aliens are

1538
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:22,560
beautiful and reaching out to us for peace and harmony. It's like truly like a dropping piece

1539
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,040
of music that you think maybe you're putting on as kitchen to laugh at it. And by the end, you are

1540
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:33,520
weeping like it's avatar way of water. Oh my God. Inter species harmony. Love the Carpenters. Glad

1541
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:39,040
I got a chance to say it. That's great. Scott, that, that YouTube channel you mentioned with the

1542
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:48,960
people mover audio also has tons of inner space stuff, like stems, like stems and music for that.

1543
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:54,720
Right. I think that and like the people mover, there's a bunch of other videos and it says

1544
01:19:54,720 --> 01:20:03,200
tomorrow land 20 55 stuff. So I don't know. I just, is there, can you think of a place that has any

1545
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:08,480
where with that seven, that seventies vibe that's left in any of the parks with that? Just music

1546
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:14,080
wise, any monorails play anything like that? I don't think so. I hope somebody correct me if I'm

1547
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:20,080
wrong, but it feels like that's a little piece of retro that should live somewhere. Some of the,

1548
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:25,600
the mute, the tomorrow land music loop that I love so much, uh, that you can hear in the people

1549
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,960
mover in Florida has elements of those songs, but a lot of it's more techno. We, it's more like

1550
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,760
eighties and beeps and boobs and I like all that stuff, but there's that breezy seventies horn

1551
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,760
that's missing. Yeah. Something I don't like about some of the more recent Florida music is it just

1552
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:49,760
feels current to me. So it doesn't have like the magic as much of this, like that just places it

1553
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:54,000
in an era in tomorrow. And tomorrow, and tomorrow, and our Epcot are really the only spots that it

1554
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,280
would still be appropriate, I guess. Probably. Yeah. So I guess it would, yeah, it would have

1555
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:05,760
to just be somewhere in there, but yeah, no, that's, that's vibe is missing from the park.

1556
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,240
Preserve the easy listening. We need it somewhere, at least just somewhere, some little

1557
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:16,800
Cartesian gardens type corner. If there's anywhere that still exists like that, uh, please love this

1558
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,120
music. Anyway, that was all a sidetrack from the Tron then another, uh, something I like equally

1559
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:27,520
as much as the carpenters. Uh, so this is, I mean, this aesthetically boy early, uh, people mover.

1560
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:32,080
I love, but I, I'm glad you brought up the music because what I'm going to play is the

1561
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:36,880
interruption of the music with a very jarring, quite different.

1562
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:51,760
Just a sightseeing, uh, too much of it, but yeah, who's complaining. Yeah.

1563
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,760
Prepare for the game grid of Tron.

1564
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:09,440
Then just weird whistly, nothing, um, very strange, very like extreme right turn in the vibe.

1565
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,400
And another thing about that is the master computer program is not what the thing in Tron

1566
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:22,880
is called. Yeah. I was going to say, what is the master control program? I know this only because

1567
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:28,800
I made a sketch about Tron, the 1982 Tron holiday special, which combines all these

1568
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:34,720
vibes that I like the great retailer and, and, uh, uh, Aaron, my wife is in this video and she

1569
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:38,320
was like, Oh, I remember that because I kept saying the wrong thing and you had to correct me.

1570
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:43,520
No, no, no. It is. I think she was saying master control. Wait, what else would, what would the P

1571
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,720
be? I don't remember. She got the other word wrong. Uh, master control panel maybe. And I said, no,

1572
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:55,120
no, no, the iconic character master control program, who's the kind of like squat tunnel

1573
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:01,680
of light with a face, right? Yes. The villain of Tron or like the zoo, the pre Zordon of power

1574
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:10,080
ranger, like so Zordon voices, very Zordon in a big tube. Yes. Same deal. Um, I want to say I

1575
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:16,960
consider myself in the like higher rankings of Tron fans. And yet I didn't know that what that

1576
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:22,000
character was called. And for a long time, even well past me considering myself a Tron fan,

1577
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,400
I didn't know if Tron was a character or a place or a thing. I truly did not know even saying

1578
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,360
through the world of Tron. I'm like, so Tron must be where you go in the movie. No, no. Tron is a

1579
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:38,080
guy played by Bruce box lightener. But again, I don't think that's what it's about with Tron.

1580
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:43,360
I think Tron is all vibe. Tron is aesthetic. Yeah. Yeah. Which is Ron is a way of life. It's a

1581
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:51,680
feeling. It's not a movie. It's like a lifestyle, a word. Yeah. It's a lifestyle. It's got motion.

1582
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:56,320
That's what Tron Tron's bigger than the two movies that are okay. That are just okay. I don't really

1583
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:02,160
care for the, I know Tron is not about the movies. Are you right? Right. Certainly what people are

1584
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:06,480
hoping, what Disney is hoping for the ride, like don't worry about the movies, ride the roller

1585
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,880
coaster. And they, it's true. Yeah, it's true. That's going to be the most popular Tron thing.

1586
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,560
Honestly, perfect. You do not even have to ask like, why would they make a ride out of these

1587
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:19,520
movies that are okay? No, you're, you are, you're overthinking. Yeah. Yeah. It's neon lights and

1588
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:25,840
stuff. It's great. I think the cartoon series has more passionate fans than the movies. Oh yeah.

1589
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:30,160
That's supposed to be cool. Right. It's got a really interesting look to it. And it came out

1590
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:35,040
around the time of Tron legacy. Yeah, I should check it out. Um, but anyway, uh, oh, and then he,

1591
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,760
then like, all you do is you go through a big tunnel that projects just footage from the movie

1592
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,600
Tron, which is great. It's like this, the whole, the trippy sequence when you enter the computer

1593
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,640
world and then the, uh, the light cycle, the original light cycles sequence, which is so great.

1594
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,120
And then like right at the end,

1595
01:24:53,200 --> 01:25:02,320
clang, clang, you have escaped Tron's game grid for now users, but take heed next time. You may

1596
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:09,360
not fare so well. Anyway, forget about all that. Forget that noise.

1597
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,720
Also, it's also funny because he doesn't say like a play. He doesn't call them like players. He

1598
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,560
calls them users, which is funny because I understand what he means, but it just sounds

1599
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,960
like he's accusing them of being like use, like you're using me or something. Like, oh yeah. Yeah.

1600
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,160
It's not, I don't know. It just, it strikes me as funny, but maybe that's just me. Very strange.

1601
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:32,560
It all, it all made me think like, first of all, you know what, you know why this is important.

1602
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:39,120
And I bet Tron like locked into me because of this and my love of this kind of aesthetic and neon. I

1603
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:44,640
mean, I know loving kind of like retro future eighties aesthetics comes from going to Tomorrowland

1604
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:52,640
as a kid, but like this must've been a big one where like that tunnel was kind of scary, right?

1605
01:25:53,200 --> 01:26:01,440
Three years old. That's not like going on, you know, Mr. Toad or small world, right? Like being

1606
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:08,240
in this big spacious gray tunnel with these kind of like imposing digital effects and a scary voice,

1607
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:14,720
it was like maybe my first entry into a scary Disney vibe. Oh yeah. The listeners know I've

1608
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:20,080
had trouble onboarding with the whole length of doing the podcast with my launches and my splash

1609
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:25,440
mountain struggles. But I think it's maybe cool. Like it is a, it is a Disney, it's a ride that is

1610
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:30,240
scary. The little kids could go on and get, get that little blast a Tron. Right. There's only a

1611
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:34,720
little small part of it. Yeah. Yeah. So that's a nice, yeah. You get, you see a light at the end

1612
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,920
of the tunnel. You're going to be out of there pretty quick. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah.

1613
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:43,040
If you could ease kids into the scare, cause most of the rides that are scared, like all the dark

1614
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:47,440
rides, which are scary for a little kid, a little scaredy kid. That's right. I don't think I said

1615
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:54,400
on the show, we did try. I forgot that Mr. Toad has, I just listed it as a pleasant attraction,

1616
01:26:54,400 --> 01:27:01,120
but I did take my two year old on it and forgot, Oh right. Train comes at you dark, hell loud. Oh,

1617
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:07,760
he was so upset. And it was even, it was a last minute flip. Do I do Alice or do I do Toad and

1618
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:13,280
boy did I fuck up. That was the wrong choice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you'd probably be scared

1619
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:19,760
of Alice too. Um, maybe, but it's, you know, but it's less scary. I think the turn I like,

1620
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:26,880
and I was on it. I was on a different vehicle than, uh, him and, and mom and, uh, and I was

1621
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:32,800
behind them and I was like, Oh, Oh wait, train. Oh, this is probably scaring the shit out of him.

1622
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:38,160
Well, I hope he is not red in the face and weeping when we get off this thing. Sure enough. Oh God,

1623
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:45,440
Oh God, Oh God, Oh God. No. Yeah. I was much older. I feel like I was five and I hated every dark ride

1624
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:50,080
except for Peter Pan. Cause I think it's just cause of the distance. It felt like either there

1625
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:56,080
was enough room space between me and the characters. Oh sure. Okay. Okay. Cause I love that. I opened

1626
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:00,000
my eyes on that and I want to go on again, but it's too long. So we didn't go at the time. You

1627
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,280
did not want intimacy. I did not intimacy fear. I feared it. A fear of intimacy. So now I've tried

1628
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:15,520
to embrace it in my old age. So that's, that's what I'm working on myself. The shot you've slowly

1629
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:21,200
called. That's right. Anyway, you know, like there's, there's not much else specific to say about,

1630
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,040
about the Disney and one, cause then you're just, you know, then you get this leisurely tour through

1631
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:29,760
the, like through the outdoor part, through the art toby part, which, which is so, so pleasant.

1632
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:36,800
What else is there to say about it? Well, they, I think we've said this before, but I,

1633
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,800
apparently the reason is so this eventually was replaced by a ride called the rocket rods. If you

1634
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:46,240
don't know, it was a fast version of the people mover. Cause it was on the same track. It broke

1635
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:54,560
down a lot. It was, this is one of the most, I guess one of the most prominent disasters, I think

1636
01:28:54,560 --> 01:29:00,240
as far as like a big hype new thing that pretty quickly went away. And if you haven't guessed yet,

1637
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:04,720
that's its own episode. Yeah. Yeah. That's not this episode. We will deal with that as, as a thing,

1638
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:09,600
but what I also, were you heading somewhere? Yeah, I was just going to say that if you're one,

1639
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:14,400
so yeah, we've made mention that these tracks are still, a lot of them are still up. So you go like,

1640
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:20,080
why is there track here? Nothing is running on it. Especially right down the middle of,

1641
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:25,520
as you're entering tomorrow land from the hub, from the castle area, you were like, it's, it's,

1642
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:31,200
it's covering you. Like it's, it's so present that first big people. Right. And so people,

1643
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,360
I think have often said, well, why don't you just put the old people mover back up? And I guess the

1644
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:41,200
track has decayed so much at this point that they would have to like completely redo all of it. And

1645
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:48,160
what's the stand? What's the OSHA? Thank you. The safety regulations now are such that you couldn't

1646
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:54,480
fit the cars in the tunnels because people could touch the walls too easily. Right. So now you can't

1647
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:59,600
do a new version of it because it would be against the rules. Like stuff that gets grandfathered in

1648
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:05,200
is okay, which is really funny. If they left it running all these years, it would have been fine.

1649
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:10,000
Right. Which doesn't make sense, but I guess that's the way it works. So we have, there's stuff at

1650
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Disneyland that I think, yes, is grandfathered in as far as like ride code or whatever falls

1651
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,040
under building code. But because of this dumb reset they did, because we talked about it a little

1652
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:27,680
bit. There was the, there was a rumor that this year, a big D 23 of course, and parks announcement

1653
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:32,400
would be the people movers coming back and even just something with tomorrow land. Obviously we,

1654
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:37,520
we need, we want and need something to happen there. And they're even teasing a daddy tomorrow

1655
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:43,120
is teasing us by making the speech where he keeps saying tomorrow. I know it's this awful

1656
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:47,840
like we're being strung along. I know. And then nothing is said. Of course there's no people

1657
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:54,000
move. I'm seeing bloggers so confident about why I saw a guy in a hard hat walking around over there.

1658
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,240
We must be getting a new people mover. Well, that was the before the pandemic that was like,

1659
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:03,600
you know what D 23 tomorrow. Here's what I think we saw Joe roadie up on the people over track.

1660
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:08,480
The multiple people telling us we saw Joe roadie around the people mover track for a couple of

1661
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:12,880
hours to be very, he probably was working on a tomorrow land redo that just didn't get green

1662
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:19,280
lit, but still it's just, it's a, how many Lucy and footballs do we need? And now I'll call my shot

1663
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:26,320
podcast, the ride episode, fixing tomorrow lands. Yeah, that's a big, that's coming. We will fix it

1664
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:32,960
in the hypothetical Disneyland, Disneyland. Yeah. Land is in, or I'm sorry, in Disney world. I,

1665
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:38,240
yeah, we're still in, we're still in pretty good shape, but we've, you know, obvious this comes up,

1666
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:43,360
there is some tomorrow land complaints, uh, maybe every other episode. I don't know. I don't know

1667
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:47,600
how often, but we've never completely focused on it. And there's a lot of tomorrow land things

1668
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:54,240
that we have missed. And in, in terms of a broader call of shots, I think 2023 is the year to deal

1669
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:59,920
with tomorrow land. Exactly what you said, Mike, um, we, over the course of that also, how did we

1670
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:05,040
get here? What is the stuff that happened? Sure. Yeah. Uh, and you know, where are the tomorrow

1671
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:09,120
lands that did it right? And what can we learn from those lessons? What were the tomorrow lands

1672
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:16,000
that never were? Um, and certainly this bizarre thing, the rocket rods that ripped the guts of

1673
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,920
this pleasant ride out of Disneyland. The only thing I want to say about the rocket rods is that

1674
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:27,600
the, the, the sound of the people move for a very pleasant aspect and then still in the Disney world

1675
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:34,960
one. Um, it's just this like, I mean, it's silent mostly, but also if you're on it, there's just

1676
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:40,000
this kind of like nice clunk, clunk, clunk. You get those as you're like going past the little,

1677
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,640
you know, the what's giving you speed. Um, and that's so much part of the pleasantness. It's

1678
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:50,560
little clunk clunks and it's this music that is so great. The rocket rods was like a ride based on

1679
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:58,080
leaf blowers, leaf blowers. The ride could not have been more just like the awful, like it was

1680
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:05,520
like a fog horn play through, uh, amps that were turned up to the point of distortion, horrible

1681
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:10,480
sounding ride that then would like speed up and then have to stop and just crawl past the turn

1682
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,920
because they couldn't afford to make the turns. We will get into all this. We'll deal with it

1683
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:20,320
because I didn't do the rocket rods and I have rocket rods thoughts. Oh, you did. I did. Yeah.

1684
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:27,520
Um, it's, uh, it, it was interesting. I were like, it had a real, it had a vibe to it and, and, uh,

1685
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:31,760
I don't know. My thoughts might surprise you on it when we get to it, but let me, you know, as we're

1686
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:38,240
winding this one down, pause on that, we'll explain, um, this is a quote from theme park tourist. They

1687
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:43,520
did a good article about people, the people mover, uh, in some ways the people mover proves that not

1688
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:48,800
every starring attraction has to be a thrilling e-ticket, perhaps the most appropriate lesson to

1689
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:53,440
learn from the case of the people mover is one of the oldest adages in the book. If it ain't broke,

1690
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:59,520
don't fix it. Absolutely. Look at the mistake they made. Basically, here's what I'm getting at.

1691
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:04,240
In the nineties, there was a juncture point for all the tomorrow lands. And there's this question

1692
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:09,760
of like, well, but tomorrow is here. How do we keep tomorrow and fresh forever? And Disney world

1693
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:16,320
went one path and Disneyland went another, the Disney world path, the people mover is still

1694
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:22,400
there. Everyone is smiling as they get off it. Uh, new elements have been added to it that are a

1695
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:29,520
lot of fun. The people mover is like a key part of the story of nineties tomorrow. And in Disneyland,

1696
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:36,560
they added leaf blowers, the ride it broke after a year. And now we have rusting tracks and have for,

1697
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:42,160
but, oh, that's, this is the, why it's the year of tomorrow. And this year, 25 years since that

1698
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:49,360
redo, since tomorrow land 98, uh, it has been this bizarre way for 25 years. I don't want to

1699
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:54,320
go another 25. Something has to be done. The PTR boys are going to put their heads together and fix

1700
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:59,440
it. If they, yes, if we have to bring a hammer and nails to tomorrow and to start working ourselves,

1701
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:05,440
we will ingots ourselves. We will fully map out what the ride is. And the three of us will build

1702
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:11,840
it by hand with drag Bobger down there with us. He'll, he'll shout directions at us and we'll do

1703
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:18,000
it. He, uh, tomorrow land 94 and tomorrow land 98. It is literally the two face coin. One is the

1704
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,120
nice ed and the one is carved out, scratched out. And they, I bet they thought they were doing it

1705
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:28,640
because 90 really Florida got lucky because the imagineers were like, well, let's do something fun

1706
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:34,240
for, for here and for Disneyland. Yeah. So they kind of got lucky. I think, I think, you know,

1707
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:40,160
I wasn't ultimate and we'll probably, we should try to learn what should have been with that 98

1708
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:44,480
redo. Uh, and there were a number of plans for that, but I think even the one we got, I think,

1709
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:51,200
I think Tony had a good idea for it and it just stayed budget cuts and corporate greed, you see.

1710
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:54,880
And I'll call another shot. We're going to get Michael Eisner this year and he'll tell us

1711
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:00,560
what he was thinking. Oh, this is the perfect time to get him. When we're talking about the,

1712
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:07,360
the folly that's often prescribed to Michael Eisner and Paul Pressler looking for getting him on the

1713
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:12,560
show. Spensive rides. And that was a big impetus for closing. We would love to talk about this

1714
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:17,760
with us. The episode will mostly be about bazooka Joe, which he owns, but it will have a Tomorrowland

1715
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,960
section. Okay, great. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to learn. We're going to find out what we're going

1716
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:25,120
to hear it straight from the horse's mouth. Wait, so not the horse's mouth from the very handsome

1717
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:32,720
man's mouth for the mouth that is aging so well, please come on the show. We need you. Uh, anyway,

1718
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:38,480
well, is this now you're probably looking at the time code and thinking, what the hell, this isn't

1719
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:46,240
the podcast, the ride that I know it's over. No, no, no. You see, we are, we're making a bank down

1720
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:50,880
all other tunnel that you didn't know about. We had a feeling this was not going to be, we had,

1721
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:56,560
there's going to be a lot of people mover to go. So at this point there is a split much as there

1722
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:03,200
was with the different types of tomorrow lands. We now split off here and over on the second gate,

1723
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:10,560
we are going to deep dive into the ins and outs of, uh, the, the Florida version, which Jason is

1724
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:16,320
chomping at the bit. I, it's one of my favorites, the tomorrowland transit authority. I was fully

1725
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:22,000
prepared coming in today of like, all right, Scott knows a lot more about California. I'm sure he's

1726
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,640
written it a bunch. I don't know anything about it. I just know the history, but I know the Florida

1727
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:31,520
one in and out. And then I learned there are a lot more things I didn't know about Florida. Boy,

1728
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,520
a boy there in the texts about it, there was the, there was the brief mention of like, well,

1729
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:39,120
maybe we do this one and then we do a shorter one. And then Jason like, well, no, that one's going

1730
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:43,280
to be longer. It's going to be much, if you guys, you guys need to be okay with sitting around for

1731
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:47,360
a while, because this is going to take a while. Do we even want to do like a lighter, sillier

1732
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:51,840
episode? Because this is going to be an intense one to do. This is what Jason is promising

1733
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:56,800
on the second day. I thought it was very constructive conversation. I thought it was

1734
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:01,200
very collaborative conversation. I mean, Mike at the time was holding like a fire extinguisher

1735
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:05,360
in one hand and a baby in another. So he was kind of out for it. But, um,

1736
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:10,960
I was, yeah, it was a busy morning for me. I remember checking in on the thing and I had

1737
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,560
the baby in the hands and I'm like, what is going on here? And there's like, I was like, all right,

1738
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:20,560
we'll respond to that. But I have a lot of texts. The baby has been very upset lately. The baby has,

1739
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,440
and sorry, we also did somebody burn a roast in the house. Did I miss something?

1740
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:31,120
Did you have to, was somebody's boss coming over for dinner and you had to put it out with a fire

1741
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:38,480
extinguisher quickly? Well, not figuratively, not literally. Um, so yeah, anyway, we, we, we got there.

1742
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:43,840
Okay. Yeah, yes. We know the plan. So we veer off at this point, but a lot of promises made,

1743
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,080
we're going to solve tomorrow. And part of that is going to be discussing how did people move her

1744
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:52,880
Florida do it better, how they do it right. And why is it a stalwart that remains there to this

1745
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:57,760
day? So look for the episode tomorrow, land transit authority, a different thing. And by the way,

1746
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:05,200
let me, in this discussion, this was my thought. I did text tomorrow land transit authority be

1747
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:09,200
its own thing. That's what I found odd is that I said that and the answer was not yes. The answer

1748
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:13,920
was many more questions and concerns. Well, I think that answers your question

1749
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:22,720
because I remember I was, I remember going insane, trying to cram in a monorail like Florida and

1750
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:28,160
monorail. Yeah. This is a specter that comes every once in a while. So one of you guys says,

1751
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:31,440
well, remember I was stressed out. We were trying to do all the monorails and what I was in.

1752
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:38,320
So I know I see it comes up in therapy every four months. You think I don't deal with this.

1753
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:43,600
What we did to those poor monorails flashback. Well, stuff often comes back around. You never

1754
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:47,600
know when things are going to bubble back up and it's best to address them and not let them lie.

1755
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:54,000
Absolutely. Well, and it's, and clearly it is best to, uh, split topics into as many subtopics

1756
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:00,000
as possible. The show is all about, but it is really what we have learned the show is about.

1757
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,880
And with that, you survived the first main feed podcast, the ride of 2023, a lot of promises made,
