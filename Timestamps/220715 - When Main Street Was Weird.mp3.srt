Forever.

00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,840
Warning, the following podcast may contain devil dung,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,380
buttermilk farts, blushing hubbies,

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,180
and bras, bras, bras.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,780
We stroll to the turn of the century by way of 1955

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,060
as we talk weird old bullshit that used to be on Main Street

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,660
on Podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,360
["Wild Wings of the Sun"]

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,020
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks,

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,340
but also shockingly often weird old meats.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,740
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan, hello.

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,940
Meats, M-E-A-T-S?

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,500
Yeah, not meetups, no.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,020
I wouldn't say that today is largely about weird old meats,

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,740
but we are talking about weird old stuff on Main Street,

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,940
and that includes restaurants, and restaurants in the 50s

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,460
at Disneyland had to include weird old meats.

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,280
Oh yeah.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,020
It just didn't, doesn't count as a restaurant

21
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,700
unless there's something you would never

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,300
put in your mouth today.

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,260
Yeah, absolutely.

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,180
And joining us, hmm, hmm, the video watchers.

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,660
This is a video one, by the way,

26
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,820
and you can find that on the Forever Dog YouTube,

27
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,160
but the video watchers can already see an empty chair.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,060
The listeners, you'll figure this out with us.

29
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,260
Mike Carlson, hello?

30
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,700
I did feel about like 150 pounds lighter or so.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,100
Mm-hmm, his private is more than that.

32
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,180
I don't know, I have to give him,

33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,240
but it's by sheer height, by sheer height.

34
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,120
Yeah, yeah, by sheer amount of him.

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,600
I didn't want to go too much more than that and be like,

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,440
you know.

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,600
Well, he's not here, so you don't want to start saying,

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,600
yeah, that 230 pounds, I don't believe so.

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,720
No, Mike, this is, so he's late.

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,200
This does not happen usually,

41
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,840
and I think normally we might just wait on it,

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,880
but we're here at the glamorous Forever Dog Studios.

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,700
We want to get moving, use the slot that we have,

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,760
he texts us that he's late and just start without him,

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,180
so this is all being done with his permission.

46
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,760
You know, this feels, this is interesting first of all.

47
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,200
I think this has, and we've done one just you and I,

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,200
but not one where we will start just you and I,

49
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,320
and then there will be this burst of absolute panic,

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,440
just sheer.

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,280
I love it.

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,940
The most, and we all get it together.

53
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,080
The listeners get it, the watchers get it

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,160
on the Forever Dog YouTube channel.

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,040
The bundle of stress that we're,

56
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,720
like Santa Claus is coming.

57
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,560
I love it.

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,160
Stress to Claus, stress to Claus.

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,580
I absolutely love a little bit of chaos,

60
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,240
a little bit of uncertainty,

61
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,360
and maybe it's just the hunger,

62
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,840
maybe it's just the hunger of not having done improv

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
in three years.

64
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,640
It's just like a little bit of the unknown.

65
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,200
Yeah, well, sure, sure, you know,

66
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,560
we've done our little, we've done our live shows,

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,680
but we aren't like, you know, we haven't done a ton.

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
You have this weekly slot

69
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,440
that you have not been back to,

70
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,400
but the people who were up live all the time,

71
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,800
the Chris Rocks and the Dave Chappelle's of the world,

72
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,160
they've had the wild cards of people trying to kill them.

73
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,720
You know, you haven't had that level

74
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,080
of something unaccountable from the audience.

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,640
No, I have not.

76
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,920
I mean, I guess my equivalent would be like

77
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,360
a hungry coyote trying to steal like the ham sandwich

78
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,760
I packed in a Ziploc bag in my bag.

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,400
Like, hey, get out of here, pal.

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,880
Does that, has that happened?

81
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,720
No, it hasn't.

82
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
No, I'm saying that would be my equivalent.

83
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,000
No, I'm not saying anything too incendiary

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,960
that someone would be coming after me.

85
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just general interest

86
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,400
in things that people might have.

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,240
Yes.

88
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
Your weird meats.

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,920
Yeah, my weird meats.

90
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,680
A man-o-mole might want your weird meats.

91
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,240
But so, we'll just see.

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,960
We'll see when the bomb goes off.

93
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know if it will be in 10 minutes.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,720
I don't know if it'll be later than that,

95
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,000
because does he remember that today

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
he is at the Glamorous Foreverdawg Studios?

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, yeah, I did something similar a few weeks ago

98
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,080
where I was a half hour off.

99
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,320
And so, I was driving over when he texted me

100
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,960
and was like, where are you?

101
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
And I'm like, in the car, what do you mean?

102
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,000
And I was like, oh no, it's one, not 130, isn't it?

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And so, I started using an old shared,

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,040
I have a podcast to write, like Google Calendar,

105
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
that I think I mostly used it.

106
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,720
You should get the listeners on that too,

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
so you know what's coming up.

108
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,400
Yeah, I'll put it on.

109
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,920
You know where we are, and that we are producing

110
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,280
the episodes, there's more going on with Club 3,

111
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
so if you wanna keep track of our iCal,

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
make sure we're hitting these dates.

113
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,200
So, I'll remind him that that is,

114
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,760
he can punch that into his calendar app.

115
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,120
The calendar is, yes, I use the calendar, yeah.

116
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,560
I'm on the calendar, you send me those invites.

117
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,880
And well, the issue that you have with Mike though,

118
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,360
is that you get him on those alerts,

119
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,840
and then you get lost in an avalanche of 100 alerts

120
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,360
of like, there's a new kind of Batman sticker releasing.

121
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,080
There's new, you can get a deal of two fries for one

122
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,120
at a restaurant that he doesn't like.

123
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,760
Right, that's right, I forgot about all his notifications,

124
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,360
because I said I turned all of mine off except reminders,

125
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
and text messages, and phone calls.

126
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,200
So, if I get a weird notification, it's like,

127
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,960
oh, fuck, I downloaded a new app, gotta turn that off,

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,760
fuck that up, you know?

129
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,600
But he's like-

130
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,240
Mike just, the more that he can,

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,520
he's like, through the looking glass,

132
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,960
every day is like the end of 2001.

133
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, he's still somehow getting Circuit City notifications.

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's a, yeah, zombie accounts, closed stores that are,

135
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,280
yeah, Fry's Electronics, he's getting alerts about the deals.

136
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
He's getting the HBO Go, like,

137
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,600
this app is no longer supported,

138
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,720
please download HBO Max to continue watching HBO programming.

139
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,440
Well, it might come back, I mean,

140
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,200
the effort it would take to shut off the alert,

141
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,680
like in that time, you might as well just leave it on.

142
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,520
Yeah, yeah.

143
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,040
Mm-hmm.

144
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,120
Well, we'll see when it happens.

145
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,920
We'll, and boy, this is a good one for video,

146
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,040
because the empty chair,

147
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm just looking up at our monitor.

148
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,400
The empty chair is a very funny visual.

149
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,520
I'd also so think it's very funny if he comes in

150
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,680
totally prepared for a different episode.

151
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,920
That's possible too, yeah.

152
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,280
Yeah, if he's like, oh, god,

153
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,920
so what does everyone think of the King Arthur carousel?

154
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,040
That's fine, we can pivot, we can half and half it,

155
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,040
you know, we'll just, we'll leave an index for the listener.

156
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Or, okay, so if you want King Arthur's carousel,

157
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,440
remember half of it is in the weird old Main Street episode.

158
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,720
Oh, yeah, that was a thing for a little while.

159
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,240
I don't think it lasts a smart podcast with chapters,

160
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,240
and I think the image would change as you went through.

161
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,240
I don't think this caught on.

162
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,840
Mm-hmm, it sounds exceedingly complicated.

163
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,680
Absolutely.

164
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,480
More effort than we wanna put in,

165
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,480
but we do like complication, so if we can create a scenario

166
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,200
where there's gonna be a lot of different arrows

167
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,720
drawn to different podcasts, I mean, we've done that.

168
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,720
We have a podcast series that picked up two years later

169
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,680
with one with a secret title.

170
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
I feel like a lot of people still haven't figured out

171
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
the secret title.

172
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,840
If you go to our Patreon and listen to the episode

173
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,680
Universal Cruise Line, you'll see that.

174
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,960
The cruise line.

175
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,800
Yes.

176
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
A little Easter egg happening in there.

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, yeah, which was, I mean, that was still fall 2020.

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,760
We were all insane, and so I think we were,

179
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,960
oh, a little bit, we love doing little surprises.

180
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,200
And listeners seem to like it.

181
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,920
I don't think a lot of other shows do surprises.

182
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,800
That's well because they don't care.

183
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,120
They don't give a shit about you.

184
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,960
Yeah.

185
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,600
But we do, the two of us do.

186
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,440
The two of us do.

187
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,480
The two of us who cared enough to be here on time

188
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,040
for you and pointing in this video iteration,

189
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,440
again, at the Forever Dog YouTube channel,

190
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,400
because people seem to get confused where that is.

191
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,480
All right, so yeah, there's confusion with that too.

192
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,280
What goes where, what episodes are where.

193
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,480
But let's kick it off proper, and we'll allow Mike

194
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,320
to give any introductory thoughts.

195
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,600
Yeah, we'll give him the log line and yeah.

196
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,120
Remind him what it is.

197
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,000
But today's episode, I mean, look,

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,960
I don't think we've landed on the name exactly,

199
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,240
but in my head, at least what it is thematically

200
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,640
is weird old Main Street bullshit.

201
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
That's kind of what we're addressing today,

202
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,760
which is to say attractions, and I say that

203
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,120
with like the floppiest, limpest quotation marks

204
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,520
I could possibly do.

205
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,480
Things that visitors could experience

206
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,480
in the first five years or so in Disneyland's

207
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,560
beginning area of Main Street USA.

208
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Yes, yeah, a lot more exhibits, a lot more sponsored tie-ins,

209
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,160
and not just like this restaurant is sponsored

210
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,800
by Kraft Foods.

211
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,360
Sure. Like an exhibitor sponsoring,

212
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,640
and maybe showing you the history of something,

213
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,240
showing you their products over the years,

214
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,560
and solely to cover some of the costs,

215
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,200
because that was what an interesting fact I found out

216
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,440
these leases, it was like a five-year lease,

217
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,320
and Walt won it the first year and the last year upfront,

218
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
so he could have a little operating money.

219
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,360
So the other ones you can pay like regular retailer rent.

220
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,760
Oh, interesting.

221
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,840
Well, and it was like early Disneyland

222
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,120
was such a weird risk and calamity

223
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
that that's sort of a big ask.

224
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,160
If Walt is saying, hey, I need you through 1960,

225
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,560
and give me some of that cash, they might be thinking,

226
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,360
what if there is no Disneyland in 1960?

227
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,200
I think that was a very real possibility.

228
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Extremely, especially given some of the things

229
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,680
that we will be talking about, because if this is what,

230
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,760
like I think we've had some of these stray,

231
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,920
like oh, I heard they had this in the early days,

232
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,840
and this and that, and when you look into it,

233
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,160
you really start to go, how did Disneyland make it?

234
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,080
Disneyland was sort of like, this is what they had,

235
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,240
all the hype, they hype it on television for a year,

236
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,560
and then it has, well, we'll get into it,

237
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,560
but it's, a lot of it is extremely mundane, I would say.

238
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,040
Yeah, and some of it makes sense.

239
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,640
I'll throw out a kind of a generic one,

240
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,480
the book and candle shop.

241
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,680
Okay, sure, like candles, kind of a go-to

242
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,760
when you travel to tourist destinations.

243
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,440
That's like, oh, it's a nice thing,

244
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
it'll remind me of the trip,

245
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,760
I can bring it home for myself,

246
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,320
I can bring it home for a gift.

247
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,640
Makes sense, especially the idea of Main Street being,

248
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,480
I was telling you before we started recording,

249
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,720
there's so many articles just saying,

250
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,880
it's based on Marceline, Missouri,

251
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,240
and kind of, the answer is kind of.

252
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,160
It's more based on, like John Hench

253
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,480
and a lot of other Imagineers talked about,

254
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,280
it's based on the idea of a perfect Main Street,

255
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,520
in the past, there's a little bit of nostalgia here,

256
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,680
and memory is kind of a difficult thing.

257
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,040
Because you're saying that,

258
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,840
if it were more literally based on where Walt Disney grew up,

259
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,640
you said it's not a particularly glamorous place.

260
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,920
Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of places back then,

261
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,120
the Main Streets, while they were,

262
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,280
like everything you needed in town,

263
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,440
so everyone could walk there,

264
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
or take a horse and buggy, or early cars,

265
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
it was filled with mud,

266
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,600
and everything was painted like one or two colors,

267
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,960
and there were newly installed power lines everywhere,

268
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,240
like it's kind of gross,

269
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,520
it doesn't look like the World's Fair, you know?

270
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,360
You had to go elsewhere in Disneyland

271
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,120
if you wanted a bunch of mud.

272
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,640
There definitely was mud.

273
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,880
There was mud, they did get that,

274
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,440
but the idealized perfect Main Street,

275
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,360
they were trying to keep spick and span.

276
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,680
Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

277
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,920
We're doing this, by the way,

278
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,440
I think this episode will be landing

279
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,280
kind of right around the anniversary,

280
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,840
that mid-July point, which is Disneyland's birthday,

281
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,440
I think the 67th anniversary, I believe,

282
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,640
if my math is not. I think that's right, yeah.

283
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,400
Happy 67th.

284
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,040
You doing anything for the 67th?

285
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,920
I don't know.

286
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,320
I think I blacked out for a little while.

287
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,360
We're celebrating by not going,

288
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,960
even though we gave them a bunch of money.

289
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, blacked out on the past,

290
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,520
not blacked out on Walt Scots Mist or whatever.

291
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,640
I don't know, that's an idea, though.

292
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,880
We'll see how I feel when July 17th rolls around.

293
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,280
Oh, that's something to do on July 15th.

294
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,360
That's an episode.

295
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,080
Eat, drink, and smoke like Walt for a day.

296
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,160
Yeah, yes.

297
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,280
Well, you know what I discovered over the course

298
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,200
of this bit of research is there is a book

299
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,160
called Eat Like Walt.

300
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,320
There's a handy guide to how to do exactly this

301
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,160
that we've been talking about.

302
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,760
I have seen that book.

303
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,360
Is it in an official Disney book?

304
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,200
I don't believe so.

305
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,560
Oh, okay.

306
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,040
Because every now and then there's some very specific books

307
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,000
and it's like, oh wow, Hyperion Publishing.

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,960
You know, like.

309
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,920
Yeah, I'm not sure.

310
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,080
Here's what I can say is that I went to the website,

311
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,440
eatlikewalt.com, and the mouse ears that I saw on it

312
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,960
seemed not standard issue.

313
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,720
Like the, you know, it's a circle and the two circles,

314
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,520
but they seemed like maybe calculatedly

315
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,880
like legally in the clear.

316
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,760
We make them a little smaller, a little asymmetrical,

317
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,200
then maybe Disney can't come after you.

318
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,360
But anyway, that's what I think like, you know,

319
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,920
it's opening day week.

320
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,800
We did this episode two years ago that I enjoyed so much

321
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,880
about Disneyland's opening day,

322
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,880
which seemed like such bedlam and such just odd wild west

323
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,760
where obviously there was the wet cement

324
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,040
and there wasn't working water and there were monkeys

325
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,360
with organ grinders and then the host of the broadcast

326
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,960
cheating on his wife live on the air

327
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,120
while hopped up on meth essentially.

328
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
I've just been so, that just made me go like,

329
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
wow, Disney really was, even the clips that they choose

330
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,960
to show you of that opening day special

331
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,120
can still kind of give you the man.

332
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,440
It's Art Linkletter and it's Ronald Reagan

333
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,280
and then like that's Americana right there.

334
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,480
But I think if you get past kind of the wall

335
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,840
that they've set up and see like what that park really was

336
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,760
for the first year or so, it was weird and sloppy

337
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,600
and it is kind of amazing it made it

338
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,480
and it's such a like tent pole of culture now.

339
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,120
Yeah, you know, when I, we first,

340
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,160
I started reading stuff about this and everything

341
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,640
and I was like, oh, am I just, you know,

342
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,400
looking at it through like 2020 eyes?

343
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Like is it, was it stuff people actually liked at the time?

344
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,400
And to an extent maybe, but then also you see the like,

345
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,080
stores that aren't stores, you see that like,

346
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,200
I just need a little operating money.

347
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,520
Like I'm just trying to get anyone who will take it,

348
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,960
you know, in here and then you start to dig down

349
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,240
the specifics of like, no, that can't be,

350
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,840
I can't be right, no, that, oh my God, it is right.

351
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,760
Yeah, yeah, I mean, some of them are just boring.

352
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,160
Like, honestly, and I don't mean to like say

353
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,200
that this won't be a good fun episode,

354
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,920
but truly like the things that I don't have

355
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,360
a bunch of stuff prepared about,

356
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,640
there were things that were so boring

357
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,680
that I did take like a hard nap yesterday

358
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,240
because I was looking at a big article

359
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,000
about the Disneyland baby shoes store.

360
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,680
Like, there's gotta be something interesting

361
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,160
in here somewhere and then, oh my God,

362
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,000
I went out just like a brick.

363
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,240
Oh, is that grandma's baby shop?

364
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,840
You know, confusingly not.

365
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
It's not grandma's baby shop.

366
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,520
I did come across grandma's baby shop,

367
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,320
but separately there was something called

368
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,080
blue bird baby shoes.

369
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,080
So grandma's baby shop is not blue bird baby shoes.

370
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,240
Because I didn't see much on it,

371
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,320
but as soon as I saw, in reference to another place

372
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,560
we'll talk about said, it's right past grandma's baby shop.

373
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,400
And I was like, grandma's baby shop, let's fucking go.

374
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,640
Yeah, I was upset there wasn't more information

375
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,040
about grandma's baby shop.

376
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,160
Yes, I, you know, I think Yesterland,

377
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,200
one of them, Yesterland, a very good website

378
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,000
about like stuff at the Disney parks

379
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
that's not there anymore, pretty thorough,

380
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,040
quoted someone, another website or another article

381
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,180
was like, there is not a lot of documentation

382
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,080
on the book and candle shop.

383
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,000
And it is so weird to see these places

384
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,200
that are pretty thorough say that.

385
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,120
But then when they say right after grandma's baby shop,

386
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,960
it's like, is that the funniest phrase on Yesterland?

387
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,280
Right after grandma's baby shop.

388
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,160
It's only for like, yes, I want some things for my baby.

389
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,560
No, get out the door.

390
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,100
This is for grandma's to buy for babies.

391
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,480
Yes, it would be, all right, if you're a grandma

392
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,920
and then you also have your own new baby, that's allowed,

393
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,400
but no mom's buying things for babies.

394
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,620
No, no.

395
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,000
Grandma's only.

396
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,280
So, all right, to start getting into some of these things,

397
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,660
and by the way, like just the way this has played out,

398
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,040
is this the first episode in months

399
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,200
where the phrase bad boys of Boston has not been said?

400
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,040
So far it hasn't.

401
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,640
We've made it like 15, 20 minutes,

402
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,040
well I did it, I did it by.

403
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,960
You did it, let's not tell him we mentioned that.

404
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,800
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

405
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,640
And let's see if it comes up organically.

406
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Let's see if he naturally, if he comes in so guns blazing

407
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,080
and knowing what has been lacking in his absence,

408
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,820
he's just gonna come in and start shouting,

409
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,040
Green Day, Green Day, Green Day.

410
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,040
He's gotta make up for it within a 30 second span.

411
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,880
Yeah, and also the idea, there's not a,

412
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,440
I'm not gonna dox the man,

413
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,640
but there's not a straight shot from his place

414
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,960
to where we are on a freeway.

415
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,280
So he's on surface streets.

416
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,120
And this, for whatever reason, this type of year,

417
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,560
the San Fernando Valley has decided,

418
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,400
time to get some construction projects done.

419
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,520
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

420
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,960
And I'm checking that still now,

421
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,340
this is a very late mic, this is an extremely late mic.

422
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,340
But it doesn't matter.

423
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,380
Let's start talking about these old timey stores.

424
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,920
There's one I'm gonna save for him

425
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,200
because he wanted to talk about it.

426
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,040
I'm gonna wait.

427
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh, I don't know what that one is.

428
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,580
I'll just sit here, I just won't do it for the time being.

429
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,640
But what do we do in the meantime?

430
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,160
Let's, okay, so one thing, all right,

431
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,220
so here's a general thing to say about Main Street.

432
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,800
You go there now and it almost feels like

433
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,960
just one big run of Disney Store, right?

434
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,080
Like there's separate store fronts,

435
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,920
but you kinda just walk through all of them

436
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,800
and there's subtle, like all right,

437
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,280
this one has more shirts and this one has more toys.

438
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,680
And then there's ice cream and candy and whatever.

439
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,760
But it definitely feels like,

440
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,240
it does not feel like 15 distinct businesses or anything.

441
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,640
No, with some, with a rare exception of like,

442
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,240
okay, that's the coffee, the current coffee shop

443
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,720
and it's a Starbucks now.

444
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,440
There's a jewelry and watch store.

445
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,400
That does connect to the other stores,

446
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,840
but it's kind of on its own.

447
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,640
Yeah, yeah.

448
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,400
But besides that, yeah, it's just sort of like,

449
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,000
it's all places where you buy stuff

450
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,200
that is cute and Disney-ish, essentially.

451
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,760
Not so much the case when it started,

452
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,600
because they knew they wanted this Main Street area

453
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
and they knew they wanted,

454
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,320
or we wanted to feel like an old timey town,

455
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,880
but then what is in these places?

456
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,140
I feel like they were starting to build the stores

457
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,180
and didn't know what was going to be in them.

458
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,780
And then once built, what you ended up with

459
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,180
was a bunch of, was literally a bunch of different businesses

460
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,460
that were all often competing with each other

461
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,940
for business of the, like restaurants specifically.

462
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,700
This was not a Main Street thing,

463
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,140
but there was a name that struck me a couple years ago

464
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,460
whenever it came up, that there used to be a restaurant

465
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,580
in Frontierland called Don DeFour's Silver Banjo Barbecue.

466
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,700
And that you had to learn who's Don DeFour,

467
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,220
just a guy could have, and not a character.

468
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,380
This isn't like, you know,

469
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,900
like Sleepy's Pillow Hut or whatever.

470
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,740
Yeah.

471
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,900
You're a real life man, Don DeFour.

472
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,800
And like, because those individual businesses

473
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,140
made money separate from Disney,

474
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,120
they did, they had to compete against each other.

475
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,100
So like, he was worried he was gonna lose people

476
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,460
to the chicken plantation

477
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,580
or whatever other old timey place there was.

478
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,900
So he had to like start putting spotlights

479
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,380
on the restaurant.

480
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,260
Like the park had to let him point a bunch of spotlights

481
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,060
at his own place, just to get people to come to his,

482
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,480
because it was kind of like tucked away and easy to miss.

483
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,540
So this is an early thing about Disney

484
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,380
that I think is interesting,

485
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,900
that all the stores were fighting each other.

486
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Yeah, I think another distinct, and I hear keys,

487
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,420
could this be, nope.

488
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
Nope, false alarm.

489
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,260
Get in here.

490
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,080
Oh, here he is.

491
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,700
Go, and there you have it.

492
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,580
Well, the walk of shame begins.

493
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
Why does this have to be on video?

494
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,580
Why does this embarrass me?

495
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,300
You're not on video yet.

496
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,580
You can collect yourself.

497
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,380
The listeners have been watching an empty chair for.

498
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,740
There's a stain on my shirt.

499
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,540
It is such a shit show.

500
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,220
In my life right now, everything's fine,

501
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,780
but it's such a shit show.

502
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,460
If it makes you feel any better.

503
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,860
Look at my, oh, I look awful.

504
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,700
You look great.

505
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,820
I'm so sorry to the listener.

506
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,060
Sort of sorry to the listener who's just listening,

507
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,460
but there's video component, and I look like crap.

508
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,860
Look at the video to see how crappy Mike looks.

509
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,660
Look at this stain, look at this stain.

510
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,500
What is it?

511
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,340
It's wet.

512
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,180
Mike, if it makes you feel any better,

513
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,180
I have a small stain on my shirt,

514
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,460
because this is a real, I'll tell the story about this shirt.

515
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,300
This is a real vintage Epcot shirt.

516
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,360
I bought it March 10th, 2020.

517
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,600
We had just recorded the Islands of Adventure

518
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
preview episode. What happened March 10th, 2020?

519
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,720
Oh, I went to a crowded Trader Joe's.

520
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,960
Jason loves, you love any like,

521
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,280
and guess what the week was?

522
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,680
It may have been a March in a certain year.

523
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,840
And I went to a very crowded Trader Joe's

524
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,720
to buy canned goods like a blizzard was coming.

525
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,680
And sure enough.

526
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,440
So you got a giant bean stain on your, what's the stain?

527
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,440
I bought a $2 vintage Epcot shirt at a Salvation for Me,

528
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,640
or some sort of thrift.

529
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,600
There's gonna be a time when you're in like a kind of,

530
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,200
like a retirement home and you're gonna start,

531
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,400
you're gonna start like conflating that March week in 2020

532
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,120
with 9-Eleven.

533
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,560
You're gonna be, you remember March 9-Eleven, 2020?

534
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,200
I bought a can and a shirt.

535
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,800
A much more annoying Irishman hours.

536
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,200
But hey, let's not dunk on me.

537
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,120
Let's dunk on Mike a little more.

538
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,960
This is an opportunity.

539
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,080
It's not Jason, it's time to dunk on me.

540
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,120
And I deserve it.

541
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,920
I deserve it for the way I look on camera, first of all,

542
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,720
but also for my tardiness.

543
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,360
Hey look, in the interest of solidarity, there.

544
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,040
I just dumped water on myself.

545
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,800
Now I am also stained like all of you.

546
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,800
It's a clear stain, but you can kind of,

547
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,000
I am sopping wet.

548
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,800
So if you feel more.

549
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,160
Sparkling water.

550
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,760
Noted for removing stains.

551
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,840
No, Scott's making it better.

552
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,680
Well.

553
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,520
He's making his stains better.

554
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,480
Preventing future stains is what it's doing.

555
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,760
Well, I have nothing stain making on my person, so.

556
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,640
You okay?

557
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,480
How you doing?

558
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,320
I'm all right.

559
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,640
I'm a little stressed out.

560
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,320
A little stressed out right now.

561
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,720
We had the discussion of do you,

562
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,440
did you, we were like, well I hope he knows it's here too.

563
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,560
Oh, I didn't know.

564
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,480
Well, yes, you're right.

565
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,520
You're correct that I assumed the opposite.

566
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,920
So that was correct.

567
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,320
But I did have a half second to double check that

568
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,240
before I left.

569
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,960
And when all shit, it's farther.

570
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,200
It's farther than we oftentimes report.

571
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,560
You were slightly delayed because the iMessage

572
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,040
search feature is still this many years

573
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,720
and it's just absolute dog shit on Apple's part.

574
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,160
I did look, because yeah, I don't want to get into

575
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,040
the weeds of how this organization runs.

576
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,880
But.

577
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,040
We did a little.

578
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,880
You'll have to listen and find out.

579
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,720
I will have to listen.

580
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,160
So yeah, yeah.

581
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,600
I did do a quick search.

582
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
I definitely wrote it down wrong.

583
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Look, there's secret reasons that I can't reveal yet.

584
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,520
What's going on in my life?

585
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,640
It's like Doughboys.

586
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,280
Like Mitch, you're also in the Twisted Metal show.

587
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,400
You can't talk about me yet.

588
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,840
I am also, there's a new character they're adding.

589
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,400
But it's so secret they can't talk about it.

590
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,800
No, it is nothing a career, well I guess acting wise,

591
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,480
no, it's nothing like that.

592
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,080
I forget, we were recording, right?

593
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,080
Yeah, I know you walked into it.

594
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,120
We were recording for half an hour.

595
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,040
Listen, we decided to live stream this.

596
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,640
Everyone's watching it live too.

597
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,240
Did you do any of the episode or did you just roast me?

598
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,040
We were just kind of getting into the generic stuff

599
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,680
about early Main Street and how they had to fill the space

600
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,800
and first to last year rent up front.

601
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,800
We did discuss how even if you had a calendar alerts

602
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,400
correctly that it would get lost in an avalanche

603
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,480
of alerts for restaurants you don't like

604
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,880
and stores that have closed for good.

605
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,840
Yes, that's true.

606
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,880
And like two dollars off like a new Marvel legend alert.

607
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,880
If there was a toy that was a slightly discounted toy,

608
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,840
I would be getting alerts and it would cover up

609
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,720
what I was supposed to be doing.

610
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,120
Yes, that's true.

611
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
So anyway, I am here.

612
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,400
I mean, feel free to destroy me if you'd like.

613
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,080
I do deserve it.

614
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,320
I'll take my lashing.

615
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,680
You already have the stain.

616
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,240
You bear the scarlet letter that is the stain.

617
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,200
Any idea what the stain's from?

618
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,000
I think it's just probably water.

619
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,880
I think it might be gone already.

620
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,720
Not mine.

621
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,240
I poured a bunch on my, which is not visible

622
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,080
as far as I can tell.

623
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,200
If you both want to throw water on me during the show,

624
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,280
I'll take that but there's equipment.

625
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,600
I guess the equipment might be hurt by it.

626
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,320
I don't want to mess up their equipment

627
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,040
and I would only do it to help people.

628
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,400
I would only do it if there was an ice bucket challenge.

629
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,840
Yeah, if there was some sort of charity events,

630
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,680
then yes, okay.

631
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,440
Would it be a viable episode to go back and do

632
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,040
to just cover a bunch of people's ice bucket challenges?

633
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,120
Because it was a great thing that like hit everybody.

634
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,960
Everyone did, lots of weirdos did

635
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,600
from Mike Love to George W. Bush.

636
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,440
Yes, that's true.

637
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,800
Everyone got to put their stamp on the ice bucket challenge.

638
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,880
Every once in a while, I'll go back and like,

639
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,000
you know what I'm watching tonight?

640
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,840
Ice bucket challenges.

641
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,720
Is that true?

642
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,480
Yeah, a little bit because I like the George W. Bush one

643
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,000
because Laura Bush has to act.

644
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,760
One of the worst actors up for on the Earth.

645
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,600
Oh sure, yeah.

646
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,400
She's supposed to do it and then she comes in

647
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,120
with that smile of nervousness

648
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,760
when you've never been on camera before.

649
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,040
And like, I didn't know how to do it.

650
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,440
I didn't want to mess up my hair.

651
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,840
I think that's viable.

652
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,400
Mike Love does it.

653
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,880
It's in a concert and it's such a gun point

654
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,840
and not understanding what it is.

655
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,320
And then it is so sad when he challenges Mick Jagger

656
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,080
to do it because like, dude, Mick Jagger's not watching

657
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,200
one of your YouTube videos.

658
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,840
And he didn't do it?

659
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,640
No, he, no, if Mick Jagger ever did an ice bucket challenge,

660
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,960
I don't think it was because of Mike Love's

661
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,120
challenge being issued.

662
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,960
I see.

663
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,800
Well, I felt like the celebrities were like doing that

664
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,240
in sort of conflict.

665
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,320
There was some sort of plan, but maybe that's wrong.

666
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,120
Maybe they just picked somebody they liked.

667
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,120
I'm not sure.

668
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,960
I think some of that, that's an interesting study

669
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,320
you could do if you were analyzing ice bucket challenges

670
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,720
is unanswered ice bucket challenges.

671
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,560
Oh, that's a good idea.

672
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,800
And ice bucket challenges outside of your league,

673
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,440
like reaching for somebody.

674
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,720
Somebody too high up the tier.

675
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,160
I know you're sort of famous,

676
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,480
but like Obama's not gonna do it because you said to do it.

677
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,920
Who, Jamie Kennedy, I don't know who.

678
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,280
So like if we had said like Pod Save America guys,

679
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,200
we challenge you, they're out of our league.

680
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,120
So they would not have answered us

681
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,280
and it would have been embarrassing.

682
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,120
Obviously, yeah.

683
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,040
I mean, we'll get to their league someday.

684
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,480
We're trying, but the more we're late

685
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,000
and the more we're, that's why, if for only that reason,

686
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,600
to just catch up to Pod Save.

687
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,440
Sure.

688
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,080
Yeah, we just need to vote a little harder.

689
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,680
And then maybe they'll dump a little ice.

690
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,520
Yeah.

691
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,120
They'll finally answer our ice bucket challenge

692
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,720
seven years later.

693
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,200
Here's what, but you know what?

694
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,320
This isn't about roasting and it's not about being mean

695
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,240
because we haven't really gotten to a specific location yet

696
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,360
in weird old Main Street bullshit.

697
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,120
And we saved the one that you wanted to talk about,

698
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,000
which is the bank.

699
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,920
We saved the bank for you.

700
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,240
If we really were vindictive,

701
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,440
we wouldn't have let you talk about the bank.

702
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,840
After all that, after half an hour,

703
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,480
all right, we're there everybody.

704
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,720
The bank is what we're.

705
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,160
I'm crying on the way over here.

706
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,600
I wanna talk about the bank plate and get to the bank yet.

707
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,720
I wanna talk about there's a bank on this.

708
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,040
An actual bank, a functioning bank.

709
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,400
Yeah, it's a functioning bank.

710
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,240
Just a bank.

711
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,440
And the first thing when you came in,

712
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,200
if you go into Disneyland now

713
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,840
and off to the right is the Disney Gallery

714
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,040
and maybe that corridor of bathrooms

715
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,000
are the first you use when you come in.

716
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,120
But so Disneyland's here, you're in its Disneyland,

717
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,920
the realm of magic, here's a bank.

718
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,080
Yes, it's like now, yeah.

719
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,400
I like, I'm trying to think of what's better.

720
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,160
I think it is better that you can buy a Mickey statue

721
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,600
where he's tugging on a firefighter's outfit

722
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,960
or something there now instead of it being a bank.

723
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,960
But if I'm thinking about Disney as a real place,

724
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,480
I do really like the idea that there's just a bunch

725
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,000
of stupid daily tasks you could take care of on Main Street.

726
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,720
So there's something fun about it.

727
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,320
You would have liked to,

728
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,760
you might have saved banking to do.

729
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,680
100% I would have saved banking for Main Street.

730
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,600
Don't you think you would have done it?

731
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,080
We would have done a little bit,

732
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,280
these two, we're the first guys to ever think of this

733
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,120
10 years ago, been like,

734
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,680
you wanna go down and make a deposit?

735
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,560
And be like, yeah, Jason and I would have two envelopes

736
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,240
full of cash that we were gonna deposit at Disneyland.

737
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,280
And be like, this is how we do all of our banking.

738
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,920
We would have absolutely done that if it was still there

739
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,320
when we first started going to Disneyland.

740
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,240
Because again, I do wanna emphasize

741
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,600
that it's an actual bank.

742
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,200
Because some of the places were simulations of business.

743
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,760
It weren't actually their businesses.

744
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,240
Or like, I bet there's people in Florida.

745
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,560
Because Florida still is a barber shop.

746
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,400
Really?

747
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,240
Yes, right, right.

748
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,080
A functioning barber shop.

749
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,040
You can get your haircut on Main Street?

750
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,760
You can get your haircut on Main Street.

751
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,840
I have heard some people like,

752
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,760
oh, it's time for baby's first haircut.

753
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,760
We're getting it done on Main Street at the Magic Kingdom.

754
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,800
Oh, because they're happy to be at Disney World.

755
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,880
It's like a first thing, it's a first time, yeah.

756
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,320
Yeah, and I'm sure there's Orlando locals

757
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,400
who it's like, time for a haircut.

758
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,560
I'm gonna make a reservation and make a park reservation

759
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,400
to get a haircut on Main Street.

760
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,800
Would you not do that?

761
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,760
I would also do it.

762
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,800
I would probably do that if I was close by.

763
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,880
Not every time.

764
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,040
If there was a Disneyland haircut,

765
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,360
I would have tried it probably by now, at least once.

766
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,960
I wouldn't have, and I'll tell you why.

767
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,920
Because it would suck and cost $250.

768
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,720
Well, it would suck, because it's $250,

769
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,440
but don't you think they'd have some sort of whimsical

770
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,680
80-year-old man who's cutting

771
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,920
and he's gonna give you the hot shave?

772
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,560
It's like, why don't you do it once?

773
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,400
You do it in...

774
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,240
One time.

775
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,680
You're in the window on Main Street

776
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,280
and you're kind of a display, you're kind of an attraction.

777
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,360
Oh, they make you a little show.

778
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,160
Yeah, yeah, I suppose so.

779
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,760
Maybe once you would do it?

780
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,280
Yeah, I would consider doing it next time

781
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,840
I was in the Magic Kingdom.

782
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,480
Well, yeah, well, you got it now.

783
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,440
Well, now we have to do it.

784
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,080
Now all three of us have to do it.

785
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,160
Ideally, at the same time in chairs next to each other.

786
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,400
Oh, can they do that?

787
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,240
I don't know.

788
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,760
Is it like a sport clips?

789
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,120
Is it like multiple chairs?

790
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,960
I was picturing the old couple, well, like one or two.

791
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,080
I feel like there's two chairs, probably.

792
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,680
Okay, can they do colors?

793
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,520
I don't know they do dye jobs.

794
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,760
I'll dye my hair on Main Street.

795
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,960
I've never dyed my hair before,

796
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,440
but I will dye my hair on Main Street.

797
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,920
In an old timey barber shop, you're gonna go bright blue.

798
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,080
I wanna get as much as you can get there.

799
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,320
Hmm.

800
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,200
I don't know if he has blue.

801
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,040
Well, I don't know.

802
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,920
That feels like that would take a long time to color.

803
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,880
Because if you're going different colors,

804
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,280
I think you have to bleach,

805
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,680
and then it would have to dye it yellow and then go blue.

806
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,240
And you're on vacation also,

807
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,200
so now you're using hours for this haircut.

808
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,680
But it's content for us.

809
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,760
That's true, yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,640
Do they have the menu, what you can do?

811
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,320
You gotta get your eyebrows removed.

812
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,400
All of your arm hair.

813
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,840
I wanna see if there's like a menu.

814
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,480
How much hair will they touch?

815
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,360
Yeah.

816
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,040
Now I'm wondering, have they relegated this to the app too?

817
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,640
Is this now like, in theory, simpler,

818
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,080
but more of a pain in the ass?

819
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,520
Because you can't specify,

820
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,120
you can't talk to a human over the phone.

821
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,880
Yeah, that's a good question.

822
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,400
Child, okay, services available, child haircut,

823
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,200
my first haircut, adult haircut, beard trim.

824
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,160
So they're not gonna color your hair there.

825
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
I don't think so.

826
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,960
They're probably not gonna shave you either.

827
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,920
Well, the beard trim, yeah,

828
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,280
you're not getting the warm razor out.

829
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,040
No, but I'll get an adult haircut.

830
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,680
It doesn't, starting at $21.

831
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,880
Cheaper than Floyd's, cheaper than local chain Floyd.

832
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,720
Not so bad.

833
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,840
I guess I may.

834
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,960
Yes, you have to do it.

835
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,120
Well, let's see how those hidden fees stack up.

836
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,800
Aren't you suspicious of this?

837
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,120
At current Disney World, a service that in the real world

838
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,320
is usually much more expensive,

839
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,160
is $21.

840
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,920
Do you, yeah, $21 gets you the high and tight

841
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,960
or gets it shaved all the way off?

842
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,240
Sorry, that's the price.

843
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,080
$21 is the cost for a haircut.

844
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,480
We cut one hair.

845
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,360
Do you want us to cut the others?

846
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,160
That's just the going through the door fee is $21.

847
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,920
One hair, I cut one hair, that's a dollar.

848
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,680
Another hair, yet another dollar.

849
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,960
And like Mickey's just got a calculator next to him

850
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,800
and it's like, $1, $2?

851
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,200
You have 1,000 hairs.

852
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,960
Shapek approves of this, not just because of

853
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,920
all the hidden fees, but because he's like,

854
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,480
hey, make haircuts as expensive as you want.

855
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,320
Not a problem for me.

856
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,680
That is gonna, that will,

857
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,240
that is definitely on his to-do list.

858
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,600
He's got like a big board.

859
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
It's like, he says like, evil board or something.

860
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,400
And it's like, make haircuts cost at least $500.

861
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,560
What is left to make more expensive?

862
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,840
All right, charge per brick that you step on.

863
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,640
That's the new Disney and Magic ankle bands.

864
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,600
We track, it's a fun thing where we track

865
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,360
every step that you take in the park.

866
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,520
And it helps with fitness and you get a little sticker

867
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,840
at the end and Goofy says, good job.

868
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,920
And yes, then we charge you for all the wear and tear

869
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,480
that you put on bricks and cement in our park.

870
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,920
We're helping your heart, so pay us.

871
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,560
Or pay us for your heart help.

872
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,720
But yeah, so they had a bank.

873
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,560
They had a bank.

874
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,240
I like more mundane stuff.

875
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,920
I like, I would like more of it is what I'm saying.

876
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,320
I would like more things like that available.

877
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,520
I know they did have it, obviously.

878
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,360
We're talking about that.

879
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,600
Well, you say it's mundane, but here,

880
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,960
like here's a description I read of what you could do there.

881
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,000
You know, there's a vault.

882
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,520
You pass by the vault that is holding money and documents.

883
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,320
And then the branch manager, Leo Wagman,

884
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,120
sits in a nearby armchair behind a roll-top desk,

885
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,800
nodding and smiling at the visitors.

886
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,160
So you come back from Disneyland.

887
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,200
How was Walt Disney's Disneyland?

888
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,120
It was great.

889
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,320
I saw Leo Wagman.

890
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,160
Who's that?

891
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,800
Is that a character from a movie?

892
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,480
No, he's a guy at a bank.

893
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,840
You know, like a fun movie about a bank

894
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,400
or like the Mary Poppins bank.

895
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,880
Mary Poppins bank guy?

896
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,680
No, bank guy.

897
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,720
He's a real branch manager for Bank of America.

898
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,520
This guy is a famous Disneyland character, though.

899
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,280
Now, I mean, we're getting him out here now.

900
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,720
Yeah, we're getting the word out about Leo Wagman.

901
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,560
Leo Wagman.

902
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,680
Some of my information today came from a really strange book

903
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,240
that I think is called like Fifty Fivers or Class of 55,

904
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,480
something my parents gave me for Christmas one year.

905
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,720
It is a book that tracks every single human being

906
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,320
who worked at Disneyland in the first year.

907
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,160
Wow.

908
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,000
Wow.

909
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,120
And like, then you read, like they tracked them all down.

910
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,600
There's at least a little information.

911
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,240
Like this, he's from Fullerton,

912
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,840
but then he died in La Palma.

913
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,760
The stories are not magical.

914
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,720
They aren't interesting.

915
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,680
It's just like, here's people.

916
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,560
Do they claim to have everyone?

917
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,120
Yeah, and there's, I mean, there's hundreds of little.

918
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,280
Sure.

919
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,400
Is Leo in there?

920
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,240
Yeah, yeah.

921
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,600
There's an entire, like I don't have it with me.

922
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,000
There's a whole separate, besides what I just read,

923
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,600
there's a separate Leo Wagman section

924
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,680
where you find out where he was born and I assume died.

925
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,280
Wow, has anybody here ever known the name of a bank employee

926
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,680
that they would go to a lot?

927
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,400
No.

928
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,160
Like they might've like thought I did

929
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,680
if I went more than once, but I didn't remember their name.

930
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,600
Did everyone go to the bank as like children

931
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,560
to open up your first savings account?

932
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,520
And like, it was a big deal

933
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,640
because you sat at the desk with your parent?

934
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,600
I did not have that.

935
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,040
You never did that, Jason?

936
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,440
I think, yeah, I did something like that.

937
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,960
I mean, we had the like, the bank was next to the post office

938
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,680
and they were both across the street from the high school.

939
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,600
Right, and you got like a little book

940
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,000
because it was 100 years ago when we were children.

941
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,280
Yeah, yeah.

942
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,360
You know what I'm realizing now

943
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,600
is that I'm potentially introducing

944
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
a new second gate character

945
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,000
because I believe I got a mascot character for our bank,

946
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,320
the Harris Lion.

947
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,600
Oh.

948
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,520
I believe I had a plush.

949
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,360
Let me look him up.

950
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,120
You got any info on Harris Lion?

951
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,360
Is the Harris Lion cute?

952
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,560
Let's see, he for sure is cute.

953
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,280
There's no doubt about it.

954
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,360
But that's like more of a Midwest, I think I've got bought.

955
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,920
Yeah, I got bought by BMO, BMO Harris.

956
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,080
BMO Lion? But they kept Harris?

957
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
I guess so.

958
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,880
BMO, Harris Bank, here he is with a bull's jersey.

959
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,240
I mean, he's not the cutest, I'll be honest.

960
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,800
No, no, not really.

961
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,640
I like him.

962
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,400
He's not not cute.

963
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,280
Yeah.

964
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,640
Oh yeah, there's this bank.

965
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,560
I mean, I've had this bank as well.

966
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,920
A bank, you mean a piggy bank?

967
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,760
A literal bank, yeah.

968
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,880
A lion bank.

969
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
That does look familiar.

970
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,520
So this is a new guy, Harris.

971
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,520
Oh, that's fun.

972
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,280
I'll do this, hold up to the...

973
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,720
There you go.

974
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Mike is now here to show you banks,

975
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,160
a little bank that he had.

976
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,480
And hopefully, my biggest fear during that

977
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,600
was that something that's happening right now,

978
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,440
I wasn't gonna get a bunch of panic text messages

979
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,960
and show those to the camera.

980
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,520
But luckily those came before and will come after.

981
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,360
That's another thing.

982
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,760
No, you have full transparency to the listener.

983
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,560
I guess that's the bank.

984
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,920
So you got to do it.

985
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,560
The vault is still there.

986
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,400
Did you say that?

987
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,240
No, no.

988
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,880
The vault is still there and it's still being used

989
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,440
to house very expensive things you can buy

990
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,960
from the Disney gallery.

991
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,840
Oh yeah, there is that little nook.

992
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,680
And it's big, it's a big, thick bank vault door,

993
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,240
which I never questioned what it was.

994
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,440
I thought it was just theming.

995
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,040
And I was like, oh, that's fun.

996
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,720
They made a vault for the special things.

997
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,320
But I've walked by there before and they had a full...

998
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,080
It wasn't on an animatronic,

999
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,000
but it was like a recreation of the guy

1000
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,280
in the haunted mansion with the dog.

1001
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,480
Sometimes it's just like some sort of statue.

1002
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,360
Sometimes it's like a one of a kind artifact.

1003
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,440
And sometimes it looks like it's just a picture in there

1004
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,080
and you're like, well, that's not as...

1005
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,400
This feels like it should be some crazy expensive thing.

1006
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,240
But sometimes maybe they...

1007
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,040
Or people's actual financial information,

1008
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,840
which is what used to be in there.

1009
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,400
Yeah, sometimes it should just be like ledgers,

1010
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,480
bank ledgers and withdrawals and deposits.

1011
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,440
And yeah, I mean, that's gotta be in there somewhere, right?

1012
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,280
Maybe it doesn't.

1013
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,800
Like in the wall somewhere.

1014
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,320
But there weren't safe deposit boxes there.

1015
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,160
No.

1016
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,000
That would have been amazing.

1017
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
You couldn't do your escrow services.

1018
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,560
You couldn't do that.

1019
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,400
Right.

1020
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,600
These surfing bank robbers from Point Break

1021
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,840
did not try to heist the Disney World Bank.

1022
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,640
But what a great novel for your new novel series.

1023
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,480
Oh, yeah.

1024
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,760
Bodhi is back.

1025
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,520
He did not totally eat shit at the end of the movie

1026
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,680
and die in the big wave.

1027
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,400
Jason Sheridan presents The Main Street Files.

1028
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,760
Disneyland, it's a Disneyland meets Point Break adventure.

1029
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,920
Yeah, it's Disneyland meets Point Break.

1030
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,920
They're 70 page paperback novels that Jason writes.

1031
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,920
They're like those series of the guy

1032
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,200
with the adventures at Main Street.

1033
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,680
The Main Street Files.

1034
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,800
You could write one of those.

1035
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,040
For our patron, Jason's gonna say

1036
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,520
he's gonna write a 70 page novel for the highest tier.

1037
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,240
When did I say that?

1038
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,760
Just now in my imagination.

1039
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,880
Oh, okay.

1040
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,320
Yeah, on the car ride over,

1041
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,800
did you have a conversation with me?

1042
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,160
Do I just appear when you're running late?

1043
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,520
You are like my great kazoo.

1044
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,160
You show up all the time in my life.

1045
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,960
It's not 11, dumb dumb.

1046
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,800
It's not the right time, dumb dumb.

1047
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,480
Also, I'm going to write a novel.

1048
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,480
There's a weird video of Jordan Peterson going around

1049
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,240
where he's in the scare, he's in like a Jack Skellington suit

1050
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,760
and he's doing this odd screed about.

1051
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,200
Oh, Elliot Page?

1052
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,880
Yeah, yeah, but the only part I saw is this weird like,

1053
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,880
we'll see who gets canceled.

1054
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,720
Yes, that's it.

1055
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,480
I was like, this is like great kazoo a little bit.

1056
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,440
He's like a big tall great kazoo.

1057
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,360
He's like, yeah, so long, woke mob.

1058
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,200
I forget what he says.

1059
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,040
Woke moralist, you dumb morales.

1060
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,880
You dumb.

1061
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,960
Yes, it's lit because he's joining Ben Shapiro's

1062
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,640
Daily Wire now as a contributor.

1063
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,120
Same family as Gina Carano's movie.

1064
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:24,960
That's right.

1065
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,200
All the best content.

1066
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,960
Terror on the Prairie, which as somebody pointed out,

1067
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,160
sounds like a 30 Rock fake movie.

1068
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,120
Yeah, so they've shot a video.

1069
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,080
I don't know, I was just like,

1070
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,280
do we have to explain to this guy

1071
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
in the middle of Main Street?

1072
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,520
Jordan Peterson is like an annoying guy

1073
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,200
who's like mad at trans people and always crying.

1074
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,120
And like trying to get kicked off Twitter.

1075
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,360
And yeah, he said something derogatory about Elliot Page

1076
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,080
and then Twitter kicked him off.

1077
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,800
And now they made a little super villain video of him

1078
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,080
for Daily Wire.

1079
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,920
He came back.

1080
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,960
We'll see who cancels who.

1081
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,800
We'll see who cancels.

1082
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,680
He says like, we'll see how,

1083
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,480
yeah, like it's a weird, did somebody write it?

1084
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,640
Did the writer of Terror on the Prairie

1085
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,040
write this little monologue?

1086
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,120
He came back after attempting,

1087
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,600
his daughter tried to get him to eat an all meat diet.

1088
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,240
And then he was addicted to Benzos.

1089
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,360
And then I think she took him to like a weird

1090
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:29,040
stay in rehab in Russia or somewhere in far Eastern Europe.

1091
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,320
And somehow came back.

1092
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,680
Somehow he's doing the rounds again.

1093
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,480
And there was like the most fragile person.

1094
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,320
Yes.

1095
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,120
Why are we talking about this guy now?

1096
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,960
Hold on, hold on.

1097
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,200
We can stop.

1098
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,040
Keep talking.

1099
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,920
I'm sorry, this guy is insane.

1100
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,760
He's a crazy, like he was mad.

1101
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,600
Clock's ticking.

1102
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,760
When the, all right.

1103
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,600
It's 11.33 right now.

1104
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,160
No more, 11.34, we're done.

1105
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,120
He was mad about like the Sports Illustrated cover.

1106
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,000
The woman didn't look like a woman

1107
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,440
from the 90s on the cover.

1108
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,040
And he was like, you're not fooling me with this.

1109
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,680
I won't be tricked.

1110
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,400
This woman is not the same weight as the woman in the 90s.

1111
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,760
And people were like, what's wrong with you?

1112
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,280
Well, and what's important is that anytime this guy

1113
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,720
farts anything out of his mouth hole,

1114
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,080
that we, Twitter needs to make it be trending.

1115
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,920
Well, that's an issue.

1116
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,760
There is no other choice.

1117
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,280
We're trending it now, but it is like,

1118
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,720
dude, what's wrong with you?

1119
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,920
This gaunt crying man who clearly has consumption

1120
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,040
has some thoughts, has some thoughts on light year.

1121
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,520
And Jason summed it up.

1122
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,200
All right, so the door slammed, vault door slammed.

1123
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,680
We're shoving Jordan in there.

1124
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,160
You brought up heists.

1125
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,280
There was a heist on Main Street.

1126
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,360
I'm gonna dive into that story.

1127
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,200
Oh yeah.

1128
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,000
Yeah, you ran into this at the restaurant,

1129
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,400
the Red Wagon Inn.

1130
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,880
This is now the Plaza Inn, I believe,

1131
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,040
down at the end of Main Street.

1132
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,960
And there was a heist there of some kind in 1960.

1133
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,200
It's a really weird story where a guy at the restaurant

1134
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,840
was taking, he was moving money from one place to,

1135
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,000
from the back of the restaurant

1136
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,080
to technically the backstage.

1137
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,440
And then a guy came out, he felt something against his side

1138
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,480
and uh-oh, and he had to give the guy

1139
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,080
the full $10,000 that he had,

1140
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,400
which seems like that's a lot of money

1141
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,200
for a Disney restaurant to be moving.

1142
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,440
And that was, so this became a matter

1143
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,280
for the Anaheim police and they're like,

1144
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,320
and there was, somebody had a gun in Disneyland

1145
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,840
and this all, this seems weird and it's a lot of money.

1146
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,240
So they talked to the employee again.

1147
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,000
Two days later, he failed a lie detector test,

1148
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,720
confessed and showed the police where in,

1149
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,400
they did the women's locker room.

1150
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,680
He hid most of $10,000 and returned it.

1151
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,600
Why would he hide it there?

1152
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,400
They'd never, why would a man be in the woman's room?

1153
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,920
It's the perfect crime.

1154
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,160
Yeah. Yeah, geez.

1155
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,000
He just lied.

1156
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Only in Jordan Peterson's America.

1157
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,640
I didn't say it, I didn't say it.

1158
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,520
Doesn't mean we have to keep talking, let's go, all right,

1159
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,520
quick.

1160
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,280
But yeah, it's like, I would think if you would

1161
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,360
steal a bunch of money, you'd try to not keep it

1162
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,440
within 50 feet of, like, try to get it out of there.

1163
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,600
Yeah, really strange story.

1164
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,400
And the idea that like, I don't know,

1165
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,480
I don't think we had metal detectors at that point,

1166
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,080
but I also don't think people were bringing guns

1167
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,840
to Disneyland.

1168
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,680
Yeah, right.

1169
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,520
I don't think.

1170
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,480
It just seems like this was maybe a plan

1171
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,000
that wasn't well thought out.

1172
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,040
Yeah, yeah.

1173
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,960
This was a very, this was the William H. Macy of his day.

1174
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,800
Oh yeah.

1175
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,120
Immediately.

1176
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:48,960
Usually.

1177
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,200
I told you the story, what do you want?

1178
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,840
If you're gonna heist like $10,000 like that,

1179
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,840
which is probably worth like 10 times as much in 2022 dollars.

1180
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,360
But usually you don't just have one doofus who lies

1181
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,640
and is very bad at lying.

1182
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,320
Yeah, and his plan was like, himself on like,

1183
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,560
I'll be good, I can handle this.

1184
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,440
Me, a like, assistant manager at a theme park restaurant,

1185
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,440
I mean, I can hold up to the police for more than two days.

1186
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,360
Oh God, no, I'm sorry, you're dang it.

1187
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,440
Come to the women's room with me.

1188
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,000
That's like the three of us are probably,

1189
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,680
if we were little and we took like an extra piece

1190
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,960
of candy, we would have like within an hour

1191
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,800
of been like crying and be like,

1192
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,760
well you have to confess something, mommy.

1193
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,640
I ate an extra piece of candy after dinner.

1194
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,600
100%.

1195
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,440
Yeah.

1196
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,520
I lied about something.

1197
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,280
Three big bucklers.

1198
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,240
At the time, three little bucklers.

1199
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,240
That's what we'll call ourselves from now on

1200
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,560
because we're not three childless men in our 30s anymore.

1201
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,000
Three little bucklers.

1202
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,200
That could replace Cliffords too potentially.

1203
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,400
The list, we can't put this on the listeners.

1204
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,120
The listeners are bucklers for sure.

1205
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,760
If they listen to us.

1206
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,760
This is unfair, we've already put on them

1207
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,280
that they're like the creepy little Martin Short character.

1208
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,240
You Cliffords, you're also bucklers.

1209
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,920
They also would not hold up against police

1210
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,760
or parent scrutiny over a piece of candy.

1211
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,600
Let's ask them.

1212
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,000
Hey, tweet at us if you're a little buckler,

1213
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,320
a nasty little coward with no integrity.

1214
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,920
I'm glad you're in the main video

1215
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,200
to seek for that, for asking that question.

1216
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,760
Well, I mean, what a boy.

1217
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,360
I mean, if they truly are bucklers,

1218
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,080
they'll buckle because you asked that.

1219
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,920
A nasty little coward.

1220
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,600
Yes, I am, sir.

1221
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,120
The podcast I listen to yelled at me, I buckled.

1222
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,360
I think we got a lot of bucklers in the audience.

1223
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,280
I think we have a lot of people

1224
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,880
who could easily give us wedgies too.

1225
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,720
Yeah, I know.

1226
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,200
You come in late and then you insult,

1227
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,400
then you say that everybody,

1228
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,560
our whole audience is gonna buckle.

1229
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,720
Who is this Mike?

1230
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,240
I don't know.

1231
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm not sorry though, I'll tell you that.

1232
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,120
I'm not sorry for what I said.

1233
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,080
I'm like Jordan Pierce.

1234
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:11,920
You won't cancel me.

1235
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,760
You won't get an apology from me.

1236
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,600
You won't cancel me for calling you bucklers.

1237
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,040
That's right, bucklers.

1238
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,240
We'll see you buckles against you.

1239
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,080
No.

1240
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,720
I regret nothing.

1241
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,160
Here's some other things I have to say

1242
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,240
about the Red Wagon Inn.

1243
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,520
This is my intro that you missed.

1244
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,640
It was, mainly what we did was laugh

1245
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,360
at my opening joke for 10 minutes,

1246
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,240
but I said that there were a lot of,

1247
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,400
you know, like weird meats come up on the show

1248
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,800
and it's gonna happen here

1249
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,440
because it's original Disneyland.

1250
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,160
Kids menu at the Red Wagon Restaurant.

1251
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,680
A couple odd things going on.

1252
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,840
This was a Yesterland poll.

1253
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,360
Why Red Wagon Restaurant serves

1254
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,400
genuine Swift's meat for babies.

1255
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,040
For 25 cents a can, choose from strained beef,

1256
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,360
strained veal, chopped beef, and chopped veal.

1257
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,040
Swift's is the foremost name in meat for babies.

1258
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,560
100% meat.

1259
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,480
Now, Scott, you got a two year old.

1260
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,800
What is his favorite chopped or strained meat?

1261
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,720
And do you buy Swift's?

1262
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,480
It's so frustrating that it's not easier

1263
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,560
to find strained veal.

1264
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,880
It's been my biggest complaint since becoming a parent.

1265
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,600
Where's all that used to be on every street corner?

1266
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,080
I took them to Disneyland.

1267
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,960
Where's your veal?

1268
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,440
It can be strained or chopped.

1269
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,720
Will it slide?

1270
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,320
He prefers chopped, but you can strain it.

1271
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,200
You know, a fun fact that Mike found out in the app,

1272
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,200
you can order, you know, a kid's meal of strained meats.

1273
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,840
You don't have to have a kid.

1274
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,120
You can just do it in the app

1275
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,200
and it'll be ready at mobile pickup.

1276
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,720
And can you get it a little cheaper

1277
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,200
if you say doesn't have to be 100% meat?

1278
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,040
Yeah, yeah.

1279
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,880
But that's a...

1280
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,720
A couple cents off.

1281
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,400
They can't do that in an app though.

1282
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,240
You gotta ask.

1283
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,840
Yeah, you gotta stand in line to get it a la carte

1284
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,960
or to get a little more filler, a little more sawdust.

1285
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,800
Veal.

1286
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,160
I want the, I'm here for, I need the baby veal,

1287
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,840
but it doesn't have to be all veal.

1288
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,000
Meat for babies is also just...

1289
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,840
Really disturbing, Nate.

1290
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,000
I guess babies have meat.

1291
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,840
Sure.

1292
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,560
Mine doesn't so much.

1293
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,400
Not a lot.

1294
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,800
You don't need a lot of meat.

1295
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,680
No, I don't think so.

1296
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,800
You certainly don't need veal for babies.

1297
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,280
No, that's what's, and veal is babies.

1298
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,320
It's babies eating babies.

1299
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,000
Oh yeah.

1300
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,040
This is the world that Walt wanted in the food.

1301
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,800
This is what he was trying to...

1302
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,000
I wanna look down the street

1303
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,880
and see nothing but babies eating babies.

1304
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,080
There was a whole wonderful world of Disney

1305
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,640
about babies eating veal.

1306
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,320
He was presenting that to the American public.

1307
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,000
The most beautiful American sights there is.

1308
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,640
Jason, did you eat veal when you were a little baby?

1309
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,920
No, I don't think so.

1310
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,840
I don't think as a baby.

1311
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,240
I've never had veal.

1312
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,080
Really?

1313
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,960
Yeah, I still don't, no, yeah, I wouldn't.

1314
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,880
I feel like chicken Parmesan and veal Parmesan

1315
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,640
are just kind of standards at like where I grew up.

1316
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,000
When was the last time you ate veal?

1317
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I don't know, a few years ago?

1318
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,400
Veal piccata maybe?

1319
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,520
Never.

1320
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,360
No?

1321
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,080
I don't even know that it's been offered to me.

1322
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,240
Like I don't even know that I've seen it on a menu.

1323
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,520
You must have been in a restaurant with veal.

1324
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,360
Probably.

1325
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,200
I think so.

1326
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,600
It just wasn't, nobody offered it out loud.

1327
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,840
Nobody pushed it on me.

1328
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,960
Can we make you buckle?

1329
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,080
We know that stain is veal.

1330
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,640
Buckle now.

1331
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,120
I was eating a little jar of baby veal,

1332
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,560
of baby food veal on the way over here

1333
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,200
because I haven't eaten in days

1334
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,200
and that was the close.

1335
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,040
That was.

1336
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,160
Lap, lap, lap, lap with your tongue.

1337
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,080
The closest store was a baby food store

1338
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,280
and I just grabbed stuff off the shelf

1339
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,040
and I was just shoveling baby food veal into my stomach

1340
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,720
and yeah, I got some veal juice on my shirt.

1341
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,600
The cans are mostly juice, you gotta get them.

1342
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,960
Yeah, because it can't be big pieces for baby.

1343
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,800
Yeah.

1344
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,640
Yeah, baby needs.

1345
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,640
You put juice in the bottle.

1346
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,640
Baby needs juice.

1347
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,800
My baby needs juice.

1348
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,640
Baby.

1349
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,120
We're bottle feeding him.

1350
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:20,960
Veal juice.

1351
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,440
Veal juice, of course.

1352
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,840
No formula, no breast milk.

1353
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,560
No, the formula shortage has not affected us at all.

1354
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,920
Well, that's because we mainly give him veal juice.

1355
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,520
Veal juice.

1356
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,920
No, not beetle juice.

1357
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,760
No.

1358
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,960
Well, you also, then you'd have your,

1359
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,520
you'd give baby strained veal

1360
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,720
and then they'd wash it down with buttermilk.

1361
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,360
It's just weird this time.

1362
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,320
What was going on?

1363
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,720
And then also, and then just past that,

1364
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,720
then there's a full, okay, there's a page from,

1365
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,840
they don't call it the kids menu,

1366
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,280
they call it the menu for young Americans.

1367
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,120
And then there's only five items on it

1368
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,400
or types of meals you can order.

1369
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,360
Two of them are problematic.

1370
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,680
I'm not gonna say those out loud.

1371
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,520
Oh no.

1372
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,600
Two of them in various ways are characters

1373
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,440
who are problematic.

1374
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,200
Oh, got it, got it.

1375
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,000
And then one of them is,

1376
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,040
this, you know, like one meal is just the Casey Jr.

1377
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,080
And then that's unrelated.

1378
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,240
It's a sirloin patty.

1379
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,440
But then one is Danny.

1380
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,320
And it's a little happy black sheep,

1381
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,040
or a black lamb, I guess, from So Dear to My Heart,

1382
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,800
the 40s Disney movies, So Dear to My Heart.

1383
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,560
And he looks so eager and happy

1384
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,440
and like he's gonna go run and play.

1385
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,320
And then his meal is broiled lamb chop.

1386
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,120
It's like clucking chicken.

1387
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,800
It's like a Saturday Night Live sketch.

1388
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,480
Yes.

1389
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,300
Weird.

1390
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,200
Like have lamb chop, sure.

1391
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,960
But why put this, like we have one lamb character

1392
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,600
in the entire lineup and we're gonna have him.

1393
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,880
That's a decades long trend, I think,

1394
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,020
that maybe around the time of that clucking chicken sketch,

1395
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,800
people were like, wait a minute.

1396
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,640
Didn't wanna think about the face of what they're eating.

1397
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,720
Yeah, it was like, oh yeah,

1398
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,800
we'll have a cute picture of the thing you're eating.

1399
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,720
And finally, after decades, people were like,

1400
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,520
well, maybe that's a little weird.

1401
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,760
Maybe that, people don't wanna see that.

1402
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,120
Yeah, and why have that when one of them is chopped meat

1403
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,760
and then a side of jello represented by a smiling train?

1404
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,720
What was the smell back then in these places,

1405
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,880
just like everyone eating the most meat possible,

1406
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,120
just like churning out meat in the kitchen?

1407
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,080
I mean, I guess it probably wasn't that insane, but.

1408
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,320
Well, I have that question in general because there's,

1409
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,320
well, there's not only that,

1410
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,920
it's all meat and buttermilk everywhere,

1411
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,320
but then also to transition

1412
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,100
into the other smell making materials,

1413
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,520
there's a tobacco store.

1414
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,360
The tobacco is.

1415
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,000
Right, you're just buying tobacco.

1416
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,560
And everyone's farting too.

1417
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,840
So I think we've talked about

1418
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,520
how much farting was going on back then.

1419
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,160
No, we must've discussed the degree of fart in the air

1420
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,520
at early Disney Land.

1421
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,720
Because everyone's eating heavy meat for every meal,

1422
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,200
smoking like a chimney,

1423
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,700
and that gas has to come out.

1424
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,760
And I don't even think we've answered the question of how,

1425
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,440
people didn't just let it rip in the 1950s or 60s, did they?

1426
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,840
Or would they say, well, excuse me after they did it?

1427
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,320
If they were in line for the train, would you fart

1428
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,160
or would you have to squeeze it out?

1429
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,000
What would it be?

1430
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,720
What was the protocol back then?

1431
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,760
Obviously it's not.

1432
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,560
Was everyone just wearing so much wool material?

1433
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,400
Did it just get absorbed?

1434
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,240
It would muffle it.

1435
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,080
It would muffle it.

1436
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,680
That's why you dressed that way.

1437
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,080
It was soundproofing.

1438
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,600
Yeah.

1439
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,600
Yeah, yeah, it was such a thick material

1440
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,640
that you just hear like,

1441
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,240
it wasn't like that far.

1442
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,280
It would bounce off though.

1443
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,480
It's as much as two hands rubbing against each other.

1444
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,080
That's what it ends up sounding like.

1445
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,080
Right, so you just hear that constantly.

1446
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:55,880
And then this.

1447
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,040
I'll say, just an unsettling little shuffle.

1448
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,280
And then just the worst smell imaginable.

1449
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,120
But you were used to it

1450
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,200
because that's what everyone smelled like.

1451
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,880
Well, no, but just the smell is muffled

1452
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,000
by everyone's nasty hair products and pomade

1453
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,120
and unfiltered lucky strikes.

1454
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,400
So you're saying a meat fart in the 1950

1455
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,320
was a better smell than just what was going on.

1456
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,240
It would be overpowered by everything else.

1457
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,080
Yeah.

1458
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,360
Okay, that makes sense, honestly.

1459
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,000
There were so many other smells going on.

1460
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,800
It wasn't even a big deal.

1461
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,800
And also, I mean, a lot of plastics nowadays still stink.

1462
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,040
Early plastic, first few decades of plastics

1463
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:37,240
probably smelled atrocious.

1464
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,280
Maybe, yeah.

1465
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,120
Interesting.

1466
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,680
Well, but the tobacconist didn't help.

1467
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,960
It's the time more than anything.

1468
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,440
I'm not like, this wasn't perverse, I don't think,

1469
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,520
for Disney to have a tobacco store.

1470
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,040
But it's just weird that now you can't even smoke

1471
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,160
in the parks in any way.

1472
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,000
Right.

1473
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
But at the time, it's cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco.

1474
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,800
You just buy them on Main Street, walk right out,

1475
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,520
and start smoking, probably on the rides.

1476
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,360
On the rides, which is what I've said many times,

1477
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,640
that I don't wanna smoke cigarettes,

1478
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,320
but I will smoke a cigarette on Pirates of the Caribbean

1479
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,240
if I was allowed.

1480
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,080
Oh, yeah.

1481
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,480
Well, I realized a couple times recently,

1482
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,160
I had the thought, like, oh, I have never smoked

1483
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,400
inside a U.S. Disney park, and I guess I never

1484
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,680
will have that option, because it's now a smoking,

1485
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,280
smoking areas outside.

1486
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,800
Yeah, when did they get rid of the inside the park

1487
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,720
smoking areas?

1488
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,240
It was more recent than you'd think.

1489
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,480
I think it was like 2019.

1490
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,120
Because we went with a friend of ours.

1491
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,960
Some article said like.

1492
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,480
In the last decade, and he smoked.

1493
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,280
All right, Disneyland has ceased having indoor smoking

1494
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,920
in the year 2000.

1495
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,920
It's like, oh no, that is much later than you would think.

1496
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,360
Yeah, well, that's when it all changed, I guess.

1497
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,880
Late 90s, too, yeah.

1498
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,720
But yay.

1499
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,360
So out of step, I guess.

1500
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,240
You could get your hair cut and smoke a cigarette

1501
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,440
in Disney World in 2000.

1502
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,720
And if certain products were blown into your hair,

1503
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,440
it would light your hair on fire.

1504
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,280
That's true.

1505
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,080
Yeah, is that blue sanitizing liquid

1506
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,920
that they keep combs in, is that flammable?

1507
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,760
Barbasol?

1508
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,600
Seems possible.

1509
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,240
Isn't there a light alcohol component to that?

1510
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,440
Yeah, I think so.

1511
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,080
No, Barbasol is the shaving cream.

1512
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,280
It is something close to Barbasol, I think.

1513
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,040
Are you sure?

1514
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,880
I think so.

1515
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,360
I mean, Barbasol could also just make that, I don't know.

1516
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,320
Hmm, let me look.

1517
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,080
Barbasol is a thing.

1518
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,120
Everyone here be quiet while I do this.

1519
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:38,960
That's right.

1520
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,800
We'll wait.

1521
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,360
Barbaside. Barbaside.

1522
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,640
Barbaside, that's it. Barbaside.

1523
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,640
Yes, I apologize to the listener.

1524
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,720
Barbaside is blue and yes, alcoholic

1525
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,360
because it's killing germs.

1526
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,960
Here's, there's not a lot of photos of the tobacco store

1527
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,720
and not a ton of information about it.

1528
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,160
But I found a photo from the front door

1529
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,040
and the front door had a little poem on it.

1530
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,920
And just, okay, you'll be able to tell with my voice

1531
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,560
where the text goes from just black italics

1532
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,120
to all caps red.

1533
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,800
I think I'll be able to signal it.

1534
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,920
So this is what, if you want to buy a pipe at Disneyland,

1535
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,440
here's what you read at the door.

1536
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,600
Tobacco is a dirty weed.

1537
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,280
It satisfies no normal need.

1538
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,600
It makes you thin.

1539
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,920
It makes you lean.

1540
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,160
It's the worst darn stuff you've ever seen.

1541
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,280
I like it.

1542
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,200
That's what, look at this.

1543
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,040
Look at this.

1544
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,360
Wait, there's for the listener.

1545
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,880
There's the watcher.

1546
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,280
I like it.

1547
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,760
I like it.

1548
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,640
What is this?

1549
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,760
This wasn't Disneyland.

1550
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,040
Wild thing to put in there.

1551
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,200
This I would buy.

1552
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,360
I would love to own this sign.

1553
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,120
John Stamos probably paid like 200,000 for that.

1554
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:54,960
Yeah.

1555
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,800
Bastard.

1556
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,960
I mean, it's funny to look at nowadays,

1557
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,360
not just because they don't let Nick Fury

1558
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,360
have a big cigar in the Avengers movies

1559
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,880
or the really insane detail of,

1560
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,000
yeah, there's photos in Carthay Circle

1561
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,080
where it just looks like Walt's pointing at stuff

1562
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,120
because they Photoshopped the cigarette out of his hand.

1563
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,240
And let's not forget Krusty the Clown toy

1564
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,920
is not allowed to have a cigarette.

1565
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,520
These things you both have said

1566
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,120
are like five-timers clubs in the last six weeks.

1567
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:26,960
Yes, for sure.

1568
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,360
Well, stay tuned, folks.

1569
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,200
This is the third time for this.

1570
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,160
There's more cigarette content coming.

1571
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,200
That's right, that's right.

1572
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,040
That's true.

1573
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,600
But I think it's weird to look at the tobaccoist

1574
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,840
because I feel like Disney, Main Street,

1575
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,760
they have removed anything that's potentially objectionable.

1576
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,840
Like the candle shop they wouldn't have on Main Street now

1577
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,280
because a child could like,

1578
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,640
can't let the idea of children being by flame.

1579
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,960
So much is so like, well, you can't have that

1580
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,040
because a child could use that

1581
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,960
to stab themselves in the arm.

1582
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,960
Yes, yeah, yeah.

1583
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,280
But this is acknowledging that it's like bad.

1584
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,680
Oh, yeah.

1585
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,520
Like this is basically saying like

1586
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,840
sometimes it's good to be bad.

1587
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,680
Oh, that little poem?

1588
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,520
Yeah, yeah.

1589
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,340
It's saying it's bad,

1590
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,080
but it's also saying smoke them if you got them.

1591
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,640
Yeah, yeah.

1592
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,160
Well, it feels like it's like a mockery

1593
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,880
of somebody who likes poems

1594
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,880
might think this stupid thought.

1595
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,720
Right.

1596
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,000
But me, I say, I like it.

1597
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,840
Isn't it absurd?

1598
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:25,680
I like it.

1599
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,840
Yeah, who wrote it?

1600
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,320
Yeah, no, it's not attributed to anyone.

1601
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,600
Did Walt just compose it one day?

1602
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,200
He started talking like, you there, take a note.

1603
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,880
We're putting this up on the side of the wall

1604
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,720
or is it a fame?

1605
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,200
Maybe it's a famous thing we don't know about.

1606
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,840
Well, I know some of the,

1607
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,360
I think I was saying for, if you got here,

1608
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,680
that they asked for,

1609
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,520
they would say to get businesses to be on Main Street,

1610
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,480
we're gonna build a building, okay?

1611
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,440
We're gonna take care of the decoration of the outside.

1612
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,720
You have to do the inside or we can help you.

1613
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,320
But yeah, who knows if that was

1614
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,120
whoever was running the tobaccoist

1615
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,840
or if that was like Disney's little touch.

1616
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,160
It's outside, so I guess it would be Disney.

1617
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,200
You would think so.

1618
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,040
Yeah.

1619
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,560
You know what else he said before you got here?

1620
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,640
You stink.

1621
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,480
Jason said it.

1622
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,320
Roll the tape back.

1623
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,640
He wouldn't stop saying it.

1624
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,480
Jason said that?

1625
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,040
We have to change the topic.

1626
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,160
Just because he's not here doesn't mean.

1627
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,200
I bet he's gonna come,

1628
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,960
that stinker's gonna come in with a stain on his shirt.

1629
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,360
Because he was eating meat and smoking

1630
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,720
and going back in the car.

1631
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,760
He was smoking.

1632
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,600
He's stressed out so he's just chain smoking

1633
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,000
in the car on the way over here.

1634
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,960
He was pounding his Virginia Slims.

1635
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,960
He was sipping a Nalgene bottle of veal juice.

1636
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,960
He's a stinker and a buckler.

1637
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,440
Let the record show.

1638
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,600
There's a lot of ways to describe me.

1639
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,280
And I accept all of them.

1640
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:54,360
A stinkler, a buckler.

1641
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,120
Put that on a shirt, folks.

1642
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,920
A Clifford, a stinker, a buckler.

1643
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,880
I like it.

1644
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,720
And I like it.

1645
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,760
I'm kind of mentally going from least weird to weird.

1646
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,200
This isn't that weird to me.

1647
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,640
But we've talked about it.

1648
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,120
I feel like, Mike, you've noted the oddity of this,

1649
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,520
that there is a Wurlitzer store.

1650
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,960
It was a piano and organ location.

1651
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,800
Right.

1652
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,360
This doesn't make any sense for Disneyland to have this.

1653
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,920
But it is cool.

1654
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,680
Yes, definitely.

1655
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,120
Well, because that's what I,

1656
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,440
so I was like,

1657
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,280
I was like,

1658
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,040
do you, could you buy a piano at Disneyland?

1659
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,200
And then they gotta load it into your car?

1660
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,800
Like you can, you just see people moving pianos

1661
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,720
down Main Street?

1662
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,560
Yeah.

1663
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,600
But no.

1664
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,440
Yeah, it wasn't,

1665
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,440
because there's no room to hold house,

1666
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,760
like a piano warehouse.

1667
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,800
Yeah, yeah.

1668
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,240
Probably not more than a couple pianos.

1669
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,120
So I just happened to come across this,

1670
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,920
right when we started talking about this episode.

1671
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,840
Twitter user, at MysticFlights,

1672
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,520
who I believe is an artist

1673
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,760
who has worked for Disney Imagineering before,

1674
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,240
posted a postcard of the Wurlitzer store.

1675
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,560
And on the back, it says,

1676
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,680
Wurlitzer, the name that means music in Disneyland,

1677
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,840
proudly represents the entire music industry

1678
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,160
in the fabulous spectacle.

1679
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,080
The Wurlitzer exhibit is located

1680
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,760
on the quarter of Main Street USA and Disneyland.

1681
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,600
And then it says,

1682
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,320
you're cordially invited to visit our store today.

1683
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:32,320
And see here play Wurlitzer pianos from 495 up.

1684
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,480
So they've priced it out, by the way,

1685
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:41,200
with the inflation calculation, $495 in 1955,

1686
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:46,200
is worth $5,398.75 today.

1687
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,320
It's a pricey purchase.

1688
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,360
Yeah, so it's like go to Disneyland and stop in,

1689
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,360
order a Mac Pro and a Retina monitor.

1690
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,120
Well, it's the price of that Star Wars drink

1691
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,800
on the new cruise ship.

1692
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:02,120
Yes, which is like multiple cocktails,

1693
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,080
a shot of Pappy Van Winkle bourbon,

1694
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,600
which is very expensive on its own.

1695
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,440
And a trip to Skywalker Ranch.

1696
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,280
A ticket to get into Skywalker Ranch

1697
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,040
comes with a special $5,000 drink on the Disney Wish.

1698
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,160
Oh, so it's not icy.

1699
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:20,040
A bottle of Lucas Fincher's sparkling wine

1700
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,440
sent to your hotel room.

1701
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,600
So it's more like another trip.

1702
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,800
A free cameo from George Lucas.

1703
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,640
Yeah.

1704
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,360
He'll whisper what his episode seven through nine

1705
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,200
were gonna be.

1706
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,040
That's right.

1707
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,160
All about what the Wills were gonna do.

1708
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,320
Let's talk about the Wills, yeah.

1709
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,880
So, yes.

1710
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,080
There's Wills in this drink.

1711
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,880
It's a shot of Pappy but infused with Wills.

1712
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,560
So they do high ticket, high price items sometimes at Disney.

1713
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,320
What is the most expensive like souvenir

1714
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,560
you can get from Disney right now, I wonder?

1715
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,280
Oh, is it in the vault?

1716
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,320
Maybe it's in the vault.

1717
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,160
It's in the vault.

1718
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:59,520
I mean, there was a bunch of like $500 Marvel statues.

1719
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,360
That's up there.

1720
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,180
That we've looked out before.

1721
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,020
I think that's up there.

1722
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:03,560
It's gonna be something.

1723
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,520
But there's pieces of art in there

1724
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,360
that I'm sure are more expensive and stuff.

1725
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:12,040
Yeah, Giggly Prince, is that the term?

1726
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,360
Oh, G-I-C-L-E-E?

1727
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,200
Yeah.

1728
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,040
Or how do you know how to,

1729
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,320
I don't know how that is pronounced.

1730
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,160
You might be right.

1731
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,000
I don't know how it's pronounced, yeah.

1732
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,320
So yeah, you could get a piano.

1733
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,560
Yeah, I think though it was mainly about,

1734
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,520
in that way that we found with City Walk

1735
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,360
that it's less about they make a lot of money

1736
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,600
at this location.

1737
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,440
To advertise.

1738
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,480
And more about getting the word at, yeah, yeah.

1739
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,560
So I think it was more about,

1740
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,160
I think they would even give you information

1741
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:38,240
about where to get pianos and organs closer to you.

1742
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,160
Right.

1743
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,240
But they also, they did organ concerts every night.

1744
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,920
Like a guy would sit and demonstrate,

1745
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,640
and they'd patch it into all of the Main Street speakers.

1746
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,880
So I didn't know that, that in the early years,

1747
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,600
at five o'clock, there'd be an organ concert of Disneyland.

1748
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,440
Yeah, that's cool.

1749
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,520
Of instrumentals of Disney songs.

1750
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,080
It's competing with the lowering of the flag.

1751
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,440
They're playing taps.

1752
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,920
And someone else is playing an old time rag.

1753
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,960
20 feet away.

1754
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,400
Scott Joplin playing.

1755
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,200
So that, yeah, that was organ music,

1756
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,680
which is much more like a baseball game.

1757
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,640
Yeah, there was a guy who used to play organ

1758
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,960
at Disneyland every day,

1759
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,280
and then he left that to play organ for the Dodgers,

1760
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,120
in fact.

1761
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,960
There you go.

1762
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,360
And then now it's just, now there'll still be a person

1763
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,200
that plays the piano over by the hot dog store.

1764
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,640
Yes, there's that, yeah.

1765
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,720
So you still got a little of that old time feel.

1766
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,400
I just love the hubris of like,

1767
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:39,600
we're like, sir, we represent the entire music industry.

1768
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,600
Sure.

1769
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,640
They made a deal with Walt to be presented that way.

1770
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,560
Well, that's what a lot of these things were about,

1771
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,640
and it's a lot of why these places were there,

1772
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,600
is they were flexes, they were flexes of your business

1773
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,040
and of your Walt relationship.

1774
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:59,320
And due to Walt's friendship with a particular CEO,

1775
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,200
you ended up with a pharmacy in Disneyland,

1776
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,200
the Upajohn Pharmacy.

1777
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,720
Walt and this guy were smoke tree ranch guys together.

1778
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,560
Of course.

1779
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,680
At the famous ranch where they're building Cotino now.

1780
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,520
Of course.

1781
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,880
We all knew about smoke tree ranch

1782
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,520
before a couple months ago.

1783
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,360
No, smoke tree ranch's still going.

1784
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,760
Cotino is inspired by the league.

1785
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,920
It's not the same place.

1786
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1787
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,200
He liked the Palm Desert in general.

1788
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,560
Can we become smoke tree ranch guys

1789
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,840
if it's still around?

1790
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,560
Or is that like a rich person's club?

1791
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,880
I think it is a rich person.

1792
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,960
I think there are vacation rentals or stuff.

1793
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,640
Yeah, I don't think it's the most,

1794
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,440
I don't remember the nature of the property.

1795
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,320
But to become smoke tree ranch guys,

1796
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,960
do we have to have a membership

1797
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,920
or can we just go there once and call ourselves that?

1798
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,320
We should look into that.

1799
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,160
Look into it.

1800
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,560
We'll hang at smoke tree ranch.

1801
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,640
Yeah.

1802
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,200
In an episode on location.

1803
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,920
So this place, the Upjohn Pharmacy,

1804
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,920
this is one, I was probably initially glossing this over

1805
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,360
as like, that doesn't seem like anything,

1806
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,400
but Jason, we found the same thing.

1807
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:14,440
This place is weird.

1808
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:18,600
So much detail, there's so much on,

1809
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,000
specifically there's one mouse planet article

1810
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,960
called the story of the Upjohn Pharmacy at Disneyland.

1811
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And it is so detailed both because people still had

1812
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,800
the pamphlets they would give out.

1813
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,360
And there's also like the internal Upjohn newsletters,

1814
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,360
like reproduced, which sounds like,

1815
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,000
it doesn't sound like a human being really.

1816
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,760
So like, we are not in the entertainment business.

1817
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,960
As you know, we are in the pharmacy business.

1818
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,960
But this is a chance of solid,

1819
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,920
interesting advertising opportunities.

1820
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,880
And it's like, all right,

1821
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,320
don't have too much fun there, buddy.

1822
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,080
You want a pharmacy copy to be fun.

1823
01:11:59,080 --> 01:11:59,920
Yeah.

1824
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,040
Pills, pills, pills.

1825
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,440
Get them now.

1826
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,480
Hey, they literally say at some point,

1827
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,200
it's like, I know this may seem weird.

1828
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,520
This might be totes random, but

1829
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,400
we're gonna do a pharmacy and a theme park.

1830
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,160
This was like, but the main feature of it

1831
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,480
was that it was a turn of the century,

1832
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,160
a recreation of a turn of the century pharmacy

1833
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,160
with old turn of the century stuff.

1834
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,640
So you got to see old syringes.

1835
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,280
Yes. Yay.

1836
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,520
It was like, it was kind of like,

1837
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,720
it's a wonderful life pharmacy thing.

1838
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,160
Remember he's like delivering the medicine or something.

1839
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,200
Yeah, he delivers medicine and then

1840
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,280
the pharmacist like smacks his pad here.

1841
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,120
Oh yeah, that's right.

1842
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,040
The pharmacist hits him in the head

1843
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,240
and it's a wonderful life.

1844
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,080
So I don't think that would happen.

1845
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,120
Bailey is like, you filled those capsules with poison.

1846
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:54,960
Right.

1847
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,800
I know you didn't mean it.

1848
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,600
Oh, because the pharmacist is losing his mind.

1849
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,640
Well, yeah, because he's drunk himself into a stupor

1850
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,800
because his son died.

1851
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,880
Yes, that's right.

1852
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,480
Jason knows this movie very well.

1853
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,320
I do know.

1854
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,280
Then what happens?

1855
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,320
Well, in the alternate universe

1856
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,200
where George Bailey is not born,

1857
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,160
he's not there to stop the pharmacist

1858
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,600
from poisoning a child with pills.

1859
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,440
Yes, that's right.

1860
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,880
We were living in it's a wonderful life

1861
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,400
for a minute of what if Mike was never born?

1862
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,240
I know.

1863
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,040
If Mike wasn't on the show.

1864
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,440
And thank God it was short

1865
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,520
because what a nightmare.

1866
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,720
What a nightmare for somebody.

1867
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,280
There wouldn't have been that tangent about it.

1868
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,640
It's a wonderful life if I wasn't here.

1869
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,080
Can you imagine?

1870
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:35,920
I can't.

1871
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,680
Imagine your life without that.

1872
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,720
So yeah, picture of an old timey pharmacy,

1873
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,360
which again, I kind of wish they had it there

1874
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,800
and that was just the candy store or something.

1875
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1876
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,080
I wish at least it was themed after it.

1877
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:49,920
Yeah, yeah.

1878
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,000
Right, where there was old time medicine

1879
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,600
but it was just a Gobstopper.

1880
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,800
It seems like a lot of emphasis on mortar and pestles.

1881
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,920
Which are cool.

1882
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,800
Which are cool.

1883
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,040
Also a jar of live leeches.

1884
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,480
Yeah, we got a photo of that.

1885
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,520
Can Brett through there?

1886
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,840
Brett, bring up that leeches photo.

1887
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:11,440
Pull up the leeches please.

1888
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:15,960
Yeah, this is a really creepy situation.

1889
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,160
This is scarier than anything in Disneyland.

1890
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,480
Now this was not a real pharmacy.

1891
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,320
No.

1892
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,160
The bank was a real bank.

1893
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,480
This was not a real pharmacy.

1894
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,280
Oh, here we go.

1895
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,120
There they are.

1896
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,440
Yeah, there's a girl just staring in horror

1897
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,760
at leeches that are very long.

1898
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,360
These are three inchers, three inch guy.

1899
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,560
They were bred on leech farms.

1900
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,640
Like these medicinal leeches were bred

1901
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,320
to be good at medical stuff.

1902
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,800
Right, they were trained.

1903
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,640
Yeah, yeah, they like whispered at them,

1904
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,600
suck out bad stuff, not good.

1905
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:54,080
Don't just make people bleed and that's it.

1906
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,280
Yeah, oh yeah.

1907
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,520
They definitely didn't stop using leeches for a reason.

1908
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:05,440
Yeah, were leeches happening so much in this era?

1909
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,280
I feel like no.

1910
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,280
If we're saying this is turn of the century.

1911
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,320
I feel like this is a fun thing they're using here.

1912
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,280
Because I think they're touching on,

1913
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,360
before pharmacies there were apothecaries.

1914
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,800
And I think if you go back far enough,

1915
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,000
you get to like, oh no,

1916
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,680
leeches can take out the bad blood.

1917
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,640
Right, but this wasn't happening

1918
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,680
as much in the 50s and 60s.

1919
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,160
No.

1920
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,960
I think the, well not 50s and 60s certainly,

1921
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,960
but if we're like tributing turn of the century.

1922
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,800
Right, like mainstream timeline.

1923
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,040
What I saw is that maybe,

1924
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,280
like they were around a little

1925
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,160
and that you'd find them at bars and barber shops

1926
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,280
to treat black eyes.

1927
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,480
So got punched in the face,

1928
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,440
put a scary black worm under your eye.

1929
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,800
Would it just suck the blood out

1930
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,480
so it would not look as bruised?

1931
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,000
I think that's the idea.

1932
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,840
That's right, some dentistry.

1933
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,800
You used to go to the barber to get your hair cut,

1934
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,360
a shave and get some bad teeth pulled.

1935
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,280
Whoa, that's wild.

1936
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,120
Buy a leech.

1937
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,760
All right, leeches gonna start,

1938
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,400
leeches gonna yank this tooth out.

1939
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,960
Also how often are you getting a black eye as an adult?

1940
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,800
Well in the turn of the century probably a lot.

1941
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,120
I guess probably a lot, yeah.

1942
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,400
Rough and tumble time.

1943
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,840
Bullies everywhere.

1944
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,160
You hit a wrong note in your barbershop quartet

1945
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,000
and they gang up on you, that's three against one.

1946
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Blue-dos, Popeye's, blue-dos everywhere.

1947
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,720
Hey, I'm ready to, I gotta kiss ya.

1948
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,320
I'm gonna take you out and give you a suck ya one.

1949
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,480
I'm gonna suck ya one.

1950
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,760
They're just mumbling constantly

1951
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,880
and you gotta stay away from them.

1952
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,280
Yeah, and that guy was the secretary of state.

1953
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,200
Yeah, for many years.

1954
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,680
Again, not a real pharmacy

1955
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,680
but did employ two real pharmacists

1956
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:48,240
whose names are Frederick August Esteem

1957
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,760
and Philip Milton Harvey.

1958
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,480
So they could answer your questions.

1959
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,000
They would dress in, they were wearing

1960
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,840
the period appropriate attire.

1961
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,560
They would talk to guests

1962
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,960
and they would talk about the exhibits.

1963
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,040
Great, so you watch Leo Wagman waves at you

1964
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,760
from an old banker desk and Frederick August

1965
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:12,480
tells you how they used to grind up Sassafras.

1966
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,240
I wonder, is there enough room in there for a real pharmacy?

1967
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,760
Probably not, because you gotta get a lot of different,

1968
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,040
I mean, I guess around that time,

1969
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,240
I don't know how many different drugs they had

1970
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,960
just being used in America.

1971
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,960
They're limited, so be like a,

1972
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,440
it maybe fit in more of the hotel,

1973
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,320
where it's not a hotel store, it's like a little,

1974
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,960
it's like one shelf of necessities.

1975
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,960
So yeah, now you can basically just like,

1976
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,920
you can buy Tylenol on a leave and stuff, right?

1977
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,240
Yeah, you can get those,

1978
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:49,840
yeah, you can buy those at a lot of the shops.

1979
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,760
You can also just go to First Aid

1980
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,400
and they'll give you most of them for free.

1981
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,240
Oh, load up.

1982
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,080
Good tip.

1983
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,440
Yeah, that's their way, that's your Disney Land bargain.

1984
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,400
Save yourself some money, folks.

1985
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,920
You bring a little duffel bag and just say,

1986
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,440
I have 15 children with headaches.

1987
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,520
And then just open the bag

1988
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,160
and then the doctor will dump it in.

1989
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,680
Don't do it if you're a buckler.

1990
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,520
But don't do it, yeah,

1991
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,520
because you'll start crying in a minute,

1992
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,600
you don't have 15. Do it for me.

1993
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,920
I'm too cheap for a leave.

1994
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,920
My only choice was to pay $120 to come to Disneyland.

1995
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,960
My 15 kids don't have headaches.

1996
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,080
They're fine.

1997
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,120
They're fine.

1998
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,160
They're thriving, okay?

1999
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,560
Especially the quintuplets.

2000
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,680
They're queer. Both sets.

2001
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,800
Clear headed and fine.

2002
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,400
I think I told this story on the trip report

2003
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,320
when I went to Disneyland last fall.

2004
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,160
You five timer.

2005
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,560
A five timer.

2006
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,960
But it was still very funny to witness someone

2007
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,120
who had a very specific ailment

2008
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,760
and knew exactly what they needed come into First Aid.

2009
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,920
I think I was just in there getting an ice pack

2010
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,280
and they went, excuse me,

2011
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,160
I just rode the Millennium Falcon and my,

2012
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,320
I have a stomach ache.

2013
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,160
Do you have Dremamine?

2014
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,920
They're like, eh, we have a generic version.

2015
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,120
Here you go.

2016
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,200
So that was funny?

2017
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,040
I don't know.

2018
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,120
They were just so, they were just so,

2019
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,520
good day, madam.

2020
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,680
Do you have Dremamine?

2021
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:15,040
I have just ridden the Millennium Falcon Smuggler's Run.

2022
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,000
You're saying they knew exactly what it was.

2023
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:17,840
They didn't have any,

2024
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,000
they weren't like me when I went in there

2025
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,480
and I was like, there's something in my eye

2026
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,600
and I needed help and they were like,

2027
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,240
I don't know what to do.

2028
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,520
Yeah, I wasn't sure,

2029
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,360
I think I was just not sure if Disney First Aid,

2030
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,880
if it was like the school nurse

2031
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,800
where you really had to sell

2032
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,960
that you needed a single Tylenol,

2033
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,640
like please, I have a headache.

2034
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,560
I just need one Tylenol

2035
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,640
and they would act like they were giving you

2036
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,840
like a Xanax or something.

2037
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:44,840
They would act like they were giving you

2038
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,400
a controlled substance.

2039
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,680
I only went to the nurse once.

2040
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:48,520
Did we talk about this?

2041
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,340
Are you serious?

2042
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:50,320
In all of school years?

2043
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,160
Once.

2044
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,120
I went like once a month when I was in elementary school.

2045
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:53,960
Oh really, you were a nurse?

2046
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,800
I was a nervous guy.

2047
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,640
You were a nurse kid.

2048
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,560
I was puking.

2049
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,320
I was always seemingly dehydrated.

2050
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,760
I didn't know you were a nurse kid.

2051
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,240
I was a nurse kid.

2052
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,080
Because there were kids.

2053
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:05,920
Nurses' pet.

2054
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,560
Yeah, there were kids who would always go to the nurse.

2055
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,240
And sometimes they would just be like,

2056
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,440
the solution was like, go in here

2057
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,880
and lie down for 20 minutes.

2058
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,720
Wow.

2059
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,680
On that paper bed.

2060
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,360
On the paper bed, yeah.

2061
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,560
I came in there because somebody scratched my eye

2062
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,920
in gym class and the nurse couldn't tell

2063
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,080
what was wrong with it.

2064
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,000
But she called my mom and she was like,

2065
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,640
he says something's wrong with his eye.

2066
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:30,680
I don't really see it.

2067
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,040
But I think it's probably real

2068
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,200
because I've never seen him in here before.

2069
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,000
Like he's never come into the office

2070
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,840
so I believe he is not lying.

2071
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,920
Because she would see liars constantly.

2072
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,280
Because kids are lying all day.

2073
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,600
Jason was probably doing it when he was a kid.

2074
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,720
Oh, we all tell a little white lies.

2075
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:50,120
That's much respect to the guy who heisted that restaurant.

2076
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:53,200
Yeah, you can just lie your way through things.

2077
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,960
If he had been a little better at lying,

2078
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,200
he could have gotten away with it.

2079
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,040
Yeah.

2080
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:00,880
10 grand from his job.

2081
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,440
So that was the only time I ever went to the nurse once.

2082
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,440
Hey, we were jumping in the pool

2083
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,400
in a kid's little red shorts.

2084
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,040
Their scratchy little red shorts.

2085
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:17,280
I was saying I got a lower half injury.

2086
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,880
Michael has a testicular trisian

2087
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,880
due to his little red shorts.

2088
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,320
No, no, no, it was that a kid's,

2089
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:29,200
the bottom of his shorts went against your eye.

2090
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,360
Oh, yeah.

2091
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,720
That was high school with the little red shorts.

2092
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,840
I did not wear little red shorts in elementary school.

2093
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:36,680
Even though it would have been cute.

2094
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,120
Ballistic, great nylon shorts.

2095
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,240
I wasn't old enough to wear little red shorts.

2096
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,440
I wanted, look, if I could have worn Mickey's

2097
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,120
little red shorts when I was in elementary school,

2098
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,440
I would have.

2099
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,600
But it was not an option presented to me.

2100
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,080
Yeah.

2101
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,000
Scott, do you have what they gave away

2102
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,400
at the Upchon Pharmacy?

2103
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,640
Yeah.

2104
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:57,160
So, well, if you have a more official description.

2105
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,080
I have a very, very detailed description

2106
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,760
from Mouse Planet again.

2107
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,640
The shop gave away free postcards,

2108
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,280
as well as a free square miniature glass bottle

2109
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,000
of orange colored unicap vitamins.

2110
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,200
Inside a red box, a white silhouette

2111
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:18,360
of the Disneyland Castle logo containing a description,

2112
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,080
a descriptive pamphlet stating,

2113
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:24,800
a souvenir of Disneyland Upchon with a history of Upchon.

2114
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,000
The bottle was one and a half inches tall

2115
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,560
and contained 12 vitamins with an expiration date.

2116
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,200
Yes, I love it.

2117
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,480
Give me more hyper detailed descriptions

2118
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,440
of the tiny free vitamin bottle in a box.

2119
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:42,040
So how, okay, how big was the bottle?

2120
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,040
How many vitamins were in it?

2121
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,400
How big was the box that held the bottle?

2122
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,240
Right.

2123
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,000
So it was the degree of.

2124
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,840
Specificity.

2125
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,680
Yes, that our listeners,

2126
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,360
I struggled to get to the word specificity.

2127
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,200
My language has no specificity.

2128
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,000
You were becoming so bored by what you were talking about.

2129
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,520
You just trailed off.

2130
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,880
Little bottles of vitamin of box of.

2131
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,840
Is there a Jim Hale about vitamins?

2132
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,040
Is there anybody, is anybody like,

2133
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,200
is Kevin Perger done a big Disneyland vitamins.

2134
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,040
An Upchon episode.

2135
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,240
Yeah, Upchon episode.

2136
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,840
I wanna know, were there kids who would dare each other?

2137
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,000
Like, do you guys know about the TikTok trend,

2138
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,160
gentle minions?

2139
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,000
Yes, indeed.

2140
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,320
Where like just tons of teens will go see

2141
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,320
the new minions movie in suits and be rowdy.

2142
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,720
I don't know this actually.

2143
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:29,560
Where they are.

2144
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,040
Aren't they like, I think they're very like, yeah, yeah.

2145
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,080
I've seen footage of them all watching it very intently

2146
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,720
with their arms up in this sort of.

2147
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:38,880
I think it's a mix.

2148
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,280
I think some are rowdy and I think some are, who knows?

2149
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,280
But we're there, I'm saying we're there kids

2150
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,320
who would go to Upchon, get the free bottle of vitamins.

2151
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,480
Like, I dare you to take all those vitamins.

2152
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,720
I think that being a little stinker

2153
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,800
was not invented until the 1960s.

2154
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,640
Oh.

2155
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,440
Like no child had ever misbehaved until,

2156
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,760
it was Dennis the Menace really helped kick the idea.

2157
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,720
Just the idea, it was invented by perverse Hollywood writers.

2158
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,280
Oh man, Jordan Peterson's right.

2159
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:12,080
And that is when everything went off.

2160
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,440
The world gets you Dennis the Menace.

2161
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,360
It will get you Menace too.

2162
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,360
The rowdy antics of Dennis the Menace

2163
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,560
destroyed this America.

2164
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,280
Dennis is lost.

2165
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,240
He doesn't, he's looking for meaning.

2166
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:29,360
He's crying out and society is ignoring him.

2167
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,600
That's why he has to have the little slingshot

2168
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,240
poking out of his back pocket.

2169
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:36,920
We're all Mr. Wilson, aren't we?

2170
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:41,080
Aren't we all trying to get the rowdy boy to behave?

2171
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:44,240
Isn't this what we all feel?

2172
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,200
You won't cancel me.

2173
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,440
What would Walter Mathau say if he was still with us?

2174
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:54,160
Even Don Rickles in the sequel, the director of the sequel.

2175
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,120
Playing Mr. Wilson.

2176
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:01,360
I was confused by it, but now I understand.

2177
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,800
Wow, that's a pretty solid, like.

2178
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,680
Rickles is Mr. Wilson from Mathau to Rickles.

2179
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,400
Well I think Mathau to Rickles, that's pretty good.

2180
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,680
Yeah, Rickles acting career, interesting.

2181
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,760
Yeah, you're right in terms of prominence

2182
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,840
and interesting person, but yeah, I guess,

2183
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,120
it's an acting trade down.

2184
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,920
Yes, 100%.

2185
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,320
Oh yeah, and I'm sure that was the only shift in quality

2186
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,760
in the Dennis to Menace sequel,

2187
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,000
which started very, high bar by the way,

2188
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,720
the Dennis to Menace Walter Mathau movie.

2189
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,560
Dennis to Menace?

2190
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,400
Of a great film.

2191
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,320
Are you calling it Dennis to Menace?

2192
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,800
I didn't, but that's a good idea.

2193
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,640
That's what I thought I heard.

2194
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,000
I don't know.

2195
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,160
Did I accidentally say Dennis to Menace?

2196
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,000
Maybe not.

2197
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,960
It should have been that.

2198
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,280
Well, that's maybe too, you already had Menace to society,

2199
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,040
so two and Menace have already been in a title together.

2200
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,960
That's right, Dennis is a Menace to society.

2201
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,480
Dennis is a Menace, I'll tell you what, two, society.

2202
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,720
I'll get you.

2203
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:03,960
So weird play, they also, they had a weird,

2204
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,360
the movie that's slightly less weird than The Leeches

2205
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,600
is that they had something called asafoetida gum,

2206
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,440
which is a type of root or spice,

2207
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,160
or something that comes from a root or something,

2208
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,160
and the nickname for it is Devil's Dung.

2209
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,040
Folks would wear it in a little sack around their necks

2210
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,880
to ward off diseases.

2211
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:28,240
So go to Disneyland, go see the bank teller,

2212
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:32,200
go check out the Devil's Dung, try some strained veal.

2213
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:35,240
It's at this point, here's maybe a broader question

2214
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,160
with this topic that I wanted to bring up,

2215
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,240
that's what your main street is.

2216
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,280
Your main street is leeches and Devil's Dung,

2217
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:47,320
and your dad makes a deposit at the bank,

2218
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:52,320
and there was a lock store, they had a history of locks,

2219
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:57,160
you could see a lock from ancient Egypt.

2220
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,000
So you do all that, and then you go,

2221
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,600
and that's just your opening act, to then go to a park

2222
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:07,600
which has an unthemed hill and mules that kick

2223
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:12,320
and bite you and piss, and a cloth dumbo

2224
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,000
with eyes as black as death.

2225
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,720
Mickey and Minnie with holes in their face.

2226
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,800
Yes, with grates.

2227
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:23,680
Grates, four grates going down their lower part

2228
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,880
of their head, yes.

2229
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:30,880
I think what I'm getting at is, how did it make it?

2230
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,680
In this first year, and I don't even mean that,

2231
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,960
because I always said there was fun stuff

2232
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,800
at Disneyland even to begin with,

2233
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,680
but then there was all this, and what was it

2234
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:43,680
in that first year that got them through?

2235
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:47,240
Because everything we have listed is either boring

2236
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,880
or insane, and then a lot of the rest of the park

2237
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,080
was that too, what do you think the takeaway,

2238
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,840
when you came back from early Disneyland,

2239
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,040
what was like, and then they had this, a castle?

2240
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,520
I bet the castle and the Fantasyland rides,

2241
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,800
and I bet those went a long way.

2242
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,440
Oh yeah, Jungle Cruise was almost what it was,

2243
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,200
because that was roughly the same,

2244
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,840
just with less animation and the figures,

2245
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,760
and the trees hadn't grown out yet.

2246
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,560
But that's pretty, yeah, in 1955,

2247
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,240
that's pretty crazy and immersive.

2248
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,440
Yeah, and that's kitschy and fun.

2249
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,720
No jokes yet though, don't forget.

2250
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,560
No jokes, serious.

2251
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,560
We're just saying serious facts about tigers.

2252
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,520
Yes, very serious.

2253
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,320
So I bet it's that, I do think probably

2254
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,640
having it be turn of the century Main Street

2255
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:39,640
felt novel to people and reminded them of their childhood,

2256
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,840
or some of them, depending where they lived.

2257
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,440
So that was a nice nostalgia hit for them.

2258
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,440
I mean, I guess, look, I'm somebody who goes

2259
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,720
to the saddest malls I can find,

2260
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:53,720
because they feel like 1983, so that's roughly,

2261
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:59,400
that's like a 50s person trying to visit a weird town

2262
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,400
from 1902.

2263
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,880
Well, it's like me when I drove through the Taco Bell

2264
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,280
a couple weeks ago, near where I live,

2265
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,760
and I was like, oh, they repainted it,

2266
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,040
and it's the 90s purple.

2267
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:13,080
Like they're using 90s purple on a lot of Taco Bells again,

2268
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,040
which is very exciting.

2269
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,040
It still doesn't look like the same

2270
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,560
as 90s Taco Bell inside, but it made me feel good

2271
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,400
seeing 90s purple on the outside of the building.

2272
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,480
That does sound nice.

2273
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,320
Yeah.

2274
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:24,800
I love Taco Bell.

2275
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,640
Yeah, it's fun.

2276
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:28,560
Yeah, it's like the preserved Burger King

2277
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,040
that was going around Twitter.

2278
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,200
Oh yeah, they uncovered the Burger King.

2279
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,560
From the Concord Mall in Wilmington, Delaware,

2280
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:37,760
which I used to go to all the time,

2281
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,680
and I was like, yeah, I recognize that Burger King.

2282
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,720
I recognize that Burger King.

2283
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:43,560
Like.

2284
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,600
It was just like sealed up, and they never.

2285
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,440
Sealed up?

2286
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,280
Yes.

2287
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,760
It's a woman posted, she's like,

2288
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:52,560
I worked at that mall one summer,

2289
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,720
and this was our overflow store room,

2290
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,520
and there were just boxes and boxes

2291
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,880
among the booths and stuff.

2292
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,080
It reminded me of when the turtles

2293
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:02,200
find that untouched subway station in Secret of the Ooze.

2294
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,120
And make it their home?

2295
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:03,960
And they make it their home

2296
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,600
because it's been abandoned, no one knows it's there.

2297
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,920
Yeah, so they just found.

2298
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,240
Oh, oh yeah.

2299
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,080
Perfectly preserved.

2300
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:09,920
Yes, yes, yes.

2301
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,960
Like I was like, I think I was sitting there

2302
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:15,280
after Toy Story, I think we bought extra toys.

2303
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,720
A little toy, whatever.

2304
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,760
For Toy Story. Google it.

2305
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,520
Yeah, yeah, oh boy, oh I will.

2306
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,360
So.

2307
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,400
I'll try to find like a VR helmet

2308
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,640
that'll let me just wrap myself in those.

2309
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,000
So yeah, so if we were imagining what,

2310
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,800
like the version for us, if there was a new theme park

2311
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:37,000
and Main Street looked like just a mundane mall

2312
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,720
that we went to when we were little,

2313
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:42,400
with like a retro Burger King, a retro McDonald, like.

2314
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,240
Yeah.

2315
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:44,080
If a.

2316
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:44,900
Like.

2317
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:45,840
No, it's an old circuit city.

2318
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,680
Babbage's, what is that?

2319
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,520
Oh, Babbage's, yeah.

2320
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:50,120
The old electronics store.

2321
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:50,960
I don't know if Babbage's.

2322
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,120
Babbage's and electronics boutique.

2323
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,320
Electronics boutique.

2324
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,680
An old hot topic.

2325
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,920
An Aladdin's Palace arcade.

2326
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,840
Oh, Aladdin's Palace, fantastic.

2327
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,000
Yeah, so if it was like all of that,

2328
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,440
I'm going back every weekend.

2329
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,280
Yeah, yeah.

2330
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,560
If it's like that hardcore.

2331
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,720
They have, they have a Mervins, wait for it, California.

2332
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:13,600
A Mervins California, who would care about a Mervins, but.

2333
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,360
So yeah, cause like even our parents who like Disneyland,

2334
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,720
that's still, like they didn't live

2335
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:20,520
during the time of Main Street.

2336
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,280
They're maybe fascinated by.

2337
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,400
And yeah, so I think, you know,

2338
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,560
when you were going in the 50s,

2339
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,480
there was a much higher percentage of people

2340
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:33,040
that had lived through the time period it was representing.

2341
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:33,880
Yeah, yeah.

2342
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:34,720
For sure.

2343
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:38,360
And it's like the most like clean, idealized version of it.

2344
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:41,080
Yes, there's no problems there.

2345
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:44,840
Well, and also, all right, so in asking that question,

2346
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,400
what were the hits?

2347
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,600
What were getting people to leave Disneyland

2348
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,240
and talk about Disneyland?

2349
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,000
I think that brings us to the big dog.

2350
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,800
I was wondering like, oh, are we wrapping up?

2351
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,640
No, no, no.

2352
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,480
Are we just building up this?

2353
01:31:58,480 --> 01:31:59,320
No, no, no, no, no.

2354
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,160
Is this its own?

2355
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,000
No, no, no.

2356
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,840
Is the wizard?

2357
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,640
Look, it should be its own, but it will do it here.

2358
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,480
It should be its own.

2359
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,320
We'll do it here.

2360
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,160
Let's do it.

2361
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:08,920
If we can, if we can contain ourselves.

2362
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,440
We're gonna get really nervous.

2363
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,360
And that is, okay, we're gonna buckle.

2364
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,880
We're gonna buckle even talking about it.

2365
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,200
Well, we'll ease ourselves in

2366
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,160
because we're talking about a store

2367
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:20,160
called the Intimate Apparel Shop.

2368
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:23,480
It's not the Intimate Apparel Shop contain,

2369
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:26,200
but the incredible, the immortal,

2370
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,400
the wonderful Wizard of Braz.

2371
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,400
Is there a way to turn these studio lights red?

2372
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,240
Oh.

2373
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,800
Turn up the heat on us in here?

2374
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,400
The table red is a red table talk.

2375
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,240
We're getting real.

2376
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,960
We're getting real about bras.

2377
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,920
So yeah, Disneyland had a bra store.

2378
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,800
I mean, what it said, okay, so outside of the store says,

2379
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:53,680
if you can pull it up, the outside,

2380
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,680
there's like people standing on the steps or something.

2381
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,960
And the, well, here we go.

2382
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,880
There's, well, there's the wizard.

2383
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,920
There's the wizard, C.V. Wood in front of him,

2384
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,840
an early, important figure in early Disneyland,

2385
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:12,840
who I later went on to other projects outside of Disney.

2386
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,440
And I have heard described alternately

2387
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:19,680
as an interesting character and kind of a con man.

2388
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,920
But I haven't really dug into.

2389
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,760
Yeah, me neither.

2390
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:23,600
Yeah, I need to learn the show.

2391
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,440
Oh, that, yeah.

2392
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,680
Yeah, that's a good tease.

2393
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:27,840
We'll figure out what's up with C.V. Wood.

2394
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,440
But okay, so this exhibit was sponsored

2395
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:36,440
by the Hollywood Maxwell Bra Company.

2396
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,440
And they had the tagline, the Wizard of Braz.

2397
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,620
The viewers can see that here.

2398
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,320
Included, and with this odd piece of art,

2399
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,400
where we are looking at two women,

2400
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,440
one is in a bra and one is in,

2401
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:53,700
the outside of the store says,

2402
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:57,120
"'Torsolette,' a word I have never heard in my life."

2403
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,160
I guess that is a corset.

2404
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,000
I believe that's what I would think it is.

2405
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,680
That's an old-timey way.

2406
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:04,480
But a lovely torsolette.

2407
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:08,120
And these, it's very bridal.

2408
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:11,840
It says, the bride chooses bras for beauty's sake.

2409
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,000
The whisper wardrobe, lavished in lace,

2410
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,680
wooing a wide world of fashion with straps to,

2411
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:19,500
blah, blah, blah.

2412
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:22,720
But anyway, the headline of what we're looking at right now

2413
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:26,280
is these two women kind of demure and looking down

2414
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:29,600
and changing into their beautiful torsolettes.

2415
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,120
But then there's a fucking creep behind him.

2416
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:36,600
Look out, one of the it follows creatures is behind you.

2417
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,040
There is a murderer.

2418
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,680
Pressed against foggy glass?

2419
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,960
I don't know exactly.

2420
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:49,360
It looks sort of like Eric Idle making a goofy face.

2421
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,680
Big wide eyes.

2422
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,560
And is that the Wizard of Bras?

2423
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,400
Is this the Wizard of Bras?

2424
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,800
Yes, that's the Wizard of Bras.

2425
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:58,560
There's the Yesterland posts on this

2426
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,520
have a little illustration of him.

2427
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,960
It's not much better.

2428
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:06,800
He's like a weird little, not quite a jester.

2429
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,240
Yeah, he's like Zoltar.

2430
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,080
He's like a dude.

2431
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:11,920
There you go.

2432
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,800
He's like a little Zoltar-y.

2433
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,520
He's a little like the person in the medieval movie

2434
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,440
who it's like, oh, they're a total liar.

2435
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,160
They're snake oil salesmen.

2436
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:24,520
And they're trying to weasel their way into becoming king.

2437
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:29,040
I wouldn't trust this man to sell you a brassiere.

2438
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:29,880
Yeah.

2439
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,080
Creepy attitude.

2440
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:36,840
I mean, if anything, he should be selling neck doilies,

2441
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,320
whatever the hell those are called.

2442
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,160
Yeah.

2443
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:41,160
You know, what Shakespeare wore.

2444
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,480
What are neck, I mean, is it neck doilies?

2445
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,000
Why not?

2446
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:45,840
Oh, I know that thing.

2447
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,320
Yeah, you know those puffy's that people wore

2448
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,040
because they were dumb in old dumb times.

2449
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,720
That is a very good question.

2450
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:55,040
But then what's he holding in this picture?

2451
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,120
Is it a key?

2452
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,480
Is it a leech?

2453
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,720
Is he trying to make these women have leeches?

2454
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,000
Is it like, you're not beautiful enough.

2455
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,640
Let the leech suck more beauty.

2456
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,400
Suck the ugly out of you.

2457
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,720
I will remain young forever.

2458
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,360
Well, in the illustrated one,

2459
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:15,680
he has a, like, it looks like he's holding a needle.

2460
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,960
Like a weird little.

2461
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:17,800
A needle.

2462
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:18,800
Like stringing it through his ears.

2463
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,640
Yeah, I don't know what this.

2464
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:20,480
What's he doing?

2465
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,840
Oh yeah, he's pulling a needle through his ears.

2466
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:23,680
Why?

2467
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,520
It's like an old circus trick.

2468
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,360
What are you doing, wizard of bronze?

2469
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,000
Does one of the torso let,

2470
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,760
does it like unlock like some sort of chastity belt?

2471
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,800
Maybe from the back?

2472
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,240
And he's like, I've locked you in.

2473
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:36,040
A knot will unlock until your wedding night.

2474
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,000
Your groom's in for a nasty surprise.

2475
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,840
Certainly I have the key.

2476
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:46,600
I will be there at all your important moments.

2477
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,080
I am the wizard.

2478
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,600
He's really a great Disney villain.

2479
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,280
He should be up there with a Chernobog, quite frankly.

2480
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:56,080
He's one of, yeah, he is a scary,

2481
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,040
I mean, yeah, they should be using him in Phantasmac.

2482
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:58,880
Why not?

2483
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,800
We should have seen the wizard of bronze fight Mickey.

2484
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:02,640
He's in Phantasmac.

2485
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:05,960
An evil champion of women's chastity.

2486
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:06,800
Yeah.

2487
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:08,960
He's really strange.

2488
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,400
Nick, can we go back to that other photo

2489
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,000
where he's on the steps?

2490
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,320
There's some stuff to analyze here.

2491
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:19,320
So I guess this is the same guy,

2492
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,840
but now he's got like a big cartoon head.

2493
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,160
And oh, there's the needle.

2494
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,920
Okay, we're doing some sleuthing here.

2495
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,840
He's holding that same needle.

2496
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:27,680
So that's an important.

2497
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:31,400
Yeah, and of course there's Hernan J. Norris.

2498
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,240
Herndan.

2499
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,080
Herndan.

2500
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:33,920
Herndan.

2501
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:34,760
Herndan.

2502
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:35,600
J. Norris.

2503
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:39,440
And they're both staring at a bug going by.

2504
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:40,280
I don't know what they're doing.

2505
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,960
President of the Hollywood Maxwell Brazier Company.

2506
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,280
Also should be noted,

2507
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:47,760
the designer at the Hollywood Maxwell's company

2508
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:51,600
who would often go to Paris fashion shows and stuff

2509
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,880
was named Theo Devo.

2510
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,240
Wow, yeah, that's a cool name.

2511
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,440
Ooh, neat.

2512
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:59,400
I mean, without a picture of the wizard of bronze

2513
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,040
putting the needle through his head,

2514
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:04,960
I think it's like it's a knitting needle, right?

2515
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,440
I guess so.

2516
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,280
He's sewing the torso in.

2517
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,120
Yeah.

2518
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:09,040
Right, but I mean it would help

2519
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,400
if it was some string attached to it

2520
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,080
and there were like two knitting needles,

2521
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,960
but I assume that's what's going on.

2522
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,080
Now we're getting to a more fun territory

2523
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:19,000
with the full picture of this character

2524
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,240
because he's like wearing fish nets, right?

2525
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,760
So that's fun.

2526
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,040
He's wearing the products.

2527
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,200
Like stockings?

2528
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,040
Yeah.

2529
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:28,880
Yeah.

2530
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,400
Is this the same character as the character

2531
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,680
from the other picture though?

2532
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:33,120
Yeah, I think this,

2533
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:35,480
well, this looks like a walk around one,

2534
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:38,200
but there was like a mechanized one, right?

2535
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,920
I think we're looking at the mechanized one.

2536
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,080
We are looking at.

2537
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:43,920
I don't know because it's the best photo that exists.

2538
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:44,760
Yeah.

2539
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:45,600
Of that.

2540
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,440
And by the way, just in your question, Michael,

2541
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,280
who is the real wizard of bras?

2542
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,160
I also saw one that's just like a cone

2543
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,400
and who's just like a little cute cartoon guy.

2544
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:57,640
He's a cute, like a left breast of a bra?

2545
01:38:58,640 --> 01:38:59,560
I wouldn't say that.

2546
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:03,640
Even though this company did sell the 50s pointy bras,

2547
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,680
I wouldn't say that because he was longer

2548
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:07,640
than those would probably be.

2549
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:08,760
He was just a cone.

2550
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,480
He looked like a big wizard's hat,

2551
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,600
but then the top part of him

2552
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,440
was his own little wizard's hat.

2553
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,200
Okay, so it wasn't like a Madonna cone bra.

2554
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,320
I don't think he was one breast of a cone bra, no.

2555
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,880
So there's a lot of ways to represent,

2556
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,200
like Mickey, there's a lot of different wizards of bras.

2557
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,400
Yeah.

2558
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:31,480
Now, while this picture is up for people viewing this,

2559
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:36,120
that man on the right who's looking at an ant infestation,

2560
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:37,640
the one in the darkest suit,

2561
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:41,040
he is the voice of the wizard of bras.

2562
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,680
So I don't know this for sure,

2563
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:45,960
but my best guess is that there was a mechanized figure

2564
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,520
that looks like, or that it is,

2565
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:53,520
this stocking-clad vizier, whatever you want to say he is.

2566
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,440
Who would tell you about the history

2567
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,160
of underwear and intimate apparel?

2568
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,000
Mm-hmm.

2569
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,640
And with this guy's voice,

2570
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,480
which you can only imagine is like,

2571
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:07,040
I don't wear bras, like how else is he gonna sound?

2572
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:11,400
And a couple things here.

2573
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,800
First of all, there's info about this

2574
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:16,200
on the Ripley's Believe It or Not website.

2575
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:18,140
Because then, by the way, wizard bras is one of these things,

2576
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:19,680
if there's ever a list of the weirdest things

2577
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,280
ever at Disneyland, wizard bras is in there, definitely.

2578
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:23,200
It's not number one.

2579
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:25,480
So you see it a lot, but still not a lot of info

2580
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:26,960
to pull from it.

2581
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,840
But it was enough that Ripley's Believe It or Not

2582
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:31,000
talked about it, and they called the little show

2583
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,200
that you watched an underwear history lesson.

2584
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,040
Ha ha!

2585
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,280
And let's see.

2586
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,840
So there was a couple bits to this.

2587
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:45,840
It was a store where you could buy bras and torsillettes.

2588
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,580
So you could do that.

2589
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:51,720
But there was also a demonstration aspect to it.

2590
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:55,400
One bit seems to be that you would look into

2591
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,680
3D illusion boxes, and you would turn your head

2592
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:03,280
in the illusion box, or one of those pens you would get

2593
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,880
that makes ladies clothes disappear.

2594
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:05,720
Of course.

2595
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:09,120
So you would look one way, and it was a woman fully clothed.

2596
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,320
And then you'd look another way,

2597
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:13,800
and she was just in a corset and pantaloons.

2598
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:14,640
Okay.

2599
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,880
So it was a place in early Disneyland,

2600
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,480
an opening day Disneyland, where you put your head

2601
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,320
in a box and watched a woman undress.

2602
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,160
It was a peep show.

2603
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:22,600
It was a little peep show.

2604
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,040
It was a little peep show.

2605
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:24,880
There you go.

2606
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,680
And you'd think they'd lean into,

2607
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:30,840
and this stuff is utilitarian, and society's opinions

2608
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:33,520
have changed on it from here to there, and that's it.

2609
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,200
But they are a little bawdy about it all.

2610
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,160
They are a little bawdy.

2611
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,600
And Jason's getting emotional and upset about it.

2612
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,400
I don't understand.

2613
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:46,720
How could they, they're grooming.

2614
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,000
It's grooming.

2615
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,920
It seems like there were some interviews,

2616
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,120
websites would note it, that they would talk to people

2617
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,960
who worked there, talk to cast members at the time,

2618
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:01,600
and they'd be like, okay, yeah, the parents and the kids

2619
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,520
didn't really care.

2620
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,680
The grandmothers would giggle, and the older,

2621
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:11,840
the grandpas would be scandalized that this was here.

2622
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,200
And I guess that's just a side, that's progress for you.

2623
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:17,000
That seems to be the...

2624
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,600
Grandpas were scandalized?

2625
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,160
They were like, I'm so upset with this.

2626
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,600
They weren't upset, they were just like,

2627
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,320
oh, I can't be in here, I have to get out of here.

2628
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:28,040
Well, you're discussing, you're describing passages

2629
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:32,160
from a Disney-produced article from an internal newspaper

2630
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,720
called Disneyland News with the headline,

2631
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:39,440
If Hubby is Shy, Watch Him at Main Street Corset Shop.

2632
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,480
Hubby is so shy.

2633
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:44,240
Hubby is shy in the corsetaria.

2634
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:48,640
It's just a weird article in general,

2635
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,880
but it's the older generation of men

2636
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,120
who are the most polite.

2637
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:57,560
They invariably remove their hats upon entering the store.

2638
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:02,080
Oh, there's pantaloons nearby, I best remove my hat.

2639
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,560
I mean, people would remove their hat

2640
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:05,880
anytime they went in anywhere.

2641
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,840
That's old, for people's favorite thing to enforce,

2642
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:11,040
is hats on or hats off.

2643
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,920
And they loved getting apoplectic at like,

2644
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,800
the guy hasn't taken his hat off in this diner,

2645
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,440
in this 24-hour diner.

2646
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:22,720
Meals ruined, birthdays ruined, any occasion destroyed

2647
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,960
because a guy like 100 feet away had a hat on.

2648
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:30,160
If you could have monitored everyone's blood pressure

2649
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,480
as they walked in there,

2650
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:33,880
I bet it would have jumped 30 points.

2651
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:37,400
I need to calm down, I need to go get some tobacco,

2652
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:39,400
three doors up. Some baby veal.

2653
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:40,720
Yeah.

2654
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:43,480
I need to calm down with some baby veal.

2655
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:46,200
You can't eat baby veal in the store,

2656
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,720
you're spilling it on the torsolettes.

2657
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:51,080
It is crazy, I mean, I'm sure people have said this,

2658
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:54,760
and maybe we've like, Walt famously didn't want

2659
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:57,680
Annette Funicello to wear a two-piece bathing suit

2660
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:00,360
because she would show her mid-drift in movies.

2661
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:03,960
But he had a bra store where you could see,

2662
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:06,640
I mean, maybe they weren't showing their belly.

2663
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:08,000
He was upset with the belly.

2664
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,880
You put your head in a box,

2665
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:13,360
he would have happily had Annette wear whatever,

2666
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,320
but you have to have a special box to view it.

2667
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:19,840
But if it's a room open to anyone,

2668
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,600
and a grandpa or a hubby might walk in and be scandalized.

2669
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:27,160
Was it some sort of a box that would protect you from Jesus?

2670
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,160
Like Jesus is scorned?

2671
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:32,800
Like how Magneto has a helmet to protect him

2672
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,200
from Professor X?

2673
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,480
So if you put yourself in this box

2674
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:39,680
that would protect you from religious or God's scorn,

2675
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:43,080
you could gawk at a woman's bare belly.

2676
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:44,400
Yeah, I think so.

2677
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:48,760
Well, you can make Jesus sort of magically appear

2678
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:51,040
in items when you want to.

2679
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,360
So yes, by virtue of that,

2680
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,320
you could make him disappear from a box.

2681
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,760
So Walt could have like a priest like bless a box,

2682
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:00,760
a reverse blessing or something,

2683
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:04,560
or have like a church of Satan guy bless the box

2684
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,920
to prevent Jesus from getting into the box.

2685
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:09,040
So whatever hubby does in that box,

2686
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,040
Jesus doesn't find out about.

2687
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:12,240
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

2688
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,760
We're opening in three days.

2689
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,640
We haven't had the Church of Satan

2690
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:18,640
chase Jesus out of the boxes yet out of the bra box.

2691
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:21,480
Now, I don't go for you, you characters a lot of the time,

2692
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:23,840
but there's one thing I need you to do.

2693
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,880
You're good at chasing Christ away.

2694
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:29,440
Protect hubbies when they're getting a peek.

2695
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:33,520
We don't want Jesus here in the bra store.

2696
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,960
So please put us put a first put a spell on them

2697
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:39,760
to ensure that their hats get removed.

2698
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:42,760
Because if they don't, their hats are going to fly off.

2699
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,280
It's going to blow off their heads.

2700
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:45,480
Steam will come out their ears.

2701
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:48,960
We need a satanic draft in the entrance of the store.

2702
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,000
And he'll blow hats back then.

2703
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:57,000
Yeah, so this is stuff Walt had to deal with.

2704
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,880
He apparently was against having this store.

2705
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:01,360
He did not want this to be here,

2706
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,240
but he had to flesh out the street.

2707
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,800
There had to be things in the street.

2708
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,240
Sure, he was against it.

2709
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:07,680
He's the guy in charge.

2710
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:08,840
Hollywood is the story.

2711
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:11,160
Hollywood makeup even Max Factor,

2712
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,680
the actual Max Factor, told him to fuck off.

2713
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,160
And it's like, OK, guess we can't have a makeup shop.

2714
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:21,280
What else do mom, grandma, and little Sally like?

2715
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,080
Pantaloons.

2716
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,080
I don't know, underwear.

2717
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:27,080
They need dresses and underwear.

2718
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:28,560
Laces, toilets.

2719
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,560
Undergarments.

2720
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:31,000
They smoke cigarettes.

2721
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,680
Oh, fuck, we already have that.

2722
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:36,200
Women in the park should smoke cigarettes

2723
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,280
with little bits of lace at the end.

2724
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,280
The cigsigalettes.

2725
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:44,880
Fire again at Disneyland due to the lace cigarette trend.

2726
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,880
Like, there should have been...

2727
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,880
There were other things he could have done.

2728
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:52,880
If you really like pudding, like pudding works.

2729
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,880
Someone's like a pudding store on Main Street.

2730
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,880
They didn't have to put this here.

2731
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:00,880
He was pretending he didn't want this here.

2732
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,880
Second candy store.

2733
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:03,880
Sure.

2734
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:04,880
Or so to fowl.

2735
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,880
You know what, between the carnation and the candy,

2736
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:10,880
the carnation ice cream and the pharmacy,

2737
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:14,880
there wasn't, I'm sure there was regular fountain soda,

2738
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,880
but there wasn't an old timey, you know, sarsaparilla soda.

2739
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:22,880
I still think pudding works is a good choice.

2740
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,880
If they had just a full-time pudding radio,

2741
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,880
a good Disneyland pudding place.

2742
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,880
J.L. Pudding's pudding works or something.

2743
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:33,880
There are a couple pudding places in Los Angeles.

2744
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:34,880
Really?

2745
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:35,880
I think, yeah.

2746
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:36,880
Where, do you know?

2747
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,880
Santa Monica?

2748
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:38,880
I don't know.

2749
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,880
Is it like hipster pudding?

2750
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:44,880
I think it's like, yeah, it's like a paper version of pudding.

2751
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,880
So you load it with toppings and stuff.

2752
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,880
Yeah.

2753
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:49,880
Interesting.

2754
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,880
High-end Silver Lake hipster pudding.

2755
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:52,880
Yeah.

2756
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,880
You heard it.

2757
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:54,880
I did not know about this, Trevor.

2758
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:55,880
We gotta go.

2759
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:59,880
The thing that's like $2 at the grocery store, guess what?

2760
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,880
They found a way to make it $10.

2761
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:04,880
Man, I wonder, is there like a Mike Gambusa of pudding?

2762
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:05,880
Or is that maybe you?

2763
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:07,880
Could be, yeah, yeah, the door's open.

2764
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:08,880
Yeah.

2765
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,880
J.M. Sheridan's pudding works.

2766
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,880
J.M. Sheridan's trifle world.

2767
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:15,880
Puddins and trifles.

2768
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:17,880
The Wizard of Trifles.

2769
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:21,880
Before we wind it down, there's a clip that we have,

2770
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:25,880
if we could play that, because there's no audio of the,

2771
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:28,880
what then the Wizard of Braz did,

2772
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:31,880
which is very upsetting that we can't look at that character

2773
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:34,880
and then know how Gruff and William Frawley is.

2774
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:35,880
Yes.

2775
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,880
But what if there was some even weirder audio

2776
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,880
that people cannot seem to find,

2777
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:43,880
or it seems like the most I found was,

2778
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:46,880
this may have been at a print-on-demand kiosks.

2779
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,880
This was possibly part of when they did,

2780
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,880
I guess, the 50th anniversary or around then,

2781
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,880
you could burn a CD.

2782
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:57,880
You could pick what tracks you wanted on a CD and burn it,

2783
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:59,880
and this might have been one of them.

2784
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:01,880
Which could have been like a song from a ride

2785
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:03,880
or it's Groom Grinning Ghost or something,

2786
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:06,880
but then it could also be this odd 90-second snippet

2787
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,880
of the Wizard of Braz show.

2788
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:12,880
So this isn't the wizard, let's be clear.

2789
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,880
She's setting up the wizard.

2790
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,880
So I don't remember a lot of what this is,

2791
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:19,880
but let's just experience it together.

2792
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,880
Look in the mirror and see the story of fashion.

2793
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,880
Like all stories, it has two sides,

2794
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,880
but since fashion is a lady,

2795
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:31,880
the world can only know half of it.

2796
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:34,880
The truth is that even in Granny's day,

2797
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,880
being a doll required a lot of pull.

2798
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,880
Those 90s were supposed to be gay,

2799
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,880
but it took a lot of work to be stylish,

2800
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:48,880
and most of it was undercover, as this makes clear.

2801
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,880
Needless to say, Granny's secrets were well hidden.

2802
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,880
Why, she turned green with envy if she could see the lift

2803
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:59,880
today's girl gets from our low-cut Viet.

2804
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:04,880
I want you to pause between every third word.

2805
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,880
Cheeky pauses.

2806
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:09,880
Then for a change of mood,

2807
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:13,880
there's the new and intoxicating pink champagne

2808
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:16,880
that lends its own sweet shape to you.

2809
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:21,880
You see, modern girls have so many fashions to choose from,

2810
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:23,880
it takes a wizard to keep them in shape.

2811
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:28,880
That's why Hollywood Maxwell designs a bra for every fashion.

2812
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:31,880
To see them all, just ask at your favorite store

2813
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:35,880
for Hollywood Maxwell, the Wizard of Bras.

2814
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,880
My favorite store?

2815
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:39,880
Favorite store, yeah.

2816
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:42,880
My favorite store is Fry's Electronics.

2817
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,880
I don't think I could ask them for Hollywood Maxwell bras.

2818
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,880
I went into the Woolworths and said,

2819
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:50,880
do you have Hollywood Maxwell's bras?

2820
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,880
And they're like, no.

2821
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:57,880
One thing that's striking me from that is that music.

2822
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:59,880
I was going to say the music is so...

2823
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:01,880
Vrooom.

2824
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,880
Doot doot doot doot doot doot.

2825
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,880
Vrooom.

2826
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:09,880
That's still used as lazy comedy music in certain movies.

2827
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,880
Yeah.

2828
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:13,880
You're like, oh god, the comedy music.

2829
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:15,880
Yeah, good old sneak around.

2830
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,880
Sneak around music, yeah, it is sneak around music,

2831
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,880
but it is trying to lighten the mood.

2832
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:23,880
It's trying to lighten the mood of this like, dolekit.

2833
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:25,880
It's uncomfortable.

2834
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:28,880
Well, the hijinks that, you know, like,

2835
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,880
Steve Martin might get into,

2836
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:35,880
try to get his way at the wedding and father of the bride.

2837
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:37,880
Yes.

2838
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:41,880
But in this case, it's the hijinks of a woman

2839
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:46,880
hiding her... giving herself some pull for hubby.

2840
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:53,880
A woman, but you can only know how a woman is this.

2841
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:55,880
Just clothes, I don't know.

2842
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:59,880
Humans are so fucked, like, it starts to close.

2843
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,880
Come on.

2844
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:03,880
I mean, I'm not saying like when I was younger

2845
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:05,880
and you'd like walk into a Victoria's Secret,

2846
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,880
I wouldn't be like, what am I?

2847
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:09,880
I can't look at anything.

2848
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:13,880
Like, I was like that, but like, this is society I live in.

2849
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:15,880
This is the society.

2850
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:17,880
What do you need to do, ladies?

2851
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:22,880
Spend an hour and a half getting little hooks and pulleys

2852
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,880
to jam around your body,

2853
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:27,880
make you very uncomfortable all day

2854
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:32,880
so that you can sort of look like you are half a pound lighter.

2855
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,880
I wonder if Hollywood Exile had the reputation

2856
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:38,880
that I have heard women talk about Victoria's Secret,

2857
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,880
go like, it fucking sucks.

2858
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,880
Like, none of the sizes are correct.

2859
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,880
They don't measure you right.

2860
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,880
Like, an actual apparel, like, women's apparel store,

2861
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,880
actual, like, bra shop, they're like,

2862
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:52,880
you've been wearing the wrong size bra for two decades.

2863
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,880
You're saying like, teen mall employees that work there

2864
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,880
might not be measuring people correctly?

2865
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:59,880
Yeah, it might not be totally correct, yeah.

2866
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:03,880
Well, the Hollywood Maxwell bras from these pictures,

2867
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:05,880
if I'm gathering things correctly,

2868
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:07,880
they were the perfect size and shape

2869
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:10,880
for women's pyramid-shaped breasts,

2870
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:14,880
which I assume that they had until the year 1959 or so,

2871
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,880
until they evolved to be less pointy.

2872
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:19,880
Until the 60s when they started burning bras.

2873
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:21,880
Like, they were burning...

2874
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:23,880
They started over as the Great Revolution.

2875
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:25,880
We had to reinvent what they were even like.

2876
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:26,880
Yeah, yeah.

2877
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:29,880
What a strange place and show.

2878
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,880
Oh, but here, just before we wrap up,

2879
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,880
one thing that's interesting about this,

2880
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:36,880
this odd, creepy show with that V.O.

2881
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,880
Oh, buh-buh-buh, and I don't know.

2882
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,880
And then whatever the wizard sounded like.

2883
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,880
And I don't know what the wizard did,

2884
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,880
but he at least probably like turned

2885
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,880
or shook around violently.

2886
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:50,880
But he was mechanized.

2887
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,880
And keep in mind, in 1955,

2888
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:55,880
there were not mechanized characters at Disneyland.

2889
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:58,880
Lincoln was almost a decade to go,

2890
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,880
no Enchantiqui room.

2891
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,880
So it's possible, possible that technically

2892
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:06,880
the first audio animatronic was the Wizard of Bras.

2893
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:07,880
Wow.

2894
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:08,880
Yeah.

2895
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:09,880
That's pretty wild.

2896
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:11,880
Again, don't know what he did.

2897
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:16,880
Probably just like his ears steamed.

2898
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:17,880
Yeah.

2899
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:20,880
At the mere thought of like a, you know,

2900
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,880
of a half inch of skin revealing itself.

2901
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:27,880
If he rotated, it made the sound of like an ax being sharpened.

2902
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:30,880
Like, it was just horrifying.

2903
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,880
He sparked, he would spark.

2904
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:36,880
Again, if those sparks tumbled into the barber shop,

2905
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:38,880
into the barberside.

2906
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,880
He's the first ever robot that could get horny.

2907
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:43,880
That's what we're trying to say.

2908
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:44,880
He's the first.

2909
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,880
Now we have many robots like that,

2910
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,880
but back then that was very rare.

2911
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,880
Yeah, look, and if you played that like tinkling little music,

2912
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:54,880
you were allowed to be a little horny.

2913
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:57,880
Disneyland could have a little horny as a treat

2914
01:54:57,880 --> 01:54:59,880
if you had that.

2915
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:01,880
Because it would make it comfortable.

2916
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:04,880
Without the soundtrack, it would go right to hell.

2917
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,880
Society would fall apart.

2918
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:11,880
But unless you play the Mickey and Goofy sneaking around the haunted house music.

2919
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:13,880
Walt came into Matching Ring one day and he goes,

2920
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,880
here's what I need you to do.

2921
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:18,880
We need to make a robot who's a little horny.

2922
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:19,880
Not a lot.

2923
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:20,880
A little horny.

2924
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:21,880
Can we do it?

2925
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:22,880
All right, see you later.

2926
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,880
And he walked out and he went to see Hazel George

2927
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,880
and get his polo injury worked on.

2928
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:28,880
His laugh in place.

2929
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:29,880
Yeah, yeah.

2930
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:31,880
Okay, ladies, that's the presentation.

2931
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:35,880
Now all eyes on the wizard who's about to get hard.

2932
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:40,880
What a wall person.

2933
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:41,880
I said a little.

2934
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:43,880
I didn't say anything about an erection.

2935
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:45,880
I'll allow a 20 degree angle.

2936
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:47,880
He can go 20 degrees up, not a full 90.

2937
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:48,880
Not a full one.

2938
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:50,880
No full 90s, not on my watch.

2939
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:53,880
If I say a 90, we're shutting the store down.

2940
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:54,880
Roy comes in.

2941
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,880
He's like, this is too expensive to give a robot a boner.

2942
01:55:57,880 --> 01:55:59,880
Walt, we're going broke here.

2943
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,880
The Bank of America won't allow this.

2944
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,880
I'll ask him for 50 grand more.

2945
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:05,880
No problem.

2946
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:06,880
Here's what I'll do.

2947
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:07,880
I'll stage a robbery.

2948
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:17,880
All fake robbing the bank so we can pay for this wizard robot boner.

2949
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:22,880
If the chicken of the sea people can cut the amount of tuna used on sandwiches in half,

2950
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,880
we'll save ourselves a bundle.

2951
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:27,880
Have a scoop, fellas.

2952
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:33,880
We got rusty robotic erections to pay for.

2953
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:39,880
Well, I think that's a little window into what Main Street was like back in the early.

2954
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,880
It was exactly like that.

2955
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:46,880
And if you manage to not get sparks in your eyes that flew off of the Wizard of Braz,

2956
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:49,880
you could have yourself a pretty nifty day.

2957
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,880
You survived Podcast The Ride.

2958
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:58,880
And thank you for putting up with an episode that did not have full host content,

2959
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:01,880
much like a chicken of the sea sandwich.

2960
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:08,880
It was thin on host for a little bit, but I hope it was an assumptuous meal anyway.

2961
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:13,880
I want to apologize to everyone for my little secrets.

2962
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:20,880
I will be on all the episodes going forward unless other little secrets get in the way.

2963
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,880
Little secrets, sorry.

2964
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,880
Little secrets.

2965
