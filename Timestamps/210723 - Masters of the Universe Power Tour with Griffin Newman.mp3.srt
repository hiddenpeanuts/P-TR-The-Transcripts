1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,800
Warning, the following podcast contains a limited use sword, lazy toy name creation,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,200
a confusing circus, and an arena show that's 5% action and 95% religious service.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,960
Griffin Newman returns to talk the Masters of the Universe power tour on today's podcast,

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,720
The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,800
Welcome to our universe podcast, The Ride universe.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,240
It's podcast The Ride everybody.

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,200
I'm Scott Gardner joined back in the Zoomiverse by Jason Sheridan.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
That's right.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Thank you.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
Oh yeah, well we're going to get into that.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,520
I mean, why not just get that off, right?

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,520
You know, the audience might not know that song yet, but you will and you'll love it.

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,600
It'll rise to the top of your personal charts.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Mike Carlson, hello.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Hi, I'm here.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,760
Yes, I was watching our topic today and I was thinking we need actually some sort of

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,520
pledge of allegiance to our podcast that we need to develop.

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,920
And I don't want to do it right now because we have a lot to get to, but I just want to

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,360
put that in the air that we need to figure something out to make sure that all the Cliffords

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,800
out there pledge their allegiance to us.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
We need to do that.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:38,600
So anyway, not enough nationalism in comedy podcast, podcast nationalism is that the name

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
for it?

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
It's just proud.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
I'm just proud.

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
You know, I guess I'm just proud.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,480
You know, podcast the lism.

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,760
Is that is that?

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,480
No, that's not good.

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,240
Does this imply that they can only listen to our podcast or that they just have to like

33
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,520
always listen to it?

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Like that's unfair.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
It depends.

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
I don't know.

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
It depends how we write the song, honestly.

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
How we write the pledge.

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
All right.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,800
Well, it also just that if you can only listen to our podcast, then that cuts out people

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,240
like our guests with their own podcasts.

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,240
And I would hate to because because look, we're everybody's supposed to get along unless

43
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,040
we start getting more militaristic about this.

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,160
Choose a side, I say.

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Come on.

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,360
OK, but until the anthem is in place, then you are welcome to podcast hop.

47
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
You could listen to a blank check.

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,040
A great podcast that our guest today comes from.

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,480
Well, here, let me say this.

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,720
That today's topic is the Masters of the Universe Power Tour, which was the live

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,960
touring theatrical spectacle that's that supported He-Man and She-Ra in 1987.

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,000
Sort of they're coming out of our shells tour, which is how our guests today

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,200
presented it. And our guest is the voice of Orko on the new series Masters of the

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,480
Universe Revelation, which premieres on Netflix today.

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,480
As you are listening to this, it is accidental PTR legend Griffin Newman.

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,400
Hi. Hello. Hello. Accidental PTR legend.

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,120
Still my greatest credit.

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,560
I always ask to be introduced that way on other podcasts and they refuse.

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,960
I do want to say right off the bat, Scott, we've been we've been emailing back and

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,040
forth for some months now.

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,440
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,400
Some delays. Yeah, I've had some correspondence with with Jason and Mike over

63
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,280
the pandemic as well for different subjects or different issues.

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,920
What was the thing, Jason, that you were asking me to weigh in on in real time

65
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,520
during a recording? Oh, oh, it was Shrek shaped fun nuggets with swamp pudding.

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,160
Right, right. It was the Shrek fucking meal, which is revolting.

67
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,880
And then Mike and I, of course, messaged back and forth about our struggles to

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,400
successfully preorder action figures, but also looking into the numbers of how

69
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,520
much it would cost for us to produce a run of toys based on our respective

70
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,880
podcast. Oh, you're in that game as well.

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,520
Oh, my God. I mean, Mike's doing the heavy lifting, but I'm constantly sort of

72
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,880
trying to compare notes with him. Yeah, I think it's doable.

73
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,840
I do think it's doable.

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,520
And probably next year, I think maybe we could shoot for some motivation.

75
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,800
Yeah, I have a thought, a possible lead that I want to bring up with you after

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,760
we're finished recording.

77
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,840
So I'll just I'll leave that dangling thread here.

78
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,480
But but Scott, you and I have messaged back and forth mostly about what matters.

79
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,200
Podcast the ride, the most important thing in the world.

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
That's a pledge of allegiance.

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,920
Yes. And I don't remember if you emailed about something else or I emailed first

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,960
because of this, but the chain quickly became me sort of saying, look, I really

83
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,760
feel like I let down podcast the ride listeners in 2020.

84
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,320
And I know it was a hard year.

85
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,640
Oh, I know it was a hard year for all of us.

86
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,240
I know why I was not up to the challenge.

87
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,600
You know, I went through my struggles and what have you.

88
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,600
Well, I don't know. But you're on the show.

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,640
You were on the show behind the paywall.

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,920
Is that what feels weird?

91
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,080
It was just feels weird.

92
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,400
Because there's that thing where the listeners did their vote on best episode

93
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,640
and best this and best that.

94
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,600
And I got voted best guest.

95
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
And I only did one episode.

96
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,240
I only did one appearance, whereas the previous year I did three appearances in one year.

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,440
I only did one appearance in 2020 and it was a paywall only.

98
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,720
I know it was a long episode.

99
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,400
I know it broke the record and made Jason break out into flop sweat.

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,160
But I remember I needed to urinate so badly.

101
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,560
We we might have to plan on a break in this.

102
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,680
Absolutely. We have to be smarter this time.

103
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,000
But I just felt like I didn't do enough.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,240
And I would see certain episodes and topics come up and go,

105
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,240
maybe I should have thrown my hat in the ring for that.

106
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,800
Maybe I should be suggesting more.

107
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Maybe I should this. Maybe I should that.

108
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,320
I felt bad about it.

109
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,240
So I reached out to you and I said, I want to put three things on the book.

110
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,520
I want to commit to coming back.

111
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,560
Twenty twenty one main feed and second gate with a vengeance.

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,400
And the first one, I don't know if we want to spoil stuff,

113
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,320
but there was a ride that had been talked about derisively on the show.

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,280
And you guys had said, we'll probably never do an episode on that.

115
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,560
And I emailed you and I said, I would like to do that episode.

116
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,560
Can we put that on the books?

117
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,320
The second thing, which I do want to announce here. Yes.

118
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,920
I said Muppet Haunted Mansion, that's mine.

119
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,360
Very good. OK, people are going to be really happy about that.

120
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,120
I feel like I need to tease that the ride we can keep secret for now.

121
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,720
Wait, it's a ride talked about derisively.

122
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,920
I is it not to me and I don't think I would have did we or did others?

123
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,840
I've been listening to the show on on a big delay

124
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,000
in the pandemic.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,760
I got way behind all my podcasts.

126
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,520
And so I've been that I feel like also to you, Scott,

127
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,240
I've been that annoying fan who like emails you about things

128
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,640
you said nine months ago that you no longer remember.

129
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,960
I made a joke about how are your two sons doing?

130
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,920
And you said, I only have one son.

131
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,200
And I said, what do you mean?

132
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,360
Eight months ago, you made a joke about Rex being your first son.

133
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,440
How could you not immediately recall that?

134
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, I thought it was a reference to two hours ago.

135
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,680
Yeah, yeah, I thought it was it was phrased such that it was like a

136
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,320
that he's like not a baby anymore, that some so much time has flown.

137
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,960
I was like, OK, that must be what it is.

138
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,200
Yeah, I think, yeah, we have dropped the Rex as my son thread.

139
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,600
Look, I thoroughly I didn't learn the joke.

140
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
And this is what I'm talking about.

141
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,000
I've been letting everyone down as a podcast.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,280
The right legend. The emails have been sloppy.

143
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
Too few appearances.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,280
No bathroom breaks in the Fallon episode.

145
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,880
These are all problems that I want to rectify.

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,880
But in an episode I was listening to, I think that is what caused me

147
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,680
to email you in the first place.

148
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,040
You guys were like, we'll probably never do an episode on that.

149
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,680
You kind of shrugged at this ride and said, like,

150
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,840
we never have to do an episode on that.

151
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,960
Wait a minute. Are we talking about the right thing?

152
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm confused, by the way. I'm confused.

153
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,000
Wait, can we just say what it is and then cut it?

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,760
Say what it is? Yeah, yeah, we will believe what it is.

155
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,120
Wait, of course we would do an episode.

156
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,320
What do you mean?

157
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,120
Wait, you have a zoom background that's fighting.

158
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,880
It's getting blurred. It's getting blurred out.

159
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,120
It's still a secret.

160
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,160
I'm trying to in the zoom background.

161
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,400
We all that's that's the thing we all think we're talking about.

162
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,640
Yeah, of course we would do an episode on that.

163
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,560
What are you talking about?

164
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,680
When did we say that? Who was derisive on it?

165
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,640
Was it one of us?

166
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,800
I'm telling you, there's an episode where the three of you say

167
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,080
we never have to do an episode.

168
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,920
No, it can't be.

169
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,440
There's got to be confusion there.

170
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,040
I'm going to ask the listeners to go back and find it.

171
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,240
But that's what motivated me to send the email in the first place.

172
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,800
Were you watching a different podcast?

173
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,000
Were you listening to Jim and Len and like Len said that ride sucks?

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,240
The bumper car boys.

175
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,600
Yeah, they'd hate that.

176
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Bumper car boys would hate it.

177
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,160
I'm telling you, I just know that's why I sent the email because I was like,

178
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,560
concerned about it.

179
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,200
You're sort of like, maybe we don't maybe we don't ever do an episode on it.

180
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,920
Is it not necessary?

181
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,040
I truly cannot imagine.

182
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,440
Was it a bit were we being was our bit not clear?

183
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,880
It was the pandemic. We were all losing our minds.

184
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,080
The point is.

185
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,720
Yeah, I can't.

186
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
But now it's pandemic two and we feel so much better

187
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,840
because we've had practice.

188
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,240
We're all pros at this.

189
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
At this point, we know how to handle it.

190
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,680
But yes, but then things shifted around.

191
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,080
I was having health problems.

192
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,280
You had a job, Scott.

193
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,400
And I said, like, the third thing I'd like to do is when the He-Man show is coming out,

194
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,120
do you guys know that there was a He-Man equivalent coming out of our shells tour?

195
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,520
And it feels like it's right in your guys wheelhouse.

196
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,360
And so absolutely.

197
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,400
And I you guys, Mike and Jason, tell me your thoughts on this.

198
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,280
I I had never heard of this.

199
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
I didn't know this existed.

200
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,920
You brought a totally new thing, at least to my attention.

201
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,120
I I I may have found out about it like a month before we put this on the books.

202
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,840
I was not this is not something I've lived with for very long.

203
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,240
I feel like some account that we probably both follow, Mike,

204
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,760
one random day started tweeting out a bunch of photos from like the the playbill.

205
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,880
Like the big full color photos of the costumes.

206
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,080
Like I remember they were circulating around Twitter around the time.

207
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,200
Yes. Message Scott, which had sort of activated my mind like, oh, this

208
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,160
this might be a PTR subject.

209
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,040
Yeah. Do you think it was one of our toy accounts, one of our toy Twitter accounts?

210
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,760
I think it was. I think it was a preternia or something.

211
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,800
Perturnia, Toy Bro, I was going to say Pixel Dan.

212
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,920
Did he tweet about it?

213
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,960
Look, I think Pixel Dan might have retweeted it,

214
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,800
but I think if Pixel Dan was the one uploading the photos, I would have remembered.

215
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,000
And I don't say that as any slight to preternia or Toy Bro.

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,120
But I think of Pixel Dan as the preeminent sort of like

217
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,840
Motu, obscura scholar.

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,440
You know, I agree.

219
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,360
Wasn't it was impossible to that?

220
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,800
Possible. Yeah, it was possible.

221
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,280
Pete Scott, that is not funny.

222
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,480
Yeah, not funny.

223
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
All right. It's not.

224
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,920
I know. When it's regular, when it's theme park stuff,

225
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,640
I could do it. This I got to know when I'm not wanted.

226
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,640
Would be very upset to hear you just wantonly making up fake toy YouTuber names.

227
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,720
Mike just muted his zoom window and threw a folding chair like Bobby Knight.

228
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,400
How do I do a podcast with this guy?

229
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,280
I don't get that. I don't get that reference, Jason.

230
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,040
I did. I get the name wrong.

231
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,200
The coach. No, no, I did. I'm saying I'm a toy guy.

232
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,240
I don't know. You're a toy guy. Oh, I see.

233
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,440
Yeah. I call it sports.

234
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,240
I think I saw.

235
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,200
Yeah, something like what you guys are saying, like it was tweeted or like

236
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,120
he man collage of stuff of like different like, oh, remember him?

237
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,280
Like a nostalgia account and like showed a quick flash of like this show.

238
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,080
My my he man.

239
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,160
I was very into he man as I was learning object permanence.

240
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,280
Like I caught the tail end in the late 80s.

241
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,640
I caught the tail end.

242
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,520
My real passion for he man, I believe, was the

243
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,200
reboot that was called The New Adventures of He-Man, which was noticeable

244
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,400
because he wolf wore full pants.

245
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,200
And I had this toy sword, which was great.

246
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,560
But I just can I can I read, Jason, your notes?

247
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,560
You just shared your notes so you could show the picture of the sword you had

248
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,920
and your notes for our 1990 show.

249
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,080
It was awesome.

250
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,160
This was the one where he man wore it.

251
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,200
Yes. And then I saw this plastic sword on the ground.

252
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,840
And I specifically owned I specifically owned this sword.

253
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,960
So I'm looking for it.

254
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
I didn't share it. It wasn't a co-op thing.

255
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,720
Could we publish your notes for Patreon subscribers?

256
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,120
No, but they're all they're all like me writing out thoughts I've had.

257
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,960
Like it's it's it's. Yeah.

258
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,080
Really? Yeah.

259
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,480
Very good. The formatting is funny.

260
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,280
The formatting is insane because sometimes they use dashes, sometimes they use

261
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,800
nothing, sometimes they use the Apple Notes bubble.

262
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,760
I have like five gigabytes in Apple Notes of just mostly notes for the show.

263
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,800
Will you allow me to have access to those and pick out the ones I think that are

264
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,280
the best? Absolutely not.

265
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,160
No, these have to be they have to be public record.

266
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,080
We know the people are given the pledge and at this point they owe.

267
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,600
They should be able to peruse the Jason Sheridan Library.

268
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,080
I agree. For the right price, for the right.

269
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,720
Well, now we're talking.

270
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,280
We will we will certainly be digging into this because this is the interesting

271
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,840
context to this show is that like I think this show was sort of supposed to be a

272
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,040
victory lap for them timed out around the same time as the movie, which they

273
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,800
thought was going to be this big brand rejuvenator.

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,240
And then this show ended up being like a death rattle.

275
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,840
Like this was the last successful thing to come out of He-Man.

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And it was very successful at a time that the rest of the brand was like plummeting.

277
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,680
Like sales were down, the movie bombed.

278
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,440
And then the New Adventures of He-Man was their hail Mary pass.

279
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,080
They were going to do a show called Hero that was going to be like a prequel

280
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,400
show about He-Man's ancestor and like an earlier person who had held the power.

281
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,440
And then there was an alternate pitch at one point where Hero was going to be

282
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,560
He-Man's son.

283
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,600
But the first hero show was going to be set in pre-Eternia, so there were going to

284
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,840
be dinosaurs in it.

285
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,400
And that was their big business like thing was like, this is how we're going to

286
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,200
save He-Man. We're going to put dinosaurs in the toy line.

287
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,280
Now it's new characters, so the kids have to rebuy all the heroes and villains and

288
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,280
they're all riding dinosaurs and the dinosaurs are going to be huge and

289
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,080
expensive. And I think they were trying to sort of get in on like the G.I.

290
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,720
Joe vehicle playset money of just like constant huge dinosaur toys.

291
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,520
But then New Adventures was like the like, fuck, this is plummeting so fast we

292
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,760
need to do like a huge pivot, go steer totally out of the like the barbarian

293
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,360
swords and castles shit and go into space and just fight fucking Star Wars.

294
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,760
But they were fighting Star Wars like 10 years too late.

295
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,440
And that show was a huge flop, except as I know, because I've spent the pandemic

296
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,280
watching too many videos by former Masters of the Universe brand manager at

297
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,200
Mattel, Scott Knightlick and his new channel.

298
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,760
That sword was like the best selling thing Mattel produced that year and the

299
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,080
rest of the line bombed like everyone bought that fucking sword.

300
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,800
So no one watched the cartoon show.

301
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,640
So the one that Jason showed the picture of that sword was like a huge seller

302
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,280
specifically. And then no one watched the show.

303
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,440
No one bought the figures. Every kid I knew had that yet had that sword.

304
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,400
I played with it so much and it was pretty solidly made except the blade,

305
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,760
because eventually the blade just snapped off.

306
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,200
And then I just had a handle with a tiny light bulb sticking out of it.

307
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,400
So it was made great except for the sword part.

308
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,240
I somehow never managed to break that tiny light bulb.

309
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
It's a miracle.

310
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,120
Wow. It's like a Hanukkah miracle.

311
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Yeah, it's it's fascinating.

312
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,840
There's that Netflix documentary I watched recently, The Power of Grayskull,

313
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,520
that has a lot of that history in it.

314
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,680
And it is fascinating. Maybe I even talked about it on one of the episodes we've

315
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,760
done recently about just watching a bunch of guys go, I don't know, it's Skull.

316
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,760
And they want to call it whatever you want. Grayskull.

317
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,960
OK, great. Like nobody gave a shit about it.

318
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,360
But then they were all trying to strategically just figure out how to keep

319
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,440
this thing going. And yes, they were.

320
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,800
There were like there were some toy people that were like, we weren't even that

321
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,400
creative. We threw it to somebody else and then they gave us a better idea.

322
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,160
There's a guy who was really like down on all his ideas from that worked on the

323
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,480
toy line initially. I forget his name in the documentary.

324
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,440
There there is that documentary is worth watching on Netflix.

325
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,800
There's also The Toys That Made Us episode about Master of the Universe.

326
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,480
That's a really good kind of more condensed version of it.

327
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,160
But like I am a huge Masters of the Universe fan.

328
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,920
Like it sort of is to me what I would argue may be what Ninja Turtles is to you.

329
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,160
And similarly in lockdown, my collection has gotten out of control.

330
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,760
It just became my large overarching obsession.

331
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,800
But I like actively, actively sought out and fought to play Orko

332
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,320
on this show, perhaps more than any other job in my entire career.

333
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,000
Like I was just like very single mindedly focused on like I love He-Man.

334
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There's a new show. I want to be part of it.

335
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,840
Orko is the character I want to play partially because I feel like Orko is

336
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,040
very divisive and people either like love him and they were like,

337
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,120
that was my favorite fucking character when I was a kid.

338
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,040
I dressed up as Orko. Orko was the funniest.

339
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,160
I rooted for him. Or people like hate Orko.

340
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,160
He's like 50 percent Jar Jar, 50 percent Chewbacca.

341
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,880
Like there's like no middle ground.

342
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,960
And I just felt like there are a lot of easy ways that someone could sort of

343
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:07,440
sell Orko up the river, you know, that you could kind of like make him into a joke,

344
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,240
whereas he is the comic relief character and he should be like silly and fun.

345
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,080
I didn't want it to be like a like Scrappy Doo thing, you know, like in the in

346
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,680
the Scooby Doo movie where you have to sort of like reframe him as like, oh, well,

347
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,560
we all hate him. And I also got bummed out at the idea

348
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,360
of some famous person just doing it because they were offered it.

349
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,800
Oh, sure. And not knowing it or just doing it as themselves and not like making a new

350
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,120
Orko as in an actorly way.

351
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,400
And he's got a very fucking specific voice, which I'll get into.

352
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,920
Maybe not here, but I was very protective of all this shit.

353
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,400
My mind as a fan, I was like, I really want to be the one to do it.

354
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,480
And I was working like 18 different angles to get cast on this show.

355
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,680
Like I had friends in the writers room.

356
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,480
I found out the Netflix executive had an Instagram account that was just action

357
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,120
figure photography. So I started like following him and liking his

358
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,360
posts until he followed me back.

359
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,560
And then I like slid to DMS and then was like, I'm going to be in L.A.

360
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,080
I'd love to have like a general meeting and then just sort of talked about how big

361
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,040
a fan I was of Motu and then ended by being like, by the way, I just sent it

362
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,840
in tape for Orko, but like just wanted to prove to him my bona fides.

363
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,080
But I was like, I fucking know this shit.

364
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,880
I like far too well.

365
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,240
So I really I really worked really

366
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,080
aggressively for it and have been working on the show for like

367
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,240
a year and a half now, and now it's finally about to come out.

368
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,360
Animations just like so such a long drawn out process.

369
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,520
But needless to say, I

370
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,640
my first record was like right before the pandemic.

371
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,000
It was maybe like end of February.

372
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,280
It won weird at home one minute.

373
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,080
I had one. I actually I got lucky.

374
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,600
I was able to do all of them in studio.

375
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,760
I did most of my work.

376
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,800
I did I did like a real marathon session, most of the episodes in February

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,520
in person in a studio.

378
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,040
And then they sort of put everything on pause, started just animating everything

379
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,640
they had because the season is going to come out in two chunks.

380
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,080
What is dropping today when this episode

381
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,600
has come out is the first five episodes and there's another five that are almost

382
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,280
finished that I don't know when they're going to announce when those are coming

383
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,880
out, but within this year, so they focused on the ones that they had totally in the

384
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,760
can and then when I had to go back and record more, it was when things were

385
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,000
a little less scary, at least numbers had dipped in New York.

386
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,320
And like I was terrified about being on a set, but being in a hermetically sealed

387
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,160
recording booth felt as safe as any type of performance could possibly be.

388
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,400
That's pretty ideal.

389
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,320
You barely do like meet anyone on the way in.

390
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,200
Do that kind of thing. Right.

391
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,960
Right. And like everyone's directing over Zoom anyway.

392
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,120
So, yeah, I was able to do all that in studio, which was great because like doing

393
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,920
shit from home doesn't feel professional.

394
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,400
It's very hard to feel like you're doing a job.

395
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
And there's no pump up.

396
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,560
There's no like the commute where you think about it and what could go wrong,

397
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,200
but what could go right and how do it like sort of talking yourself up and then

398
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,480
you're in a place and you perform.

399
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,720
Right. You lose that.

400
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,400
And you also gain a thing I'm sure you guys can relate to the added stress of am I

401
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,800
fucking this up on a technical level at every single moment, just like checking to

402
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,360
make sure everything's plugged in correctly because it's like, oh, I have to be

403
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,680
my own engineer is now well as well.

404
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,840
Add distracting.

405
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,720
Yes. Yeah.

406
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,600
Which I had to do for some other voiceover things.

407
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,960
I was very happy that I got to do or go like all those sessions in studio in a

408
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,520
normal way, not rushed with the animators and Kevin Smith, the showrunner and the

409
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,840
voice director and everyone like on and sort of guiding me through stuff.

410
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,120
I think the show is going to be really good.

411
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,600
I'm really proud of it.

412
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
And hopefully people are liking it now.

413
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,880
But all this to say,

414
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,560
my love of He-Man stems from I'm a little younger than you guys.

415
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,120
And as Jason said, like generationally,

416
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,880
that's when he man is just petering out. Right.

417
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,520
So most of my He-Man toys came from garage sales.

418
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,160
Right. Like my object permanence phase comes

419
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,840
in when he man is like done, when, you know, like the new adventures is bombing out.

420
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:40,360
And I was a big nerd kid and like just never stopped collecting action figures

421
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,800
and was obsessed with comic book stores and everything there.

422
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,800
And every other, I feel like 80s kids property still existed in some form into

423
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,200
the 90s. Right. Like there were evolutionary changes.

424
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,120
But like Transformers is still in the ecosystem.

425
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,080
It might be Beast Wars now, but Transformers still exists.

426
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,080
You know, like G.I. Joe is going through

427
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,720
reinventions, but G.I. Joe still exists.

428
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,960
He-Man was just nowhere for like 10 years.

429
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,200
It was just like memory hold.

430
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,760
It was gone.

431
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,960
There was just like no media.

432
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,280
There was no retail presence.

433
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,560
There was no nothing.

434
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,360
And I would read this magazine, Toy Fair magazine that was like the big action

435
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,080
figure magazine, and they would talk about He-Man all the time.

436
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,120
And I'd be like, what's this reference I don't get?

437
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,920
Like I was very much a kid where I was

438
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,360
trying to understand what the nerds 10 years older than me liked.

439
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,440
So I could like be in the club and make the jokes.

440
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,840
And I was so confused by the fact that there was no,

441
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,200
like, cultural presence for He-Man outside of this one magazine that was weirdly

442
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,200
still obsessed with it. They would be in like cartoon.

443
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,160
Toy Fair would have like these like jokey

444
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,800
cartoons, which honestly felt like the precursor to Robot Chicken to me.

445
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,480
It was Toy Fair Theater.

446
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,440
Yes. Most of the writers and creators.

447
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,160
OK, yeah. It was Twisted Migo.

448
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,520
And then they changed it to Twisted Toy Fair at a later point because of copyright

449
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,640
shit, I think. So both of you are.

450
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,000
Both right. Jason and I, both right.

451
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,240
Great. But no, but literally the creators

452
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,320
and original writers of Robot Chicken are largely guys who wrote that.

453
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,480
Yeah. With Seth Green.

454
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,520
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

455
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,920
It's the direct precursor.

456
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,640
And it was this toy magazine that had like a sense of humor.

457
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,920
And they would put Skeletor and He-Man in their comics.

458
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,720
But they would also just like write them up as like, oh, these are the big ones.

459
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:37,040
You know, it's like Duke and Snake Eyes and Lion-O and He-Man, you know, like

460
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,880
that's their sort of like Mount Rushmore for like 80s kids who grew up with the,

461
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,520
you know, fighting action figures.

462
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,800
So it was when I went to summer camp and there was a kid who was older than me,

463
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,200
who was obsessed with He-Man, who started like telling me about it.

464
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,480
And then I got really into it.

465
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,720
And then there was a relaunch in 2002 where they did a new modern He-Man show

466
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,440
that was on Cartoon Network.

467
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,000
And I was like 13 or 14 at that time and then got super into He-Man.

468
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,280
A children's property from the 80s.

469
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,200
It was a great, very cool time for me to suddenly be all in on this thing

470
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,400
where everyone was like, you're obsessed with a cartoon show from before we were

471
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,760
little that none of us remember that is now rebooted for current day children.

472
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,720
Like, why can't you exist in your own time?

473
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Why are you like simultaneously older and younger than you should be?

474
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,480
Hey, man,

475
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,280
it pretty much guaranteed you became a podcast.

476
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,880
Like how if you survey podcasters, how many could be described in that way?

477
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:49,200
It's the unconscious training for the media landscape we now live in.

478
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,400
I feel like Thundercats kind of fell into this memory hole too and then got rebooted later.

479
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,640
My exposure to a lot of this stuff, there was a run, there was period in time

480
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,000
kind of related to the comic book boom, kind of related to like action figures

481
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,120
just becoming big business when people would open quote unquote collectible

482
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,720
stores and it was mostly just like junky old toys.

483
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,200
Some still in boxes, some not in boxes.

484
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,000
The handful of comic books.

485
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,320
If you could rent a retail space and you

486
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,600
could get a bunch of this shit, some of it's probably your own collection

487
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,120
you're selling like that was that was where I would find some of this stuff.

488
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,480
Like, especially in South Jersey, this caught on.

489
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,400
And my family is like, we want to go to the beach.

490
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,040
And I was like, I want to go to this dank

491
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,720
basement where someone sells dusty old toys, please.

492
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Absolutely. Yeah.

493
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,520
And like if you're seeing human toys at like a flea market or collectible store or

494
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,480
whatever, they truly looked unlike any other action figures.

495
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,920
Like they they just as they say, their whole thing was like this was Mattel

496
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,040
trying to fight with Star Wars first wave, right?

497
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,120
Like, you know, early 80s going like we passed on Star Wars.

498
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,040
Kenner has just been making hundreds and

499
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,680
hundreds of millions of dollars with these things.

500
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,560
Now Hasbro has rebooted G.I. Joe.

501
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,760
I mean, I began my timeline wrong.

502
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,920
I don't know if that's right before or right after, but it's like they had their

503
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,760
sort of famous boys property that they were able to relaunch and make smaller

504
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,600
and build into vehicles and new cartoon show and all that shit.

505
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,480
Mattel was like, we need to own something.

506
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,120
And this is what as I've gotten older,

507
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,200
I've come to love more and more about him and is sort of what Mike was talking

508
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,200
about, where it's like it's a boardroom of people trying to solve the equation of

509
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,040
how do you make something that every single kid would find cool?

510
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,720
And it's just like these cynical guys like chain smoking, throwing every idea

511
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,160
at the wall, and then at some point someone comes in and goes like,

512
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,800
what if it's just all of them at the same time?

513
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:58,880
And it's sort of just like this this jambalaya of all of it, of just like sci fi

514
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:05,520
and fantasy and barbarianism and monsters and robots and like everything

515
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,080
with this mythology that is like so thinly sketched out names that are like

516
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,920
established within like five minutes in the back of a napkin when someone's

517
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:19,000
taking a shit and then it gets passed around to all these different mediums

518
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,680
and all of them start trying to actually make something out of it.

519
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,920
So like, you know, there's no media to support it when it comes out.

520
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,680
They go in and pitch it and Toys R Us is like, how will this is cool?

521
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,280
But like, how will kids know any of these characters?

522
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,640
And they're like, oh, because of the comic books.

523
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,280
And they were like, what kind of books and like their comic books inside

524
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,600
the packaging and they're like, oh, good idea.

525
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,920
OK, we'll order like 10,000 of them.

526
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,080
And they walk out and the one junior Mattel guy says to the other guy,

527
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,280
like, what kind of books?

528
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,520
Because I don't know, that's your job to fucking figure it out.

529
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,760
Now,

530
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,320
well, I was just saying some shit, but now that's your purview.

531
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,280
We have no budget. Make comic books.

532
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,680
And so they started like hiring these guys who are like science fiction

533
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,840
novelists to write these comic books that came inside the action figures,

534
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,440
which were starting to establish the mythology, which then when the toys get

535
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,400
big, they do a cartoon show, the cartoon show almost immediately negates 50%

536
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,200
of what is in the comic books that come with the toys.

537
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,160
And then they're like DC Comics.

538
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,400
You should do some comic books, too.

539
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,160
And the DC Comics, that maybe comes before the cartoon show.

540
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,320
But DC Comics creates a bunch of new things that negate that.

541
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,560
So you already have like the DC Comics are different from the comics that come

542
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,800
with the toys are different from the cartoon show.

543
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And there are shared elements, but there are areas in which they totally bump up

544
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,920
against each other.

545
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,400
And then the movie comes out.

546
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,520
It's its own fucking thing.

547
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,360
When they reboot, it's its own fucking thing.

548
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,160
Modern comics are their own fucking thing.

549
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,040
There's a modern toy line from the late 2000s into the 2010s that establish its

550
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,320
own mythology that was trying to reconcile everything and weirdly power

551
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:00,720
tour, I would argue, is one of the first times they kind of cleanly laid everything

552
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,200
out and presented a somewhat definitive story that tracked.

553
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,840
They took all of the mythology and they because this is what happens actually now,

554
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,440
I feel like, because like Turtles is the same way where there's like 15 different

555
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,680
timelines you can go back.

556
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,360
So when you're making a new version of it, you literally just have to pick and choose

557
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,600
and try to make something like cleaner out of a bunch of just like haphazard

558
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,680
decisions people make.

559
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,040
Is there like, I don't know, this got thrown on my desk today.

560
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,840
I have no affection for it because it's new.

561
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,560
Who gives a shit?

562
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,320
And then 20 years later, people with actual affection are like, here's how it

563
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,360
actually happened.

564
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,000
Here's what I think is actually the true can.

565
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,320
Because I have that with Turtles.

566
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,360
I know what I think is real and what's not like I get.

567
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:42,760
Right.

568
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,120
So this is the cleanest version, you're saying, of Masters in the old days.

569
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,120
Way. Yes.

570
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,200
In that early days, because like what you're saying with Turtles, it's like

571
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,000
everyone every time they relaunched it, someone kind of came in with a new thing.

572
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,240
Right.

573
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,280
Whatever the creative team is, whoever was on top, they sort of like, well, this time

574
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,200
we're going more cartoon, more serious, more like the comics, less like the comics

575
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,640
or whatever. He man, it was like four things right out of the gate that all

576
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,680
clashed with each other that like didn't make sense.

577
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,040
And there's even stuff where like the paintings on the back of the packaging

578
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,160
for the original He-Man toys, half of them look nothing like the characters.

579
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,880
Like they made prototypes, they painted

580
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,880
the prototypes and then they changed the look of the characters.

581
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,400
And then when those characters showed up in the cartoon show, they had a third

582
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,680
different design and in the comics, they had different colors.

583
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,320
Like it was just such a mess.

584
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,120
It was so disorganized, but there's weird magic that comes out of that.

585
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,160
Like it's an interesting counter to like a George Lucas Star Wars universe

586
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,160
that is very specifically crafted and it's the vision of one guy.

587
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,800
And then watching like 200 people try to replicate that and not really talking

588
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,800
to each other, there have been so many lawsuits with guys who claim like, no,

589
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,240
I was the creator of He-Man because there are like 10 different guys who can say

590
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,200
like, well, I'm the creator of He-Man because I built the model.

591
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,320
But like I came up with the name He-Man, but I came up with this part of the

592
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,960
mythology. Well, I have the idea to do a toy line that was like this.

593
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,120
You know, they looked at these like Star Wars action figures and they were like,

594
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,440
these are small and wimpy and they just put clay on top of it and as much muscle

595
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,360
as they possibly could. And the He-Man toys.

596
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,200
And this is like when Arnold is starting

597
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,600
to get big and Schwarzenegger is presenting this like new body type.

598
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,880
And they were like, just go for that.

599
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,840
Just like absurd muscles upon muscles, you know.

600
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,120
What's the timeline with Conan the barbarian?

601
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,600
Like in terms of affecting and influencing this or they sort of separate,

602
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,880
but then interweave at some point. Great question.

603
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,760
A lot of controversy in this era.

604
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,080
There is a rumor that Mattel

605
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,280
had the license for Conan toys.

606
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,960
Started producing them, then found out the movie was going to be rated R,

607
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,560
realized it was not a child friendly property, took the prototypes they had

608
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,200
made and made them He-Man instead, that they were actually supposed to be

609
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,000
Arnold's sculpts. That has been disputed by a lot of people,

610
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,480
that the timeline doesn't work out, that there was one meeting taken,

611
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,680
but that didn't really line up and that this was already in development.

612
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,320
When He-Man was originally created,

613
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,480
the muscle thing was a big thing because they were trying to like big dog the

614
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,400
Star Wars toys. That was the big thing, was that all the Star Wars toys had that

615
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,280
like kind of like straight arms, straight legs, kind of very vanilla posing.

616
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,200
We're all very skinny to fit in vehicles.

617
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,720
And they like all the He-Man toys are in this crouch and their arms are bent,

618
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
their knees are bent.

619
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,920
They sort of look bad already.

620
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,280
And they just have like grotesque amount of muscles.

621
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,440
It's rock and wrestling time, too.

622
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,360
It's Hulk Hogan.

623
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,040
It's so like kids are just kids are desiring a jacked guy.

624
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,440
They want a toy of a jacked guy now.

625
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Yeah. And the original idea for He-Man,

626
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,920
there was this character that Mattel had in the 70s named Big Jim,

627
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,560
who was like their competitor to G.I. Joe.

628
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Hold on.

629
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,520
You follow up questions?

630
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Yeah.

631
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,200
Now I just want to know about Big Jim.

632
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,720
Oh, I'm about to tell you.

633
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh, please.

634
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,560
Big Jim was like their answer to G.I. Joe, where it was like, oh, this is like a 12

635
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,120
inch, like handsome built brunette man

636
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,560
doll with removable outfits.

637
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,320
And he could be anything.

638
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,000
Like hair is nuts.

639
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,960
Or sometimes he has this like helmet hair.

640
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,760
It's crazy.

641
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,400
This is the thing. Big Jim, they were just like, he's just like a blank slate.

642
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,160
And he can be an astronaut if we want,

643
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,960
or he can be a fucking like the six million dollar man or a secret spy.

644
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,600
Yeah. Or a lifeguard.

645
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,000
So he's the next generation of Action Man.

646
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,880
Yes.

647
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Action Man was a very similar like kind of a thunder, kind of had a thunderbird sort

648
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,560
of outfit, but yeah, you could get a million different.

649
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,040
He could be a scuba diver.

650
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,600
He could be a soldier sort of thing.

651
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,040
And then Action Man survives in the UK and becomes the dominant thing.

652
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,600
Like in the UK, they have no cultural fondness for G.I.

653
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,360
Joe. Action man lingered and has become their dominant boys action figure hero in

654
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,000
history.

655
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,080
Can I just say Big Jim?

656
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,240
I'm looking at a lineup of Big Jim's.

657
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,600
Look down on the bottom right.

658
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,920
Big Jim is a firefighter in a silver suit.

659
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,560
He looks like he's like a 50s sci fi robot.

660
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,360
What firefighters have you ever seen in silver suits?

661
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,040
I mean, let's be honest, Big Jim's a sociopath.

662
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,520
He's right.

663
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,800
It can't be everything.

664
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,600
He's a catch me if you can.

665
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,760
You're telling me he's talented Mr.

666
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,520
Ripley. Yes, he's camping football, baseball,

667
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,840
firefighter, Arctic Explorer, race driver, boxer, cowboy, Safari hunter, commando,

668
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,720
warm up, skin diving, karate and basketball.

669
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,920
And this is like one page like spies not on there.

670
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,760
As you pointed out, he's got his like secret disguise shit.

671
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,560
Why is he when he's a football player?

672
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,360
Why does he have a cape?

673
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,160
Football players don't have capes.

674
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,960
That's one thing I know about sports.

675
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,120
Big Jim's got a lot of shit going on and like moderate success, but didn't really

676
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,520
linger in the 80s. They come back around.

677
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,960
They go like, is that the concept?

678
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,000
Do we do a modern Big Jim thing in a smaller scale where it's like a hero who

679
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
can become anything?

680
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,640
And they were sort of thinking a more fantastical version of it.

681
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,440
They made this prototype I love where it was the one figure with like the body

682
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,400
pose we sort of know in the musculature of He-Man, but they were removable parts.

683
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,320
And it was like he can be a spaceman.

684
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,720
And the spaceman armor was just Boba Fett armor painted orange.

685
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,840
It was the helmet and the jetpack, the exact Boba Fett shit.

686
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,360
Painted orange.

687
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,040
He can be a barbarian.

688
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,360
And it was like a Conan style barbarian, but a slightly different look.

689
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,360
And this predates when Mattel would have taken the Conan movie, bitch.

690
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,320
And then the third one is a tank man.

691
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,560
And the tank man is his head is just the turret of a tank.

692
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,800
He like he is a military vehicle.

693
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,360
And they were just like the barbarians, the thing they did, all this focus group

694
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,680
like shit with little kids and they were like little kids are obsessed with the idea

695
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,800
of power. That's the whole thing.

696
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,200
They want to feel powerful. They want to feel in control.

697
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,760
The whole thing is like I have the power

698
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,960
that he man is like this dude who has power.

699
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,280
No one can tell him what to do.

700
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,040
And then they just threw every single thing into the pot to like flesh out his

701
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,320
universe, every type of supporting character, every type of genre,

702
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,200
all of that. And it was, yeah, hugely successful.

703
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,480
Outsold Barbie for like a number of years was Mattel's number one thing was making

704
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,040
billions of dollars. The cartoon show was huge.

705
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
It like just flowered.

706
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,480
And then it was so big and they realized that they had a very,

707
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:06,760
very sort of unusual percentage of female viewers as opposed to most boy action

708
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,160
shows. So they decided we're going to spin this off.

709
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,680
We're going to do She-Ra, He-Man's sister,

710
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,720
make a show and have to explain why his sister has never been mentioned until now

711
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,840
because she was like stolen Maleficent style.

712
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,400
But

713
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,120
She-Ra is very big.

714
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,840
And at a certain point, I think was even out doing it in the ratings,

715
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,040
out doing it in sales, maybe. And then like 1986, 1987, it just plummets.

716
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,040
It just plummets out of nowhere.

717
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,560
It was one of these things where it went from like He-Man is making five hundred

718
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,720
million dollars a year to He-Man's making twenty million dollars a year.

719
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,080
It was like one year where it dropped like that.

720
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,600
And there are all these different theories on what happened.

721
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,600
All the cranky dudes at Mattel blame it on She-Ra.

722
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,240
They say that like there was this show that the boys little sisters like to watch.

723
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,400
And that was fine.

724
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,440
But then once there was a girl show,

725
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,120
then it made He-Man look like a girly property.

726
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,080
And when the girls had their own warriors

727
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,520
to play with, then the boys got territorial and abandoned it,

728
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,920
which I don't know if I really believe that.

729
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,360
There's also a story that they fucked up like circulation,

730
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,120
that the toys were selling so well, the retailers were like, we want more and more.

731
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,880
And they kept on creating more and more characters.

732
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,760
They made so many different characters

733
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,800
in the original line over the span of only like four years or something.

734
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,840
But at a certain point, they weren't still producing the main characters.

735
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,120
And so the stores just got clogged with like a lot of these final year deep cut

736
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,560
characters who end up in the power tour, who they were desperately trying to make

737
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,160
cool, who like never made it onto the cartoon show, were only in the power tour.

738
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:56,720
And now like your shelves were filled with snout spout and like blast attack.

739
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,720
I love snout spout.

740
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,040
These guys weren't in the...

741
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,760
Because I'm not so up on all this mythology.

742
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,280
Some of this is only tour.

743
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:10,760
Some of these, I don't want to get reamed by He-Man fans who are more

744
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,440
comprehensive in their knowledge than I am.

745
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,800
I don't remember which are which, but some of these characters

746
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,440
were never on the cartoon show, were only in the tour.

747
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,800
Some of them only appeared in, you know, like mini comics.

748
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,920
Like there was that sort of like scattering of it.

749
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,520
And

750
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,120
the movie was supposed to be the big thing that sort of rejuvenated it.

751
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,320
And then it bombed really hard.

752
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,400
It was tied up in canon sort of like going under in Superman 4.

753
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,040
And the budget was getting cut and it sort of like fell flat.

754
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,280
But this show was like a huge fucking success.

755
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,280
And to the best that I could check it

756
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,000
still holds the record for the most sold out performances at Radio City Music Hall.

757
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,640
That seems so insane.

758
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,160
I was trying to find any like further validation than the people involved

759
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,280
in this show, but it is 18 is the number.

760
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,920
18. I don't know. That's a lot.

761
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,040
Why wouldn't that be the winner of that stat?

762
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,480
That's crazy.

763
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,680
They sold out 18 performances at Radio City Music Hall.

764
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,640
And that is the smallest venue they ever played.

765
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,760
I was going to say, because if you're comparing it to Turtles, this is arenas.

766
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,240
Turtles was a theater tour.

767
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,720
And this is in LA.

768
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,120
It was the LA Sports Arena.

769
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,400
Yes.

770
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,320
I mean, and if you see any videos or it pans to crowd.

771
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,440
Yeah, it's always like, you know, theater in the round.

772
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,200
Radio City was the only theater they played.

773
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,920
Otherwise, it was stadiums.

774
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,720
Geez.

775
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
Yeah.

776
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,040
I as I started looking up pictures and videos of this,

777
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,720
I was kind of surprised because this looks expensive, really fucking expensive.

778
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,240
Yeah.

779
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,360
The Mortal Kombat show looks a little chintzy, but this looks like they spent so

780
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,240
much money. I think that's why the costumes were sort of going viral.

781
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,760
However, many months ago it were, I mean,

782
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,960
viral within our very nerdy corner of the Internet.

783
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,120
But like, all of us sort of noticed it in our timelines because you are kind of

784
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:09,120
taken aback by like these costumes look higher quality than the other types of

785
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,840
these shows that you've seen before.

786
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,440
Like there's something less chintzy about this.

787
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,040
And even just the scale of the show,

788
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,360
like the narrative ambition of the show is wild.

789
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,000
Like this is a thought I had watching it.

790
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,600
It feels like this show is every different type of theme park show

791
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,640
run back to back to back to back.

792
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,200
Like it has like 30 minute stretches where it's like now it's a condensed

793
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,120
musical version of the story.

794
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,240
Now it is a stunt show.

795
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,680
Right now it is this weird fucking attorney in circus thing.

796
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,680
Yeah, which is less less

797
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,200
tracked on you or less like archived seemingly.

798
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,320
I didn't ever see a really good copy of the attorney in circus.

799
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,520
It's also like Starlight Express kind of performers on roller skates.

800
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,880
Skating.

801
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,680
That's where it really hooked me.

802
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:10,240
Yeah, it's like it's like a dance show, a stunt show, a musical rock opera,

803
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,600
a little rock opera, pseudo futuristic rock opera.

804
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,920
The moment where I felt like I need to bring this to the good boys,

805
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,600
we need to talk about this on podcast.

806
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,240
The ride is songster just feels like such a PTR character.

807
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Oh, boy. Oh, you know, I lit up at Songster.

808
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,800
Let me just I'll pull him up on the screen.

809
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,120
So let's explain Songster, I guess he's well, there's a little

810
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,320
we're looking at kind of his like his hero shot from the program of the tour.

811
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,480
And we'll post these somewhere.

812
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,320
But his little like attribution Songster,

813
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,000
the cosmic troubadour tells the ancient legends through his music.

814
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,600
So he's introduced lately.

815
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,520
I guess we have to say a little about the premise of the show,

816
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:02,040
because it's not just it's not that the He-Man characters are touring a concert.

817
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,080
And it's not just that this is happening and you're not part of it.

818
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,000
It is a tour. Power tour is correct.

819
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,400
It's almost like if the pope was coming

820
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,920
to your town or just like a bunch of dignitaries from a nation that you knew

821
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,000
a little about but wanted to know more and they're bringing the best that they

822
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,680
kind of a shin you right?

823
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,160
Like a shin you see a five thousand years of eternal civilization.

824
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,560
But that's like a very important distinction, Scott,

825
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,760
because coming out of our shells is the turtles have decided they want to rock

826
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,560
for you, right? Yeah, that's when I taught them about music.

827
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,320
And now they wanted to share it with the world.

828
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,680
Yeah, right. And they're like doing a tour.

829
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,120
You know, it's like we're treating this like it's a concert.

830
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,640
And then I remember seeing like a Rugrats Radio City Music Hall show when I was

831
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,920
young that was like an original stage show with people in terrifying costumes,

832
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,120
you know, and lip sync songs.

833
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,240
But that was just a play.

834
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,840
You know, that was just a Rugrats musical that toured.

835
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,160
This this is the format of the show is, as you said, it feels papal.

836
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,880
It does feel like you are going to be blessed by visitors from Eternia.

837
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,440
Yeah, and it's very because it's very pomp and circumstance in like a way that

838
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,320
things in the 1600s would have been pomp and circumstance where it's all like

839
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,000
banners and fine lemons and then they show you their traditions.

840
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,800
It's like it's their culture.

841
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,520
It's not like here's like a random random smattering of people and bands or something.

842
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,800
It's like this is the best and brightest of an entire culture.

843
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,560
Right. The narrative of this show is

844
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,720
the attorney and the high attorney and want to share their culture with you.

845
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,960
And some things get disrupted. Right.

846
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,640
But this is almost supposed to be a very

847
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:55,360
regal, austere, educational presentation for the audience.

848
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,600
You know, the first act in a way, if it wasn't characters who you knew about from

849
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,520
toys and TV, you as a child might be bums to see this.

850
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,120
If it was for anything else that you'd never heard of,

851
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,360
royal wedding, like what are all these weird traditions?

852
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,360
It feels like religion.

853
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,840
It feels like you're in church.

854
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,080
Yes.

855
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,920
It's like you're like, what?

856
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,240
What now? A reading from the book of.

857
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,120
Yeah, like they tell you to.

858
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,360
That's what Songster does.

859
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,360
And when you say it's interrupted, I feel like it's not interrupted that much.

860
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:30,120
It's interrupted a couple of times, but they get to do a lot of their presentation.

861
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,720
A lot of the bulk of it out.

862
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,320
Yeah. Act one is totally uninterrupted.

863
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,920
It's mostly like an in-universe show.

864
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,080
You know, it's like, well, this is what those characters would do.

865
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,880
It almost feels like you're visiting the palace, except, of course,

866
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,520
they are visiting you, which is the other weird wrinkle of this.

867
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:55,480
Eternia is like a far off planet in a distant universe, right?

868
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,720
That's a big thing.

869
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,520
And in the movie, there's like a portal that forms, you know,

870
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:06,240
like Skeletor sends He-Man to the New Jersey.

871
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,640
I think it was shot in California,

872
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,880
but I think he's sent to New Jersey and all the good guys are stuck in New Jersey

873
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,720
and they have to find their way back to Eternia.

874
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,960
But it's like that sort of like fish out of water thing.

875
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,280
This is sort of doing like a non-terrifying alien encounter thing

876
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,360
where at the beginning they're like, we have technology.

877
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,360
We're going to bring them to you.

878
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,080
You know?

879
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,480
But only nice stuff, only good things.

880
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,360
Right. But I find it fascinating that like they even kind of cared enough to be like,

881
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,680
No, we have to answer why they're able to come to like,

882
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,960
you know, the IZOD Center.

883
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:50,280
I was trying to think of what these things would have been called fucking 35 years ago.

884
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,600
But like, you know, well, kids know they come from a different planet.

885
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,000
They can't just show up here.

886
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,680
They're not going to show up here in a spaceship.

887
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,200
You know, you need to create this new

888
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,040
like commander character at the beginning who's like, we have the technology.

889
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,120
Hold on. Transmission coming through.

890
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,280
Let's beam them onto your stage.

891
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,600
I imagine that now this is just not I'm not saying it has to be.

892
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,600
I just appreciate that they justified everything logically,

893
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:23,400
because I think now if you see Paw Patrol live, it's just so these dogs are doing

894
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,640
a concert for you, they are here in your city and you're going to sit and watch them.

895
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,560
I don't think that logic holds

896
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,480
other jobs they have to go to on Monday.

897
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,000
But they took a break for this weekend to do seven performances.

898
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,080
I feel like if you're a little kid and you go see the show,

899
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,760
it does make it feel more real to you, where you're like,

900
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,560
they are really justifying how these characters could be in the same physical

901
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,000
space as me, you know?

902
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
Was this like first?

903
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,320
Oh, I was going to say they even work in like the souvenirs.

904
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,760
Well, that is so fucking canny.

905
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,000
It's very canny.

906
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,040
So craven.

907
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,760
But I love that as a kid.

908
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,280
Like I bought it hook line and sinker.

909
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,320
You know, right.

910
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,640
They do. They're sort of like if you believe in Tinkerbell,

911
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,320
you have to clap moment, except the clap costs fifty dollars.

912
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,720
You got to get a sword like there's like everybody.

913
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,320
Everybody takes a pledge, basically.

914
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,880
And which, by the way, that's that's one part that I I like.

915
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,960
I have to jump around too much, but I really enjoy when I think part of the

916
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,800
it by this point, Skeletor has been introduced.

917
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,280
Skeletor is a presence in it.

918
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,120
And there is the line that he has everybody or ask everyone,

919
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:45,160
just do you do you promise to protect this country from the wrath of Skeletor?

920
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:51,280
And the particular this particular performance was filmed in Calgary.

921
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,880
So when he's talking about country, it's Canada.

922
00:49:54,080 --> 00:50:00,160
I find it really funny that like, will you children protect Canada from Skeletor?

923
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,880
Well, I'll see the the online records of this show are the guy.

924
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,720
I think his name is Greg Park.

925
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,920
Gus Park.

926
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,040
Gus Park. Yes, thank you.

927
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:19,240
He played ninja in this show and he videotaped like 50 different performances.

928
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,720
But not great because it's 87.

929
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,560
Don't forget.

930
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,520
So it's just like camera in the back.

931
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,800
It's the best as you could do.

932
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,120
A little hard to make out.

933
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,720
But like there's a video that's just the first hour of the show.

934
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,200
And then on his account, he has like three parts of the attorney in circus

935
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,040
in the second act, but they're titled weirdly and I miss them.

936
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,520
It's a really hard YouTube to navigate.

937
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,200
Yeah, it's hard to navigate.

938
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,200
And they come from different nights at different venues, I think.

939
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,440
And then he a couple of years ago went to

940
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,480
Power Con, the He-Man convention, and they screened it with some of the other

941
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,320
actors who were in the show and did like a live commentary.

942
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,680
And there's a video of that.

943
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,920
And that's you watch.

944
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,880
You just I think right before we did this.

945
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,760
Yeah. Yes.

946
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,800
So that's a better quality performance.

947
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,600
But it's like they only have it's a better quality performance.

948
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,040
No, it's the opposite.

949
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,840
It's that the video he has up of just the first act is the better quality.

950
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,960
But he doesn't have the second act of that show.

951
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,040
And then he has the second act of a different performance split into three

952
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,720
videos. And then when they screened it at the convention, it was the whole thing

953
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,840
all the way through, but from worse angles with worse sound.

954
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,360
If you go on his YouTube, it's so weird and messy where it's like it's all messes

955
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,120
the universe and then numbers, but then there's a missing number two.

956
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,480
And you don't know if that video is going to be a bad back of the room video

957
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,280
of the show or a brief clip from P.M.

958
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,560
Magazine, an early 80s, I guess, all of 80s news show where they interview some

959
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,120
of the cast and then there's five videos in a row.

960
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,200
He's like, well, all right, I better upload all these Masters of the Universe videos

961
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,080
finally, although I should upload this Oak Ridge Boys music video as well.

962
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,160
I got to get to that because if I don't do it,

963
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,960
got like modern martial arts, like demonstrations on there as well.

964
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,720
I found it the kind of message where he said a couple of years ago that he was

965
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,440
trying to get the clearances to do like an ultimate cut and take the best

966
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,400
performances from whichever sources he had and put together the most viewable

967
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,960
video, but he still hasn't done that. But there are some great.

968
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,960
In addition to the local news interviews,

969
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,160
there's some great local TV like Coming Soon to the Local Spectrum,

970
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:38,480
He-Man, Masters of the Universe, Power Tour, like great local commercials for this show.

971
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,320
All of this to say, you do kind of need to navigate the power tour,

972
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,000
unlike Coming Out of Their Shells, where like it was

973
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,920
recorded professionally, released on VHS, there was like clear representation of it

974
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,960
if you didn't get to see it live.

975
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,400
You have to sort of construct this event like it's the JFK assassination.

976
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,840
You're looking at it from different angles at different sources.

977
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,000
Not the best video ever, but they're trying their best.

978
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,680
Reading synopses, looking at photos.

979
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,280
Is there any talk of why?

980
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,920
Where is the master recording of the audience, like with the songs?

981
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,000
Do they exist?

982
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,000
Nobody knows.

983
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,200
Because I just I want to put this forward right off the bat.

984
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,520
The songs in this are good, right?

985
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,880
Yeah, yeah, pretty good.

986
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,120
Yeah, pretty good.

987
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,920
Yeah. Are they as good as Turtles?

988
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,440
I don't know, but they're pretty good.

989
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,120
Yeah, I knew this was going to be the issue.

990
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,320
I knew Mike was going to come in arguing for it.

991
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,360
And here's and now I'm not going to I'm going to back off.

992
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,440
But I'm going to say this, but just know that I already backed off of this point.

993
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,640
But by the time when I'm watching it by Songsters first song,

994
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,640
which I did a little snippet of at the beginning, by the end of that number

995
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:51,400
and looking at the scale of the set, which is this bit, this like giant round

996
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,840
like a cliff piece essentially.

997
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,080
And there's kind of solid gold dancers and like bright purple.

998
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,280
I really like the song.

999
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,360
Songster descended from the ceiling.

1000
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,240
There's so much going on and knowing that there's fighting and roller skating.

1001
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,600
There was a moment like 15 minutes in where I was like,

1002
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,520
I think this is better than coming out of our shells.

1003
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,880
And I don't know.

1004
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,200
It lost me a little bit.

1005
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,360
So I'm not I'm not going to say that now.

1006
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,880
But there was a minute where like just pure scale.

1007
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,320
I really like the music.

1008
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,240
That it was it was neck and neck for me for a minute.

1009
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,480
I'll say this to be democratic.

1010
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,240
I think at this show's highs, it is better than coming out of our shells.

1011
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,080
Coming over shells is a more coherent, cohesive work.

1012
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,360
And I say, yeah, rarely, rarely said point, but I threw in the person

1013
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,000
who has watched the entirety of the attorney in circus, which is like interminable.

1014
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,680
It's so fucking bad.

1015
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,360
And in the commentary where they're watching it at the convention, they're like,

1016
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,960
so we're just going to talk over the next 20 minutes because this part sucks.

1017
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,520
It never worked.

1018
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,560
We never once went over well with a crowd.

1019
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,760
We never figured it out.

1020
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,880
We never fixed it.

1021
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,240
It was a fucking nightmare.

1022
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,360
The second act of this was like a problem.

1023
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,920
I have to go to Mike for your any is this is your blood boiling at the that there?

1024
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,480
No, I mean, it's ambitious.

1025
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,880
I appreciate the ambition.

1026
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,160
And then the songs, too, like I especially I would like that's what I'm looking.

1027
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,280
I'm looking to hear like an official recording.

1028
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,120
Do they even make one like I would like to hear it because you could really judge.

1029
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,120
Yeah, because it does feel like from the

1030
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,240
songs are like the songs are a little more interesting than most of the turtle songs.

1031
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,640
Well, look, I love Skipping Stones and I thank you guys for turning me on to that one.

1032
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,760
I think it's a genuine jam.

1033
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,560
I've listened to it a lot.

1034
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,600
It's the biggest genre breaker because the right because they get into a run

1035
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:41,400
of like there's a few like mid album cuts that are very just like, all right,

1036
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,920
they're doing kind of new kids rehash.

1037
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,000
But that's the one like they there's a new

1038
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,600
genre applied and I think it really hits a new high.

1039
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,480
Brr, brr, brr.

1040
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,280
It's also just the vocal performance that is unbelievable.

1041
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,280
I'm so fucking on a hip when it comes

1042
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,440
to popular music that most of my major

1043
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,720
music discoveries of the last couple of years have been because of podcast The

1044
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,480
Ride, where I'm like, have you guys heard hot drinks?

1045
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,760
Hell, yeah.

1046
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,320
Like hot drinks and the McGruff crack cocaine song and Skipping Stones are like

1047
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:25,000
in pretty regular rotation for me and all three I only know because of this podcast.

1048
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,480
I'm honored, but also like, oh, my God, we're those and us are your reference

1049
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,440
for for new music.

1050
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,280
Discover.

1051
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,800
Yeah.

1052
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,560
You have Phoebe Bridges.

1053
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,320
That's all I know.

1054
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,400
You haven't gotten into South Side, Johnny and the Asbury Jukes yet.

1055
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,240
I have not even heard of them.

1056
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,520
That's a podcast, The Ride favorites.

1057
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,480
You say that, but I've never listened

1058
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,040
to them, even despite all of their references on the show.

1059
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,280
They're fun.

1060
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,760
When do you guys bring them up?

1061
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,880
Maybe I just it slipped past me.

1062
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,400
That's OK.

1063
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,000
We brought them up once and then Mike said frequently brought up on the show.

1064
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,280
And I was like, are they?

1065
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,160
I brought about in the last episode was the gathered episode we did.

1066
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:08,840
I don't know.

1067
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,760
I feel like I brought them up twice before that.

1068
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,040
But maybe that's only once.

1069
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,400
Yeah.

1070
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,200
I'm trying to see if there was any.

1071
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,720
Official soundtrack release, but it doesn't feel like there was and it feels

1072
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,960
like such a bizarre missed opportunity.

1073
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,360
It was like, obviously, this show existed

1074
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,280
to sell merchandise and sold a tremendous amount of merchandise.

1075
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,240
You can only imagine how many millions of swords they sold, not specifically.

1076
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,120
The sword Jason has not specifically that one.

1077
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,320
No, that's pricey.

1078
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,840
That's a nicer sword.

1079
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,600
But we haven't mentioned most of the show was pre-recorded.

1080
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,840
Like, yes.

1081
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,600
Oh, yeah.

1082
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,560
And man at arms were the only two people with live microphones.

1083
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,080
Yes.

1084
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,240
Is what I saw.

1085
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,160
Songster we started setting up, but is the Cosmic Trooper door and is

1086
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,760
not only the narrator of the show, but the lead character of the show.

1087
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,200
He's like the one guy who's on stage the entire time.

1088
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,480
And he is the new character created only for the tour, which in and of itself

1089
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:16,320
feels audacious to me, but I think it fits into this concept they have where it's

1090
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,280
like, well, he man's not going to put on a show for some kids.

1091
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,560
That's not what he does.

1092
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,920
He's a hero.

1093
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,800
Songsters a performer.

1094
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,560
He man will make his appearances.

1095
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,800
Right. He'll he'll wave to the crowd.

1096
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,120
He'll fight off evil.

1097
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,560
He'll show up when he needs to.

1098
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,560
But you need someone whose power set is music.

1099
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,040
Music.

1100
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,400
You go to see the pope.

1101
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,040
He waves from a box.

1102
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,840
He doesn't go.

1103
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,800
He doesn't sing a song for people sing.

1104
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,440
Right.

1105
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,040
Right.

1106
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,240
He means he means the pope if Skeletor

1107
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,880
invaded and the pope had to get out of the box and fight a little bit.

1108
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:56,840
So like if the devil showed up during a papal visit, right, which sounds like, God,

1109
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,400
I wish that would happen, boy.

1110
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,640
I mean, who wouldn't go see the pope if the pope comes to your town if you thought

1111
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:08,520
the devil was going to actually get be there, especially if Songster was narrating it.

1112
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,920
This is the tale of how the devil became the devil.

1113
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,760
I'll say there was a this I mentioned previously, but this action figure line

1114
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,760
called Masters of the Universe classics that started the models that have ruined

1115
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,520
Mike in my life forever.

1116
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,040
Right.

1117
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,840
Where all these toys get pre sold online, you have to order them on a specific day

1118
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,000
because the 2000s he man had failed.

1119
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,760
There were still like a big adult collectors market.

1120
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,800
Yeah, there's mutagen man

1121
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,320
from Super Seven, which is a direct lineage of Masters of the Universe classics

1122
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,280
in how that toy line structured.

1123
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,640
But it was this toy line where they were

1124
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,000
trying to make the definitive version of every character from every version of the

1125
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,120
property and all these characters that never been done before and variants and

1126
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,000
shit like that. And

1127
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,680
I heard that they wanted to make a Songster action figure

1128
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,240
and they were going to do it as a San Diego Comic Con exclusive, which like Mike,

1129
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,920
you were beating the drum for the coming out of our shells toys for so long.

1130
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,120
And Randy and that kept on being dismissive about it for years.

1131
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,160
But then all of a sudden he started playing along with me on Twitter and then

1132
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,360
made it feel like I may have been the reason he did it.

1133
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,840
I just feel like there was this like attitude for a long time that you really

1134
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,080
helped push back against that, like coming out of our shells is not real turtles.

1135
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,760
That's embarrassing.

1136
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:41,280
Whereas Mochi was was going to do a fucking Songster figure like 10 years ago.

1137
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,600
Is there are you on multiple Facebook groups,

1138
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,480
Masters of the Universe Facebook groups?

1139
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,000
I mean, it's going to be hard now that you're on the show.

1140
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,320
But like I'm on multiple Facebook groups that involve the turtles.

1141
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,560
And when the turtles, when they made coming out of our shells tour turtles,

1142
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,360
peep, there were like half the audience,

1143
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,120
maybe 30 percent of the audience that were furious.

1144
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,640
This is garbage.

1145
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,080
This is dumb, childish shit.

1146
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,360
They shouldn't be making this.

1147
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,960
I want more serious turtles.

1148
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,720
I want the Eastman and Laird red bandana.

1149
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,400
I want a new version of that from NECA.

1150
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,120
And there was a very large, angry portion

1151
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,320
of the audience that felt coming out of shells was not real turtles.

1152
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,840
So I wonder if it's similar to this.

1153
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,040
Those people are so fucking cool.

1154
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,680
Yeah, you know what's really fun, Mike,

1155
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,080
is when you're going into those like message boards and groups that you've been

1156
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,720
part of for over a decade and now they're arguing about the thing that you're a

1157
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,280
part of and you can't say anything must be weird.

1158
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,280
The fucking weird and it's like social justice warrior orco.

1159
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:40,720
I can't handle this character.

1160
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,520
Jason, not even a joke, not even a joke.

1161
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,440
Oh, yeah.

1162
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:52,320
Just absolutely absurd projection shit and like shit that is based in nothing or

1163
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:57,320
shit that is correct, but like it can't be explained because it's a spoiler.

1164
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,280
And why don't you just wait and watch the thing and then decide whether you like it

1165
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,800
or not, rather than listen to these YouTube channels that are trying to stoke outrage.

1166
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,160
Anyway, songster, it felt like for a long time,

1167
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,080
Motu, because of its goofy origins and how

1168
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:19,040
disparate all of its different like incarnations were, was more accepting of

1169
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,800
all the weird nooks and crannies and things like songster.

1170
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,080
They were going to do the songster action figure as a San Diego Comic Con

1171
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:32,040
exclusive, and the idea was to get the guy who played songster on the tour to come

1172
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:38,000
to Comic Con and do a concert and like be in the Mattel booth and make like a splash.

1173
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,440
And apparently he asked for too much money.

1174
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,280
Oh, geez.

1175
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,240
Oh, bummer.

1176
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,480
I've had this image up on the screen for a while.

1177
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,960
Let me just like we'll post it on Twitter, but like let's just describe some details.

1178
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:59,960
It's like a little bit Ren fair with spangles and open chest and like kiss to like

1179
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:05,320
the color palette, but the actual pattern of the outfit with like shoulder guard

1180
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,280
kind of things and yes, and like tight in the pants and big boots.

1181
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,040
Absolutely. It's a colorful kiss.

1182
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:11,840
Yeah.

1183
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,240
And then the guitar is unbelievable.

1184
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,120
It is like it's like a space broom.

1185
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,520
It is.

1186
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,880
It's got no strings, seemingly no strings.

1187
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,360
Yes.

1188
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:30,520
Big turquoise rod and then like kind of angular cut weird pink plastic with stripes

1189
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:36,600
that mean nothing, but then still a dial, still like a little crank it to 11 dial.

1190
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,600
I mean, this image and then he himself is sort of it feels like

1191
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,000
I mean, there's like a little bit of Siegfried and Roy in there with the cape.

1192
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,520
A lot of it's a little bit like if you squint and especially you look at this

1193
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,120
black and white one, you know, like Prince is influenced in this a little bit.

1194
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:54,800
Oh, yeah.

1195
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,600
And the hair and the earring.

1196
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,040
Yeah, there's a in this one.

1197
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,720
There's kind of a you could sort of make out the penis shape in the pants.

1198
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,680
That's the man as a prince.

1199
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,680
Yes, extremely.

1200
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,080
He looks like that Robin Chris O'Donnell hot toy that I'm going to buy next year.

1201
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:17,080
Yeah, although a little kind of a little bit of a tiny shape.

1202
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,280
No offense to the guy.

1203
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,560
If you're going to show it so well, maybe kind of like puff yourself up.

1204
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,200
He could have done some stuffing.

1205
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,960
I think that's no, I'm not going to.

1206
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,120
That's the I just had the grossest thing I was about to say.

1207
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,640
No, Mike, you have to say the grossest thing.

1208
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,160
Say it.

1209
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,160
I was going to say maybe that's just a vein.

1210
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,840
That's oh.

1211
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,840
So the penis, what he is the grossest thing you could possibly say.

1212
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:41,520
That's pretty gross.

1213
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,640
Yeah, that's the grossest thing I've ever said on the podcast.

1214
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:48,120
That a vein, just a vein on a penis would be as big as someone's actual penis.

1215
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,280
Well, yeah, because you are not seeing the rest of it.

1216
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,080
That seems like it'd be more concerning.

1217
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,120
Yes, I don't know.

1218
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,840
It goes his actual penis goes up his back.

1219
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,280
He's hiding it because it's too

1220
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,280
he wraps it around.

1221
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,480
I just I like a I think this guy playing

1222
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:12,560
Songster is giving and I there was an injury where Songster got stuck from the

1223
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,640
opening where they drop him from such an insane height.

1224
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:20,240
So I think he missed a small number of shows, but it was the one guy doing it

1225
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,760
for like 98 percent of the tour.

1226
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,120
I have his name and his

1227
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,320
wait, I got it.

1228
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,480
Doug Howard is the guy's name.

1229
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:35,440
And I sparked to his Wikipedia because a couple of things.

1230
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,440
One, he for one tour and one album was in the band Utopia, which was Todd Rundgren's

1231
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,160
prog rock band, a big Rundgren guy.

1232
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,000
But also, here's one for Jason.

1233
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,360
This guy Songsters grandfather wrote the song.

1234
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,800
Hello, my baby.

1235
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,920
Hello, my honey.

1236
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:01,600
What the writer of that wrote the Michigan J.

1237
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,560
Frog song.

1238
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,360
Yeah. Yeah.

1239
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,880
Which was apparently at some point

1240
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,280
purchased outright by Warner Brothers.

1241
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,440
It was like a song in the world and then became a war.

1242
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,520
So it could be in the WB server verse.

1243
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,760
LeBron and Granny could run into who they could.

1244
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,280
They could run into that song and the writer, Joseph E.

1245
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,280
Howard, as much as they needed to louse his way in again.

1246
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,160
Of the many, many

1247
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:32,560
sort of systemic failures of Space Jam, a new legacy, some of which we're talking

1248
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:37,520
about right before this record audience, we did a full pre air podcast about Space

1249
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,600
Jam, a new legacy, we did at least a second gate on the legacy.

1250
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,960
Sorry, we didn't record it the day before.

1251
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,440
I have to record a fucking two hour episode about Space Jam.

1252
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,920
Wait, you'll be covered.

1253
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,360
Yeah, you got to get warmed up a little.

1254
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,840
You got to get the muscles flexing.

1255
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:58,560
I was just going to say, because it's so hard to formulate an opinion on that movie,

1256
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,960
I was just going to say you just made me realize

1257
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,840
how does that movie not use Mr.

1258
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,880
J. Frog once?

1259
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,760
How do they not call it cyberspace jam?

1260
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,040
It's right there.

1261
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,120
Jason. Yes, right there.

1262
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,120
Yes, I was saving that for blank check.

1263
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,760
But yes, I had the exact same thought.

1264
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,760
Yeah, yeah.

1265
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,160
This is the bug main texted me.

1266
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,040
Space Jam 2 is not in space.

1267
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,320
No, never.

1268
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,360
The title is not applicable.

1269
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:33,000
I mean, I guess their justification is that they hijack Marvin the Martian spaceship

1270
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,520
and they go into toon space briefly.

1271
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,520
It is planets.

1272
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,800
The game is distinctly not in space.

1273
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,520
It's in cyberspace.

1274
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,800
Yeah, yeah.

1275
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,520
I was going to say, on to things that are great and perfect in media.

1276
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,680
I think Songster is a virtuoso performance.

1277
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:59,480
And I think it is just fascinating that this is like if Botanicus was the main

1278
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:03,440
character of the E.T. ride and he just showed up a couple of times.

1279
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,920
But everyone loved it like it worked.

1280
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,680
Yeah, yeah.

1281
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:15,400
I have a video clip and this is I'll ask for patience from you guys and from the

1282
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,560
audience because the quality is not great, as we've said.

1283
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,560
But I think just to give you a taste of the song, not only that, but also this

1284
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,920
might be good for setting the stage in general because you will not just hear

1285
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:31,920
Songster, but also He-Man and She-Ra's introduction.

1286
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:36,680
And as Jason mentioned, this is a classic theme park trope pre-recorded.

1287
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,840
So we are looking at actors who are mouthing along to a track.

1288
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,840
And boy, there is something this He-Man, this voice.

1289
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,440
I mean, I guess it's what he sounds like in the cartoon, right?

1290
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:54,520
But just so just verbose and clear and not that emotive.

1291
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,280
I don't know about that Skeletor.

1292
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:01,240
Like it's all very there's this weird like winky quality to it.

1293
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,520
A little removed.

1294
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,440
This is the first section of the show,

1295
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,240
which is like a meet and greet where they're like telling you the customs of

1296
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:12,120
Eternia and just introducing the characters to you one by one.

1297
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,240
Yeah, yeah.

1298
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:18,120
And so you've like met a lot of the folks and then who beamed in and then and then

1299
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:23,800
you get to He-Man and She-Ra and they introduce

1300
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,240
Songster and say what his purpose is.

1301
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,480
So forgive the quality.

1302
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,960
I might interject with a thing or two.

1303
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:33,440
We'd like you to know a bit more about the magical history of our planet.

1304
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,480
And so we roll along our kingdom's finest storyteller.

1305
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,160
His name is Songster.

1306
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,720
And so his name Songster will create our

1307
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,840
Eternian legends before your very eyes.

1308
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,600
That's right, She-Ra.

1309
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,800
So sit back.

1310
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,080
That's right, She-Ra.

1311
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,960
And enjoy Songster and the legend.

1312
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,440
Really, that's right.

1313
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:00,760
She-Ra is so much like when the equivalent of when Osmode are the tiny green space

1314
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,280
alien that only Homer can see shows up.

1315
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,320
Damn straight, Troy, my man.

1316
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,720
All right. Now then Songster goes down.

1317
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,000
Sometimes

1318
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,360
from the ceiling.

1319
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,100
And

1320
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,160
choose to fit.

1321
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,280
Where are you?

1322
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,040
Dab towards the teller.

1323
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:46,280
Let me review a spell that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

1324
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,840
Let me take you now.

1325
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:51,280
A bunch of solid gold dancers come out.

1326
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,280
He landed perfectly in the center.

1327
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:15,240
All the dancers had to guide in his little stage, which is very precarious.

1328
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,440
I mean, love the song.

1329
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,720
I love that in this performance, he's shouting out Fairfax, Virginia.

1330
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,040
Hello, Fairfax.

1331
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:27,520
He's just got like such a fucking like smooth voice, you know?

1332
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,040
It's a real. Yeah. Yeah.

1333
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,120
Very, very strong.

1334
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,760
Very powerful, very smooth.

1335
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:36,120
I also just to continue my ET Ride analogy.

1336
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:40,960
That's the other thing I'm realizing about the structure of this show is like.

1337
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,960
Here are the attorney and customs, right?

1338
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,320
Here are all the characters.

1339
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,560
It's building to like a boiling point.

1340
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,000
He man and she were a holy fucking shit.

1341
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,960
They're here and they're like, wait a second.

1342
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,240
You are excited for us. No, no, no.

1343
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,280
Now let's introduce the real star of the show.

1344
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,640
It's Songster.

1345
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,120
It's like if the opening of the ET Ride was like, guys, just wait until you fucking

1346
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,600
meet Botanicus, I'm telling you, this guy is the shit.

1347
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,320
And then you just spend the rest of the ride like Botanicus apartment.

1348
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,800
You know,

1349
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:16,160
like Songster just becomes then the the protagonist of the show.

1350
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,880
Yeah, because from this point on, he does like five songs in a row and they all

1351
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:26,560
correspond to a different tale of attorney and legend.

1352
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,520
Before he finishes this one, let me say,

1353
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,720
because I don't want to get to it in the clip, but he starts singing about other

1354
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,240
we've got stories to tell and he gets kind of, you know, into the meat of what's

1355
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:45,160
going to happen tonight and then adds, and by the way, Songster's my name.

1356
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,560
He takes you back to.

1357
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,560
But like and why would you like he man,

1358
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:57,600
the guy with the clearest voice in the universe said his name is Songster.

1359
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,560
And then he said it again.

1360
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,800
Some people might have missed it.

1361
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,400
Yeah, if it's a new guy.

1362
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,240
You want to make sure you say I'm Chevy

1363
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,760
Jason, you're not coming in and going out of that.

1364
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,400
That's why you became a star.

1365
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,800
And that's when you say your known name on television.

1366
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Things change.

1367
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,640
That's what I when I was talking to Songster, I gave him the advice, you know,

1368
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,000
you got to say your name twice.

1369
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,920
Somebody has to say it once and then people will tell you it's overkill.

1370
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,280
They're wrong. I said Songster when people go to the zoo.

1371
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,520
The first thing they go to see are the lions.

1372
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,480
But also just in isolation.

1373
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:39,440
And by the way, Songster's my name is such an incredible sentence.

1374
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:44,320
There's something about anyone saying, and by the way, blank is my name is such

1375
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,880
a weird way to introduce yourself because it's making it clear you're not introducing

1376
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,800
yourself up front, right? You front loaded some other shit.

1377
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,920
And by the way, blank is my name.

1378
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,560
But then for your name to be Songster is incredible.

1379
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,480
But yeah, narrative reigns completely

1380
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,640
thrown over to Songster.

1381
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:08,680
He man and she have vacated the stage, not just the star of the show, but two stars

1382
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:15,720
of two different shows, the cross section of this audience has both been told.

1383
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,000
It's not about them.

1384
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,800
Don't worry about them. Songsters, the fucking guy.

1385
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,200
And then Songster takes you through this,

1386
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:31,080
like a bridged reconciliation of the origins of like the he man mythology.

1387
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:36,560
Going back to like the legend of Grayskull, the formation of the tower,

1388
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,080
the power of the sorceress, the formation of the castle.

1389
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:44,680
You see dancers turn into Castle Grayskull

1390
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,600
and and yes, setting up like this thing that was all retconned.

1391
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,720
Like that's this insane thing where it's like he man doesn't have a sibling.

1392
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:56,200
Right. Like it's Prince Adam is the Clark Kent,

1393
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:00,160
the mild matter teen who gets this power,

1394
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,960
this ancestral power in the form of the sword that he can conjure, turn into he man.

1395
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,440
But he is the prince of the kingdom.

1396
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:13,120
His dad is an attorney and his mom is a human astronaut from Earth who landed on

1397
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,920
their planet, something this show takes the time to work in.

1398
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:22,680
Like, I'm just impressed with how thorough they are in their backstory,

1399
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,960
which admittedly, it lost me a little.

1400
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,920
This is where it lost points to Ninja Turtles.

1401
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,440
But yeah, the mythology sense and then also the songs end up.

1402
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,480
I mean, that first song is that's Guns of Blazing.

1403
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,760
I love that song a lot.

1404
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:42,320
And then you end up in a little bit more of like space version of medieval bard.

1405
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,960
Like that's like structurally, that's what the songs are like.

1406
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:49,560
A little bit is like telling you it's like the guy in Robin Hood, the rooster

1407
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,000
telling you like they work less as like fun concert pop songs.

1408
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,960
So I have to give it back to the turtles in that area.

1409
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,320
It becomes like a decent theme park musical.

1410
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:03,400
Like there's this 30 minute stretch where it's just straight up.

1411
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,360
Here's the story.

1412
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,520
And you're having story songs sung by the characters.

1413
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,000
Right. Like songs are singing as well.

1414
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,160
But you have why am I immediately forgetting the tune of it?

1415
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,200
But that weird staccato, semi-spoken Prince Adam song about the fact that he can't

1416
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,880
lift the sword.

1417
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,120
Mm hmm.

1418
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,000
Yeah.

1419
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,560
What's the.

1420
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,280
Where he doesn't have the power.

1421
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,600
He doesn't have the will.

1422
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,840
Oh, right. Right.

1423
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,080
But the rhythm of that song is so odd.

1424
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,040
I just think it's interesting where I was watching this and going like, huh,

1425
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:40,440
this is interesting that like as opposed to these concert shows or writing a new

1426
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:46,440
narrative, they're kind of making like a big budget musical out of the origins

1427
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,400
of these characters and the universe that were never very clearly laid out in the

1428
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,120
cartoon.

1429
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,080
And instead, they just do that a bridge and then they're like, and now some other

1430
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,400
things.

1431
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,840
It's yeah, they really threw every again, as you were saying, they threw everything

1432
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:05,000
at it because it was like it feels like it's somebody probably was just like,

1433
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,680
yeah, let's just make let's just tell kids about what happened.

1434
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,480
They should know that.

1435
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,600
And then someone was like, no, we have to make it present.

1436
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,120
Something has to be happening now.

1437
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,600
Right. And then they were like, yeah, let's just do all of it.

1438
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,360
Because I guess it's like you're here and watching this and you didn't know

1439
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,200
anything about like what this kids show that your kid likes.

1440
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,680
You'll know what's going on by the end of this.

1441
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,960
You know, it's sort of helpful.

1442
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,480
They're giving the parents like a crash course.

1443
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:36,200
But isn't I guess it's like, are we seeing like historical documents of what happened

1444
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,960
or reenactments or projections?

1445
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,160
But you're right. They're like, we want present action.

1446
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,880
We want the kids to feel like the shit's happening here.

1447
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:48,240
So then like you have this 30 minute section, 20 minute section, whatever it is

1448
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,200
of like the telling of the story where the characters are singing their own songs.

1449
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:57,800
And you're seeing how he got the power and Hordak like rude the day said he would

1450
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,720
some back come back to claim his prize, which ended up being she rather twin sister.

1451
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:04,360
And that's why she's at her own show and all that shit.

1452
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,920
And then when that ends, like Skeletor shows up on the screen and is like fake news,

1453
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,000
not how I remember it happening.

1454
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:17,760
And their solution is we have to fight for who gets to tell this story.

1455
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,080
And the fight is what do they call it?

1456
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,440
The power race, the power race.

1457
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,920
Right. It's not a fight.

1458
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:28,400
It's a power race, which is a roller skating tournament.

1459
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:33,960
Yeah. And he like he kind of just seems to want to be included in the ski.

1460
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:38,240
He's just like Skeletor seems lonely and wants to be in a skate thing.

1461
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,680
Yes.

1462
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,440
He just wants to have friends.

1463
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,080
There's a line in there like once.

1464
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,080
So, yeah, I get where you're.

1465
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:49,320
You're all the way through the first act with no presence of Skeletor.

1466
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,800
And then if I then you hear him, then it's just his voice.

1467
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,440
Right. Right.

1468
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,840
There's like a half a second appearance where they say like and then Hordak found

1469
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:03,880
his like protege and Skeletor's on stage for half a second, then disappears,

1470
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:08,840
is not part of the story as they set it up and then only comes in afterwards to say

1471
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,760
I dispute the telling of those facts.

1472
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,320
It's propaganda.

1473
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,720
Review all sides before you judge.

1474
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,680
But then there's I think my favorite line in the whole thing is right after

1475
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:30,720
Skeletor first appears and then he says, where are you, bone face?

1476
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,840
How did you get here?

1477
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,560
Show yourself.

1478
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,480
Where are you?

1479
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:39,200
Boneface is what a dad would call like, hey, why don't you go play with your

1480
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,680
boneface figure?

1481
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:48,200
Skeletor is already like one letter off of what dad would have like that skeleton.

1482
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,000
Like, OK, well, we could change the name.

1483
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,680
And now it sounds like it's like a little bit.

1484
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,880
Dad couldn't have thought of Skeletor, an average dad.

1485
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,440
But that boneface, he has perfect peak dad.

1486
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,640
Skeletor specifically says I will destroy

1487
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,240
everyone in that arena, which shows you that they are committed to being in arenas.

1488
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:10,040
It's not an open ended venue in this.

1489
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,360
This production hall, it's like, yeah,

1490
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,040
this is an arena show for sure and really specific.

1491
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,200
And then I think there's some he man stuff about like somebody says, how is he

1492
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,000
going to destroy everybody? I don't know.

1493
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,760
But when Skeletor sets out to do something, he finds a way.

1494
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,800
I don't know. That really doesn't put the urgency there.

1495
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,880
It's you.

1496
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,440
You should if anyone knows how to deal with Skeletor, it would be you.

1497
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,800
Yeah, you don't. What do you mean?

1498
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,760
I don't know.

1499
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,480
I don't know.

1500
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,880
What's anybody's guess what he's up to?

1501
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:48,120
They build up the power race like it's like someone challenging you to a duel

1502
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,360
in medieval times like, oh, fuck, this is the way things get settled.

1503
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,000
It's definitive.

1504
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:57,680
And then but yet you're allowed to have like eight participants on each team

1505
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:02,000
and only one of them needs to win for your side to win.

1506
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,280
This is life and death.

1507
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,920
So let's real quick.

1508
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:12,520
This side of the audience cheer for the door and this side of the audience cheer.

1509
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,800
It's like medieval times also.

1510
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,320
They bring them out one by one and tell the audience to like, let them know how

1511
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:22,240
you feel about them. But it is funny that like this show hits

1512
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,760
the major characters, right, which like on the good side or he man

1513
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,960
man at arms, Tila or co.

1514
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,960
And then his parents to a lesser degree.

1515
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:35,240
And on the bad side, it is Skeletor, Beastman, Evil Lynn.

1516
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:40,520
And then everyone else in the cast is the newest line of action figures.

1517
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:44,600
Like these are not the primary supporting characters on the cartoon show.

1518
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,000
These aren't the toys the kids own.

1519
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,160
They're the toys they want them to buy.

1520
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:56,080
So it's like odd if you're a he man fan to see like a real blast put in like such

1521
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,320
a position of prominence, you know?

1522
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,360
Well, tell me who.

1523
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:03,320
Because I pulled out just my favorite ones from the program and I don't know

1524
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,920
mythology super well, so you know, it is just a good excuse to see him.

1525
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,640
Yeah. So here's Grizzlore.

1526
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,680
OK, so Grizzlore comes from the Horde.

1527
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:17,120
They were originally supposed to be a new group of villains for He-Man.

1528
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,760
And then the She-Ra team took them.

1529
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:24,880
So then She-Ra kind of had better villains than He-Man for a while.

1530
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:28,400
Oh, OK. And the toys sold really well.

1531
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:33,080
When did he learn to do like the Thriller hands?

1532
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,880
I'm like, ha ha ha.

1533
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,720
The other thing, I mean, the famous thing about He-Man was they they had like four

1534
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:42,280
sculpts, by and large, that they just reused for everything and would like

1535
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:45,840
kit bash different parts and be like, now the robot has lizard arms and his name is

1536
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:50,080
Robo Lizard, like it was just the same pieces finding ways to paint different

1537
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:54,320
colors or whatever. But Grizzlore, the action figure, looks like this,

1538
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:58,720
where it's a muscle body and then they just put fur on top of it.

1539
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,160
Oh, boy, that is aged well.

1540
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,880
That that's preserved well.

1541
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:08,200
It's not flaking off in anyone's cardboard boxes and starting to stink.

1542
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,360
Absolutely not. Yeah.

1543
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:13,520
And then just regular boots, just like kind of like, you know,

1544
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,360
hot topic sort of boots.

1545
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,280
And then this guy, really like this guy, Clamp Champ.

1546
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,160
He's good.

1547
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,240
Does anyone know the movie Laser Blast,

1548
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:28,760
the mystery science theater movie Laser Blast, where a guy gets a big clunky thing?

1549
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,760
That's a laser gun attached to his arm.

1550
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:36,160
It's like the Tomorrow War, except much bigger, entire arm.

1551
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,760
And that's kind of a clamp.

1552
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:42,040
I guess, yeah, this is his he's got a big, big old clamp on one arm.

1553
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,040
No, Clamp Champ is like a fan favorite

1554
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:48,120
because he was the only black character in the original show.

1555
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,040
So like a lot of fans had affinity for him because for a lot of people it was

1556
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,760
like their only representation.

1557
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,440
He is funny in the sense that

1558
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:01,840
so many of the He-Man characters are like otherworldly or inhuman.

1559
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:05,720
And whatever their power is, is part of their physical being.

1560
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,960
Like there's a guy named Mechaneck whose power is that he is like neck and

1561
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:15,080
telescope, like a thousand feet up in the sky, like he's like a human periscope or

1562
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,640
whatever, but it's like he's got a fucking robot neck.

1563
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:23,040
Whereas Clamp Champ just holds a thing that can clamp people.

1564
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,800
Oh, it's not even I thought this was clamped to him.

1565
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,120
That was absolutely not.

1566
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,240
It's like a thing he holds in his hand.

1567
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,280
And then from either side of this, like two pincers come out

1568
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,960
and he can sort of trap people.

1569
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:38,120
Clamp Champ is just a dude who has a weapon.

1570
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,400
Owns a good thing.

1571
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,440
OK, he owns a good thing.

1572
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:46,520
I really like that you're saying this guy's new.

1573
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,640
He's one of my all time favorites.

1574
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:54,880
He's got a freaking like robot elephant head, like a big pipe trunk.

1575
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:59,560
So this is a question amongst fans is like, is that a helmet or is he a robot

1576
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,920
elephant? Like, is that his true form or is that a mask?

1577
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,320
But he is made it don't know, probably.

1578
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,840
No, no, no.

1579
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,600
He is canonically an attorney and firefighter.

1580
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,480
Like it's the point is that he uses his

1581
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,440
snout to put out fires and the toy squirted water.

1582
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,160
Wow. Oh, that's fine.

1583
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,520
That would have been my favorite toy.

1584
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:24,480
That's why it says, yeah, a frontline attorney and warrior.

1585
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:25,920
That's not a rule.

1586
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:30,240
I was always really like as a kid, really into the toys that looked like very

1587
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:35,320
detailed or had very odd features in addition to him and like the toxic

1588
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,920
Avengers like action figures were so great.

1589
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,880
Like I kept those in such good shape

1590
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,680
because they just had such odd features to them.

1591
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:51,400
Well, that was a lot of the He-Man designers then went over to Playmates and did

1592
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,080
the Ninja Turtles line and the Toxic Crusaders line, some other lines.

1593
01:25:56,280 --> 01:26:00,920
And that was them trying to like one up He-Man and be like, what if like the poses

1594
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,480
are even more extreme and the detail is like bananas?

1595
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,040
And if you look under their foot,

1596
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,200
there are like five different objects sculpted there.

1597
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,440
Yeah, like Muck Man. Right.

1598
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,280
Turtles. Yeah. He was like a Muck Monster.

1599
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,960
Had a lot of garbage stuck to him.

1600
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,480
You remember?

1601
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:21,760
Here's we got Man at Arms and Tila.

1602
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:25,920
Man at Arms is just a great mustache dude.

1603
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,480
The musculature on these suits is also just kind of insane.

1604
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,560
Like they really have gone for,

1605
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,880
you know, in the way that people always throw out that statistic of like,

1606
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:40,000
oh, if Barbie, like if someone had Barbie's proportions in real life,

1607
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,480
they wouldn't be able to stand up. Right.

1608
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,360
They like took the musculature from the action figures and made it just as

1609
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,520
grotesque as it would look scaled up to a real human.

1610
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,800
So it just requires like a bunch of padding.

1611
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,760
It's just the most like fake sumo suit.

1612
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,120
Soft muscles.

1613
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,000
Because like nobody looks

1614
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,200
so as as mighty.

1615
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,000
Yeah, it's hard to find a bunch of people

1616
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:09,160
who are built like He-Man and She-Ra, which brings me to this point.

1617
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,400
Do we know the thing about where who those people were in the tour and where they

1618
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,760
came from? Yeah.

1619
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,720
So great story.

1620
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:17,960
We all landed on this.

1621
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,280
I think so. I mean, somebody else feel free.

1622
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:24,200
But Jack and Leslie Wadsworth

1623
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:28,560
are and by the way, Jack and Leslie Wadsworth are their names and they

1624
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:32,920
are married in real life and they met

1625
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:38,040
while portraying Conan and Red Sonja at Universal Studios Hollywood.

1626
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,040
They were in the Conan live show,

1627
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:46,600
date, met there at both as muscle people and then were married by the time they

1628
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,160
were touring the country as He-Man and She-Ra.

1629
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,800
Brother and sister who kids were often confused with their relationship

1630
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,800
played by a married couple, a happily married couple who are still married to

1631
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,520
this day. Did any of you read or hear about their wedding?

1632
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:03,760
No. Yes.

1633
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,600
Oh, that's the best.

1634
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,400
Yeah. Yeah.

1635
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,600
Jason, you want to go ahead?

1636
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,280
I don't think I see that part of the article in front of me.

1637
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,080
I'll say show us your notes.

1638
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,520
No, I just click on public.

1639
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:17,880
Oh, wait. No, I do have it.

1640
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:23,520
Universal offered to pick up the wedding tab if they would exchange vows on the set.

1641
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:28,240
The wedding album shows bride and bridegroom in the set's dungeon with

1642
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:31,240
barbarians looking on. And that's terrific.

1643
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:35,240
They got married in the Red Sonja Conan

1644
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,880
Universal stunt show.

1645
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:41,680
Universal was so charmed by the fact that they were together in real life and that

1646
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,000
they met through the show that they came to them and said, we will cover your

1647
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:49,920
entire wedding if we're allowed to make this into like a press event.

1648
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:54,480
And and Bob Mackie built her dress for her wedding.

1649
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,320
Wow.

1650
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:57,400
That's insane.

1651
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,560
And she's like, it was crazy.

1652
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,440
I was like not a girl who grew up dreaming of like my big extravagant wedding.

1653
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,400
And then I had the most extravagant wedding of anyone I know.

1654
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:12,240
I only had to pay for like the material cost of Bob Mackie's dress.

1655
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:18,520
He just all he asked me to pay for was the the materials themselves and that

1656
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,840
everything else was comped by Universal.

1657
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,000
But all my wedding photos look like they're in hell.

1658
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,640
They're in this like nightmarish set.

1659
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,680
Can we take a picture by the globe?

1660
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:34,400
No, the set, the photographer will only cover the set.

1661
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,240
That's just a reporter.

1662
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:42,000
That's like catnip for like a human interest story for Universal, for the He-Man people.

1663
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:46,000
There's a long LA Times article about this tour.

1664
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,600
It's a very funny artifact because I feel

1665
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,440
like it's pop culture reporting that isn't done nowadays because it's kind of

1666
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:57,480
like confrontation. It's kind of like, well, this is silly bullshit.

1667
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,000
That's a sinking ship, right?

1668
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,680
And it's kind of it's a little mean.

1669
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,960
And I kind of but like reporters don't write about companies like this nowadays

1670
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,840
because they would immediately get a call as soon as it hit the press.

1671
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,880
Oh, like, what the fuck did you say?

1672
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,880
We gave you free tickets, motherfucker.

1673
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,680
Like,

1674
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:20,240
but it is very funny where they're like, yeah, the show's really big and it's

1675
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:23,360
touring a lot of places, but these toys are making a lot less money.

1676
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,920
So who knows how long they'll be around for?

1677
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:32,160
Well, it is fascinating to me that the toys were cratering so fast and that this

1678
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:36,760
show was maybe the most successful element of this property ever, that, like,

1679
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:40,200
simultaneously, the two things are happening where this is the only part of

1680
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,720
the property that is succeeding.

1681
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,720
Yeah, very strange.

1682
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:49,840
It's funny, the Conan reference, because I feel like the the Conan stuff,

1683
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,480
the rights get really weird where it's like, oh, the Robert E.

1684
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,040
Howard, Robert E.

1685
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:59,960
Howard created Conan, the Red Sonja with a Y was in a Conan story,

1686
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:05,440
but Red Sonja with a J was created by Roy Thomas and Barry Windsor Smith at Marvel

1687
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:08,080
Comics, so they're sold off separately.

1688
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:11,080
Red Sonja Comics are published by one company.

1689
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,640
The others are published by Marvel at this point.

1690
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,760
And it's very bizarre.

1691
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:22,520
It's like Micronauts or He-Man where it's like the legalities of it is just totally

1692
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,000
insane. Well, He-Man is also now because

1693
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:32,760
Filmation got hired to do the cartoon show and then Filmation was bought by like

1694
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,800
company after company after company and then was bought by Classic Media,

1695
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,520
which is one of these companies that was like gobbling up every independent vintage

1696
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:47,800
cartoon or property that was out there, and then that got bought by Katzenberg and

1697
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,200
then Universal bought Dreamworks.

1698
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:59,280
So like Universal owns part of the He-Man rights and then Mattel owns the other part.

1699
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:03,040
And some characters are in one silo and some are in the other.

1700
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:08,040
And some of like the imagery or the music can only be used by one party or this or

1701
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:13,000
that like this feels like the last moment, maybe where everything's kind of like in

1702
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,240
one place and everyone's working together happily.

1703
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,880
Yeah, right.

1704
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,280
Because, yeah, I mean, there's all this.

1705
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:22,320
I think I talked on the Turtles is like that all of a sudden when Nickelode or

1706
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:27,440
Viacom, but Turtles, it was trying to get all the rights from the various places

1707
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,120
because of how confusing it was.

1708
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:33,200
So the characters created in the Archie comics, they'd have to go to the guy who

1709
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:36,960
was writing and the guy drawing and get the rights for like, say,

1710
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:38,880
Raphael's girlfriend Ninjara.

1711
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:42,640
And then the writer would say, no, I'm not selling you the rights to

1712
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:46,840
Raphael's girlfriend Ninjara, the sexy female Ninja Fox.

1713
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,280
And he still owns it to this day, I believe.

1714
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,680
Like Oracle was created by Filmation.

1715
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:56,680
Oracle was not in the toy line or any of the comics first.

1716
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:01,960
But Mattel seems to have a lot of leeway and control over Oracle,

1717
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:06,800
whereas there are certainly characters that were Filmation only that like can't

1718
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,080
be touched unless there's an additional license taken out.

1719
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:13,360
But also, I know like the the show,

1720
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:20,240
the show that I'm on, Revelation, is primarily produced by Mattel with Netflix.

1721
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:26,240
But then the She-Ra cartoon, which was also for Netflix, was produced by Dreamworks

1722
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,920
animation and not Mattel.

1723
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,520
It's very confusing. Everything is very confusing.

1724
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:36,680
And part of it is that I think more of She-Ra was developed by Filmation

1725
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,400
and Concert Together, whereas He-Man and the toys were already on the shelf before

1726
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:43,000
they brought them on to do the cartoon.

1727
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,760
But like, yeah, it's the question I've been having to answer for the last year

1728
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:52,520
and a half, which is like, oh, the show I'm on is not connected to the Netflix She-Ra.

1729
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:57,400
And the Wright's answer is so boring and convoluted, it's not worth answering.

1730
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,960
So the easier answer is this shows a continuation of the original 80s cartoon,

1731
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,520
which is in the same continuity with the 80s She-Ra cartoon.

1732
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:08,200
So technically it's connected to that She-Ra as opposed to the new She-Ra,

1733
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,480
which is a new reboot.

1734
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,160
There is a theme park connection in the midst of this.

1735
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:17,920
2018 She-Ra was briefly in Universal Studios Islands of Adventure in the Lost

1736
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:22,480
Continent taking pictures a few years ago, like when that come out.

1737
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:23,680
2018, I think.

1738
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:26,920
Yeah. So around there, there was a walk around She-Ra.

1739
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:32,400
Universal seems to have a lot more free reign with what they can do with She-Ra

1740
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:37,040
without Mattel's permission versus He-Man, where it's like

1741
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,600
Universal owns these cartoons.

1742
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,880
They don't own the characters.

1743
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:49,200
It's also complicated and it's why everything needs to merge so that all

1744
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,120
properties can be in one convenient server verse.

1745
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:57,800
Just, you know, something as clean as and understandable as Warner 3000,

1746
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:03,360
where algae rhythm reigns supreme and can dictate what properties everyone makes.

1747
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,320
God, it just make life so much better.

1748
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:07,280
Wouldn't be very easy.

1749
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:12,400
I was thinking and I didn't find anything about this because I wonder if like by

1750
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,160
the time Turtles rolls around, if it's like they've learned.

1751
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:19,720
I wonder if this was brought up in the meetings because Turtles is so much more

1752
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:23,160
synergy. The tape was being sold at Pizza Hut.

1753
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,880
It was an immediate quick show.

1754
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:28,760
Obviously, the tapes, VHS tapes, not the audio cassettes were also being sold

1755
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,840
multiple. I have the making of VHS.

1756
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:34,040
I have the actual first performance of it.

1757
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:37,280
And I wonder if Masters of the Universe, they were thinking like they're going to

1758
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:42,080
do the Jay Leno stand up comedy idea of like, you know, don't ever put it on video

1759
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,640
because people won't come out to see it.

1760
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:50,560
Like it was that they're thinking because it's crazy for a property for toys that's

1761
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,800
all about selling people things and merchandise and souvenirs from that live

1762
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
show. I wonder if that was their thought process with it.

1763
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,400
Like we want people to come see this music.

1764
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:02,640
We don't want them to be able to.

1765
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:05,440
They'll never come if they have an audio cassette of it.

1766
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,240
You have to imagine that was the thought.

1767
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:12,240
And I guess also that by the time the tour was done and I guess they would have

1768
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:16,880
released the video now that it wasn't cutting into the tour, the thing was pretty

1769
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:20,040
much dead. You know, like, yeah, I guess it's all of it at once.

1770
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:23,360
The demand to even have the remnant of the record of this.

1771
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,360
Right. Like the other thing is Turtles.

1772
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:31,160
I do think Turtles learned a lot of lessons from He-Man, which like blew up so

1773
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:34,000
quickly and then burned out relatively fast.

1774
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:37,120
Another one is like Turtles has been so

1775
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:42,160
consistent with reinventing itself, and even if every reinvention doesn't work,

1776
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:46,520
they sort of understand like if your thing's been around for five years.

1777
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:51,000
I heard some watch some fucking YouTube video or some toy executive was explaining

1778
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:59,040
this. But like when when kids realize like I'm five years old and this thing's

1779
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:04,520
been around for five years and the older kids are into it, I don't own this anymore.

1780
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:07,720
Like this is some old cartoon that's predated me.

1781
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:13,520
You need like a new version every like six years so that new kids can come in on

1782
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,480
the ground floor. Right.

1783
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:16,560
Yes, that makes sense.

1784
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:20,960
I mean, in my kid brain, it was like, oh, man, Turtles was gone for a while.

1785
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,320
But Turtles, they did next mutation with Venus de Bilo, like right after the first

1786
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,400
original cartoon.

1787
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:30,720
Like the original cartoon is like eight seasons, nine seasons.

1788
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,240
I mean, it was like a healthy run.

1789
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,840
But the next mutation actually.

1790
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:34,960
Yeah, Jesus.

1791
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:38,720
Yeah. But next mutation is only like a year or two later.

1792
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:42,200
And then there was that reboot in 2003,

1793
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,640
which it's like that's the longest they were ever dark, it felt like.

1794
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,320
And that was five years.

1795
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,000
Right. Well, and like, say, Power Rangers never stopped.

1796
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,800
I mean, that's a totally different.

1797
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,520
It's like they'll make a season in Japan.

1798
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:58,640
Right. Fly the costumes to not America.

1799
01:37:58,840 --> 01:37:59,840
I think it's New Zealand.

1800
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:05,640
And then they will make a totally different story, a totally different set

1801
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,480
of rules of like, all right, we have these costumes and we have footage where the

1802
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:13,280
Zords are trains and then they become fighting robots.

1803
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:14,720
How do we do this?

1804
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,480
It's because of the weird way in which that show is made.

1805
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:22,920
But I do think it sort of provided that model that everyone else has copied now

1806
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:27,240
where you just need like even these Netflix cartoon shows.

1807
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:32,280
I noticed that like season two will have an entirely different title than the first

1808
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:36,320
season, you know, they never position something as like it's season two of this

1809
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:40,200
show, it's this show, colon, new subtitle.

1810
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:41,960
You know?

1811
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,640
Yeah, it's interesting.

1812
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,480
I don't know.

1813
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:47,000
I'm trying to think about what's the most modern version.

1814
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,360
I guess it's hard because you need to have

1815
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,160
some property that's been around for like 20 years.

1816
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,680
But like because I know like modern

1817
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:57,080
cartoons and stuff, you know, they're still trying to screw people over.

1818
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,960
And it's like they like to end something

1819
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:02,680
at season three before they can renegotiate contracts,

1820
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,600
unless it's very, very popular and then they will bring it back and then milk it

1821
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,960
forever. It's like a weird.

1822
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:14,680
No, I feel like there's also this thing with like I think it happens a lot with

1823
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,920
superhero cartoons where like, oh, they'll do a Spider-Man cartoon and like everyone

1824
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,880
will flock to it and be like, this is the best one.

1825
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:23,160
They finally gotten it right.

1826
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,720
And then they cancel it after three

1827
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:28,080
seasons and immediately announce a new show, which is on the year nine months later.

1828
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:30,160
And they're like, why did you cancel that?

1829
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:34,040
Everyone loved that it was working and they were like, time for a new Spider-Man.

1830
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:37,680
Like, it's just like, what can you say every three years?

1831
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,160
New Spider-Man. Like these things just they don't let them linger.

1832
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:42,560
And I think the same thing happened

1833
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,200
with Ninja Turtles where there was like the Nickelodeon reboot that was going over

1834
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:52,080
very well, then they canceled it somewhat abruptly and then did Rise of the Teenage

1835
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,200
Mutant Ninja Turtles, which was very well liked, but didn't connect.

1836
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:58,280
And then that just ended like kind of in failure.

1837
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,360
Like they just canceled it for low ratings.

1838
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,720
And everyone was kind of left saying, like, why wouldn't you have kept the earlier

1839
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,880
show on the air? It wasn't losing steam.

1840
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:11,440
But it feels like now these companies don't want to let things get to the point of He-Man.

1841
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,720
Like you have to reboot it before the audience starts dipping.

1842
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:19,120
Well, yeah, with Turtle and with I'm sure with all this stuff and maybe I'm not sure,

1843
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:24,240
but I think this is what I think this is what I know is that it's like they're like,

1844
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:27,120
you know what? The ratings aren't going to be if we just do a new version,

1845
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:29,080
the ratings are going to be pretty similar.

1846
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,840
Yeah. So as long as they're pretty similar,

1847
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,560
we don't have to renegotiate contracts for all the people that are making this

1848
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,800
who are going to want more money because they're doing a good job.

1849
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,680
So we tell them to fuck off.

1850
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,800
We get a bunch of new people for less money.

1851
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,240
And by and large, the ratings are going to probably hover around the same place.

1852
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,960
And if they're not cancel it and try another one.

1853
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:53,520
I think merch is a big part of it, too, where it's like we have sold 18 versions

1854
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:59,200
of Donatello in this design style and we've done the entire supporting cast now.

1855
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,280
Like the kids have them all.

1856
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:04,560
We need to reboot it and redesign everybody.

1857
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:07,320
So there's a reason to rebuy all the characters.

1858
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,160
Yes. Three seasons is like a very there's

1859
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:16,080
an economic reason why companies are stopping things there.

1860
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,040
Right. And if you get to five, it's like a blockbuster.

1861
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:22,160
And they're like, we let you stay longer than we should have.

1862
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,120
Now, please gracefully leave.

1863
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,960
You're lucky. You're lucky that we let you do this.

1864
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:31,440
Well, and it seemed like He-Man had some of the like behind the scenes, like the

1865
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:35,720
writers, like the big name, like that.

1866
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,840
I remembered this about He-Man.

1867
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:41,800
And I double checked it and I never know how to pronounce this name because I always

1868
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,640
just read it, J. Michael Strazinski.

1869
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:45,840
I think that's right.

1870
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:51,360
Yeah, he was the main writer on it or at least one of the best writers on it.

1871
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:54,520
Yes. And then was Paul Dini on it, too?

1872
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,040
Correct. Yeah.

1873
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:58,160
And so Strazinski left eventually.

1874
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:02,760
And he was writing on like a million cartoons and stuff eventually creates

1875
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:08,080
Babylon 5 does a very well received like five years on the Amazing Spider-Man

1876
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,880
comics somewhere down the line, writes the script for the Changeling.

1877
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:15,200
Is that what it's called? The Clint Eastwood Angelina Tully movie?

1878
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:16,280
Yes.

1879
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:21,080
So there are people certainly like, you know, came out of the He-Man world.

1880
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,000
People went on to other careers.

1881
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:29,320
Well, and I think that's, you know, why there is affinity for the cartoon show,

1882
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:32,600
because there are a lot of things that are easily mockable in it.

1883
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:39,200
And it was produced very on a very thrifty sort of way.

1884
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:42,680
And there were famously all these regulations about what they couldn't

1885
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,160
couldn't do with the show at the time,

1886
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:49,240
because it was like when the government was fighting against the idea of cartoon

1887
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:53,160
shows just being commercials for toys, which they absolutely were.

1888
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,560
And also like whether

1889
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,200
cartoons were perverse influence on children.

1890
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:03,360
So like He-Man's an action show where the characters can never really fight.

1891
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:08,240
He-Man has a sword that he never once uses in a single episode.

1892
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,560
He's never allowed to swing it at anybody.

1893
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,000
He's never allowed to stab anybody.

1894
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:17,960
I think he can only use it for deflection, like he can only use it to block

1895
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:20,240
and then he uses it for his transformation.

1896
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:25,440
But like the fighting on He-Man is almost always one guy gets behind another guy

1897
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,120
and gets him in a bear hug

1898
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:32,480
until the other guy pleads uncle.

1899
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,760
This is another problem.

1900
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,760
I think the turtles, I mean, I think government regulations,

1901
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,240
but the turtles solve the problem with robots because like, how are you going to

1902
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:46,200
have Leonardo use his sword unless these are not humans or living beings?

1903
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:50,880
Right. They have some robots like Horde Troopers and Skeletor has robots.

1904
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:56,800
But I think they were always so invested in trying to sell the new characters,

1905
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:06,560
you know, that like they didn't have as sticky a sort of like army as the foot soldiers.

1906
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:09,160
But what was I going to say? Oh, yeah, these people come to it,

1907
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:13,040
these comic writers and these animation writers cutting their teeth who like

1908
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:18,000
really have grand ambition, the type of genre storytelling they'd like to do.

1909
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,800
And they start imbuing it with a weird

1910
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,760
amount of thought and consideration.

1911
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:26,200
You know, so it's like this shoe, the show produced on a shoestring to sell toys

1912
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,960
with a mythology that doesn't make any sense.

1913
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:28,560
A guy like J.

1914
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,760
Michael Strazinski come in there and go like, but can we like actually turn this

1915
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,600
into something? Right.

1916
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,320
Yeah, that's what I always like.

1917
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:40,640
Anytime I'm complaining about any any modern day movie, I haven't seen Space Jam

1918
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:44,080
2, maybe I'm going to love it. I would love to love it.

1919
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,560
I would love to be the contrarian.

1920
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:48,360
It's a very pure good movie made for the right reasons.

1921
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:50,240
And you get to see some of your friends,

1922
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:52,280
you know, you get to see your friends at least.

1923
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:55,440
Jabberjaw, but ultimately in the background, McGilligarilla.

1924
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:58,640
I am excited to see McGilligarilla.

1925
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:02,000
But anytime like any of this stuff that we would see as kids.

1926
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,760
And I know you're like even just professionals going in and seeing

1927
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:07,680
character designs, you go, I could make something cool out of this.

1928
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,200
These characters are really awesome.

1929
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:13,080
But especially as like kids, it's like it doesn't even matter that some of this

1930
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,400
stuff sucks like you watch old turtle cartoon.

1931
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,800
I don't give a shit. Like it's bad.

1932
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:18,720
The show is bad.

1933
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:22,920
I own all these toys because visually this was making me think this show is

1934
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:25,080
fantastic and it was not.

1935
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:29,000
But that's what anytime I'm complaining about, like any modern version of a thing

1936
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,960
I liked as a kid, I'm like there's like eight year olds watching this.

1937
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,360
And this is maybe the greatest thing they've ever seen.

1938
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,760
Sure. Like they're not worried about a certain character not being treated the

1939
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,200
way I think they should be treated.

1940
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,960
They don't give a shit about that.

1941
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:47,760
But I do think it's funny and interesting how like humans view like all of this

1942
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:49,920
stuff that's made cynically.

1943
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:51,720
And I guess this is what our whole show is about.

1944
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,640
Stuff that's a product and made cynically.

1945
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,040
But like we all feel it's real magical.

1946
01:45:56,160 --> 01:46:00,200
And some of it you can look back on it and it's not it's not magical at all other

1947
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:04,160
than just your child brain memory of it and wanting to see it.

1948
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:11,320
I think part of being a healthy appreciator of these things is learning to accept like

1949
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,640
the goofiness of it when it exists, the crumminess of it, the craveness of it.

1950
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,200
Like all these things are part of it.

1951
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:22,200
And sometimes the parts come together and create some greater whole, you know,

1952
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:27,840
that does transcend like its intentions or has some meaning for you or whatever it is.

1953
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:31,400
Like this is I mean this genuinely.

1954
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,920
This is not just me trying to sell a show.

1955
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:38,000
But like I work so hard to try to get cast as work going to show.

1956
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:43,080
Right. I do these audition tapes in my closet where I'm playing every single

1957
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:47,680
character to show them like how invested I am because I didn't have anyone to read

1958
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:51,800
with me and then I get the part and I realize I haven't read the scripts.

1959
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,720
And I have no idea if this thing is good or not.

1960
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:54,320
Right.

1961
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,920
And I'm a fan.

1962
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,040
And there's that worry where you're just like, am I going to read this and think

1963
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:04,480
this is dog shit and now I'm orco on the dog shit show and I have to just kind of

1964
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:05,920
stay quiet for a while.

1965
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:11,320
And the thing that I genuinely love about the scripts that was such a relief for me

1966
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:16,680
was sort of I've been told that the idea was like this is the show for people who

1967
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:21,640
grew up with the cartoon. The idea is like the way it felt when you were watching it

1968
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,880
as a little kid and everything felt important to you.

1969
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:29,760
Can you make a show at that level where the stakes are real, the budget is higher,

1970
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:33,960
the scripts have more time to be polished.

1971
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,800
You're able to actually show fight scenes,

1972
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:39,160
but you're able to sort of like put the emotional depth into the things that you

1973
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,520
projected as a child, but maybe weren't fully formed.

1974
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,040
And that was what they were saying.

1975
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:49,240
And my fear was, is this going to be like overly self-serious?

1976
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:53,840
The thing that I think all four of us dislike, where it's like trying to make

1977
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:56,960
fans of a thing feel less guilty for liking a thing.

1978
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,440
Right.

1979
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:59,480
Yes, it's real stakes.

1980
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,480
Insecure.

1981
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:06,520
You can feel how insecure some things it's like, no, this is this is deathly serious.

1982
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,280
The chest puffiness of it.

1983
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:15,440
And like the thing I love about this show is that I think it is so in touch with

1984
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:18,520
everything that is incredibly goofy about the original cartoon,

1985
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:22,680
not just in terms of where it puts the humor in, but like which elements it

1986
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:28,560
embraces, it's not like shunting anything that was too silly, you know,

1987
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,760
in a way that I think a lot of these modern things go like, well,

1988
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,920
you have to drop that character. That character wouldn't work.

1989
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:34,200
You can't do this.

1990
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,760
You know, that lines a problem.

1991
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,160
They sort of like without spoiling anything.

1992
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:42,800
And I guess some people might have watched it by this point, but they like they found

1993
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,520
a thing in the original show that is fucked up if you think about it,

1994
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:51,560
that like would be like a cracked article, right, where you're like, huh,

1995
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:53,840
there's this like weird plot line on this kid's show.

1996
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,720
If you actually think about it, that's kind of fucked up that the characters did

1997
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:02,080
this and they just kind of invested in that being a real thing and like wrote

1998
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:08,040
this 10 episode season that is about like the emotional and larger fallout

1999
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:12,760
of that situation, but, you know, are trying to do the show that you imagine

2000
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:15,240
when you were a kid, but something I think kids would also enjoy watching

2001
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:19,760
and something that is also like completely unembarrassed about how silly this thing

2002
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:24,520
is and where it came from is trying to keep those two things in conversation

2003
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:28,480
at the same time, which is which is what I find very exciting about it.

2004
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:32,600
And once again, if I thought it was dogshit, I would just say nothing.

2005
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,040
This is my genuine opinion.

2006
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:35,480
You don't have to promote anything.

2007
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:37,440
Right. People might disagree with me.

2008
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:41,360
And it gets into this thing we're talking about here, where fans get very

2009
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:43,360
territorial, like that's not my version.

2010
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:44,720
That's not what I liked about it.

2011
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:47,080
I only like this era and these characters and whatever.

2012
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,240
You're never going to make a thing that everyone likes.

2013
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:52,400
And also we live in an era now where everything gets rebooted every five years,

2014
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:56,160
as we're saying. So it's like there are already people who are upset about what

2015
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:57,360
they think this show is going to be.

2016
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,760
I think some of them will watch it, be pleasantly surprised.

2017
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,080
Some of them watch it and they'll hate it.

2018
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:05,440
But guess what? Like Netflix has another He-Man show coming out this year.

2019
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:06,160
For kids.

2020
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:11,320
And they're trying to make a live action movie and they'll do a thousand more

2021
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:14,320
things like none of this stuff is sacred anymore.

2022
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:18,680
I do think at a certain point, being

2023
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:25,360
an adult nerd is learning to accept that, like, for so long, we had this very

2024
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:28,760
clenched territorial position of like,

2025
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,960
they're only going to get to make one Batman movie.

2026
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,920
And if they fuck it up, then Batman will never get to be a movie again.

2027
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,240
You know, that pressure.

2028
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:38,200
And it's like, fuck, Burton did it.

2029
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:39,320
It worked. It worked.

2030
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:40,600
But now it's Schumacher.

2031
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:41,360
And then that bombed.

2032
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:42,880
Fuck, we're never going to get Batman.

2033
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,720
Schumacher ruined Batman forever.

2034
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,640
And now it's like he ruined Batman and Robin.

2035
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:51,120
Well, and then it was perfect.

2036
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:52,880
He made a perfect movie with Batman

2037
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:56,720
forever, and then he made Batman and Robin, which I still like.

2038
01:50:56,920 --> 01:51:02,160
At this point, you're just like, like, I used to be so anti-Snyder just on a level

2039
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,000
of just like, this is not my vibe.

2040
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Yes, I agree.

2041
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,240
And I switched. I completely switched.

2042
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:09,120
Because I'm just like, you know what?

2043
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:10,760
Let this guy make his thing.

2044
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,000
It's not for me.

2045
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,760
I appreciate what he's doing in the same way.

2046
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,680
I read fucking comic books.

2047
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,600
And if I don't like one Batman arc, I'm like, well, OK.

2048
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:22,480
And then a new writer will come on and negate all of it and do their own thing.

2049
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:23,920
Whatever. Who cares?

2050
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,240
Yes, I am 100 percent.

2051
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,280
I was feeling the same way.

2052
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:28,520
I was like, oh, this is just going to be all of the DC.

2053
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:29,680
It's all going to feel like this.

2054
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,000
Oh, man. Come on.

2055
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:32,960
Like, I don't want it to be so bleak or whatever.

2056
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:37,320
And I'm like, there's going to be another one next year who gives a shit.

2057
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:39,240
And then I watched them again now in that context.

2058
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:44,040
And I'm like, there's a lot to enjoy with this nonsense, with this bleak nonsense.

2059
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:49,760
And I think if you're going to be a healthy fan of anything, you have to learn

2060
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:54,880
to love your songsters, you know, like the songsters aren't the things you hide.

2061
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:58,960
You have to accept that's part of the weird history of the thing.

2062
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,680
It's what I like about Masters of the Inverse is that it was such an accident

2063
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:07,240
that these things get like pieced together in reverse, you know, that like

2064
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,040
you cannot claim the sanctity of the thing.

2065
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,600
Well, I think you got to do like two things.

2066
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:13,800
You got to play it straight.

2067
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,880
You know, you got to like, you know,

2068
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:19,720
be a little respectful to what's come before and like play in the world.

2069
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,600
But then also you have to have fun with it.

2070
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:24,800
And like part of my engaging with stuff and having fun with stuff,

2071
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,720
it's like teasing the goofiness.

2072
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:31,320
Like, I feel like on this show, like people sometimes a bit like, oh, well,

2073
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,040
they hate that. I was like, I don't hate that.

2074
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:34,720
I love that. I would rather be on this

2075
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:38,080
attraction than running errands my day to day life.

2076
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:39,720
But it's a little goofy.

2077
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,160
Like there's some corny shit in it.

2078
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:46,800
But yeah, I think the fun sometimes,

2079
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,720
you know, I think I think especially the Marvel stuff, they're starting to branch

2080
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:54,360
out a lot more in the movies and TV shows and add more characters.

2081
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,080
And

2082
01:52:56,280 --> 01:53:00,560
but but I think some of the shortcomings like like rough, it's like, all right,

2083
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,640
you've set up too many rules like you're not playing it straight.

2084
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,960
You're not honoring your your you set up too many restrictions for yourself.

2085
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:10,160
And you don't seem like you're having fun.

2086
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:11,720
You seem like you're checking out boxes.

2087
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:15,560
Yeah. And like you have to have.

2088
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:20,080
If not embrace the goofy elements, you have to at least sort of accept them

2089
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:23,360
as being like part of the whole of this thing, right?

2090
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:27,520
At the very least, the evolution of this thing, the different eras of these things,

2091
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:32,280
whatever these odd elements are, be they a theme park ride or, you know,

2092
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:37,880
a cartoon show or a toy line or whatever it is, rather than starting a change.org

2093
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:44,360
petition to ask that it be officially taken out of continuity because it's like

2094
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:48,200
sometimes the best shit comes out of people course correcting after something

2095
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:52,240
that's unpopular, the answer isn't that no longer counts.

2096
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,720
It's unofficial. Never acknowledge it ever again.

2097
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:58,280
It's like what what can we learn from what didn't work here?

2098
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,400
And when you step back, you can like

2099
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:05,560
appreciate Adam West and Michael Keaton equally for doing different things.

2100
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:11,520
And like, you know, that's that's part of the beauty of the stupid shit we care about a lot.

2101
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,880
Yes, it's just

2102
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:19,040
seeing anyone who's like like religious and dogmatic is really isn't, as I said,

2103
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:24,400
on those Facebook groups I'm on, it's you'd be surprised how many people get very upset.

2104
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:28,720
I'm not surprised. I mean, I mean, you wouldn't be surprised.

2105
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:31,080
Are you in the man? Are you I don't maybe I'm outing you.

2106
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:32,600
I shouldn't even say which I do.

2107
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,760
You tell me off air which I look around.

2108
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,720
I look around some things. Yeah.

2109
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:38,920
Yeah. Yeah.

2110
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:41,840
I look around. I mean, I and I have forever.

2111
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,920
You know, I just feel like

2112
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:51,000
I don't want to harp on this, but it's weird because there was no new he man stuff for a while.

2113
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:56,440
Right. And in that time, fandom has curdled.

2114
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:02,200
And I feel like these message boards and these websites and these groups and whatever

2115
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:05,040
that I used to lurk, I was never a big poster, but I would read these things

2116
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:08,320
and I would be like abreast of what fans thought were responding to things.

2117
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,800
There'd be disagreements about things.

2118
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:10,720
People dislike stuff.

2119
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:12,880
They'd get up in arms about toys and whatever.

2120
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:20,680
It's like it's not like it was entirely civil and serene, but there there is this weird

2121
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:28,560
aggro defensive paranoia about this new show, about whatever the kids show is going to be,

2122
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:35,720
where there's this it's an extension of the Kathy Kennedy shit where people want to buy

2123
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:41,760
into this idea that like whatever is being rebooted is being rebooted by like OCP

2124
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,880
and Dick Jones is behind the boardroom and he's like, I want people to die.

2125
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,880
I don't care. And 209 has to succeed.

2126
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:50,080
It doesn't matter.

2127
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:54,720
You know, like like there's a conspiratorial attack and resentment of fans.

2128
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:59,280
There's like, yeah, there's like whoever's posting is like he really thinks like

2129
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:03,160
Kathleen Kennedy is like, I want to punish Ben from Missouri.

2130
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,680
I want him.

2131
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:07,120
I want him to feel pain.

2132
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,240
I hate Ben.

2133
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:10,000
I hate that Ben likes Luke.

2134
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:11,520
And so I'm going to cuck Luke.

2135
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:12,840
So Ben feels bad.

2136
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,040
Like they truly were not exaggerate.

2137
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:18,680
You see people post these videos and they're creating like narratives about like

2138
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:21,200
this is the fight going on within Lucasfilm.

2139
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:23,120
Oh, I know exactly who you're talking about.

2140
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:24,520
I know exactly the videos.

2141
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:28,560
These people are claiming Kathleen Kennedy did not want Luke Skywalker to be

2142
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:32,360
in the Mandalorian spoiler for a season two finale that came out fucking nine

2143
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:37,760
months ago and that everywhere that Jon Favreau smuggled him onto set.

2144
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,640
And Kathy Kennedy didn't know about it and was outraged and wanted to smuggle

2145
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:43,720
him into the previs department.

2146
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,040
Well, what the fuck are you talking about?

2147
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:48,360
He was digitally rendered.

2148
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:49,760
What are you talking about?

2149
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:54,160
The guy you're talking about makes videos every week about this.

2150
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:56,280
Yes. And like that Jon Jon.

2151
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:59,360
He calls him Jon Favreau, first of all, which always funny to me.

2152
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:03,600
And he's like, it's just like it's like he's like physically battling Kathleen

2153
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:06,480
Kennedy, like it's Kathleen Kennedy and Brie Larson.

2154
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:10,720
And now there's a different channel that once a week has been doing anti

2155
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:14,480
mo to revelation stuff. Oh, and no.

2156
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:16,920
All right. Look, Griffin, you get you got a pick.

2157
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:20,240
You either get the super fans who love this stuff or you get the weird

2158
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:24,200
moralistic teens who are doing like tipper gore shit.

2159
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:25,760
And it's like, I don't know.

2160
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:30,160
I think he man revelation is like, oh, that's kind of weird.

2161
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:34,320
It's look, it's a it's a it's a tough choice.

2162
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:40,000
And ultimately, I try not I try to focus on the people who seem to be enjoying

2163
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,600
things in a healthy way.

2164
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,360
It is just

2165
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:49,800
frustrating to see people doing that sort of like

2166
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,640
rumor mongering and projecting of what they think is going on behind the scenes

2167
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:58,280
and knowing for a fact, it's false.

2168
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,480
Like with Kathy Kennedy, I know it's false

2169
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:04,600
because I am a reasonable human being who understands how the world works.

2170
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:09,960
And someone does not take over Lucasfilm and go, my job is to destroy this.

2171
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:14,560
I want this to fail so that boys feel bad.

2172
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,960
But I don't want to keep having money.

2173
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:19,040
My mission is pain now.

2174
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:24,040
I mean, I saw a website that claimed that Disney literally has decided not to care

2175
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:29,080
about money and to instead let all these properties fail to advance the woke

2176
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:34,120
agenda. And it's like, if that's what they said at the last meeting, we were all at

2177
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,680
the last media meeting. We were all there.

2178
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:41,960
If you just typed out the sentence, Disney doesn't even care about money anymore,

2179
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,520
you should take a really long look in the mirror.

2180
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:45,480
The woke.

2181
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:49,320
Oh, by the way, I want everyone to be reminded that the woke agenda means on a

2182
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:52,280
piece of paper, it says Loki is bisexual.

2183
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:55,760
Yes, that's what reflected in the series.

2184
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,600
It's no, not yet.

2185
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:05,080
That's like people are projecting into the fact like Tila has a different haircut

2186
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:10,600
and that Orko has eyes that they think look more feminine on this version of the show.

2187
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,200
And then your ass is grass.

2188
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:14,280
My ass is grass.

2189
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:18,960
And they're producing like 40 minute videos of their conjecture of what they think

2190
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:23,240
is being like planned out in a boardroom to punish people who grew up with this

2191
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:27,480
stuff. And it's just wild.

2192
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:34,480
So the character who is on this live tour in skating around in a dress, they are

2193
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:38,800
worried about some femininity entering.

2194
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:39,440
Yeah.

2195
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:42,880
And this is like a character that half of them found annoying in the first place.

2196
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:47,680
And I say this as someone who loved him dearly and did not find him annoying.

2197
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:50,720
Orko, the winner of the attorney in race, right?

2198
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:53,000
The best roller skater.

2199
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,760
I mean, you got to feel good about that.

2200
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:56,200
You must have been on pins and needles.

2201
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:57,200
I feel incredible.

2202
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:59,680
I mean, he's got he's got some hits in the show.

2203
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:04,720
He also has his number where he's trying to make magic work saying hocus shocus.

2204
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:07,360
And it keeps on failing until he does

2205
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:09,840
successfully conjure up a dancer.

2206
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:15,720
His magic is conjuring one dancer added to all the dancers that are already on stage.

2207
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:19,680
And then in the attorney in circus, he comes out in a different outfit,

2208
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:24,200
like a different robe and is like the co ringleader.

2209
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:26,040
The attorney in circus stuff like sucks, by the way.

2210
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:28,080
We didn't talk about it, but it's just they parade out.

2211
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:29,360
I never found it.

2212
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:30,560
What is it?

2213
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:36,040
Dumb animals like it's all these like the actors who were playing the actual heroes

2214
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:41,240
and villains you like in the first act of the show are now in like two part four

2215
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:45,160
people, eight legged like this is an attorney in giraffe.

2216
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:49,200
That's like very to rook the avatar like Cirque du Soleil.

2217
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:51,520
I feel like a little more like to rook.

2218
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:57,120
It also feels a little like the weird circus number in the Star Wars Holiday

2219
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:59,240
Special. Oh, yeah.

2220
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:04,320
Where it's just like kind of a long parade of like, here's a new species on

2221
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:08,120
attorney, our elephants have four trunks or whatever.

2222
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:12,240
It's a songster and orco like spinning around singing the same song, showing off

2223
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:14,040
these crappy costumes.

2224
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:18,640
And then the show finally kind of rebounds in the last 15 minutes and Skeletor comes

2225
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:20,920
out and they actually like do the fight.

2226
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:24,000
Then there's like the big fucking fight that everyone's been waiting for.

2227
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:25,680
Nobody is that on YouTube.

2228
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:27,080
I never found the fight.

2229
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,960
It's also I only saw a lot of skating.

2230
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:32,200
Yeah, the fights hard to find.

2231
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:33,560
Once again, it's label.

2232
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:38,600
It's a video that I think is labeled VTS 0 1 3.

2233
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:39,680
Oh, yeah.

2234
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:42,880
Well, I guess I don't feel bad about not finding it then.

2235
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:43,960
Yeah.

2236
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:49,720
And it's really, really low quality and it's statics out pretty early.

2237
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:52,720
But yeah, the first half of the show is definitely better.

2238
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:57,160
The second half is way too much attorney in circus.

2239
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:58,320
What the hell is this?

2240
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,520
I'm looking at this synopsis.

2241
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:06,880
He man, I just saw the sentence he man fights all three Skeletor's.

2242
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:10,600
He beats the fake ones and eventually finds the real one.

2243
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,440
Yeah, we have multiple Skeletor's around.

2244
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:16,240
It's like a magical decoy thing.

2245
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:17,920
Yeah.

2246
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:19,520
Can I have it on your show?

2247
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:21,360
Fake Skeletor? Yeah, they're fake Skeletor's.

2248
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:23,320
No spoilers.

2249
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:28,560
There aren't their decoy versions of other characters.

2250
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:32,680
Oh, can I ask who's by on the show?

2251
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,280
Well, I want to be mad.

2252
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:35,520
I want to get mad about that.

2253
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:36,320
All of them.

2254
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:39,680
If you ask Clownfish TV on YouTube, everyone is by.

2255
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:40,880
OK, all right.

2256
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:42,280
Shove down our throats.

2257
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,080
Got it.

2258
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:46,560
Seriously, maybe this is a question off the air.

2259
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:52,760
Internally, are you trying to push for a new tour, a new live show that you could

2260
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:56,640
be a part of? I would love nothing more.

2261
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:01,080
I'd love nothing more because I've been trying to nudge my way into Turtles for

2262
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:05,960
years and I would be the most annoying person if I had even like a one line on an

2263
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:10,080
episode. I'd be like, I would try to get everyone's email and be like, no, we should do.

2264
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:13,640
I've really like the amount of energy I've

2265
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:18,560
had to spend keeping my cool about this mic, like when I'm in the professional

2266
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:21,440
settings and the job,

2267
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:26,160
I mean, because it like I I become very

2268
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:29,960
quickly overcome within the terror of what if I fuck this up?

2269
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:30,760
Right.

2270
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:34,560
So like a lot of that like nerdy, like can I ram myself into this and pitch a

2271
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:39,320
thousand ideas shit goes out the window because I'm just like, oh, what if I suck

2272
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:44,480
at this? I just need to be laser focused, at least doing the things they're asking

2273
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:46,320
me to do. Right.

2274
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:52,840
But I also would voice or go in anything like I would do anything.

2275
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:57,480
You would do like a 90s city tour of arenas playing or go on stage.

2276
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:58,400
Absolutely.

2277
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:00,760
In the suit with your face not visible.

2278
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:02,080
Yeah, you wouldn't be seen.

2279
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:03,880
It would just be your voice. Right.

2280
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:07,680
Like the the other the sort of kids modern

2281
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:10,680
reboot show for Netflix that's coming out later.

2282
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:14,000
I looked into like playing or go on that and they're like, no, it's a different

2283
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,200
show. It's a different continuity.

2284
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:18,040
But I was like, but what if I just played or go on everything?

2285
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:22,480
What if I just sure they claim to this?

2286
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:26,280
So you saw your soft your soft

2287
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:29,400
like touching the boundary, touching the boundaries lightly.

2288
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:32,880
I mean, that conclusively didn't work, but I have tested.

2289
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:34,440
I have tested. Yes.

2290
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:38,040
So maybe live tour is not something you could get done right now.

2291
02:04:38,240 --> 02:04:40,720
I push for it, certainly.

2292
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:44,440
I mean, I think it depends on what the response is to this.

2293
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:46,720
You know, it's five episodes coming out

2294
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:51,120
today that this episode comes out and five episodes coming out another point this

2295
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:56,800
year. And I think it works as a self-contained thing.

2296
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,480
Like, I think if this is the only thing we ever get to make, I think this is a

2297
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:04,000
pretty good like it's sort of in my mind's eye, the kind of thing I'd

2298
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,880
imagine a He-Man movie being.

2299
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:11,960
It feels like a very epic story that is tied to the history of this property

2300
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:16,360
told on a grand scale, incorporating as many characters and vehicles and things

2301
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:18,880
as you remember as possible.

2302
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:23,080
But I think everyone would like to do more if if the interest is there.

2303
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:30,680
Like it has not been designed to pointedly be a one off is not one division.

2304
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:34,400
If people want more, I think everyone wants to do it.

2305
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:40,920
And I certainly would like to just absolutely

2306
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:43,200
run or go into the ground.

2307
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:44,760
Hey, great. Wow.

2308
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:47,760
Looks like, hey, Mayor of Eastdown has a new partner.

2309
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:52,120
This season, why it's Detective Orko.

2310
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:57,600
And he's by so by

2311
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:05,120
one more question is is on your show is does Orko have visible duct tape

2312
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,600
holding his hat onto his head?

2313
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:09,440
No, it is.

2314
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:10,880
It is a funny thing.

2315
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:13,840
Pulled up a photo, by the way, that's what you like.

2316
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:15,520
It is so like this.

2317
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:17,520
This is what they put in the program.

2318
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:21,400
It's such a wild costume, especially because I would argue the rest of the

2319
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:25,800
costumes are pretty high level executions, especially for this type of show.

2320
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:29,760
And the Orko one is really kind of haphazard.

2321
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:35,160
Orko is also tough because like Orko's tiny, like Orko sort of like great

2322
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:39,640
gazoo size, just floating around characters' heads.

2323
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:44,440
So when you need a human person to play it, the scale gets all thrown off.

2324
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:47,680
So like the commentary I was watching from the convention, they were saying

2325
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:53,240
the woman who played Orko was for ten, like they found the shortest performer

2326
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,400
they possibly could.

2327
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:57,760
But even so, it makes Orko look weirdly

2328
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:01,480
gigantic because like Orko doesn't have any legs.

2329
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:07,960
So the robe has to extend past the actor's feet, which makes the torso look huge.

2330
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:11,760
You know, and then the hands are bigger because they put bigger gloves to be in

2331
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:14,440
scale with the torso and then the hat has to get so big.

2332
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:16,400
And then where's the head in this?

2333
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:17,360
The head up.

2334
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:18,760
This is what I was about to say.

2335
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:23,080
Oh, the actor's head, I think, is in.

2336
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,160
Above the eyes, maybe.

2337
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:32,680
Maybe I feel like the arms we're seeing, like the shoulders are in the scarf.

2338
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:34,240
If that makes any sense.

2339
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:37,200
I think so. Yeah, it is confusing where they're coming from.

2340
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:41,800
Right. And their face is either above the eyes or in the hat itself.

2341
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:44,160
It does not look like a very easy costume to operate.

2342
02:07:44,160 --> 02:07:45,440
But this is the other thing, Orko,

2343
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:48,800
from a design perspective, the idea is he's a trollen, right?

2344
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:54,640
Which is like this magical troll type species in the Motu lore.

2345
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:57,120
But his face is hidden all the time.

2346
02:07:57,320 --> 02:07:58,800
They can't show their faces.

2347
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:04,320
So Orko, it's like supposed to be that that's the shadow created from under his

2348
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:07,600
hat and the scarf around the lower part of his face.

2349
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:12,600
And so the eyes are the only things that you're able to see in the shadow.

2350
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:18,520
Whenever you three dimensionalize Orko, it gets very spatially odd because it

2351
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:24,560
looks like his head is just a black featureless orb with two eyes on it.

2352
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:26,960
It's not like a black tree trunk.

2353
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:28,160
Right. Right.

2354
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:33,360
The idea is that you can't see his face.

2355
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:35,480
It's cloaked in mystery.

2356
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:37,080
Right. Yeah.

2357
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:39,360
Well, it makes you respect.

2358
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:40,520
I'm going to be wearing it.

2359
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:41,240
Yeah.

2360
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:44,880
You'll have a perfect understanding about this works when you're hitting the road,

2361
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:48,400
when you're given shout outs to Calgary,

2362
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:51,520
happy to do it when I'm begging them to let me do this.

2363
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:54,080
Yeah, it might just be an Orko tour.

2364
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:57,400
If they don't want to do the whole thing, it might just be like Orko comes alive.

2365
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,560
Yeah.

2366
02:08:58,760 --> 02:08:59,520
Sure. Yeah.

2367
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:01,240
River dance with Orko.

2368
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,280
Yeah.

2369
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:03,600
Or just one man show.

2370
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:07,680
Just every every talent you have and every talent you think Orko would have.

2371
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:09,640
And you have to develop that from scratch.

2372
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:11,360
It's like Mark Twain tonight.

2373
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:12,960
I just do my sort of like.

2374
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:13,880
Yeah.

2375
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:19,000
The poster is Orko with like his tie undone, holding a cigarette and a drink,

2376
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:20,760
like a lamp and looking down.

2377
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:21,960
Yeah.

2378
02:09:22,160 --> 02:09:24,480
We're going to do some songs, do some stories.

2379
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:26,200
Just telling tales from his childhood.

2380
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:27,800
Yeah. Fun stuff.

2381
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,040
Weird stuff. You know, Garth Brooks, like Garth Brooks' Facebook.

2382
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:35,320
Long-combed Facebook presence.

2383
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:36,680
Start the conversation.

2384
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:38,600
What a time.

2385
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:39,440
Let's see.

2386
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:40,480
Well, did we do it?

2387
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:44,600
Did we survive podcast ride Legends of Eternia edition?

2388
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:46,080
I think so.

2389
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:51,040
I mean, feel free to shout out anything else from the I just have like spare quotes

2390
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:56,520
throughout the rest of it, like, oh, no, where's Rock on?

2391
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,800
I don't know what they're connected to.

2392
02:09:58,800 --> 02:09:59,800
I mean, there's so many.

2393
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,120
There's great little or as we call him, Rocky.

2394
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:08,040
I think I just thought that's the thing I love.

2395
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:09,760
No, thank you for reminding me of this.

2396
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:11,560
Rock on is also a late character.

2397
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:18,200
He comes from the Stone Warriors and they're a race of sort of semi cybernetic

2398
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:23,040
characters, robotic characters who have the ability to camouflage as rocks

2399
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:26,840
so that people don't attack them and they can sneak up by just laying stagnant

2400
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:32,600
on a battlefield and it's Rock on and Stone Dar and Granita.

2401
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:35,600
They only put Rock on in this.

2402
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:39,280
But his whole thing is that he's like a transformer, right?

2403
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:42,720
It was Mattel trying to get in on the Transformers market.

2404
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:46,680
And so they they announced him in the show and I was like, how are they going to

2405
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:51,600
fucking pull this off as a costume because it has to look like Rock on in like

2406
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:58,400
humanoid form and the rock form and in the cartoon they do all sorts of like they

2407
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:01,560
take all sorts of license with design to make that transition happen.

2408
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:05,360
And with the toy, it's like engineering that a human body can't do.

2409
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:08,120
And with this, they're just like Rock on Rock on.

2410
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:10,320
Where's Rock on? Has anyone seen Rock on?

2411
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:13,040
Then a video screen shows a meteor.

2412
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:17,400
Then there's a crash sound and then Rock on stands up and they're like, oh, there he

2413
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:24,560
is. So they just never show him as a rock on stage and explain why that was him.

2414
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:27,120
And now he's just going to be standing up the rest of the time.

2415
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:28,880
Oh, that's why.

2416
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:30,680
Oh, no. Where's Rock Rock on?

2417
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:33,680
Yes. That takes care of that problem.

2418
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:40,240
I love this lazy Bing Crosby take on He-Man.

2419
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:42,280
I could listen to this guy's voice all day.

2420
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:43,840
I really wish I'd seen this.

2421
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:47,440
If I'd seen the show, I think I would have thought about it my whole life.

2422
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:49,280
It is so grand.

2423
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:51,360
And

2424
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:54,920
I guess that's I. Hey, we use Griffin Newman.

2425
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:59,600
You survived podcast the ride once again for time.

2426
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:02,040
I believe time number five.

2427
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:05,000
I think this is the I think you're in the five timers.

2428
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:06,760
Yes, there's there's.

2429
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:08,680
Wow. This is huge.

2430
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:12,520
Yes, it's the 3D movie trilogy of 2019.

2431
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:13,960
Yeah.

2432
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:19,720
And the and the second gate, Jimmy Fallon, record breaking Jimmy Fallon episode.

2433
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:21,640
Yes. Yeah.

2434
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:26,400
And unless you count smaller, unless you count your performance as the.

2435
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:28,200
Oh, sure. Whichever kid.

2436
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:30,760
No, I think it's host. I think I think or not hosting.

2437
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:31,760
It's hosting.

2438
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:33,760
Yeah. Yeah. Full guest appearances.

2439
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:39,480
And some people will decree that this does not count as a proper five because

2440
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:43,840
second gate is its own continuity, to which I'll say that's why we have

2441
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:51,520
redacted, controversial ride and Muppet Haunted Mansion on the books for 2021.

2442
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:55,000
Yeah. Which I think would get you up to.

2443
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,640
I was trying to crunch the numbers.

2444
02:12:56,840 --> 02:13:00,280
I think Eva Anderson has the title for most appearances.

2445
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:02,680
If you count on this second gate counts as his own thing.

2446
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:04,120
She's almost entirely second gate.

2447
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:07,680
But I think it's one that fucking YouTuber.

2448
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:09,480
I know he goes on about it every week.

2449
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:11,240
Listen, you don't know anything about

2450
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:13,520
Kathy Kennedy and you don't know anything about the second gate.

2451
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:14,640
Lay off.

2452
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:17,440
He hates the second gate.

2453
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:22,920
The second gate is what's happening behind the doors of this behind the gates

2454
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:26,240
of the second gate. The second gate is too woke, quite frankly.

2455
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:31,640
It is just bizarre that fan culture has gone from like, oh, like fan fiction is

2456
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:34,960
this robust thing where people want to write their own stories with the characters

2457
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:38,680
to now people want to write their own fan fiction about what's happening

2458
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:41,360
at a corporate level. Yeah.

2459
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:47,240
He popped a correct pod into the machine, grumbling as he reached for his mug.

2460
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:53,280
The term like forced their dinner plans for the diversity, forced diversity.

2461
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:56,000
And you're like, did you ever see the movie Predator?

2462
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:58,600
Like the movie is diverse.

2463
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:03,120
Like it's in like, you know, you know, you can cast you cast people.

2464
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:04,960
Humans cast people that are.

2465
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:09,720
Yeah, I mean, also, I try to repeat this whenever I can in any fucking medium,

2466
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,400
because I don't feel like this gets circulated enough.

2467
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:14,520
They recently went viral again.

2468
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:21,200
A clip of Carl Sagan on Johnny Carson complaining about the fact that everyone's

2469
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:22,640
white in Star Wars, right?

2470
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:26,480
And he's like on a scientific level, that doesn't make sense.

2471
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:29,840
Like on a scientific level, it doesn't make sense that the people in power

2472
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:32,040
look like humans, even though they're not.

2473
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:34,320
And they're all white and they're all like this.

2474
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:36,480
Like they would have crazy alien colors

2475
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:40,720
or at the very least would resemble other races on our planet.

2476
02:14:40,920 --> 02:14:43,640
Sure. And people were like Carl Sagan saying

2477
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:45,200
the shit that everyone was afraid to say.

2478
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:50,640
What doesn't get acknowledged a lot is that he says that that was a big fucking

2479
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:52,840
interview because it was the time when everyone watched it.

2480
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:57,280
People in the media started talking about the lack of diversity in Star Wars.

2481
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:01,840
And Lando was specifically written and created to address that.

2482
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:05,680
Like the exact thing that people get up in arms saying that Disney is doing,

2483
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:09,840
which is like shoving diversity down their throats and creating characters just

2484
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:14,600
to fill a quota Lando, who you all fucking love, was George Lucas taking

2485
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:18,960
the criticism to heart and going like, yeah, I should hire a very charismatic

2486
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:23,400
actor and put him in this franchise and set him up as an old friend of these

2487
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:27,120
preexisting characters so that he's earned his place in this universe.

2488
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:29,280
Isn't it interesting that you liked it

2489
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:33,120
when you were a kid and when you watch it now, you go, what's the agenda here?

2490
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:34,680
Why are they forcing this on you?

2491
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:37,800
If you watch Alien or Predator, the original Alien, like I don't.

2492
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:39,040
All these things. Yeah.

2493
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:40,440
All of them. And they always go like, well,

2494
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:42,720
I like Ripley because she's actually a good character.

2495
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,080
Not these characters today where they're

2496
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:46,000
just a woman for the sake of making me angry.

2497
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,640
Right. Like what's the what do you think the difference is?

2498
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:52,840
Yeah. And science fiction, like the history of modern science fiction is

2499
02:15:53,120 --> 02:15:59,040
authors slipping in future looking ideas, ideas of like progressive societies,

2500
02:15:59,240 --> 02:16:02,160
of diversity, of different ways of thinking.

2501
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:09,920
And like people either, you know, they absorb it and inadvertently get the lesson

2502
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:14,280
or like maybe it goes over their heads and they just see it on a surface level.

2503
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:17,040
But it's in there like it's in all of this stuff.

2504
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:19,840
Yeah. On that note, I would like to plug

2505
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:23,480
Masters of the Universe Revelation, the wokest he man to date.

2506
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:26,560
So much is going to get shoved down your throat.

2507
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:30,280
Open your throats, everyone, because so much so many agendas.

2508
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:34,120
Nothing but agendas.

2509
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:38,560
I'm a big fan of episode five, which is just Clamp Champ explaining

2510
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:42,000
critical race theory for 30 minutes.

2511
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:46,240
Well, I'm glad someone is.

2512
02:16:46,280 --> 02:16:48,040
Yeah, someone has to.

2513
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:49,160
No, I think it's a good show.

2514
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,840
And I think most of the people who are up in arms about it will actually

2515
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:55,000
like it if they watch it and don't listen to YouTube.

2516
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:57,160
I think I think the people were paying it.

2517
02:16:57,160 --> 02:17:01,320
I think they like probably the megaphones loom larger

2518
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:02,920
currently because it hasn't come out.

2519
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:06,760
And when it comes out, it'll be mostly people who like and enjoy it and enjoy.

2520
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:09,720
I'm not losing sleep over this, but it is just one of those

2521
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:12,720
frustrating things to watch where you're like, oh, the the loudest megaphones

2522
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:17,200
are the people who are creating hour long videos based on conjecture

2523
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:20,880
versus the people who will like this show, who cannot weigh in

2524
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:24,320
because they haven't seen it yet and aren't writing things about what they think

2525
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:26,960
is going to happen like a lunatic.

2526
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:29,880
Well, we get all that pre conjecture about what blue shirt

2527
02:17:29,880 --> 02:17:31,320
Jason's going to wear next.

2528
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:34,000
And I just like let him pick the shirt and then you'll see.

2529
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,160
I got a couple of new ones.

2530
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:38,320
That's part of the process.

2531
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:42,240
I also I just want to plug, as I always do, blank check.

2532
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:45,680
My podcast with David Sims, past guests of this show as well.

2533
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:49,920
What's Kensington?

2534
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:51,920
Chessington, Chessington, Chessington, Chessington, Chessington.

2535
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:54,960
The most frightening

2536
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:57,600
80s sci fi rides you've ever seen.

2537
02:17:57,600 --> 02:17:59,000
That was really something.

2538
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,200
He really brought us something we were completely unaware of.

2539
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:04,480
But to acknowledge the

2540
02:18:04,480 --> 02:18:09,000
a now non joking online podcast controversy.

2541
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:14,320
There is a there is a section of shared blank check

2542
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:18,320
PTR listeners who have continued to be outraged

2543
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:22,000
at the fact that the three of you have not appeared on blank check yet.

2544
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:23,640
Oh, sure. I want to stay here.

2545
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:25,400
It's getting acknowledged. Oh, my God.

2546
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:28,240
Not a conspiracy.

2547
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:32,840
There are there are culprits, most of which are based around disorganization.

2548
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:37,840
The fact that until the pandemic, we never let Zoom records happen.

2549
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:40,920
Yeah, we book things far in advance.

2550
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:45,720
There's a lot of weird strategizing that goes into how we plan out our main series.

2551
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:49,240
A regret was that

2552
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:53,000
Scott, you obviously would have been a great guest for Back to the Future Part Two.

2553
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:55,240
Nicole Byer had called that very early.

2554
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:57,320
Oh, you don't say no to Nicole Byer.

2555
02:18:57,320 --> 02:18:59,480
You never. Right. Right.

2556
02:18:59,480 --> 02:19:03,240
But but if I can just also say just to kind of peel back the curtain a little bit,

2557
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:06,120
I want to as a commitment. OK. Whoa, whoa.

2558
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:09,760
Our schedule, we booked very far in advance.

2559
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:11,800
We always do.

2560
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:15,560
It's because we go chronologically through filmography as David has a baby now.

2561
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:18,040
We need to plan things out. Oh, yeah. That's David.

2562
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:19,880
The rest of this year is full.

2563
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:24,800
I'm committing to all three good boys appearing on blank check main feed 2022.

2564
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,440
Oh, my God. Wow. Exciting.

2565
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:29,760
That's something to look forward to, at least for us.

2566
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:31,760
I don't know about the audience, but I'm excited.

2567
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:35,000
I want to say because this is the other factor that was at play.

2568
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
And this is not a good excuse.

2569
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,440
As a friend, I feel like this is not a good excuse.

2570
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:41,520
I'm not talking as a podcast creator, but talk as a friend.

2571
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:43,880
I don't think this is a good excuse.

2572
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:46,960
In my mind, I had this idea

2573
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:51,040
that it would be cute to save you guys for Pirates of the Caribbean.

2574
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:52,920
Wow. Oh, interesting.

2575
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:56,320
That was my thing, where I was just sort of like maximum impact.

2576
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:58,800
Would it be best? And I never told this to you guys.

2577
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,640
I was like, would it be best if we saved it and we had all three of you on one

2578
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:03,800
or we did the trilogy and each of you did one?

2579
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:07,280
Because Gore Verbinski felt like he was a guy we were going to do at some point.

2580
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:11,400
Then we put him on our march, badness bracket this year and chaos broke out.

2581
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:16,080
And I don't know if Gore Verbinski is happening any time in the foreseeable future.

2582
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:16,920
Oh, interesting.

2583
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:20,640
So a lot of weird shit got stirred up in the Gore Verbinski thing.

2584
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:22,920
And at least for the time being, we're putting that on the sidelines.

2585
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:24,400
So that's why I'm saying.

2586
02:20:24,400 --> 02:20:28,040
Look, also, I've never seen any of these films, so I probably wouldn't be a good guess.

2587
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:32,360
Wow, really? No, not one other like theme park movie are we going to cover.

2588
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:34,600
It's not like you guys can only come on to talk about theme park.

2589
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:38,040
I thought that would be a nice kind of poetic crossover.

2590
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:40,200
And that was the one obvious thing to do.

2591
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:42,200
And there are three of those movies and what have you.

2592
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:43,920
So I kept that in my mind.

2593
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:45,520
That's now off the table.

2594
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:46,840
We booked the rest of the year.

2595
02:20:46,840 --> 02:20:49,000
Twenty twenty two. We're going to figure something out.

2596
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:51,080
Wow. Wow. I don't know if it's separate episodes.

2597
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:52,480
I don't know if it's three of you on one episode.

2598
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:55,040
We don't know exactly what we're doing for 2022 yet.

2599
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:57,640
But I just want to state that cleanly.

2600
02:20:57,800 --> 02:21:01,560
Well, if you think Carol Reed, the long dead, Carol Reed,

2601
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:05,320
the third man, has a big Ferris wheel scene, a vitally,

2602
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:08,760
a vitally important Ferris wheel scene.

2603
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:13,640
I like that you jumped to the third man as the next most obvious theme park movie.

2604
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:15,960
Well, that's my favorite movie.

2605
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:18,200
So I was being selfish. Oh, sure. Sure. Sure.

2606
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:20,960
Well, you already look, you already did Joe Dirt.

2607
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:23,840
So I'm I'm up Shick Creek now.

2608
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,640
That would have been Scott's choice.

2609
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:28,280
Yeah, obviously.

2610
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:31,320
If there's an Adam Carolla movie about wokeness, I'll do that one.

2611
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:33,040
The ringer, right?

2612
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:33,720
It was a ringer.

2613
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:35,080
Is that what it's called?

2614
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:36,760
Is it? Didn't you do one?

2615
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:38,520
Yeah, but there's also a stand up one.

2616
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:41,760
There's one called Road Comic or University.

2617
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:44,160
There's newer, like more.

2618
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:45,280
I feel like he made a movie.

2619
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:48,120
Maybe his first movie wasn't so like focused on.

2620
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:50,440
Carolla is a great blank check director.

2621
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:53,720
I think if you ever do Bill Maher, obviously,

2622
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:55,320
we'd love to throw our heads in the ring.

2623
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:58,760
Dennis Prager, you know, all the filmmakers.

2624
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:00,960
Dennis Prager is one of my favorite filmmakers.

2625
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:02,040
Oh, God, don't click.

2626
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:03,880
Oh, no, don't let anyone clip that.

2627
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:05,600
Each decision.

2628
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:08,040
Fuck, you beat me to do that.

2629
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:12,600
I will say I because last year, not last two years ago,

2630
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:15,440
for March Madness, our bracket, we do where we let people vote on which director

2631
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:19,160
we're going to cover. We had this idea to a theme bracket where one side was all

2632
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:23,160
best director Oscar winners and one side was all

2633
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:25,920
worst director Razzie winners.

2634
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:29,320
And David and I had a very long drawn out,

2635
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:33,080
like over weeks or months fight about whether or not to include

2636
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:35,280
Dinesh D'Souza in the bracket.

2637
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:37,680
And I wanted to include him.

2638
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:39,640
I don't know if that was the right choice.

2639
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:42,160
But at the time, I was arguing to include him.

2640
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:45,600
He did, in fact, win a Razzie for directing

2641
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:48,400
Hillary's America.

2642
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:50,280
I don't remember if it was that or if it was

2643
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:53,360
26. What is it?

2644
02:22:53,360 --> 02:22:55,040
2016 is Hillary's America.

2645
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:56,640
And then the other one is called like America.

2646
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:58,360
Imagine a world without her.

2647
02:22:58,360 --> 02:23:01,920
Well, we when the three of us and Paul Shear

2648
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:05,480
and I forget who else was there, Ben Rogers, maybe Gabriels.

2649
02:23:05,480 --> 02:23:09,840
Like when we saw Mission Impossible fall out in the downtown

2650
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:14,760
L.A. with the seats that rattle and move, we were like making fun of in the lobby.

2651
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:16,720
There was a poster for Dinesh D'Souza.

2652
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:19,880
And then as we were going to our theater, there was like a big

2653
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:23,760
like step and repeat background and like a photo.

2654
02:23:23,960 --> 02:23:27,640
And we're like, are we walking by a Dinesh D'Souza premiere?

2655
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:29,880
There's no one here.

2656
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:32,560
I went to see two of them in theaters.

2657
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:35,880
I bought tickets for other movies, so I didn't have to support him.

2658
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:40,400
But I was very fascinated by him in a pre Trump era

2659
02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:44,360
where it felt like the damage he could cause was somewhat minimal.

2660
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:47,720
But just to clarify, I combined three separate titles.

2661
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:50,720
There's 2016 Obama's America.

2662
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:52,240
Then there's America.

2663
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:55,320
Imagine the world without her and Hillary's America,

2664
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:57,320
the secret history of the Democratic Party.

2665
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:00,840
Which is a movie in which he presents his grand thesis

2666
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:03,080
that actually the Democrats are Nazis.

2667
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:04,920
Oh, my God.

2668
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:08,840
That was discussed at the meeting where we talked about

2669
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:11,320
Disney not being interested in money.

2670
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:14,080
You know, yes, yes, absolutely.

2671
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:17,240
All right.

2672
02:24:17,240 --> 02:24:17,960
So those are my thoughts.

2673
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:19,440
We'll all get to that one.

2674
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:21,600
There's three of them than three good boys.

2675
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:22,200
Exactly.

2676
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:24,320
The ultimate good boy.

2677
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:27,560
Dinesh on the book will do the the America trilogy.

2678
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:32,800
His his remaining two films, I feel like once Trump got elected,

2679
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:34,080
his juice was gone.

2680
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:36,720
Like I know he got a lot of retweets on Twitter,

2681
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:39,800
but those three movies made stupid amounts of money in theaters.

2682
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:42,160
And then the other two, Death of a Nation and Trump Cart,

2683
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:44,240
I feel like made no imp.

2684
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:46,360
Once he wasn't standing in opposition.

2685
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:50,560
Yeah, it's it's well, it's been a nice diffuser of a lot of

2686
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:54,280
of a lot of bullshit stuff that's like pretty bad.

2687
02:24:54,280 --> 02:24:58,840
On kind of a moral level and mainly on a graphic design level.

2688
02:24:59,560 --> 02:25:04,440
Yes, we see so much less horrendous graphic design and documentaries.

2689
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:09,080
Now, I mean, the poster for Death of a Nation is a composite

2690
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:13,000
where the right half of the face is Abraham Lincoln

2691
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,680
and the left half is Donald Trump.

2692
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:16,960
And I will tell you, that is a very jarring transition.

2693
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:22,040
Yeah. In hair, in skull shape, in complexion.

2694
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:22,640
Yes.

2695
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:26,800
OK, so we're set for that.

2696
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:27,720
We're set for other.

2697
02:25:27,720 --> 02:25:31,320
I still am like I am so curious about the to me.

2698
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:35,760
It's not a controversial, redacted ride, but unless you guys feel different.

2699
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:38,840
But I was less interesting if it's not a fight.

2700
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:43,480
I it's it's on the I think I can say this on Mike.

2701
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:45,520
It's on the books. Yeah.

2702
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:50,560
I'm going to be coming to Los Angeles in a couple of months for for,

2703
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:53,440
in fact, Power Con, the He-Man Convention.

2704
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,040
Oh, I wasn't sure if you wanted to bring it up.

2705
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,080
You're going to be at Power Con where, by the way,

2706
02:25:57,080 --> 02:26:01,240
the Anaheim Convention Center, where the power tour played when it was in town.

2707
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:05,920
You'll be in the room where Songster himself said his name.

2708
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:08,800
So I'm going to be in Anaheim for that.

2709
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:13,680
And I'm the four of us are going to go to the parks together,

2710
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:15,600
which I've never gone to go to the parks with you guys.

2711
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:18,280
Oh, my. And then we're going to record an in-person episode

2712
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:21,000
theoretically about this redacted, controversial ride.

2713
02:26:21,320 --> 02:26:24,520
But all I'm saying is in the time between now and when that happens,

2714
02:26:24,520 --> 02:26:27,520
when I see you guys next in person and it's lovely,

2715
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:31,160
I'm going to fucking go back and find the clip where you guys talk racy

2716
02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:33,240
about this ride, because I swear it.

2717
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:37,760
I hear it. I swear it happened because I know my email was in response to that.

2718
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:41,240
Was it what maybe was a joke?

2719
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:44,600
It just felt like it wasn't super critical,

2720
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:48,120
but it was kind of like a little off the shoulder dismissive.

2721
02:26:48,120 --> 02:26:49,720
Like, I don't care.

2722
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:51,480
We're never going to do an episode about that.

2723
02:26:51,480 --> 02:26:56,000
Well, the biggest, most questionable thing to me is that we would ever say,

2724
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,280
let's not do an episode.

2725
02:26:58,280 --> 02:27:03,080
That's why I emailed because it was so wild that it was like not even.

2726
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:04,000
That's a second gate.

2727
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,080
It was like, can we just say we'll never do an episode about that ride?

2728
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:11,560
That's could that be just the most deadpan joke delivery possible?

2729
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:15,720
Like the most Bob Newhart style deadpan?

2730
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:20,560
I don't know. I'm just I'm just saying stay tuned for that episode for Dacted

2731
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:24,160
Ride. I think that we're treating this ride like it's Kevin Spacey,

2732
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:26,720
like it's like the subject we can't name.

2733
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:30,320
It's going to be so confusing when it comes out and when it's just like a ride,

2734
02:27:30,320 --> 02:27:34,600
like what people like, I believe there's really no way to know.

2735
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:37,040
I don't think what was said exactly,

2736
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:40,440
except I think the only way might be to release Jason's notes.

2737
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:44,080
It's the only way we're going to start this out specifically,

2738
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:47,160
release the notes. No tear. I agree.

2739
02:27:47,160 --> 02:27:51,280
Jason's full archive of notes needs to be released if we could actually know.

2740
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:55,480
Let's publish it in a book. Jason, to end this episode,

2741
02:27:55,480 --> 02:27:59,360
can you just scroll to a different part of your notes and share screen with us?

2742
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:01,960
Yeah. A different page of notes that we haven't seen.

2743
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:03,200
You don't have to share with the whole podcast,

2744
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:07,920
but can we see it and read out loud and you get to pick which page it is of

2745
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:12,400
what the masters, the notes, your notes for this. Yeah. Yeah.

2746
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:15,360
Any note, any part you want. Any note for this episode.

2747
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:17,000
Or else we're going to have to make a really,

2748
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:20,560
we're going to have to make a crazy documentary about you. Jason's America.

2749
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:26,560
2022 Jason's notes. All right. Let me, here's the bottom.

2750
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:28,640
So this is, this is,

2751
02:28:29,640 --> 02:28:34,720
sometimes I will, when watching along, make just like impressions when watching.

2752
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:39,320
Them introducing Songster was pretty stiff. Agreed. Yes.

2753
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:41,840
Next. His name is Songster.

2754
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:46,840
And somebody could have used a songster. Yeah. Mortal Kombat.

2755
02:28:46,840 --> 02:28:48,360
Live. Absolutely. Oh my God.

2756
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:50,920
There wasn't a lot going on with Mortal Kombat. Live. Of course.

2757
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:55,080
The song is Troubadour for sure. Yeah. Well, I will say Jason. Yes.

2758
02:28:55,080 --> 02:28:56,880
Some of these are direct quotes,

2759
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:02,000
but seeing them in this format just as like kind of bullet pointed notes on a

2760
02:29:02,520 --> 02:29:05,120
spreadsheet where you don't put them in quotes,

2761
02:29:05,360 --> 02:29:09,720
it makes it feel like you, Jason, yourself are typing in,

2762
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:13,800
welcome to my universe masters of the universe. Oh yeah.

2763
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:18,280
Well I use quotes if I'm like you like actually writing down,

2764
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:22,920
but if I'm watching live, I'm trying to keep up with the live video.

2765
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,560
So, uh, yeah.

2766
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,360
Lots of presentations and singing and roller skating.

2767
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:31,200
There's a sword fight and still 15 minutes left in this show.

2768
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:36,880
So I think that was cause I watched most of the act one one and I was surprised

2769
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:38,160
like, wait, wouldn't you,

2770
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:41,760
this is either the end of half of the show or the end of all of the show.

2771
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:44,280
Wouldn't you end on a big sword fight? And then no,

2772
02:29:44,280 --> 02:29:46,840
there was like another 15 minutes of just hanging out.

2773
02:29:47,160 --> 02:29:50,640
Well it's like, wouldn't you end this episode by saying you survive podcasts,

2774
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:52,640
the ride and then like a couple more things.

2775
02:29:53,640 --> 02:29:57,000
Or do you do another half hour after that?

2776
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:57,560
Possibly.

2777
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:58,640
This is what we did.

2778
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:02,600
But I don't mind it because now there's plans. There's plans for 2021,

2779
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:06,480
there's plans for 2022 and you can keep abreast of all of it on our socials at

2780
02:30:06,480 --> 02:30:10,080
podcast. The ride is merchant RT public store and for three bonus episodes every

2781
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:14,120
month, check out podcast, the ride, the second gate at patreon.com slash podcast,

2782
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:17,960
the ride where Griffin will not be. It's main feed. You're saying,

2783
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:23,320
look, maybe one of the two, maybe Muppets haunted man is second gate.

2784
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:25,520
I want to show love to the second gators.

2785
02:30:25,520 --> 02:30:27,520
I don't want to feel like I'm neglecting them.

2786
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:31,840
You know, when we do three hours on the good, the bad and the low key, you know,

2787
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:34,280
we're going to probably hide behind the second gate.

2788
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:37,160
On the Simpsons, the good, the bad and the low key.

2789
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:39,960
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Everyone's demanding it.

2790
02:30:40,480 --> 02:30:44,640
I just noticed on Disney plus the force awakens from her naps.

2791
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:47,320
Where did that come from? I've never seen that.

2792
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:51,680
I think that came out on star Wars day. Okay. That came out recently.

2793
02:30:51,720 --> 02:30:53,440
I want to say May of this year.

2794
02:30:53,480 --> 02:30:56,320
It's the same fucking thing as the good, the bad, the low key.

2795
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:59,960
Um, yeah, yeah. One of those. Okay. Yeah. Well, we'll get to that.

2796
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:02,200
We'll get to so much Griffin. Thanks so much for being here.

2797
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:06,160
Thanks to you all for checking it out. And by the way, podcast,

2798
