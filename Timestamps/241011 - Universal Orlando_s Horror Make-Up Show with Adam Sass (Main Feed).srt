1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Warning!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The following haunt cast may contain

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Fly Pods

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Lemons vs. Limes

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Gene Kelly's final feline role

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and spooky talk about a dead pharmacy

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
All that plus, Adam Sass returns to talk

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Universal's Horror Makeup Show

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
on today's Haunt Cast the Fright

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Welcome to Haunt Cast the Fright, a ghoulish scream park podcast

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
hosted by three men who are very scared of getting zapped by the host busters

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My name is Spiky Snarlgun

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Joining me as always is

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Gare Wolf

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, great

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Jack'll scare it in

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Great, yeah

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So we're all here today, we're all very scared

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're scared and scary today

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And you're saying that the host busters are people who bust hosts, that being us

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Right

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And if we were to get trapped into some sort of little machine that sucks hosts inside of it

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
First of all, uncomfortable for all of us

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We're long past social distancing, but to be all three trapped in a tiny box sounds tough

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Second of all, when do we get out of there and how do we do the show once we've been busted?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, I guess we would go into some sort of a host containment unit

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We would get out of the tiny trap and then we would go into a bigger like kind of hell zone

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Which is where the hosts go, so I suppose maybe that would offer more room

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And then we could do our show from in there

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A realm of entirely podcast hosts, that sounds to me like heaven

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, everybody

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Everyone's idea

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So many digressions

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wow

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So many half-remembered facts and anecdotes

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, you're technically in a box, you're technically in everybody's phones

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So you're, you know, you are in the box already

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We're in the trap

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're already in the trap

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's a trap

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, this whole thing is a trap

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This whole podcast, don't tell anyone

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't tell anybody

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You know those podcasts that ride guys?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This whole thing has been set up as a trap

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I never get tired of that guy when he floats by my, when they do the memes

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I love seeing the merch man

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I stop every time for the merch man

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm lost, I'm officially lost

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh, the M&I Shyamalan trap

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, I see, okay

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The new film

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The new film

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The trailer has been played in a lot of places and they play this one segment every time

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Where he's like explaining to Josh Hartnett, the serial killer, that they're trapping a serial killer

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes, it's a man explaining the, a character within the movie explaining the premise of the movie

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, have we spoiled, we should have spoiled an alert I guess

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No, that's in the trailers

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, this is the trailer money shot

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is it really?

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, and on Twitter, the new meme is, since traps come out, is that they have a screenshot of the merch man

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And they're just recapping different movies and he's like, oh, you know, you know, and then just, they'll fill in the blank

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You know, they'll pitch a new thing, they'll be like, hey, you know, and it's all a trap

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Wow, okay, well, thank goodness

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I didn't want to ruin this movie three months after it came out

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Get back on Twitter

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's been out for a little bit

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But maybe some memes have been spoiled

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's true, yeah

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Do memes need spoiler alerts?

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Maybe

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We're getting to that place socially

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's introduce this ghost voice that just entered

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Our special ghost

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Our special ghost today

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Returning to Hauntcast this Friday, he's the author of LGBTQYA books and an old character actor, name enthusiast

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Adam Sass is back

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hello, hello, and for Hauntcast, I am Adamian the Exorcass

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Wow, that's cool

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That sounds like a real character

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, yeah, we're going to concentrate all the devil energy over here

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
As I usually do

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That could help us get out of the trap

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Although we're still

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Having the devil involved?

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
An exorcist, I just think

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Somehow

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's right

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're right

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, I'm like a Beetlejuice type who's like, yes, I'm the Damian part, that's the devil part, but I'm also helping out

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, yeah, yeah, sort of

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Like a Dexter

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Dexter or Beetlejuice, which are similar characters now that I just realized that

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, yeah, I hadn't thought about that

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So like if Beetlejuice, if it was, you were Beetlejuice, but the way he was helping was, I'm trying to remember who played Mel Cooley on the Dick Van Dyke show

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And you said Richard Deacon, that would be your Beetlejuice's function

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's right, exactly, yeah, I'm the Beetlejuice for old character actors from Nick at Night era

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Right

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, mid-90s

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Very helpful though

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, yeah, needed

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Very needed

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There's an unmet need, yes

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes, more of those, we need more old Dexter names

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, so yeah, thank you for coming back, thank you for joining the haunt cast again

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm happy to be a regular haunt cast ghoulie

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, it's a very fun space to be in

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And today we are talking about something very near and dear to your heart, I would say

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Currently called the Universal Orlando's Horror Makeup Show

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's right, and this is, so like I'm, you know, last time I was here to talk to Murder, Shrew, at Mystery Theatre

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I'm, for whatever remaining OG Universal Orlando things you all have left, I'm like, I don't know, I feel like I'm scavenging for those

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're stalking them, yeah, picking the bones

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This one's definitely more Halloween horror appropriate than the Murder, Shrew, the Murder, Shrew one was, you know, I think that was still appropriate

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But now we're like

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It was really, you suggested it, but I think I rounded it up into Halloween not really knowing the contents of the show

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Knowing that the word Murder was in it and thinking, well, that'll be good for a tiny amount of research

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, shit, sorry on the books, let's not, but this is way more, this is like a year round thing that does have scary moments, scary clips and all that

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So now we can really get into my horror bona fides here, you know, with that

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So this is something that like, yeah, I loved this show and it's, I think, you know, it's been several different iterations

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But this has been around from the get-go, this has lasted

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
As something that's been around from the get-go, we get to do something that we also did last time

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Which is, you know, we can only build these things up so much

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But you need somebody with a true presence and a strong voice to tell you what the attraction's all about

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And that means I get to consult one of the great texts, the Magic of the Movies video with John Forsythe

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And I think once you hear this clip, you'll understand why it needed to be played

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Because we're never going to explain the attraction as succinctly as John Forsythe does

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The darkness is the deepest. These are the elements of our most enduring type of storytelling and entertainment

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Universal gained the reputation as Hollywood's home of horror in the 20s and early 30s

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Bela Lugosi, Dracula, Boris Karloff, Frankenstein

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Was that a scary crow that they piped in or was that just a regular crow hanging out during the shoot?

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It was just some guy circling John Forsythe, sensing his time was approaching

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The Grim Reaper was so good!

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Sounds good, but white hair!

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He seems to be kind of getting through that sentence a little bit

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That does seem like the opening of Universal Orlando was so fraught with troubles

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Like Jaws didn't work, King Kong kept breaking down

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It would be apropos if they were like, also there's a murder of crows haunting this park

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We cannot clear out the crows, they're a protected species, we had to leave their habitat there

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well Spielberg has the big film strip and he's got the scissors and he's about to cut and then he just hears

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And he just throws them off and he's like, oh shit, okay

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It grabs his hat

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It reveals that Spielberg's been bald the whole time

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What?

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Thank you for bringing back my guy John Forsythe

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I hope you're sitting down

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I did rewatch the entire making of the movies ahead of this

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Because I can't just watch a little clip, I had to watch a little thing

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm in love with John Forsythe's line readings

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I know we're in this age of like, that sounds like Chad GPT wrote that

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This script was written by a human being and it does sense

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It was an early version of AI wrote a lot of these sentences because they're so clunky

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And the way this Magic of the Movies opens, he says something, I'm going to paraphrase

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I had it written down but I lost it

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He's just describing the act of going to the movies

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
In the most rudimentary ways

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The filmmakers of yesteryear entranced our minds and imaginations

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
In the same way that our bodies were entranced by the popcorn and soft drinks

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He hits the syllables weird

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And it just sounds like it was Chad GPT wrote it

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And you're having an AI voiceover guy read it

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But no, it was the Magic of Forsythe that came organically from him

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's so highfalutin and what does any of it mean

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
In that clip I just played, does that actually

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He got to horror but we didn't quite get to the show

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He does a little bit later

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But the weird past tense

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Lovers and heroes lit up our days

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But villains and spooks haunted our nights

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why is it past tense?

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I got news for you John, there's still movies now

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
They're still making them

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It feels like someone

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Like if he came in now I'd be like

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He's eulogizing movies

183
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He's eulogizing the way we kind of do movies

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Because movies are in this kind of flux period right now

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But I think definitely back in 1990

186
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
When movies were just in their absolute prime

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Just everything, even just the 17th movie at the box office

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Just some beloved thing that you just watched on HBO all the time

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I love this genre of YouTube video

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Where it's like people buy movie tickets in 1997

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And like one weekend the movies that are playing

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's like blockbuster after blockbuster after blockbuster at one time

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh I mean every time I'm listening to Plank Check and they do the box office game

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm just like God, what a week

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What a week that was

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And they all did immensely well

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's like wow, number nine is great

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh to be in a theater seeing Mr. Wrong now

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It is funny to think that John Forsythe is talking like very poetically

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
About a show that will eventually have clips of the lost world and the frighteners

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah our greatest days are ahead of us

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Van Helsing is coming

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's my favorite part is that the most recent movies

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
A lot of them are like kind of duds

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And we're going to get into this

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But like it is one of those things where I wonder how many days the show has

207
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I mean I hope it's continuing

208
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I hope it's like a well attended show

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But it's just like we don't really do makeup a lot

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Not as much

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We're kind of doing

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I was researching best makeup winners, Oscar winners

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And you're just sort of seeing the last 10 years are really defined by

214
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We're going to make

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The defining makeup of the last 10 years really has just been like

216
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We're going to make Charlize Theron look like Megyn Kelly

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Which wasn't saying

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Which wasn't, I looked very spookily correct

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But then it's really just defined by

220
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Like we're really just makeup now is just we're doing

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Really iffy fat suits now

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Like that seems to be what makeup is doing

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Like a lot of the best makeup actors

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I think there was like the year the whale one was just like it was that

225
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And then Colin Farrell doing that and the penguin and Batman

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Like there was just

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think that was that year

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There was like three of the four or five best makeup actors were like

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes that was overweight makeup you were putting on

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And it just seems like I'm like we're not really in the Rick Baker glory days right now

231
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Of like you know because it does seem to be more defined by like digital manipulation

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Hopefully it is maybe

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You know maybe it's just one or two swinging back

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But I saw an interview with Michael Keaton about Beetlejuice Beetlejuice

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And they eat him and Tim Burton were kind of like as much practical stuff as we can

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
As little CG as we can

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I think that's from the reviews that are starting to pour in or just like yes, correct

238
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Like that worked and it's just the tactile and you can feel it

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And I think that's I think that's another reason why like it's just horror is so fun

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Is because you're just it'll kind of kind of feel like it feels like it feels like that's still a good haven for makeup

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It still feels like that's a good place to get lots of good practical effects

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Like everybody who's doing horror seems to like be really like kind of you know both feet deep in on

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You know doing things practically doing things in this way

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We're like we're going to try to invent these new mechanisms for blood splatter and this sorts of things

246
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And it still does feel relevant

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's why I'm like I hope it continues because I do think there is still this really strong avenue for makeup

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It still works as a show to see in a theme park

249
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And it's not you know how it's maybe if it's less appealing to see other you know a special effects show or even like

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Go look at backlog sets because of how much is done digitally at this point

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
There is still really crazy makeup in movies all the time and it like and it's still physical and tactile

252
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And you can like it's yeah, I don't know and with the blood and everything

253
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's just it is a good thing to do in front of an audience in a theme park setting

254
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I guess just the the basic cliff notes to say about this is that this is a show

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's been going since opening day of Universal Florida

256
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And the the basic thing I guess is that you are going to see a demonstration in a makeup lab

257
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But also like a creature effects lab

258
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Where there's it's I guess it's it's one guy is more or girl is more hosty and the other performer is more the experts in the

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Makeup or blood and guts and gore area and together they give you a demonstration person in suit and then person in

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hawaiian get up

261
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And the while a lot has changed about the show over the years that basic

262
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Construct is stayed and the you know where they they do it is stayed and with that. It's kind of interesting. I think

263
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Definitely saw places pointing out maybe the only

264
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
universal opening day attraction besides ET adventure and

265
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That still remains and then if you add it up and somebody correct me if I'm wrong is this not the final in all of

266
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Orlando show that is about how movies are made unless you count Indiana Jones

267
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Stunt spectacular you're still that component of we're shooting this but it's a little bit more you get lost in the

268
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You know in Indies world in the stunt, but but in terms of like here is a specific as there's no animation tour

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
There's no special effects stages. Right? There's no here's how Foley works. Yeah, Disney or Universal

270
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This is the kind of last man standing. I think like so much

271
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Horror keeping people in theaters

272
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Horror is keeping

273
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,920
How how do they do that kind of around you know, because I think like a lot of times with digital

274
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,080
I'm not like a I'm not a huge digital hater

275
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,640
But like there is an element that takes the mystery out of cuz you're just like oh, I'm sure you know a computer did that

276
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,600
I know there's like a more sophisticated answer to that

277
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,720
But I think for the masses you do end up in a situation where there's less curiosity cuz you're like

278
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sure somebody just did a thing on a computer and it's fine. And there is not that sort of deeper level of like

279
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,760
Here's how that gets done and then this is what that's like

280
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,160
I wonder if there's a compelling theme park show based around

281
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,920
computer like a graphics or something. Yeah, could you do like a

282
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,200
Admittedly insultingly remedial version where you're like dudes doing like, okay. Yes. Here's how you you know, here's how someone who's

283
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,200
You know, here's how you do like a mocap. They're gonna do like a mocap room

284
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:32,080
There's gotta be some mocap and volume definitely yeah themselves more than my past iterations of

285
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,920
Yeah, cuz usually it's just a montage with all the different stages like you see a gray

286
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,400
Mummy and then you see another mummy with a little more detail and it is always the mummy still

287
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,660
Yeah, it's still kind of got set on when we show people how computer characters are made. It will always be

288
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
actor Arnold Voslue

289
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,640
And look, you don't have to tell me I love Arnold Voslue

290
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:08,240
Let's get them all back for number four, you know, we we brought Brendan Frazier's come back Stephen Summers needs to have his

291
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,560
Do you know the story about how he like?

292
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,040
Lived in a house that that was apparently like people say was cursed

293
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,540
No, like Britney Spears own it owned it. I

294
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:27,980
Heard yeah, yeah through all this stuff and then he bought it and then had like these movie like

295
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,580
all his movies were hits and then he did Van Helsing and it was kind of

296
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:39,780
Barely broke even and then he he just got stuck doing he blamed the box office bomb on the house

297
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,540
People were saying okay sounds kind of fun though to just be like Van Helsing was you know, if you didn't like it

298
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,340
My house goes well, I made it so how would it be good? How was it gonna work?

299
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,260
Universal has treated I feel like universe. I was treated Van Helsing

300
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,140
In the Peter Jackson King Kong. It's like the biggest

301
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,940
21st century there there's they're still contractually obligated to speak like that

302
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,640
I feel like they're they send some yeah

303
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,300
They send some Faustian deal back then just just be like well in perpetuity you have to speak about it as if it

304
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:20,580
Yeah, yeah, and I I saw a King Kong when it opened that when you're a Christmas

305
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,020
I think I've seen half of Van Helsing on TNT. They know drama

306
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,220
But I I've seen this show a lot

307
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,040
So you're saying it's better because you've seen it

308
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,360
Oh this? Well I can vouch for it personally. You're the taste maker so you're like I am yeah

309
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,760
You're like well if I haven't seen it, it's not really close to you know, it's not

310
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,360
Van Helsing is worth half a watch. Van Helsing equals Olivia Rodriguez

311
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
You've only seen the first half of Van Helsing

312
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,240
I've seen 25 minutes of Van Helsing and I've seen all of this 25 minute show a number of times

313
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,880
Listen, if you've only seen the first half of Van Helsing, you've missed the best part, which is for an entire generation

314
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,480
There's a whole like there's a whole like werewolf thing at the end of Van Helsing that like all of the like

315
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,840
Monster lovers on Twitter are just like that was my root when I was like young like there was like

316
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,440
Yeah fucking like stuck in their heads and they're just you're like cuz it's just like this

317
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,240
It's just like it's like a ripped guy with like a werewolf head on it

318
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,440
So it's just like it's and it's just it like stuck for a lot of people

319
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,520
So yeah, you missed out on that second half man. I gotta fire a peacock

320
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:33,480
Where I would assume it would be but it is probably not listen peacock is like got everything low-key

321
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Peacock and to be you're sad that's I'm telling you all you need is peacock and to be like you and you've got all of

322
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,560
cinema covered

323
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,480
To be has I gotta go home and watch cuz I just discovered to be has cats don't dance, which is gene

324
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
I

325
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,040
Was reading about the Emperor's new groove

326
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:08,480
Okay, and I started reading about the director and it says he briefly left it left Disney to direct cats don't dance

327
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,680
Credited as Gene Kelly's final film role. Yep, cuz he is the choreographer

328
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,080
Okay

329
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,520
The

330
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,320
Character is kind of inspired by him and I'm like I didn't know this

331
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,720
I thought it was just about like a slick looking cat. So now I have to go watch this cuz I love Kelly

332
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,120
So when you see Danny t cat

333
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:40,800
Really seeing Gene Kelly for the last time but he didn't motion capture it. I don't think I don't think they were there yet

334
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,120
Doing any choreography for the penguin named Pudge I

335
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,880
Don't know cat says cats don't dance. There's no word on if Pudge dances. We don't know penguins dance

336
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,360
They do there is I don't like you have to promise me you won't talk about something else for 20 minutes

337
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,080
But I want to tell you quickly Don Knott's is in this movie

338
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,160
He has TW turtle an erotic superstitious turtle. You said neurotic not erotic, right?

339
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Yeah

340
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,400
The word was that Don Knott's like got around there's a ladies man, you've heard this I assume yes, okay

341
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm watching you for those listening my warning for those listening. I said it at all

342
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,480
So I was listening when he Mike Mike heard that he did a Don Knott's esque reaction

343
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
Some yeah

344
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:38,040
Like really yeah early style and I really do hope you get off on a tangent on this because it was Mike it has been

345
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,680
On my it's on my like bucket list to not just now that I've been on

346
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,580
Podcasts to ride to be part of a false start episode

347
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,600
Really I was like I really hope I throw this into such a disarray

348
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,400
So yeah, it's a way to buy yourself a second episode. That's true. That's true. Look, you know, we can go down my different watch lists

349
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,760
I gotta get the cats. Don't dance. I gotta finally watch cool world

350
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
To be has

351
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Okay, these are all

352
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Do the full start for you

353
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,160
Advertisements in the comic books of the time and they loomed so large. Mm-hmm

354
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,560
You for a year you look you've been 18 and over for a long time

355
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,940
It's been legal for you to see many many years

356
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,760
I think the thing to be scared of is it sucking?

357
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:48,320
Well, that's a good thing about a lot of 80s and late 80s 90s animated stuff about 70 minutes long

358
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,920
So not a huge investment sure sure. Well now the test for you with anything is does it pass the Helsing?

359
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Do you make it

360
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,760
I mean look, I don't I don't want to date it

361
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,440
But I we have a few days with nothing to do

362
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,520
Need to get my rest so I could fire up Van Helsing can fire up cast

363
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,800
Don't dance. You don't want to date it. You have a few days with nothing to do

364
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,160
Like saying what holidays are coming up because we're recording recording a little early

365
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,960
So how would you saying you have nothing to do like people would know because Jason's they all know Jason's schedule

366
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,800
Famously packed schedule. We've already kind of discussed Beetlejuice Beetlejuice is a movie that is about to open. So

367
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,120
What will cause Jason to have to leave the factory that eats his days and nights when he's not doing the fuck

368
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,040
Just just know if you're tucking in with some of these movies with to be and you put on the second half of events up

369
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,480
Then Helsing just be prepared for something to awaken in you

370
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,080
Know as at the end, you know by the second half, you know, but no one's ever prepared

371
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Here's my pitch you get the volume which is the big like fake screen

372
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,800
It's a screen they shoot the Mandalorian on it with like very ultra detailed backgrounds

373
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:13,320
You bring dad up you put the motion capture suit on dad and then you cycle through funny scenarios on

374
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,400
Stage and everyone eats it up

375
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,000
This is a perfect recipe for a theme park show and modern version of what we like and what we miss listen

376
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,800
You guys are fathers here. So you just I don't want you to go the rest of your you know, you know

377
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,840
Your fatherhood while you're while your kids are in the house, you know and not get humiliated at a theme park

378
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,920
That's your that's a rite of passage. We were all promised right growing up. Yeah

379
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,900
I think everybody was moved by Tim Walz's son saying that's my dad

380
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,300
Well, we're since there's no chance of us becoming vice president or a vice presidential nominee

381
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,620
We're waited that moment will come when we're on stage wearing a feather bella

382
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,900
With the other big theme park show participatory group

383
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,820
Members of giant Brazilian tour groups who have English as a second language

384
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,380
Okay, that was the one show I watched

385
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,220
Oh this of the makeup show right over the audience loved it

386
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,040
They're telling the show that there was a giant Brazilian tour group. I was she I think she alluded to

387
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,060
Yeah, and she was like

388
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
English was her second language, right?

389
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,340
the hosts were

390
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,700
speaking they were using that as

391
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,740
Like well spelled me a bad name for you and then they you know cut into her what I love about the horror makeup

392
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,740
show is that there are

393
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,780
You could just type that into YouTube and none of us will see the same episode. Oh, yeah

394
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:53,500
Yeah, and we've come across things and recently we're like we're just watching one person's home movie of this, huh this case

395
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:59,940
There's a ton of recent ones and then I don't remember what year I I think you know, probably like 91 or 93

396
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:08,700
Oh, yeah, hopefully we can all bring different jokes to we can all just recite very dry Lee different jokes from our performances to each other

397
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,020
I did read

398
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:16,300
This is one of Universal's official website, but a few years ago on this blog discover universal

399
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,340
There was a long profile of two actors

400
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,020
That have been doing this show forever and they've been doing lots of shows in Orlando

401
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:32,940
Summer ILO and Robin Kelly and they talk about doing this show and I would change over the years and now like if they're coming in

402
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,060
And they're working together

403
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,920
Sometimes a rock-paper-scissors for who's gonna be those and who's gonna be the effects expert?

404
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,740
Wow, and it's really fun. They know it so well they can just they can flip it easily and also yeah

405
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:52,700
Well to that end it seems like a show in which improv is allowed and encouraged and included

406
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,940
Yes, which I don't think is the case with a ton of these things especially things shows where there's sort of like tight brand management

407
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,780
But there isn't with this because they're talking about universal horror in general

408
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,900
Yeah, and it sort of is its own IP within just you know

409
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,780
All that has to happen is a guy and a Hawaiian shirt has to be very passionate about Jack Pierce or whatever

410
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:19,420
Beyond that you could sort of you could sort of do what you want Lon Chaney man of a thousand faces and that's

411
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,620
Because the original iteration of this was called the Phantom of the Opera horror makeup show

412
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:31,180
Yes, so this would that was the first the first time this clunky name was clunky

413
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,860
Was they were and it opened where you went into this opening room

414
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,860
You know much like you kind of did in all them in the murderous row on the Hitchcock one

415
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,700
Was you went into this pre-show room probably what they wrapped up the next thing and then this one was there was a guy

416
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:53,100
Dressed as Phantom of the Opera, you know original Lon Chaney Phantom of the Opera and he had a mask on and then he did a little

417
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:59,240
Ah, you know kind of while they had like a room full of props and posters and whatnot and then he kind of did his

418
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,300
Spooky intro and I'm not sure if they do that

419
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:11,120
That was also the big ending of the show was not Eddie the werewolf it was the fly

420
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,460
Chamber and that's the one I remember because that would the fly chamber which

421
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,760
You know at no offense to Eddie the werewolf

422
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,780
But they you know, the fly chamber thing was like so impressive because like you're they had

423
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:30,060
The Hawaiian shirt guy like would go in the one of the pods and

424
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,360
You know and you know everyone be like no don't get in the pod

425
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,500
You'll turn into a fly and then and then he appears in the next one

426
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:37,820
Really?

427
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,540
It's somebody else who's already got you know

428
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,860
Sort of halfway to fly makeup applied in the Hawaiian shirt and I think that might be why

429
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,940
They had that guy in the Hawaiian shirt cuz they're like, oh, I remember that's the the shirt

430
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,940
That's the same shirt the guys wear

431
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,380
Quickly you could recognize me like oh my god, it's the same person

432
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,860
but it's a very recognizable shirt and then he comes out and then he

433
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,860
Goes back. This is not this is not proper fly world building

434
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,060
But this is how they did this in the show

435
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:10,780
You can't just go back in and go go back in one came out half fly went into the other pod came out full

436
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
beast fly

437
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,360
And then he's like get back in there and then came out normal at the other one

438
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,920
So you just needed to kind of crisscross if it were that easy

439
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,080
Yeah, that would have solved all of the film's problem. Davis would not need to be so terrorized

440
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:31,040
Yeah, saw the movie and you know what? Honestly, there should be more David Cronenberg representation at the park

441
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Let's get a videodrome

442
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,320
Horror night scanners house. Oh my god, that would be scary. Yeah. Well, I think let's let's get an infinity pool

443
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
into

444
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,920
Just in general, there's just like a body horror sort of thing and it's really like interesting how because the original and I I'm sorry

445
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,120
I'm gonna I'm gonna if everybody remembers the last one. I'm

446
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,120
Mr. I only remember in 1982 and I don't recall anything else

447
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,320
There you go, so I'm just like so they had the fly and then they had the American Royal from London change

448
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,360
Oh heads as part of this as well

449
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,440
Yeah, I think they still lean on those pretty heavily because they're still very impressive and they're at the Academy Museum now still too

450
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,880
You know, so they're they're kind of all over the place, which is an interesting demonstration that that is not it's like it's it's not prosthetics

451
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,840
It's like although it's related to prosthetics and Rick Baker did it

452
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:32,240
But they're like that there's two steps of molds based on the actor's head one that is getting somewhat more

453
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,320
Wolfified and one that's all the one that has the mechanisms to make the face stretch like crazy

454
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,480
Which is also it's all interesting to watch too because you're like, what's the same?

455
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,160
It's also the thriller thing on I forgot John Landis did this too

456
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,960
So John Landis made that movie and then two years later Michael Jackson said will you just do the same thing for me?

457
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,240
Correct and then it kind of that sort of lives. I'd say higher up in pop culture

458
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,120
Then right movie. That's just a strange like hey you good job me too. It's one of those things where

459
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,560
So like I love American Werewolf on London, I think it's a it's a it's a it's fascinating that

460
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,360
That that

461
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,080
That that's like that's such a like hyper

462
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,240
Toxically straight guy

463
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,040
You know made a very fun

464
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,400
fascinating

465
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,240
Zippy sometimes accidentally queer

466
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,600
Movie, but it came from such a rat bastard

467
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,320
Like I love that movie so much but they're like, oh you're like a landis guy and I'm just like no every other movie

468
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,320
No, I think this is

469
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,600
Yeah, and I think this one of those things where that's a movie that's kind of lived on they still use it in a lot

470
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,760
Of clip shows they use it. It's a horror staple. It's really really great

471
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
It is a movie that I think like

472
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:07,680
Like Zemeckis with death becomes or he just accidentally stumbled onto like gold with that and a lot of it is the makeup

473
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,280
I think that's Rick Baker's movie to me

474
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,680
Like it's I think these are a lot that landis, you know did or whatever like that

475
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,200
But like I think the the power of that is really Rick Baker who like looms large over this show

476
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,080
Horror makeup show and and you know film makeup horror makeup in general

477
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:30,720
Did he consult on it maybe I think he may have at least like hey probably I think they talked to him and he said

478
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,520
Yeah, I got these meccanus. I think he like personally donated the American werewolf stuff

479
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:41,080
I believe yeah, because it was it was it mean because you had the to change your heads which are which are you know?

480
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,080
President because that whole sequence took

481
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,080
The week to shoot I mean and then it's like a few minutes of the movie and each like I think day was like

482
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,560
Two or three shots like it was truly like it just truly like this laborious thing that like everyone involved with now

483
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,960
It was just like oh, I wouldn't do it the same way

484
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,440
but it's like it's the thing everybody remembers about the movie, but

485
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,360
but like I he must have consulted on this because a lot of like his

486
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,240
Mentees and mentors are kind of in that there is this sort of like the more I've been was investigating this the more I was like

487
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:21,520
Like you know, cuz he was mentored by Dick Smith who did a lot of

488
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,000
The stuff that gets featured in this he did the exorcist

489
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,280
and

490
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,160
This dick Smith did a ton of stuff and and then he mentored Rob Botten who did the howling at the same time

491
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,160
So like there's a lot of just like passing this knowledge down

492
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,760
I would say through the generations, but really through 15 years

493
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,400
15 years they just very right a lot of them were like 70s and 80s when there really was a lot of this like horror like

494
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,000
You know revolutionary doing that kind of stuff where you could really the production code was over and you can really just go gnarly

495
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
on a lot of these effects

496
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,640
But yeah

497
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,200
one of the one of the movies that gets brought up a lot in in

498
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,320
The original version that I remember really scaring me was something is a movie that like not a lot of people talk about now is

499
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,880
Ghost story, which was 1981. Oh, yes. I watched that a couple years ago and read the book

500
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,560
Yeah, it's um, it's a Peter Straub

501
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,400
Yeah book and it got made into this movie with like a slew of like

502
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,980
Golden age of it like Fred Astaire is in it. Oh, wow. I've never seen this Fred Astaire

503
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,760
Melvin Douglas like Douglas Fairbanks jr. Melvin Doug. Yeah

504
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,080
yeah, and like there's like a whole bunch of that era guys who are like 80 when they made this movie when

505
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:41,600
Like 81 and it's just about them being haunted by this young woman that they killed killed

506
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:48,720
When they were teenagers, they accidentally killed and the whole thing was just like there was like a I can't remember what it was

507
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,120
But it's like it's a really freaky movie. I rate highly recommend it. It's um

508
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,760
Really nuts if you're if you're if you're down to watch like a horror movie, you're never seen it's 81

509
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,680
But it featured so prominently in this show

510
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,920
Because they brought out the the ghost woman because it's this sort of this rotting ghost skeleton woman

511
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,840
Oh, that's from the okay. Okay, we sort of have sort of a half decaying face

512
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,200
Yes, yeah, because she's they accidentally like oh she they've they're struggling and she fought

513
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,280
I remember what it is, but like it's one of those accidentals grapple grapple grapple. Oh, no accidentally dead. What do we do?

514
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,120
We have we have bright futures ahead of us. We're young men

515
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,520
We gotta

516
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,520
Put her in the car and drown the car and they do that and then oh she wasn't really dead

517
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,080
And so she like drowns in the car and remember like they showed the clip of that in this show

518
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,300
I remember being you know, like just very little watching this and just being and she's just and it's

519
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,640
If I'm pronouncing her name wrong Alice Krieg who's Borg Queen? Yeah, who's in Silent Hill just who's horror queen? Yeah

520
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,640
And she's like a very young woman in this movie

521
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:58,680
But she's extremely they very early on she was able to tap into I am a sinister person I am a sinister presence and

522
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,120
So like she's very sweet, but you she very easily taps into that sinister energy got an intense look. Yes

523
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,480
yes, and

524
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,440
Yeah, and I just remember like the way she's like pounding on the window of the cars

525
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,160
The cars sinks beneath the dark lake and it just was like it just stuck with me

526
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,400
So even when I knew we were gonna be doing this episode, I was like the first image popped in my head was like

527
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Oh the lady in the car

528
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,880
With you. Yeah, which I feel like became like a trope and cut the cars thinking like

529
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,920
maybe like

530
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,080
It became a thing where it's like, oh, I don't know what that is originally from

531
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,600
Maybe it's just that clip is in where she's like almost

532
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,040
Yeah, she's banging on the windows maybe it's a lot of those AFI specials or something it

533
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,480
Jumped like, you know, so like yeah

534
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,240
The AFI peppers where it was like, oh the hundred scariest movements in movie history and they did that around like

535
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:02,680
2002 and so it's like you get a lot of nice 80s 70s that way but can I can I just say really quick?

536
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,760
I'm looking at Alice Kriegs Wikipedia and it's like a it's a big list of you know

537
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,560
Great films and things that I basically I'm looking at blue links meaning I haven't clicked on it and there's only one

538
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,920
purple that I have clicked on and that is

539
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,600
The TV movie dynasty the making of a guilty pleasure

540
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,720
She plays Joan Collins, I believe and I have like, okay

541
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,840
So I've only clicked on this and why I've never watched dynasty. I've pursued

542
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,780
What is up with a TV movie just about the making of dynasty which wouldn't be

543
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,760
The first time I've watched a full making of bad TV movie about a show. I've never seen I

544
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Just like a good hammy represent

545
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,920
unauthorized

546
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,200
like

547
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,240
There's the real person's threatening legal action. Yeah. Yeah, so wrong

548
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,480
Yeah that they may be have to change characters names because it was so not close

549
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,720
Actually recently there were fun like there was a

550
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,840
Did the cheapest cheapo of saved by the bell and full house and a lot of good ones of Mork and Mindy way in

551
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,800
The past but then I looked and then I'm like, oh, well, you know what this is what I forgot which ties it together

552
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,400
Is that John Forsythe was on dynasty? So he's portrayed

553
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,080
Okay. Oh, I think I maybe I got to see this somebody playing John Forsythe

554
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:26,600
And Alice Cree and somebody as Heather Locklear. All right, this is going in my queue

555
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,120
To report back because like I feel like I'm gonna have a high level of expectation for who's playing Forsythe

556
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,640
Oh, yeah, I'm like, no you need to get that rhythm right Bartholomew. John

557
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,920
You had a big pop hit in Australia

558
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,840
Bartholomew Johns hit someone from from Australia. It's very funny

559
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,260
I was trying to figure out the connection because when you played the John Forsythe clip earlier

560
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:03,380
I searched him and one of the second or third suggestions was John Forsythe Joan Collins. Okay. Oh, okay

561
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,020
Yeah, yes. Yeah

562
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,940
Force that got around. Yeah. No, he was and I don't I feel like it's one of those things where like I have a question

563
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,180
About him, but I don't want to know I want him to live as a legend in my mind

564
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,420
I'm like, yeah, I feel like it was like he seems like a Shakespeare guy

565
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,340
But I like thinking of him as a guy who was like never really touched Shakespeare, but he just acted

566
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,340
He carried himself with the gravitas

567
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,100
Yeah, I mainly did introductions for rides and stuff

568
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,740
Mm-hmm. Let me can I back up and play something from let me go back to the magic of the movies nice

569
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,860
Uh a little bit more where he introduces it and then you get a little of this Phantom of the Opera thing, too

570
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,660
Oh, yeah, this is it's not gonna play to the listener super well

571
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,980
But we'll talk about what what happens here of the best-known classics of all time

572
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,220
the secrets of metamorphosis from human to horror are

573
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,860
Excitingly revealed

574
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,740
So this the lamp is is tearing up

575
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:26,700
You should learn secrets of makeup and effects, which I have chosen to allow

576
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:38,060
These secrets of the craft are for you and for no others should you choose to ignore this warning

577
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,060
I

578
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,060
Have you now you will learn the history of

579
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:59,620
Of our Rick Baker's secrets were passed on from he who hath done the makeup for the godfather

580
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,920
Do this at once or you will be mine forever

581
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
I'm in love with the no more no less

582
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,140
He's you will not learn how to be a best boy or a grip unless you will only learn makeup

583
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:20,420
Yes, like if we were if we are somehow given a subpar show, he will descend upon the hosts as well

584
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,980
Yeah, give me a lesser show to be on them for me. I'm just sitting there

585
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,120
I'm trying to learn like you told me Phantom

586
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:34,420
But also you I think what you couldn't really hear is that the Phantom is revealed by bursting through

587
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,180
Like a poster, yeah, and there's I've saw footage of that

588
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,980
Right in front of it. Yeah. Yeah

589
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:49,580
But a much darker scarier iteration of that which would have it does scare like I

590
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,900
This is it's a pretty big character a pretty big creepy face

591
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,860
And then I'm also logistically like why they had to print a new one of those posters for every single show

592
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:05,220
They probably did this like I don't know at least seven times a day the printing costs alone of this production

593
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,500
I don't know. I don't know if I remember him jumping through that thing

594
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,420
I think maybe like he could be one of those like it could be like a Disney thing where they're like

595
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:12,980
All right

596
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:17,140
We're really gonna wail on this for the first three months and then it's gonna seriously Peter. Oh, yeah

597
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,700
Well, it's also unclear to me I don't know exactly when it became

598
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,940
Because he John Forsythe said the other name

599
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,500
There was this Phantom of the Opera pre-show that didn't really

600
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:34,940
Seemingly affect the main show and then at some point it was renamed the great big clunky title

601
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:41,300
The gory gruesome and grotesque horror makeup. Yeah, I was so when you were with it for safe clip was playing

602
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,860
I was like wait

603
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:49,020
He's using the language that it eventually gets changed to if you just riffed to that they named it

604
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,900
The universal parks

605
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:58,660
Copywriters room like had two warring time and there was just a team of gory gruesome grotesque and there was a team of no

606
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,860
We got a brand manage this Phantom of the Opera

607
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,620
All those 90s 80s kids love Phantom of the Opera

608
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,260
Weber musicals out

609
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:13,060
You know and they're don't they'll get fooled into it and then I think they were they kind of split the diff and like snuck though

610
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:17,200
The terminology might have been phantom after the rename

611
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,440
But yeah, the pre-show doesn't really

612
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,800
Other than you just have to like sit in there and wait like you're trying to have fun with your Hawaiian shirt guy

613
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,440
But you're like, oh is the Phantom gonna give me if he sees me yawn?

614
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,640
Am I getting yanked out of the ceiling? Do I have to go live in the rafters with him now?

615
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,980
That's so funny that almost it's so funny that a lot of the opening day attractions a universal have this like

616
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,640
We have to make it fun and theatrical that being said it's about making things

617
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:50,440
Right, we have to figure out both ways and they was a constant adjustment until it's all just been gone as far as showing

618
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:56,520
You how to make anything. Well, they were also like you did the early making of universal stuff

619
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:03,400
There's so much of like alright, we can't be Disney. We got to go against it. We're gonna be a little edgier

620
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,160
We're gonna be a little

621
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,160
bawdier

622
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,520
Just to clarify and I

623
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:15,840
Only because I saw this on that universal profile this attraction apparently opened

624
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,520
Two weeks after the grand opening so opening month

625
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,440
Take it away from them opening day

626
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,440
Cutting the chandelier is falling

627
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,120
What the hell was anyone doing opening day because jaws

628
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:51,800
Didn't work the job wasn't there yet. The King Kong is breaking. There's a murder of crows menacing everyone

629
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:58,480
We're my was my gang at murder. She wrote mystery theater. Just holding it down preventing a riot from happening

630
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,760
Yeah, they're like, all right, keep it up, you know stretch it out, you know, just this is on our show

631
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,080
Let's do the best damn Foley effects demonstration anybody ever go along the ADR section

632
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,800
We really got a take another, you know socket wrench to King Kong

633
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,440
we got the shot of everyone walking down the main entryway and

634
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:27,480
Yeah, murder. She wrote and Hannah Barbera holding down the fort. Yeah, Fred Flintstone arm-in-arm with Robert Yurick. Yeah

635
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,720
Shots we need were they giving out refunds these the first few weeks months to imagine I wonder

636
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,360
I don't know. I've never seen any like language that suggests that but you would think people would have been furious

637
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:46,440
I feel like I I feel like in lieu of a refund. I would have preferred to just watch

638
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,200
Spielberg get visibly more distressed in the park. I don't know if he was visible to the park gas

639
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,080
I don't know why that was happening. But yeah, I feel like if he if he was in a sort of a

640
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,000
So if he was just pilloried in the middle of like Mel's dying in

641
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,040
Just being like my my rivalry with Eisner. I can't

642
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,360
Without a hitch

643
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,240
it takes a few decades to get from like

644
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:17,120
Chaos of opening day to like huh that Mel's die inside for hard nights. It's pretty clever

645
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,720
What if we put it on magnets and t-shirts? Okay, and that's what's happening this year. Yeah

646
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:32,760
33 it took the hard nights 33 before they're like maybe we should sell merch of that Mel's dying it die inside everyone likes

647
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,280
It's great. Yeah, it's great. I it's I don't know. They're they're like, you know

648
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,160
We always make fun of a Disney being like fucking 10 years

649
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,840
Ten ten years and ten steps behind everything being like slow adopters and you know Universal's faster

650
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:53,000
But they're like five years and five steps behind. Yes, so yeah nowhere close to you know, they're they're better and they're better

651
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,680
Yeah, is it possible that the experience of opening day?

652
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:03,560
Universal made it more pressing for Spielberg to make a movie about an amusement park where everything's breaking

653
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,080
Existed already, but he's like something about the book story is speaking to me, right?

654
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:17,160
Yeah, yeah, I think that you might be on to something because he might have been sweating to the same degree as Samuel L. Jackson

655
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,960
Yeah, Richard Attenborough when he does the like damn like he was not getting the line

656
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,600
Right and Spielberg was like no do it the way I did it

657
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,480
Everything broke it all happened. Yeah

658
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,560
I'm giving you a line reading. I don't care that you're one of the most well-established

659
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,560
I'm just telling you you might hear my avatar. I don't know what this is like

660
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,500
It's possible that opening day he cut the ribbon

661
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:47,640
They ushered him on ET or maybe they did ET the day before maybe cut the ribbon

662
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,880
Went to the VIP lounge for diet coke and then left. Yeah, maybe he didn't know about the chaos

663
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:59,200
And they and Spielberg they stopped him right before the green planet and they let him get off because he was too scared

664
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,200
He was just going to the green planet

665
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:08,320
Intimacy of hearing ET say his name, right? It's too personal right he is scared of teakley

666
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,920
Yes

667
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,920
No

668
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,680
Friends to how he got off at the top of the Jurassic Park that yeah

669
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,680
It was like I knew he got off at some yeah

670
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,160
No, we're nice and deep within many levels of reference

671
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:37,320
Buried in references. Yeah. Yeah. He also would not go in the edit bay for the BFG. He was terrified

672
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,320
I

673
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,560
G

674
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,640
He's frankly to be in 2g

675
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:54,800
This I did not go to Universal Orlando when I was young we were at Disney family until in my late teens

676
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,360
Unfortunately, I have never seen the Orlando show in person

677
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,480
But you guys by the way you and not so tangent here, but you and Jason have more we were a blank family

678
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,440
Yes, and I've ever heard I don't think my family had any declarations about what kind of that's the way to be

679
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,240
This is giving me because like my family went to both

680
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,520
but I don't think we ever had like it I feel like when you say stuff like that it gives me the impression that like

681
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,320
Universal was suggested and then like your father angrily was like no

682
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:31,520
Now look at me look at your mother you see your eyes in her do you see your face in me?

683
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,920
Know that we are I am a Disney man, and you will be a Disney man like me

684
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,840
Well, these are very big. It's very funny when it boils when it's a family. It's like we don't go to I hop

685
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:50,040
We're Denny's family. You know I feel like you'll bust out of nowhere. You'll go like we were all lemons family

686
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,000
I was taking a walk mother

687
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,160
I was taking a walk, and I bet there's some neighbors had lime sitting out in a basket

688
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,840
Your mom just crushes it in her hand throws it back in your face

689
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:12,320
Lime sting I occasionally I never remember. It's funny you say that I never remember having lines in the house

690
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,600
But you know we always had in the house the plastic

691
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,300
Lemon filled with lemon juice. Oh yeah sure

692
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:26,700
Fortified and just laughs forever mm-hmm that was legit

693
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,840
Yeah, that was the most seasoning or plate that was like that was

694
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,860
lemon juice my ice water

695
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,860
I've never been again. I've never been young let me

696
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:50,500
Hey, here's a tip for a natural spring in your step lemon juice and ice water. This is a clip of you at 11 years old

697
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,460
Like I came here because I heard you had video games. Yeah, I go

698
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:04,940
Lemonade stand and you're like sorry you're misunderstood it is lemon juice in ice water

699
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,940
It's none of this

700
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:17,980
What are you getting lemonade mixes so expensive these days the country times on the top shelf that's for the fancy

701
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,740
That's not for the riff-raff here on the street just to squeeze that's all the flavor you need

702
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:31,900
I know if it's bedtime it can just have some orange seltzer from path mark. You know

703
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,900
Is path mark a local

704
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:43,860
Pathmark I think got absorbed by one of the company shop right is still around that grocery store

705
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:48,700
Do you want to shop right in Illinois would have been Dominic's probably that sort of thing or like a dual osco?

706
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:54,540
Yeah, I don't know where they is I wonder if they were as big as Dominic's was as far as grocery stores in the Midwest

707
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,740
But maybe maybe that is the same

708
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:00,460
There was a place called far more in the Midwest for a while where I would rent video games and we would get

709
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,820
prescriptions filled

710
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,380
So there were multiple things you could do at a far more

711
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:12,980
Aid like you go there and you'd get your little square ice cream and you could rent DuckTales on Nintendo

712
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,940
They often would have it that was in

713
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,260
The way wins had a big video store

714
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:26,580
Never seen that before interesting grocery store with rentals. I don't think I ever even

715
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,660
Considered going to Universal when I was a child. I don't think we don't go there

716
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,060
So I was never a thing I asked to do

717
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:39,380
So I it's weird to even think about cuz I like the way like your religion is handed out to you

718
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,460
Yeah, right. Well, I guess I'm dizzy

719
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,660
I'm a Disney and right and then I think spider-man opened at Islands of Adventure

720
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:52,100
Oh and that drew you and I said well if we're going there we should go to spider-man, right?

721
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:57,300
It was like, oh, okay. Yeah, so we can go to we can go to Universal then so that was not but there was no protest

722
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,740
It just needed to be vocalized. I think yeah

723
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,740
No, there wasn't so it's it's interesting to think about in hindsight

724
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,940
And I've said this many times before when I would see stuff about Disneyland when I was a kid. I'd say oh, well

725
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:11,420
That's interesting. I'll never go there. I only go to our land. We go to Orlando

726
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,640
Why would I ever go to Disneyland in California? It's too far. Yeah, so I yeah

727
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,660
But that being said this would have scared the shit out of me. I was so scared by me

728
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,260
I mean, I liked Star Trek the next generation and makeup and weird stuff

729
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:30,060
But it was so I was so scared of all of it says genuine. This says like this says jump scares. Yeah

730
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:36,300
When you meet the Hawaiian shirt guy he comes out just brandishing a gun

731
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,660
Yeah, at least in task versions of it like where's my I don't remember the name

732
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:46,660
But he cut it like all right, and here's this guy bang bang bang charging at the audience. Yeah

733
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:51,700
Yeah, nowadays it comes out with a knife in his chest like a bloody knife. Oh, okay

734
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:58,460
I remember seeing like pamphlets or ads or something where like this show before I had seen it where it was like

735
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,820
Someone getting there like arm cut it like oh your arms getting cut open

736
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,820
I just was like so like I just thought it was real

737
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,700
It's dead too old to be thinking it was real, but I was like, oh they cut somebody open

738
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,500
I don't know about that

739
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,860
But like and this is one of those things where I feel like it like and like you mentioned with the spider-man

740
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:20,820
Bringing you into universal. It's sort of like that moment in the in like the the rock star biopic where they're like

741
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:27,660
What's the strange white powder? Oh, it's interesting. What's you know, it's like all the ominous like oh, it starts. Yes

742
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,380
That's what brought me into horror. I still don't like they they still do that

743
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,340
Put your knife in the arm Trek and I know it's fake

744
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:42,300
I know it slides up and it fits and it's dull and everything but that rocking back and forth with the fake

745
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,340
I hate it the magic of the movie

746
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,860
It creates me out

747
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,620
Eddie comes alive for the fly

748
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:58,700
Transformation in the previous iteration so much of pro wrestling watching it over the last few decades has gotten me prepared for

749
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,100
Starting to watch horror movies in the last six seven years

750
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,980
Yeah, just because of the amount of blood sometimes you'll see

751
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:12,860
Last year there was a match where one wrestler drank another wrestlers blood for real in the ring and it's really gross

752
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,860
But there was part of me going that's awesome

753
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,940
Some level like I have it's a full transformation for me from like

754
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,580
Yeah, so like oh, okay. Yeah gross gross me out something

755
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:32,980
Yeah for you you'd say no to us a lemon squeezed in ice water say a glass of blood

756
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:42,740
Speaking of nasty little freaks this picture of Lon Cheney with his makeup kit is like a universal go-to

757
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,020
In footage. Yeah, I mean devious in it

758
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,220
Yeah, anybody like I get like he rocks

759
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:55,140
But like there's like anybody who was like that into a thing before it was a big thing is just a little freak

760
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,980
Like you're like, oh, you're just this little freak and it was like you pioneered it

761
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,260
But it was like it's just cuz he liked doing it

762
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:07,300
He like, you know, it was just this this whole thing and I and I love I love I love little freaks

763
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,100
Being a little freak about my own stuff and I support everyone's little freedom

764
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,620
I love this story is the anecdotes again

765
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:21,100
They get recycled so much in like making of rides or specials about how many like

766
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:27,140
Four hours in the makeup chair to become a Frankenstein eight hours become the moment like I love that stuff

767
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:31,900
I love a good like when it was like Rebecca Romaine during Mystique where it was just like yes, she

768
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,700
Hated it

769
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:40,220
Like 12, it was some insane amount of like it was like it was like all day in the chair and then like we'll shoot for

770
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:44,180
An hour of right like ha ha to Wolverine and then then we're done it

771
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:46,780
See you tomorrow and she like doesn't say much in those movies

772
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,380
No, so it's like it's just a full-body makeup job

773
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:54,060
Yeah, and then I mean she's prominently just shown in the movie

774
00:57:54,540 --> 00:58:01,020
Like what am I doing here? Well, but it like it's her not speaking in those things like ended up working because it like created

775
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,620
Like this sort of nice or a mystique if you will sure

776
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,140
that

777
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:12,460
Made it all the weirder with that when Jennifer Lawrence was doing it and she has like whole soliloquies wearing the same makeup

778
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:18,580
You're just like just talking too much. This is too much person. This is too much emoting for yeah for this level of

779
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:23,660
All-body bluetude and also not how mystique looks in the comics

780
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:35,140
Her legs are out but it's like yeah, like a loincloth long loincloth covering like a sort of a Greek goddess sort of white

781
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:38,780
Yeah, wrap skull belt buckle the skull belt buckle. Yeah

782
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,820
Have as much makeup if they just replicated that yeah

783
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:50,340
The I like those stories of makeup like Jim Carrey Grinch where he had to have like some sort of CIA

784
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,780
torture specialist that could train they trained him how to

785
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,860
Deal with getting all this stuff put on his face

786
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:02,180
Like I would need but I've done a little of I had to do this thing for Conan where they put

787
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:09,100
Two and a half hours of makeup on me and it gets you get weird you can get really like claustrophobic and it's an interesting

788
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:14,700
Thing it's on you it's on your body. Yeah sticky. It's like it's like merging with you

789
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:21,460
Yes, and you can't take take it. Can I take it off for an hour real quick? Like no you can't like no

790
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:26,180
I think that was one of the things going back to American World from Lyndon, which gets featured in this is

791
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:33,660
I think what they did for that actor was they started with the full makeup and then they just backtracked it

792
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,700
So like every day after that was a little less so they do like we're gonna start with the worst

793
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:43,660
And then after that we're gonna like, you know, cuz it's you know progressing so then they like kind of did a little less

794
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:49,020
So I think they started with the full, you know applique and then they just sort of like started cutting it away

795
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:55,140
Like trimming it down. So it was like, okay if you're having a panic about it, like it's gonna be a little less each day

796
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,140
that's the worst part has got to be the

797
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:04,260
you know, cuz there's something like it's like you're saying Jason there's something neat about like four hours to become but then like

798
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:08,340
Less glamorous how long it takes to get all this shit off

799
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:14,100
so then like and at least when you're getting the makeup on then like you're watching it build and you're watching craftsmen do their

800
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,620
Thing and then you get to come out on the set and everybody's like wow

801
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,620
Look at you and you go roar and then you get to act for a little bit

802
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:26,060
But then if it takes three hours to take it off and your reward is just like alright, go to bed now

803
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:30,500
Come back at 530. Yeah, and you're I think that's the part that isn't said enough

804
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,780
Just rip you could hurt yourself you just start ripping it out

805
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:39,660
Yeah, and sometimes you're dealing with mechanisms that have to you know, stay in good shape for the rest of it

806
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:44,500
Yeah, really expensive stuff that they've like processed and they and I think they did something like that. Yeah

807
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:49,140
Yeah, I wonder if you could nap during that if you're like Jack Nicholson

808
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:53,100
I think nap during Joker makeup from according to Michael Keaton. Yeah, he was fault, right?

809
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,400
I feel like he was calling the shots though

810
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,820
I wonder if like he was so one because the story was that he wouldn't work if there was a Laker game the night

811
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:05,140
Before that's right. Yeah, like there was stuff built in his contract. So he could he called the shots of how things would work

812
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,780
That's funny. I know there I guess you know

813
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:12,420
I know he had like the map like the crazy meh, but it's what I flashed to was just the version where he just

814
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:20,460
I'm taking a goddamn nap. All right, 20 minutes in the chair. I'm bored to tears

815
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,180
some of the

816
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:31,020
Those big outfits or makeup like you can't even take a drink like they have to give you a straw for water

817
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,900
or

818
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,380
soda or like sometimes it's like I

819
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:40,660
Add a smoothie for lunch because I can't take this thing off. Well, you know Star Trek

820
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,260
actors also I think about cuz

821
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:49,580
You know whether it's war for its quark or its neelix from Voyager you get on you're like

822
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,860
I got cast on a Star Trek show. This is gonna run for years

823
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:57,620
Also, I have to get there four hours early every day for seven years

824
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:02,180
Yeah, and have this makeup on me and like if I ever want to come back

825
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:06,420
I have to get the makeup so like it's like a weird like blessing curse. Yeah

826
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:11,660
We're yeah, I'm sure they I think as they go they like figure out ways to cut down on time

827
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,420
But still it's so many hours

828
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:19,260
it's just funny how like counterintuitive it is because you brought up Nicholson's Joker and I just like how far we've gone from like

829
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:26,660
All right, I'm gonna nap in this makeup and I'm gonna you're gonna work around my Laker schedule to like anyone doing the Joker now

830
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:30,260
It's just like we had a psychiatrist on set because I went too close to the edge

831
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:36,180
Institutionalized my you know, I didn't speak to my wife for three years

832
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:45,780
Male pig fetuses to people it is real like have you tried acting dusty?

833
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:47,780
Yes

834
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,420
And it's just like you'd think

835
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:54,580
It would make more sense if it's like listen, he went to the edge

836
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,380
He was in that chair for eight hours sure

837
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:01,820
But now it's like there's less makeup but more madness behind the scenes

838
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:07,380
Yeah, now the joker maybe just gets a little smear, but then you turn you turn your brain into a smear

839
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,020
Yeah

840
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,420
I think probably like that

841
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:15,100
I think maybe it is just because like once you've spent that many hours in the chair and you're getting like all that stuff put

842
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,580
You start to just get really real and you're like, this is all right

843
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:22,060
Let's just shoot this and I'm not gonna pretend to be like I'm actually the man

844
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:27,220
Who was it in in the robber patents in Batman?

845
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,260
There's the like is it a deleted scene or a bear is a very key

846
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:38,020
So he might be did I say you wanted you I used to I thought I said Keegan I know it's a key

847
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:44,100
I think it's no, it's a yeah. I don't know. I'm sorry. It's it's mr. Barry. Okay, mr. Barry

848
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,100
Okay

849
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,820
Yeah, yeah, but he's very clean he's like his

850
01:03:52,340 --> 01:04:00,300
Filmography is like really grown. So it's like he could very well be queuing up for like an intense Joker performance

851
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:07,060
Everyone will play the Joker in the next there will be more jokers in our lifetime than we even imagine now someone in this room

852
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:10,380
We'll play the joke someone in this room will play Joker. Not who we think five years

853
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,380
I

854
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:17,140
It's like it's one of those thing I feel like if it's this point if you were cast as the Joker and

855
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:23,100
You do like like if I was gonna play the Joker, I'd feel a lot of pressure to be like, yeah

856
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:27,220
I I don't know. I you know, I you know, I you know and just sort of act mad

857
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:32,940
but like, you know, and because I'm like, that's what everyone's expecting they're gonna if I if I say anything less than like I

858
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,660
Was I was someone called, you know, someone did a 5150 on me or something like that

859
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:43,900
Like I liked it like anything less than that people be like, oh, it's not as intense of a yeah performance. It's just a silly

860
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:49,420
Nicholson esque, right? Well, I think in the wake of the ledger Joker

861
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:55,460
Everyone's felt the need to go a certain rain road with it and I have yet to see somebody take

862
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:58,460
But yeah, that's about being the joke

863
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:01,340
But he was like he was not acting that way on

864
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:07,380
Just like skateboarding on set like it was just like that's what people away but from other reasons

865
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,980
It's not like war was like, yeah that tortured him or something. But then people are like, I don't know

866
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:16,220
He's yes skateboarding on set and like he's maybe not as it in one video

867
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:19,620
You realize he was really all he really had to do was transform into Tom Waits

868
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:25,340
Well, yes the Tom Waits voice comparison that crazy. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen it. No, I love it

869
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:30,540
I'm like it's it. I'm just like yeah, that's what people should just just be like

870
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:35,420
Yeah, some some weird old dick cabin interview if somebody don't people don't remember and just like do that bit

871
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:40,900
I really don't know. I heard I've certainly familiar with his music, but I didn't know how much Tom Waits licked his lips

872
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:53,020
Maybe in the way that like filmmaking is some people are trying to swing it back to

873
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,060
Shooting on film and more practical makeup

874
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:02,700
Maybe we need the next Joker to be like I just showed up and I was this silly goose

875
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:09,380
Yeah, you know, I just drove Batman nuts like yeah, it was fun. I'm not gonna shave my mustache paint over it

876
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,620
Yeah, all right. Well, I think Jason's auditioning

877
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:21,260
We were recording the other day and I was just starting to like, you know, feel it like a silly

878
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,260
I was just being a little silly

879
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:30,660
For instance the other day I was feeling like a silly little I was a so could I not be the Joker?

880
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,700
I was like

881
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,700
Wrapping up. I'm just feeling like silly goose

882
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:43,820
This this Joker takes the podcast conversations in chaotic direction

883
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:51,460
And to fight the chaos, let me say let's talk about some more things in this show

884
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:56,540
Yeah, hey look you get your yeah, you get your your like cleaver in the arm

885
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:57,360
Yes

886
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,420
the hole for the

887
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:03,460
It's it's you know what a lot of blood in this for a year-round show that kids are at and there's moments where they

888
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,780
Have to say hey, maybe kids close your eyes

889
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:11,260
They used to do a thing and this must have gone, you know due to sensitivity to gun violence

890
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:15,860
But that I didn't know that in the early iteration that they would bring out just a head

891
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:23,820
On a table that could talk and they would shoot the head and in front of like a really clean white

892
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:29,220
Backdrop right just to show you how squibs work. It was a different time 2007

893
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:36,340
Now they make it a thing where the head can still talk they don't they don't perfectly right reenact William H

894
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,340
Macy and boogie nights

895
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,220
Listen it's chunky is we can do a like yeah

896
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:48,140
I let's expand this out of the horror genre and do like make up these squib effects for you know that sort of those

897
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,840
Here's how we did the elevator sequence and drive

898
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,580
just explode

899
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,580
They do also I think it's one of the early ones it must be I can't imagine that today

900
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:02,980
They would be cutting a woman's arm and then say she's a bleeder

901
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:13,860
Well, we watched the one of the 91 ones and they brought a woman on stage and they went take off your clothes and

902
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:15,860
She was just like Jesus Christ

903
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,180
Yeah, they were just

904
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:23,400
Figuring it out back then I guess it was sort of an early iteration of like the

905
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:26,460
Bill and Ted like where they're just like, yeah, we're gonna get a little

906
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:34,600
We're gonna get you know, calm down mother I think you just said your Joker's catchphrase

907
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:47,380
Well, I don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable but the Joker doesn't care about that because he's a little naughty naughty

908
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,420
Discomforting you

909
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,660
Is your does your Joker dress up in a little sailor suit as well

910
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:01,260
He got well, I think he would have a lot of outfits. Okay. Good. Yeah much like Duffy

911
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:03,700
Yeah, he's kind of like a twisted Duffy

912
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,920
Duffy the Disney bear. Yeah, I think your Joker should do a lot of like

913
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:10,180
sort of

914
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:14,660
25 year dated sort of like like we're sort of like all those are kind of pushing the line

915
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:21,620
They're a little iffy sort of theme park jokes. Oh, you're just like, oh, I'm sitting here. I'm a little uncomfortable with this

916
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:26,980
It's a little gawdier than Deadpool's story time where he tells jokes that

917
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,980
elicit probably the reaction from the crowd of like Deadpool

918
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,820
Come on Deadpool. No

919
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:41,380
That's why you just you say like I think you would say hey, all right lay lady take off your clothes. Naughty Naughty

920
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,900
Naughty Naughty undercuts it. Yeah

921
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,700
We're all invited in on the joke

922
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:52,280
Right, yeah, just just remember at my core. I'm just a silly goose

923
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:01,920
Sorry apologies, I didn't mean it at the end of the day look look at me think silly goose

924
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:07,940
You're in a net upside down of said City Hall Batman's like, oh, we got you now. You're like, I'm just a silly goose

925
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,940
Yeah, I'm just a little guy. You gotta let me go

926
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,660
Yeah, we can get James Gunn to listen to this

927
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:18,340
I think maybe for his bad because there's gonna be two versions of Batman in case everybody didn't know

928
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:23,420
There will be a Matt Reeves Batman and a different James Gunn produced Batman

929
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:27,060
He's producing both of them secondly, but maybe Joker for that more

930
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:32,540
gunified Batman some it recently sometimes you've been telling me stuff that I know

931
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:40,820
Is accurate but I'm like, are you making a joke because I'm like, oh, I hadn't heard the James

932
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:43,380
Gunn bad the James Gunn

933
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,900
DC you whatever that it's called now

934
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:53,920
DC you well the DC you was the whatever was before old one whatever the James Gunn a verse of DC

935
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:58,900
When he did that video like here's what to expect. It was very if you've seen it the mr

936
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:03,220
Show pre-taped call-in show. Oh, it was just a lot of no, this isn't Batman

937
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:08,480
There's we'll have a Batman but the Batman is gonna be that's part of DC

938
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:13,060
World right and then that's a joker, but it's they will have a joker

939
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:17,220
But it's not joker and it's and there was a whole lot of explaining

940
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:23,220
There's a lot of like listen, we don't care doesn't sing only that joker sings. That's prestige joker

941
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:29,280
That's joker. Right and so there was a lot of caveats of like listen, we're building something but

942
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,780
We are not putting all of our chips on this. We still need these

943
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:39,720
Moneymakers to continue right right. So anyway, he'll listen hopefully as much explanation as Jason

944
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:46,120
What you're a you know current ones how this shows different, you know, what's a I remember this area

945
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,800
I feel like I don't know if I did jokes like this is a tour guide

946
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,960
but like I know that like there seems to be a top a topical slot that where you refer to somebody as a

947
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,880
Monster and then you say a currently famous person

948
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:06,040
Hmm, and I think this is a tougher area these days because we're not gonna do the thing where we bring up somebody who's having trouble

949
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:12,560
Yeah, we call them a monster so it leads to a pretty inexplicable version of this in one that I saw from this year

950
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:18,120
Which is like they make all of the you know, here's all the universals great monsters Frankenstein Dracula

951
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,760
Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey

952
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:27,120
And I think the audience is confused because like they're pretty well regarded, right? Yeah, they're

953
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:31,480
In the media a lot, but I don't feel like annoying and overexposed. It's a weird

954
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,960
I don't think anybody knows what to do. Right? Yeah, it's not like Paris Hilton in 2006. Yeah

955
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:44,720
Went for 2019 and I believe they showed bride of Frankenstein. They were like Lady Gaga and then Frankenstein Bradley Cooper

956
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,320
Bradley the star is born

957
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:55,120
Was pretty recent and then of course there was some Kardashian jokes and the more Reese, you know, because they don't want to get into like

958
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,220
You know or they could just go broad. They could just be like the monster

959
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:03,300
That presidential camp, you know candidate you don't like

960
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:15,940
That's as close as you could sit you certainly can't you can't use gender specifics you get that gives you clues that that

961
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:21,620
That actor or director or producer that we don't hire anymore, right?

962
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,620
You know the one I'm talking about

963
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:29,160
He was in the absent of Deadpool 3 but he's in one and two

964
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:34,740
You call in threats to amtrak you don't get in movies anymore

965
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:42,840
It's the monster the the the the person who's on the it ends with us press tour. You don't like

966
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,980
Whichever one you don't like

967
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:51,980
Did he write during the strike I think he wrote it before the strike

968
01:13:55,300 --> 01:14:00,020
Yeah, that is I want yeah cuz that was such an easy cut and dry thing 15 years ago

969
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,520
Whichever like young lady was struggling

970
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:09,700
Yeah, right at her. Yep, and it would get a big reaction, but that doesn't yeah

971
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,300
We were a little more like oh, yeah, maybe not anymore

972
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:18,660
the show did come back like after the park opened in 2020 and

973
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:22,460
You know, obviously they were wearing face shields and masks and stuff

974
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:28,860
But I think the thing that is pretty funny is all the heads of the monsters having surgical masks on

975
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:32,940
Oh, that is cute. That is cute. Great. Yeah

976
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:34,940
it's

977
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:38,460
That I wonder I was gonna say you said it's what it was, Florida in 2020

978
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,460
So I don't know that everybody was wearing a mask

979
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:46,140
If I was performing in that show I'd be like, well, hey someone in this room's got a mask

980
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:51,140
I think the theme parks had mandates longer than

981
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:54,540
Yeah, that makes sense

982
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:57,940
They were playing a game of chicken. Yeah for sure where it was just like yes

983
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:03,660
We're thinking yes that they were they were doing that for a while and then it was just very clear that it just was like

984
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:10,700
Oh, we're gonna lose people. It's just fine. It's fine. Yeah, just put the let's put the you know, the the sanitizer stations

985
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,460
Looks nice

986
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:18,020
but yeah, you know like it's it's a it's a actual demonstration of

987
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,700
makeup to show and you get a lot of like

988
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:25,060
Clip reels that pay tribute to Universal's legacy and show actually

989
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:30,780
Genuinely upsetting and scary stuff which leaves a mark when you're a kid and that spirit that all has kind of remained the same

990
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:35,700
But like the set pieces have changed in and out and it used to be it used to build up to this fly thing

991
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:39,820
but now it builds up to the sequence where there is a

992
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,060
big werewolf that is

993
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,100
supposed to be a

994
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,900
mocap controlled

995
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:54,180
But after a while it's revealed that that's a person in a suit once they break free and then they do a big genuine

996
01:15:54,180 --> 01:16:00,700
Scare of the audience we've talked about this before because they had this same they brought the same thing to the special effects

997
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,620
Stages, which we talked about with Carl Tart forever go

998
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:09,140
So we're we're back to Eddie unless there's a different name. I don't recall

999
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,980
Though you're controlling the werewolf gag

1000
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:15,820
Scared the shit out of me when I first saw it in the 2000s

1001
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:22,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and apparently it scared somebody so badly in 2002. She fell off the stage

1002
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:28,860
I was just gonna bet you that the incident the incident. Yes, and it no longer does something

1003
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,980
So she fell off the stage and broke her leg

1004
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:37,360
And obviously they probably paid her out the ass

1005
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:44,100
But the big change in the show is the audience volunteer gets back to their seat

1006
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,100
And then Eddie comes to life

1007
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:52,180
Got it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you don't something doesn't charge at you while you're on an elevated

1008
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:57,340
Do some like

1009
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:00,100
Yeah, then yeah, it did seem to be yeah

1010
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:05,180
Like a plug it was a it was a it was a definitely like a like a Kelsey Grammer type fall

1011
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:10,460
Where it was like really like it was a it was like, oh stop the show. Oh, yes. Yes. Yeah

1012
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:13,220
Right I

1013
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:18,180
I looked up this show because because I feel like this show practically

1014
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:24,300
It's also a good place to cool down 25 minutes in the dark in the air conditioning

1015
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,420
This is brought up a lot online

1016
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:30,420
it's also a good place to hide out from the rain in either the

1017
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,900
Entrance lobby or the exterior the show

1018
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,380
But I

1019
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:42,060
I also was a thing. I like to look up for these off the more off the beaten path

1020
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:49,340
Attractions is what is the old merch being sold on eBay and I only found two things

1021
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,820
I found this kind of ugly postcard

1022
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:56,780
With like a man and a very very good show time

1023
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,340
Go story ghoul

1024
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:04,580
And then this limited edition pin of the marquee

1025
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,220
Except the marquee says universal instead of Pantages

1026
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:17,620
Which drives me nuts. I don't do we say that this is you go inside a replica of the Pantages theater

1027
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:21,380
No for this show, which is a good replica

1028
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:26,460
I went online and looked and the Pantages I didn't realize it was such a

1029
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:32,820
Complicated design because usually has so many banners on it. Now. Is it does it still say Pantages?

1030
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:37,580
I know in the foresight video it said Pantages, but like is this is this like something that they had to lose at some point?

1031
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,940
Maybe yeah, I think in reality. Oh just for merch over selling it and got it

1032
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,420
The picture in the app still says Pantages great

1033
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:48,340
Okay, so what's the one look at the description in the app too?

1034
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,860
The current description

1035
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:59,500
Okay, take a close. Look at what goes into and oozes out of some of Hollywood's strangest creatures

1036
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:05,220
Hmm oozes out of yeah, not exactly a good description

1037
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,340
Yeah, it doesn't like puss

1038
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,460
15 minutes of puss play

1039
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:17,340
Yeah, but I'll tell you one thing you you're you're given for side to run for his money for for the for the descriptor there

1040
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,740
You know, I you could do some voiceover stuff. Oh, yeah, they do it

1041
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:25,180
I thought let's do a new magic of the movies hosted and let's get you, you know hosted by Jason Sherman by the Joker by

1042
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:29,220
Jason Joker

1043
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:35,180
Brothers they universal they have relationship with the the Harry Potter. That's right

1044
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:41,940
They always say is the universal gonna buy Warner Brothers or another studio or they always do say that

1045
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:46,100
They always be saying that listen. I let's let's let's keep mashing these

1046
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,780
Companies together until we're left with

1047
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:56,060
We all definitely have jobs for one cool company it'll be great for everyone's jobs

1048
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,940
Wow get my picture under the smile

1049
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:11,740
Nice to see you know that that that Florida gets a Pantages is nice that we don't have to hog

1050
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:15,740
The Pantages a place that we all are at all the time

1051
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:22,720
Nary a weekend that I'm not hanging out at the Pantages theater. Yeah a great area just yeah

1052
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,780
A lot of like yes, I'm in, Los Angeles

1053
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:33,300
Yeah, yeah programs a lot of their shows at the former Kodak theater where the Oscars are

1054
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:38,580
I would every saw Margaritaville. I know exactly where to park if you told me to go there right now

1055
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:44,740
I would know exactly where to leave my car. No time wasted and no getting tricked into 30 unnecessary dollars

1056
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:52,180
I remember this also here's a role like universal detail that I that there was the little they had little stands

1057
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:58,420
That you could put your camera on and then there'd be a matte painting a mini matte painting

1058
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:06,660
on top like that you could practically use with your camera and in this case because it's just kind of like the bottom part of

1059
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:13,760
The Pantay, but they with the magic of matte paintings. You could put your camera there and then make it look like there's a giant grand

1060
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:19,720
Marquis and back truck they did that on that you could take a picture of the back of the future ride and it looked like there was a

1061
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:24,640
Space shuttle rocket. Oh, right right on top. Yeah, these were I love these they didn't work very well

1062
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:30,680
You would get them back and like yeah with my bad like disposable film camera and not work at all

1063
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,760
But I sure liked learning about how matte paintings worked

1064
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,760
Oh, it was a thrill to put your disposable camera on that thing. Yeah, and it would not

1065
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,380
Cut off all the crap around it, but it was cool. It was fun. Yes

1066
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,240
Did you do you guys have have the photos still somewhere?

1067
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:52,420
So I remember having a disposable roll where I took a lot of pictures of the Triceratops encounter

1068
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:58,200
At islands of adventure and so if you want to see some very some dark dark

1069
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:05,480
Photos that you could maybe a forensics expert could make out there is a fake baby Triceratops

1070
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:11,520
Yeah, I could post though. Those will be that all the likes will be flying when we get those on the socials

1071
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:20,560
Something about like this show that I really really appreciate and I love that it's still around is that I think you know

1072
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,560
I love horror and

1073
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:30,000
Universal has just never really lost track of like that's where their bread and butter is that it's just like even through every

1074
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,800
Up and down that they have had as a studio

1075
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,440
film studio and as a park

1076
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:42,100
That they are leaning into that and they go and we're gonna start to get that again soon with the epic universe

1077
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:48,220
Where they're finally doing something horror related. So like this was sort of this was their horror event even before they did

1078
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:52,580
Horror nights, you know, they did horror nights. They're gonna do this Vegas horror thing

1079
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,380
And then the epic universe thing

1080
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:02,500
So I just I'm happy to see them continually reinvest in this and you're getting a lot of it's a way to like keep an older

1081
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500
Thing around and keep it newer

1082
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:10,500
Which I'm I'm always happy when either parks can do that, right?

1083
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,540
And it's not yeah

1084
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:16,700
Cuz it's not a big there's not a big hit movie franchise right now for them

1085
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:22,220
Even though that's what they eventually want back there. So it's good that they're still keeping it alive like this

1086
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:26,020
They're starting to do we will we will see

1087
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:32,180
But they're starting to do because they're starting to do the Universal Monsters because they did invisible man with Elizabeth Moss

1088
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:37,900
And then they are about to next year do wolf man again. They're doing that with Christopher Abbott and

1089
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,660
The same director is invisible man

1090
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:46,180
So like they find these sort of interesting ways to make these classic monsters sort of relevant and you know

1091
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:49,660
Make it feel urgent and not like, you know, kind of we're doing this again

1092
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:55,240
So and I did a little investigation on lights. We don't really know a lot yet about this new wolf man one

1093
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,240
But there is a whole

1094
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:03,500
Practical makeup effects team listed on IMDB. So it does seem like we're doing some practical stuff there

1095
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:10,020
You know, I know cuz I know that was something that Rick Baker fought a lot on on the Benicio del Toro wolf man

1096
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,380
That was 2010

1097
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,580
Was he did a big stuff with creature design?

1098
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:19,700
But then they decided to opt for digital for the transformation it and it really was this half-and-half and it really was sort

1099
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:25,900
Of the beginning and the end of his retirement where he was just like I feel like everyone's moving away from what I want to do

1100
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,860
But hopefully like he said Jason that we're moving back into that

1101
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:35,780
We'll probably be the guy from the show doing the make the Hawaiian shirt guys probably working on the wolf man

1102
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:40,700
Oh, yeah, yeah when there aren't audiences in there. I don't know another audience

1103
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:45,120
Slow down wolf man work the name of this

1104
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,580
The character the host character is officially named Alex Ross

1105
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:58,220
Which is also a big paint comic book painter. Yeah, so that's that always confused me

1106
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:03,080
Okay, like I was like, wait a minute. Is this a reference like

1107
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,020
The

1108
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:09,860
It was the the Batman and Superman one. I'm not a kingdom come

1109
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:15,380
Kingdom come it was the it was like one was like the Superman peace and then one was like Batman war

1110
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,380
Yeah, it was like 90s or something

1111
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,820
Yeah, I don't think I think that's not related

1112
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,420
Generic name and it Alex can be

1113
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:35,960
Gender-neutral there are a lot more that profile was like yeah, this show used to be all men and there are a lot more women

1114
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:44,300
Doing it in the mix, but you can see it's nice because they said like yeah, there's a lot of fans of this show

1115
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:46,180
They brought us gifts

1116
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:52,740
They someone made little rubber duckies of the hosts and the makeup artists and they put them on one of the shelves

1117
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:59,380
In the stage and it's it's nice. So there's super fans of the characters in the show

1118
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:04,660
Wow, I think so. Yeah, but not the actual performers. No, there are of the performers. Oh, okay

1119
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:11,740
Really? Oh, yeah, they probably like who memorized. I like this one. I like this Alex in particular. Oh, yeah

1120
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:21,260
She when she worked up at the Frog choir she would talk about there were regulars

1121
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:25,720
there were super fans there were regular photographers who would send pictures and

1122
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:29,420
So I'm nervous about all of these people you're describing but

1123
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:42,220
Enjoy that they exist. Yeah, but there's a dinner party where we are all there maybe

1124
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:45,060
Not so much or maybe I don't know

1125
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:53,180
That would be very interesting look as long as they don't call me late for dinner, that's all I'm saying

1126
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:06,980
Aphorisms for the 1950s getting people on board. I like the idea that potentially your Joker never does anything illegal

1127
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,100
You're just kind of a rascal

1128
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:14,660
He seems to be appealing to the silent generation

1129
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:21,180
Disturbing the peace and then we're like, what can we book him for?

1130
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:30,500
Alfred there's a really annoying guy out there. I gotta stop him

1131
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:35,420
He says ain't I a stinker a lot

1132
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:40,820
Bothers me, but I'd be sad if he wasn't around like I'd like him

1133
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,380
Yeah, he's interesting something about it. Yeah, it's fascinating. Yeah kill him

1134
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:52,180
He didn't put a banana at a tailpipe like Beverly Hills cop, but he left some bananas by the rear wheel

1135
01:27:54,940 --> 01:28:00,140
Yeah for someone else doing a note that just said naughty naughty, so now he's writing it down

1136
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:03,460
It's a lot like a lot like the original little rascal

1137
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:04,900
I

1138
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:08,340
All in one all rolled into one less crimes than hygiene

1139
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,900
he drew a

1140
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:15,500
Crack on my windshield and there was no crack. I was very upset for about 20 seconds

1141
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,820
Pencil and he just rub it off

1142
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:26,340
Smudge there I can't get the smudge. Yeah

1143
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:31,900
Anything else about the show before we wind it down. It's hey, I don't know. It's it's it's fun

1144
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:37,620
It illuminates great the great work of the great universal makeup artists

1145
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,660
Names are said clips are shown. I

1146
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:43,260
Have not seen

1147
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:51,020
What clip exactly but I'm very curious. I went back and was looking for it and didn't see it in the list of movies

1148
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:57,460
Featured in the show. It does list Mulholland Drive and I'm very curious

1149
01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:05,020
What oh the the the like homeless person behind the the dumpster that would be my guess that is

1150
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:08,420
One of the scariest moments in film. Yes, it

1151
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:17,020
Scared the hell out of me when I rented that DVD from blockbuster and I turn around if I rewatch that movie

1152
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:20,940
Yeah, I know I'm telling you this so that is that is actually my number one favorite movie of all time

1153
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:23,300
And I saw it in theaters when it was first out

1154
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:29,860
And I'm gonna be I'm gonna be a little Jason Cheridan right now and I'd be like so it was two weeks after 9-eleven and

1155
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:38,300
The national mood was we don't want to go it's hard to go back to the movies

1156
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:40,420
But you know, we need we were starting to get back

1157
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:45,340
We had Brittany Murphy don't say a word that movie was out there and then we were slowly getting the whore

1158
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:49,980
Yeah, I'll never tell you know exactly said that we got we were starting to get people back in the theater

1159
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:54,460
So this was like it was like my first movie after being like I'm freaked out. I don't want to go anywhere

1160
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:57,020
and I was a I was a I was a

1161
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:03,460
Freshman in film school. So I was like it was like like a month after I just like left Illinois and went to California

1162
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:06,500
And so I was just like out on my own and I was just like, oh, I'm nervous

1163
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:11,280
I'm this Midwest kid and I don't like I'm just I'm the world is frightening and I just went and I was like

1164
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,940
I'm gonna chill out with and I never heard of David Lynch before too

1165
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:18,060
So I was just like, I don't know this movie seems to be getting some good, you know reviews and it got a you know

1166
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:21,980
I got a good, you know had a good showing at Cannes and I'll go see this movie

1167
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:25,220
Maybe it's about a fun drive to the canyon like I'll see a Hollywood

1168
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:33,740
Rod racing through Mulholland Drive. You see a movie about you know, you know, just kind of crazy people who make the movies and

1169
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:38,540
I was not prepared. I was I was in the theater alone and I

1170
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:44,540
And then the guy steps out from behind the the dumpster. I had the same

1171
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,900
Heart attack the guy in the movie does yeah

1172
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:51,940
like I'm truly like I was like and I was just like and I was just like a lynch guy from from that point on like

1173
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:54,460
it was a it was it was my whole thing, but

1174
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:57,300
No, I would say my my thing about

1175
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:03,120
About makeup that I was like while I was researching for this was

1176
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:10,180
You know, this seemed to be coming at you know, during the big hate heyday of makeup effects

1177
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,580
Because it was you know, there was there was always kind of makeup effects

1178
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:17,420
But they were really like getting into this artistry level and they had I

1179
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:25,900
Think there was so the best makeup Oscar was I created in 1981 for Whirlpool London and then but that really started because of an outcry

1180
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:29,820
After Eraserhead didn't really get you know

1181
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:34,400
Because it was supposed to be there was this it was sort of like the Dark Knight how the Dark Knight led to there being

1182
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,400
Ten potential movies now for Best Picture

1183
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:38,940
This was Eraserhead was sort of that

1184
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:44,900
Of that time where there was such and like oh we need to like give this movie something and we need to like really

1185
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:46,980
acknowledge the makeup effects are kind of

1186
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,420
going where they need to go and

1187
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:55,580
And then from then on they they started the the best makeup Oscar which which ran pretty pretty like oh my god

1188
01:31:55,580 --> 01:32:00,100
You know is pretty run by like horror and big things like the Grinch one and that sort of things

1189
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,460
But then now last ten years, you know post

1190
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:09,820
Benicio Wolf, man, there's been like a tapering it has been a lot of like oh they recreated that that famous historical person

1191
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:11,820
they write, you know, you know

1192
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,300
that sort of thing so it's I I

1193
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:19,660
I really do hope my makeup effects kind of do come back and into into a big vogue that there's

1194
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:26,340
little freaks out there who are experimenting with like new ways to do things and you know, you know, you know new

1195
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:31,300
maybe not even horror but just like kind of just like new ways to kind of you know make a person look like you know

1196
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:39,540
Something but I I I really love makeup for the innovation that it continues to bring to film because I think that's something that's still

1197
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:46,340
We can't really quite digitally recreate yet. Yeah. Yeah right on. Well, yeah urging makeup artists out there

1198
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:50,460
Pursue your dreams and step one get a Hawaiian shirt. Yes

1199
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:56,620
No one will take you seriously in that business unless you do I guess with that I can say wait a Damien

1200
01:32:56,980 --> 01:33:00,700
The exorcist as you survived haunt cast the fright

1201
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:04,220
Happy to do it. Absolutely. Oh great. And

1202
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:12,140
Congratulations, and let's exit through the through the crypt shop. Is there anything you'd like to plug? Yes, I would so for you

1203
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:15,260
No, but talk a lot about horror. I have a you know, I'm on the last episode

1204
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:20,340
I talked about I have a my horror book your lonely nights are over which is a slasher which is scream meets clueless

1205
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:24,480
That is that is out that is still out in stores review go

1206
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:31,720
My newest book curse boys and broken hearts is a romance because I like to go back and forth between I started

1207
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:35,200
I my first book was a horror then I did a romance then horror romance. So

1208
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,360
I they all seem like they're from the same universe for me everybody is

1209
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:48,640
When I write them both they they seem to be like the characters all feel like this is life and death and just in the horror

1210
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,640
it really actually is and

1211
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,480
So in my romances

1212
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:57,920
Which a lot of folks have said are just as stressful if not more stressful than my thrillers my suspense ones

1213
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,880
Because we have we have you know, sort of characters behaving badly naughty

1214
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,320
but in this one curse boys and broken hearts it is set at a

1215
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,920
Vineyard it is it's at a winery

1216
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,160
where this young man believes that he is

1217
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:19,840
he has been cursed to always lose any boyfriend he gets after a few weeks and

1218
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:26,800
He goes back to his family's bed and breakfast vineyard to help them get the house back up on its feet

1219
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,760
it's old family house that's kind of in disrepair and

1220
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:35,720
When he is there he has to work with this local gardener who turns out to be

1221
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:42,120
An ex of his from long ago. And so they have this oh, we got to work together, but we hate each other

1222
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,220
Energy, so it's a very very back and forth back and forth

1223
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:49,580
Silver-tongued romance and I had a lot of fun writing it

1224
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:54,260
I just enjoy when characters can be sort of mean to each other in a very intimate way

1225
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:58,180
I think it's a very queer experience thing, but I think it's just fun to write

1226
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:01,660
It's a lot. It's very up my wheelhouse. So curse boys and broken hearts is

1227
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:06,380
Available now, but before I go I have one. I have a little surprise for

1228
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:11,340
So yes, so so I am so I am a Los Angelino, but I am you know

1229
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:15,060
I think we can still you know, I just recently moved to the Palm Springs area

1230
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:19,180
So and I have brought I have come bearing gifts for everyone here

1231
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:26,560
From because I have moved. I didn't realize this at the time. I have moved next door to

1232
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:29,620
Coutino

1233
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:37,180
Coutino, so I live next to the burgeoning site of a story living by Disney development

1234
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:39,180
I drive, you know, I drive past

1235
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:43,140
Where people will eventually live their Disney story?

1236
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:45,900
When I'm on my way to Planet Fitness

1237
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:52,580
Whoa, I guess that could be part of their story to your planet fitness written

1238
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:58,140
So I so I went in there specifically just because I knew I was coming on here and I was like well

1239
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:03,860
I can't just not talk about that. I just drove in from Coutino. You can't just leave it alone

1240
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:11,560
So I did walk in there and so there it's you know, it's it is real

1241
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,960
That I did I wanted to confirm that it was real

1242
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:19,680
There's a lot of holes in dirt. It's happening. I believe yes. It is like like we learned to d20 right now

1243
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,160
There's there's no blue sky. There's there is it is shovel ready

1244
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:28,380
And they have you know, depending on when this episode releases, I believe there will be

1245
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:33,840
You can take a tour of model homes right now. So I would I don't know

1246
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:39,640
I'm not telling you all what to do. It sounds like depending. It's they're not gonna be the haunted

1247
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:43,240
They're not gonna make you they're not gonna make it a haunt where you do tour haunted

1248
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:52,080
We don't know we don't know if they did a poltergeist s like clearing of headstones, but no bodies to build this land

1249
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:59,460
There's like a ghost story. Yeah, so I think hey if you read Adam's book read ghost story the novel

1250
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:06,080
My father was right. It is the scariest book ever written. Very scary. Yes exactly. So that that's the homework of this

1251
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:09,120
So Cotino I brought in so I've driven they have a

1252
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:14,960
community sales site, so I have a community site plan to share with everybody and it is

1253
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:24,680
Homes you could see the Cotino Bay Cotino Bay it is all around beautiful Cotino Bay and

1254
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:31,600
I feel like I would I could get into this if they had like a really retro like

1255
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:38,280
70s sort of like, you know, how like 1971 Disney World was very like and you know, it was very focused on like

1256
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,280
Usually paragliding. Yeah

1257
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,040
Yeah, you know, you know, you know, they're like, yeah, there's a theme park

1258
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:47,720
But really you're here to paraglide and have a mustard aspic dinner

1259
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:54,220
Like I feel like yes, so so there's around Cotino Bay

1260
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:59,200
Future development future town center, but I went to the sales studio

1261
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:03,880
There's two people there who could not have been nicer and I feel really bad because they did fit

1262
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:08,160
To them because I said I was I was scouting on behalf of my my boss

1263
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:12,720
So I could get a little more information. They would be a little friendlier to me for these two hours

1264
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:19,780
Well, I'm getting some I would like some physical info because they did not want to give me anything physical because they wanted really

1265
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:23,840
Wanted me to go on the website and I was like, well my my boss is a little more tactile and I didn't want to say

1266
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,280
I was going on a podcast to goof on them

1267
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:27,960
But because they couldn't have been nicer

1268
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:34,160
There's just two they were out there in the middle of the desert and like that like a true like they were like wait

1269
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:36,280
I was like a waiting for Godot thing because there's no one there

1270
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:39,640
I walked in and they were like they did that like thing. They were like, yes a

1271
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:46,160
Customers like they just lept to like their feet and I was like, oh, I'm yes. I'm here to you know

1272
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,160
I wore a thick mustache and everything but

1273
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,720
I've been looking for a place to story live. Do you think you know me?

1274
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:56,920
And I don't know if I'm feel like I'm living my best story

1275
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:02,920
My life can kind of come and go but so there is a community site plan and I have this for everybody here

1276
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,920
They have made

1277
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:08,800
Story living by Disney bookmarks. So this is very apt for me

1278
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:15,240
So because the sleeves say mark the next chapter in the story of your life

1279
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:18,840
So there is all of these different bookmarks different

1280
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:26,800
Some have little desert flowers cacti on there and then mark the most expensive chapter of your life

1281
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:31,520
Yeah, this should be said that I did not move into a similar boondoggle in the desert

1282
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:36,640
I moved into just a regular it was a it was a new home that might as well have been Cotino

1283
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:40,440
It's just an eighth of the price. It's the same neighborhood

1284
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:47,400
It's sure we're not your and it's got a community. It's it's we just don't call the pool Cotino Bay

1285
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:51,240
I guess we don't have a man-made lake, but you know in the desert

1286
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:55,060
I like calling just just a dress up where you live calling your pool of Bay

1287
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:04,160
Quick tip in the Bay. Yeah, so we've got these we've got a gecko here a lizard next chapter best chapter

1288
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:10,080
Got some others that your next chapter beckons and just an oh and this one is for

1289
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:15,840
Asteria, which is I think a new difference not Cotino. It's a different. Oh, there's a different. There's a it's a different area

1290
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:21,400
I think it's in a wooded area because this is an owl that just says discover. What's next hard to keep track of not?

1291
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:26,960
Asteria because Cotino is not a stereo hard to keep track. Yeah, these different places to live stories

1292
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,480
But now I will leave these all with you and so my god. Thank you too

1293
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:36,600
Did we say that this is the a bunch of houses that Disney is owns in the desert?

1294
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:41,800
I kind of said it's yes. They're out. Yeah, they're in like what it Palm Springs area, but like Rancho

1295
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,360
Rancho Mirage. Yeah, so it's like

1296
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:48,940
Everything in that area is five minutes away. I mean after after you leave

1297
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:54,320
LA you're so used to just like I mean it's closer than Burbank is to

1298
01:40:55,520 --> 01:41:00,760
Pasadena. Yeah, right. They're all in a big area. Oh and Cathedral City and exactly exactly

1299
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:05,600
There's a Disney's most exciting, you know, we can focus a little too much on the rides in the parks

1300
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:11,080
But the most exciting thing Disney is doing is are all these houses. They seem to exclusively be

1301
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:16,800
Advertising it in Los Angeles at upscale Caruso shopping center

1302
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,980
Universal in this game Universal should build some houses in the

1303
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:32,520
The first one to theme them actually because like I'm telling I it's the theming out there is

1304
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,200
nice desert place

1305
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:39,880
It's it's not really themed. Well, what if they built the psycho house out in desert?

1306
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:44,120
I would be I would you move it up and it was comfortable inside put my house on the market

1307
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,760
I would I would leave they have a 30 psycho houses in a row

1308
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:54,520
Well, one Street is psycho house one Street is Elliott's house from ET

1309
01:41:56,840 --> 01:42:01,360
Back to the future you get that. Yeah, that's the town square too with the clock tower

1310
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:08,520
You live your clock tower life, right? Yeah, they should I think pay tribute to the aforementioned in this episode

1311
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:09,800
an

1312
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,440
Actor who they reference a lot and a lot of their special effects discussion, you know

1313
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:18,740
But the backbone is built around this guy. Why not call their housing development Voslou?

1314
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:25,200
Waiting for there's a psycho house waiting for you at Voslou

1315
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:30,200
You could just yeah, welcome to Voslou that would work

1316
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,640
115 degrees

1317
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:38,360
That is something I will confirm that it is it is presently

1318
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,400
Voslou will be built in Death Valley or it's even hotter

1319
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:47,040
It'll be built it will take advantage of the record-breaking hottest site ever recorded on earth

1320
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:51,000
Yes, so that's you know, because Disney has Rancho Mirage covered

1321
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,600
So yeah, this was got to go to death Valley and they're the horror company. Yeah

1322
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:58,640
Yeah, Shrek's house will be built in Death Valley. Yes

1323
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:06,400
You do original psycho house then you could do Vince Vaughn psycho

1324
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:12,320
Alternate them very similar and Voslou Bay is Shrek's

1325
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:21,200
And you know what they call the people who do landscaping and fumigating the company is called the scorpion king

1326
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,520
Listen I'm too into this now

1327
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:30,720
Okay, now we're gonna get a Cabot Cove out there. We're gonna get an amity out there

1328
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:35,000
All the bad they rebuild the back lot where there's room in the desert, right?

1329
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,120
Oh my god, and they put a real shark in there

1330
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:46,240
Think of ways to get more real estate square footage for rides at Universal Hollywood what they do

1331
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:53,960
Destroy the back line, right? Yeah, move it to the desert. Yeah. Yeah, I live in old Mexico recreated

1332
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,960
I live next to the flash flood

1333
01:43:56,240 --> 01:44:00,400
Crucial that's how I shower. I just stand away for the flash flood every day

1334
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:04,320
There's all just gets to a place of recreating the Salton Sea

1335
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:10,320
A brand-new environmental disaster brought to you by Universal Pictures

1336
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:16,320
This was the one because I did to make sure I wasn't repeating anything. I listened to the story living episode from 2022

1337
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:24,320
I'm telling you. I'm like, that's what I really your pandemic brains. No, it was from 2022

1338
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,320
It was an hour

1339
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,320
So it was very I had it like listen I had an hour on the road

1340
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,240
I had an hour on the road

1341
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:38,100
So I listened to it and you did bring up that with the the word they like they just the desert said no

1342
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:40,760
You're saying one of us repeated a story in this podcast
