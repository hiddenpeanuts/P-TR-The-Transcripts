1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A gigantic oatmeal cream pie?

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
Are we inside Jason's dreams?

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,680
No, it's just today's topic on Podcast the Ride,

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,880
the second gate, I'm Scott Gertner,

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,720
joined by the aforementioned Jason Sheridan, hi.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,200
Hi, yes, I have to say, I believe I was more

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,800
of a fudge round kid, which was the chocolatey equivalent.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,120
Fudge round, did you say?

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,640
Yeah, fudge rounds, here,

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,520
little Debbie's other product, fudge rounds.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,880
Wow. You had that on your,

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,560
yeah, why was that? You had a photo of that

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,880
in your notes ready to go?

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,600
Well, he pulled it up on the computer

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,800
as if he just like willed it onto his screen.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,060
It didn't even, like he didn't type,

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,720
he just turned his computer around.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,600
As you were finishing the joke,

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,480
I Googled fudge rounds and was able to get,

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,320
results and pictures very quickly.

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,640
Wow, fudge round, I never had a fudge round.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,520
Mike Carlson has never had a fudge round.

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
You just gotta go to a fudge round?

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,760
I never heard of a fudge round.

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,640
Neither have I.

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,600
Fudge round, it's just a chocolatey version

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,640
of an oatmeal cream pie.

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,360
It's like a chocolate cookie, chocolate cream,

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,840
and a little chocolate icing on top.

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,800
Okay, I mean, it sounds fine, it sounds delicious,

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm just wondering.

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,280
I've never, because we've talked about,

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,960
in our private life, we've talked about,

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,640
what, moon pies, is that what I bought you at the Rite Aid?

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,440
Yes, you found, yeah, moon pies.

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,360
Because I was not a kid who grew up with moon pies,

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,520
but we've never talked about, what are they, fudge rounds?

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,960
Yeah, that's part of the Fine Little Debbie products.

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,760
Wow, maybe they didn't have fudge rounds in the Midwest.

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,760
My household, we always had Little Debbie stuff.

42
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,800
My schools, elementary school through high school,

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,080
single serve Little Debbie is like a currency back east

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,920
in the mid Atlantic region.

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,040
Like if you were in prison, you could trade it for cigarettes?

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,560
Kind of, yeah, I mean, some kids would just take

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,800
their lunch money and just go buy

48
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,120
a stack of Little Debbie's for lunch.

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,680
That's just- Some kids.

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,640
It wasn't me, no, no, I knew, I knew my limits back then.

51
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,040
We were a Little Debbie household,

52
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,400
as I've said this on the show before,

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,320
but we did not have fudge rounds.

54
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,760
There's more variety in certain parts of the country.

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,920
You can get the hits out here.

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
Interesting.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,200
A lot of food differences in general in your region,

58
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,680
seemingly.

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes, yeah, I would say so.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560
I mean, Pennsylvania Dutch area,

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,800
there's a lot of potato chip and pretzel factories out there.

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,800
So like, Hers, Utz, Wise are all like big Pennsylvania.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,240
And you can only find them out here

64
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,640
at like cheese steak places.

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,040
Yeah, what were the three you just said?

66
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,480
Hers, Hers is the big one, Becky's.

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,880
Utz, Utz is- UTZ?

68
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,360
UTZ, yeah, Utz is, if you've seen Mad Men,

69
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,600
the second season of Mad Men starts with an Utz story arc

70
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,680
as a client.

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,280
And then Wise has the little owl.

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,160
Do you- Does Wise have a, does the owl have a name?

73
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't know.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,360
I mean, I'm sure they all have names.

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,600
Utz has like a little- A little baker.

76
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,840
Girl. Yeah.

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,560
With rosy cheeks.

78
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,120
Utz girl's very adorable.

79
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,120
The ability that you have to just spit out

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,720
all of this information off, I always find that,

81
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,600
it's always right there, ready to go.

82
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,840
There is no reach back into the past.

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,560
It is at the forefront of the brain at all times.

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,360
It's never like, what was that?

85
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,280
It's always, I know three things, I know them well.

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,440
I mean, yeah, as our mutual friend, Andrew Grissom once said,

87
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,640
if desserts did not exist, would you have any memories?

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,480
To me.

89
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,760
And he got my ass, he got my ticket.

90
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,600
What a line.

91
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,840
You know what, he got us all really good

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,240
because we were talking, we haven't mentioned this

93
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,400
on the show yet.

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,600
Uncle Martin has sadly passed away from Clifford,

95
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Charles Groton.

96
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,480
That's maybe a while ago by now, but yes.

98
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,760
It's a while ago by now,

99
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,920
but we're finally mentioning it on the show.

100
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,880
And we were talking to him and we were saying,

101
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
yeah, like there's this weird thing,

102
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,680
we feel like we talk about somebody,

103
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,320
because what, Ziegfried or which one passed away?

104
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,160
Immediately Roy, but Ziegfried was not far after.

105
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,520
And we're like, when we talk about somebody,

106
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
it's like scary.

107
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,280
And he goes, well, all of the people you like are over 80.

108
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,080
And we were like, oh, that's a good point.

109
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,600
I guess we're not really cursing anyone.

110
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,640
They just happen to be on the older side.

111
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,280
Usually not hit by a bus situation, no.

112
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,640
Right, so he put, he got our ass there too.

113
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,080
Geez.

114
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,840
But this, gotta have him on, I guess, at some point,

115
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,480
so people can put a voice to the mentioned a lot name.

116
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,520
Maybe he can get us live.

117
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,680
For now, today we're talking about the Honey,

118
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,120
I Shrunk the Kids movie set adventure,

119
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,520
which was a kid's playground based on the first

120
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,560
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids movie.

121
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,600
This was a Disney MGM studios in Florida,

122
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,360
opened in 1990, a little bit after the park.

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,360
And it was like the film, an adventure in a backyard

124
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,640
with giant stocks of grass, items that are usually

125
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,680
very small made to be very big,

126
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,800
very much like you were in the thick of it

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
in the first movie.

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,520
Right, yes.

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,720
And it was, of course, yes.

130
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,280
The first, we've talked a little bit about this

131
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,160
because we've done the 3D film,

132
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,960
the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids 3D film.

133
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,440
We've touched upon this.

134
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,560
I mean, feet a while ago, yes.

135
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,320
And talked about, some of us were afraid

136
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,680
of the first movie and some of that.

137
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,520
I don't remember some of this though.

138
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,560
I don't remember where people landed.

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,840
I was really terrified.

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,800
I've never seen the first one.

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,400
I would watch it now, but I've never seen

142
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,920
the first one because that bee,

143
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,720
I would see the bee in the trailer or the commercial

144
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,000
and I was so scared of giant insects.

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,280
Sure.

146
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,080
So I did do this.

147
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,880
I did do this play area and did like it.

148
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,600
Despite the presence of giant insects.

149
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
Giant ants, giant bees.

150
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,240
Don't remind me, you know.

151
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,280
You're reminding me about it.

152
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,440
But yes, I remember doing it and being a little bit like,

153
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,600
am I gonna get attacked?

154
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,400
Am I gonna get attacked by a giant insect?

155
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,120
But I obviously thought the whole thing was pretty cool.

156
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,480
There was many slides, et cetera.

157
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,720
Yeah, kind of a much needed addition to this park

158
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,080
because looking back on it and even looking at the park now,

159
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,040
when it opened, there was not a lot of activities for kids,

160
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,120
especially really young kids

161
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,960
to get their boundless energy out.

162
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,080
There was a lot where they can sit quietly

163
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,400
and appreciate the Hollywood that never was

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,320
and will always be.

165
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,320
And that is a little hard to explain that saying to children.

166
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,800
But not to you as a child.

167
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,040
Oh no, as a weird little kid.

168
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,880
Yo, I loved it.

169
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,160
You got your energy out reading like plaques.

170
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,000
You were like, yeah.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,840
Oh yeah.

172
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,680
Look at this plaque.

173
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,400
Burt Langkester's hat.

174
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,520
Wow, the truck blew up and now the water tank blew up.

175
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,480
Footlight parade.

176
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,800
Footlight parade.

177
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,400
I'm getting all my energy out looking at footlight parade.

178
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,000
But most three-year-olds, you can't describe how,

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,880
though there was a time when most films

180
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,320
were about synchronized swimmers

181
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,720
rising up on tiered platforms out of the water.

182
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,560
Yeah.

183
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,800
Didn't quite do it.

184
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,200
Aquatic birthday cakes.

185
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,320
And sometimes one would have a sparkler

186
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,200
and they were all certainly bathing beauties.

187
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Three-year-olds already attacking you,

188
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,760
bashing your leg in.

189
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,240
Yeah.

190
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,680
But yeah, back then, yeah,

191
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,120
there wasn't a lot for little kids.

192
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,440
And even now, I looked at the park map now and I'm like,

193
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,280
oh, wait a minute.

194
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,320
They built lands based on Star Wars and Toy Story

195
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,000
and did not put a playground in.

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,560
Like that seems like a miss.

197
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,400
That's true.

198
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,160
Because every other park, Epcot, Magic Kingdom,

199
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,960
Animal Kingdom, all has some sort of,

200
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,640
at least a tiny play area.

201
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,520
And of course, a lot of the hotels

202
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,000
have some sort of play area.

203
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,240
Yeah, yeah.

204
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
This is one of those areas

205
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,880
where my perspective changed a lot having a kid

206
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,120
because I was all about anything extraneous,

207
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,200
dumb little cute thing, get it out of here.

208
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,680
I want E-tickets.

209
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,680
I want visceral thrills and immersive theming.

210
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,440
And now my son is a little over one

211
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,480
and all he does is run around

212
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,600
and pull all the items off all of our shelves

213
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,600
and jump and flip and roll and just be alive.

214
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,160
And I now what is just echoing,

215
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,360
I mean, I've said it about other attractions already,

216
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,480
but like, oh my God, this is like,

217
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
all I wanna do now is take him to some of these

218
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,000
like dumb foam playgrounds.

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,640
But that's all I would do if I took him to a theme park.

220
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,680
And now I'm not even sure where they are.

221
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,880
What's like this at Disneyland now?

222
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,840
The challenge, the Grizzly Challenge Trail.

223
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,600
You're right, not currently open.

224
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
Right, not open.

225
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,040
So that's a strike against taking him at the moment.

226
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,200
Elements of Toontown, I think there's still some.

227
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,040
A little bit.

228
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,880
A little bit.

229
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
But I feel like the whole point of Toontown

230
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,360
when we were kids is like, jump around, hurt yourselves.

231
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Yeah. Bash.

232
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,160
Oh, Pirates Lair on Tom Sawyer Island.

233
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,560
He might be. Also currently.

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,640
This'll be, yeah, maybe I have a reason

236
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
to go back to Tom Sawyer Island, which it's been like,

237
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,160
how long has it been since you guys were at Tom Sawyer?

238
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,960
We were there together.

239
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,360
We were on the barrel bridge at some point

240
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,280
in the last five years. Is that true?

241
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,680
Yeah. I don't have a memory of that.

242
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,520
I swear we were.

243
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
You sure there wasn't another tall friend you were with?

244
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,120
I, no, I'm pretty sure we were there.

245
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm pretty sure we were like, oh, let's do it.

246
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,280
There's no line for the raft.

247
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,280
I want to say I've never been to Tom Sawyer Island.

248
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
You think so?

249
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,800
I don't think I've ever been there.

250
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,720
That can't be true. Not as a child?

251
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,760
Well, you're talking about Disneyland or did you not,

252
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,840
you'd never, you must've done it in Florida.

253
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,400
When I was a kid, I think so.

254
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,360
But maybe you have not been.

255
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,840
I mean, I say that as if it's strange.

256
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,360
That's probably correct to not go.

257
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,880
I don't think I've ever been.

258
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,960
That's why I'm so surprised.

259
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,880
Oh. I could be wrong.

260
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,080
I swear we were on the like bar,

261
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,840
the Rocky barrel bridge at some point.

262
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,680
Are you thinking of when we were on the challenge trail

263
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,080
together and that young boy jumped into that tube and said,

264
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,600
looked at us, shrugged his shoulders and went, YOLO

265
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,160
and jumped into the tube.

266
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,120
Well, no, I'll never forget that moment.

267
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,240
And then you and I looked at each other,

268
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,320
shrugged our shoulders and said YOLO then did it.

269
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,160
And then did it.

270
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,400
But then after we got out of the slide, we're like, ah,

271
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,880
oh my side.

272
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,720
Oh God.

273
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,440
I'm very aware that you only live once.

274
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,280
Yes.

275
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,960
Gotta be more careful.

276
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,800
Never been more aware.

277
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,760
Yeah. Okay.

278
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,160
Well, I mean, I swear we were there.

279
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,560
We were, I mean, we've climbed.

280
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm a big challenge trail fan

281
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,480
because I like climbing up on that net.

282
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,640
I like going across the rickety bridge.

283
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,920
It's not really rickety, but you know,

284
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,680
it moves up at the top on the third story.

285
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,360
So we've definitely been up there

286
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
a handful of times together.

287
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,040
But possibly never Disneyland.

288
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,880
So this is a thing at Disneyland you've never done.

289
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,720
That's kind of crazy.

290
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,960
It is crazy.

291
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,280
Can I say I gotta do it?

292
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,360
Yeah, guess so.

293
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
Well, so this is like,

294
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,440
but this is when they were doing a lot of stuff like this.

295
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,400
As was universal.

296
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,200
This playground very similar to Fievel's Playland.

297
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,680
There is a size component, a giant things component.

298
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,680
And I feel like the same world of foam question mark,

299
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,600
rubber question mark, smelly question mark, answer yes.

300
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,280
They smelled weird.

301
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,000
All of these things smelled very strange,

302
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,640
especially when it gets wet.

303
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,800
Wet foam is a strong memory of being seven

304
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,960
and at one of these places.

305
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,800
I don't know.

306
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,680
I've heard, like, I've heard tell of like certain,

307
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,080
like schools, some schools don't have recess anymore.

308
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,320
They don't like, I think there's a lot of,

309
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,880
this is not gonna sound like an episode of Gutfeld

310
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,360
or something and I'm not trying to do that.

311
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,120
I've heard though that like, there's like a lot less gym.

312
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,280
There's a lot less outside.

313
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,680
I think partly to do with like,

314
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,040
they don't want kids getting hurt.

315
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,720
They don't want any liability for things like that.

316
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
So I think like there's foam.

317
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,520
Like I remember when we went to our first foam floored,

318
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,760
like, like playground.

319
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,840
Play center.

320
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,120
Like as usually when I, when I grew up,

321
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,880
it was like sand or wood chips

322
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,640
that was like scattered around on the ground.

323
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,080
And then I do remember when it was like,

324
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,800
oh, we went to this, I think it was like a kind of,

325
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,640
like there was a water element to it,

326
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,080
but it was just all foam and it, yes, it smelled weird.

327
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,000
And I feel like they had like tried over the years now

328
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,160
to make things a little softer maybe.

329
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,760
So if a kid, you know.

330
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,640
Well, my memory was, it was,

331
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,800
if you went to an old playground,

332
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,360
it was still mostly scrap metal.

333
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,680
It was refashioned like junk metal,

334
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,360
like cheapy slides and stuff.

335
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,840
And then you started to see like stained wood,

336
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,600
like nice wood castle kind of things.

337
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
But then everyone immediately just getting the shit,

338
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,600
just getting knocked out of them

339
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
from like all this hard wood.

340
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,680
And then at a certain point,

341
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
they tried these weird foam things.

342
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,640
And then eventually they're like grind up tires

343
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,280
and just use it as if it was wood chips.

344
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,720
And that, that was a thing.

345
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,200
Like they went farther and then went back

346
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,080
in their technological progress.

347
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,600
Real quick, playground wise,

348
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
playground, did you guys play a lot

349
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,200
on playgrounds as children?

350
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,120
Yeah.

351
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,560
And McDonald land's definitely flashing to me

352
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,120
because that would have been with the optimal,

353
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,360
but it requires, you know, purchases.

354
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,520
And it's smaller than, more contained than a real park.

355
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,920
But you know, this theming, this theming going on,

356
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,400
regular slides, even if they're twice as big,

357
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,920
there's no weird face on it.

358
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,040
I'm less interested.

359
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,880
Yeah.

360
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,760
But like you had playgrounds at your elementary schools.

361
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,640
Yes. Yeah.

362
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,360
And I even remember them getting upgraded at a one point.

363
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,840
Like they got something nicer,

364
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,360
which was slightly nicer scrap metal.

365
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,240
Right.

366
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,080
Can I ask this one?

367
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,160
I'm having, I'm flashing back now to some memories.

368
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,640
I used to, after a few years,

369
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
the dog is doing a distracting scratch.

370
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,120
Really nuts.

371
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,920
And he started, the dog does a thing real quick.

372
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,800
He does a thing where he scratches one of his back paws

373
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
and it like trips something.

374
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,000
And he starts like sticking his tongue out in the air

375
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,640
in a very funny manner.

376
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,120
Anyway, so after a couple of years of playing

377
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,760
on the same playground in my elementary school,

378
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,480
we used to try to figure out ways to play on the playground

379
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,560
that you weren't supposed to play.

380
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,040
For older kids?

381
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,480
Was there that division or fourth?

382
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,920
I don't know that it was really a division,

383
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,680
but like instead of, you know, there'd be the two,

384
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,080
the straight tube, you go from one side to the other

385
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
on the playground.

386
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,280
Then you'd start to jump and walk on top of the tube,

387
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,640
which you're not supposed to do.

388
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,200
Like you can do like stuff like that.

389
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,840
Do you remember kids doing things like that?

390
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,760
Yeah, I mean, we had like a tiny playground

391
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,520
for the kindergartners, a first and second grade playground.

392
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,080
And then like the third graders were just unleashed

393
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,800
on like a baseball field.

394
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,880
And there was a little bit of playground equipment

395
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,400
and maybe a basketball hoop.

396
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,200
Yeah, we had like two separate,

397
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,280
we had a tall one by the swings

398
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,440
and then we had a smaller one.

399
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,440
But there was no like only first and second here.

400
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,640
It was just like, you're all out

401
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,160
and you can do whatever you want

402
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,120
unless it was like we were playing some sort of,

403
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,280
like by fifth or sixth grade,

404
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,760
maybe we were playing touch football or something.

405
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,120
We weren't playing on the equipment anymore.

406
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,560
But I remember like going like how,

407
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,120
like which part of this can we jump off of

408
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,480
in a way that we're not supposed to?

409
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,200
And I remember jumping off of like a high part of the,

410
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,000
like there was like a big slide.

411
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,520
And I remember like a kid and I like daring each other

412
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,080
to jump off of it.

413
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,200
And we did and it hurt.

414
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,120
It was not a good thing to do.

415
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,000
But it's funny like that remembering back,

416
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,960
like that's dangerous.

417
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,800
Like a teacher should have been like,

418
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,840
oh wait, wait a minute.

419
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,160
But like no one ever stopped us.

420
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,520
No one ever was like, you're using the equipment wrong.

421
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,360
Now that you are an adult, you're like flashing,

422
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,320
well if I had that job, would I really be that careful?

423
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,640
You would have been that invested.

424
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,160
I guess that, I guess you should be,

425
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,120
if you're getting hired for that particular job,

426
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,160
watching the children.

427
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,800
Yeah, if I can bring it back to the,

428
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,360
Honey I Shrunk the Kids movie set adventure,

429
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,000
watching footage of this attraction, this play area,

430
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,360
it seemed like there was a cast member whose job

431
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,520
was just to stand at the bottom of the slide

432
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,760
and go like, okay, yeah, all right, come on.

433
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,680
Get on.

434
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,400
Like it seems like a shitty job

435
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,520
because it seems like it was very humid back there.

436
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,360
It was shaded.

437
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,120
It was shaded, there were fans everywhere,

438
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,760
but it definitely seemed muggy back there.

439
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,760
I was flashing to this exact tone

440
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,480
when I got to go to the Grand Californian

441
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,320
and hang out by the pool and I was watching the water slide

442
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,680
and spotted one of those like bored teen

443
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,840
who you know is, it just flashed me back

444
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,840
to like Typhoon Lagoon and hearing go, go, go, go.

445
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,080
The most dead inside.

446
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,600
One of the most miserable positions you can have clearly.

447
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,920
Like very sort of like security guard

448
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,800
that's something that doesn't need a security guard.

449
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,520
Where like, so I'm not saying they're all unimportant,

450
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,480
but if it's like, all right, we just had to put somebody here

451
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,720
and we were too worried.

452
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,240
Yeah, well, cause like the guy at the bottom of the slide

453
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,200
has to be there so another kid doesn't.

454
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,040
Nail him.

455
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,360
Yeah, nail him on the way down

456
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,280
and the same with a water slide and the same with, yeah.

457
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,560
But it's such a thankless.

458
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,080
If a robot could say go, go, go,

459
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,680
then it would be a robotic position immediately.

460
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,840
But it does require a human, albeit a very bored human.

461
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,520
Yeah, other than that, it didn't seem like

462
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,520
there were a ton of cast members like manning this area.

463
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,720
I don't recall that.

464
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,520
It really did just feel like,

465
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,120
certainly not chaos, that'd be too extreme a word,

466
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,360
but just, I don't know, just like lively and active

467
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,000
and full of kids and you felt like you were

468
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,320
getting lost in it.

469
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,560
That's my memory.

470
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,320
It would be like extremely immersive.

471
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,200
Didn't cover that big of a space, but enough.

472
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,880
And I never felt like I knew my way around.

473
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,640
Just like, oh, that's there, that's there, that's there.

474
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,840
It did have the feel of you're in the movie,

475
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,840
very like miniature jungle where, I don't know,

476
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,840
I'm lost in greenery.

477
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,560
I don't know what's around what corner.

478
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,320
Yeah, I mean, it definitely worked on me

479
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,000
cause my memories of it as a kid were like,

480
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,520
this thing is massive.

481
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,040
And watching back, I'm like, oh, it's actually

482
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,760
pretty compact, but the perspective is pretty solid

483
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,880
on a lot of this stuff.

484
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,920
The weirdest thing looking back on this

485
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,800
was the closing date was April 2016.

486
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,840
And I went, it was open for how, what it outlived

487
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,040
the attraction with a giant film canister

488
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,440
outlived film canisters.

489
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,280
Right, right.

490
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,800
It also outlived the Kodak sponsorship,

491
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,120
which ended in like 2012, 2013,

492
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,640
when they declared bankruptcy.

493
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,400
And in one walk around video I saw they had painted over

494
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,440
the logo for the Kodakolor on the canister.

495
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,280
Did it just say nothing or did they invent something?

496
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,560
It was just a big black can with a hole in it.

497
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,880
Like.

498
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
Which now it's like being that,

499
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,200
and being that film's not around anymore,

500
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,040
there's just no way to tell.

501
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,440
Yes, unless you are one of five directors,

502
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,080
film does not exist for the most part.

503
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,160
Yes, yeah, yeah.

504
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,000
Or.

505
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,360
A person grandfathered into using it.

506
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,160
Or like hundreds, hundreds and hundreds of hardworking

507
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,000
film preservationists who we do respect greatly.

508
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,720
But for the general audience,

509
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
like yeah, film is kind of a pain in the ass.

510
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,680
You can go buy some at a specialty store and mail it away

511
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,640
and it'll get back to you, but it's an investment.

512
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,040
Yeah.

513
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,200
That said, at that time,

514
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,600
that was the absolute highlight for me.

515
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,440
Oh yeah.

516
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,240
I loved being there.

517
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,720
I have photos on there that I cherish.

518
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,040
It wasn't even just like,

519
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,640
it's a cool item to,

520
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,520
it's not an obvious small thing to make big.

521
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,000
It's a little off the beaten path.

522
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,920
And it never occurred to me that it was a product placement.

523
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,720
I don't think I realized that Kodak was the sponsor of this

524
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,160
and that's why there's a film thing.

525
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,800
It so completely worked, felt totally organic.

526
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,120
And also just like,

527
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,120
I think it was specifically a good slide.

528
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,960
You know?

529
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,440
It wasn't like it was hidden well.

530
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,240
Like it didn't just, it wasn't just a tube.

531
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,920
Like the impression in it that guided you to the bottom

532
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,880
was sort of subtle in the way it kind of drifted off

533
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,520
to the left at a big angle.

534
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,360
I don't know.

535
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,000
It was just like a very unique slide.

536
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,760
I would love to go on that thing now.

537
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,600
If there was a way,

538
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,080
if we could get our hands on that

539
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,000
or it could come back just for a night.

540
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,360
Was that at any of those Disney auctions?

541
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,920
Like the full Kodak slide?

542
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,000
Good buy.

543
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,840
Think so.

544
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,480
The shipping on that probably.

545
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
Yeah, that's true.

546
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,280
I believe I have a photo on the Kodak slide as well.

547
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,240
I gotta look for it, but I'm pretty sure, yeah.

548
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,160
Cause that's like very fun.

549
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,480
And I'm trying to remember,

550
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,600
was there a good shot of like how you got to it?

551
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,440
Maybe I missed it

552
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,120
when I was looking through photos again.

553
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,920
There's footage, like you go up above it.

554
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,000
There's like pathways and stuff.

555
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,480
Got you in the staircase, I think.

556
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,720
Cause like it's like, I remember.

557
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,680
It's a really nice job of like hiding that even from

558
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,480
like you looking head on to it.

559
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,440
Where like you wouldn't necessarily know how to get.

560
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,880
Like it's all the part, like in a good ride or something,

561
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,600
the parts of it are hidden.

562
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,200
All like all elements of it are hidden

563
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,920
to make it look like a regular slide.

564
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,760
Sure, sure.

565
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,600
Yeah.

566
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,160
Since you mentioned product placement,

567
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,840
should we go through and say all of them?

568
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,680
Yeah, yeah.

569
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,960
Kodak, Lego, I think less obvious,

570
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,600
but there was a big Lego brick.

571
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,440
Oh, that's right.

572
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,280
Yeah.

573
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,160
And I like seeing the underside of a Lego piece.

574
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,600
I remember that being like a really unique texture to explore.

575
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,360
So I'm going to give it to Lego.

576
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,240
I'm assuming that way.

577
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,680
I mean, Disney has a long relationship with Lego

578
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,640
down there in Florida.

579
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,040
Play-Doh.

580
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,880
Oh, right.

581
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,840
Super Soaker.

582
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,680
Yeah.

583
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,640
Yeah.

584
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
Unclear about oatmeal cream pie.

585
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,640
Like it's clearly a wrapped oatmeal cream pie,

586
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,800
but I don't know if you,

587
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,440
if you wiggled your way on top of it,

588
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,080
would you see a little Debbie wrapper?

589
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,560
I don't think that was explicitly little Debbie cream pie,

590
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,400
but.

591
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,000
If you knew, you knew.

592
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,840
Kind of, yeah.

593
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,680
You knew, you knew.

594
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,800
And yeah.

595
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,960
If you saw it in person right now, you would know, I bet.

596
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,800
Well, I saw a grainy picture first

597
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,200
when I was starting to look up this ride

598
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,720
and I thought it was a big Oreo

599
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,560
and I had to go back and watch it.

600
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,400
That's what I thought it was too,

601
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,240
when I saw it in video.

602
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,040
Yeah, because the sun definitely like,

603
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,560
but like the cracking,

604
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,080
the cracking, Oreo's typically not cracked like that.

605
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,520
Oh, the floppiness, the sort of meltiness of it.

606
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,400
Yeah, I see what you're saying,

607
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,320
but sometimes depending on like,

608
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,200
Oreos can be cracked if somebody like

609
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,480
sat on the package or something.

610
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,320
That's true.

611
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,160
Or if they got,

612
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,520
they were in the grocery bag and they got jumbled.

613
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,360
They got hurt.

614
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,040
Yeah, it was partially eaten by a bunch of ants.

615
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,440
Yeah, so who knows?

616
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,560
So product, a lot of product placement

617
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,560
that never occurred to me.

618
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,240
This just seemed like a fun, cool thing.

619
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,440
It was invisible to me and I guess it worked

620
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,040
and it warmed its way into my brain without me knowing.

621
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,960
Product placement in general, I was just unaware of.

622
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
I was just like, of course, this is the real world.

623
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,360
They have products just like I do.

624
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
I know those products, like la la la.

625
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,240
Like there's no awareness, savviness to that.

626
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,880
I feel like it was a little subtler in the past.

627
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,760
I mean, it's not super front and center.

628
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,080
Like it kind of makes sense why it's in this ride,

629
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,480
but we did rewatch Happy Gilmore last night.

630
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,040
There's a lot of talk about Subway in that movie.

631
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,880
Sure, yeah.

632
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,720
A lot of Subway in that movie.

633
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,560
He just makes an ad for Subway.

634
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,920
He makes an ad for Subway

635
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,520
and then he's wearing a Subway t-shirt

636
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,520
and people are eating Subway throughout.

637
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,360
Which serves its purpose in the mood.

638
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,400
Like, oh, he's getting endorsements.

639
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,200
He's a big, but yeah, you would know.

640
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,160
They didn't make up a funny product

641
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,320
to have him endorse.

642
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,760
They chose a real thing.

643
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,600
There's that shot in Ghostbusters of like,

644
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,800
wasn't it like a Coke can and when he opens the fridge

645
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,000
and it's just like perfectly placed.

646
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,840
You guys know what I'm talking about?

647
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,680
Oh yeah.

648
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,520
Yeah, yeah.

649
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,000
Which like years later I watched it and I was like,

650
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,560
that's a product placement.

651
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
That's, I know what that is.

652
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm smart now.

653
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,840
The product placement in this one that even as a kid,

654
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,720
I was, I loved my Super Soaker as a kid.

655
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,360
You're telling me about Super Soaker.

656
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,240
I was obsessed.

657
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,160
The commercials, I mean, I had the classic one

658
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,760
and then I had an upgraded one a few years later

659
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,040
and then I never had a massive like one with backpacks

660
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,320
or anything like that.

661
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,600
I certainly was intrigued by them.

662
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,400
But in this ride, it's like angled upwards

663
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,440
and it just kind of like spits out water.

664
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,280
Like so.

665
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,960
It's not super soaking.

666
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
It's like spurting.

667
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,080
It's spurting.

668
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,440
It's like the faucet is dying.

669
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,960
Yeah, it's like a little left.

670
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,560
Aggressive spray that we know Super Soaker was capable.

671
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,400
Yeah.

672
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,720
If you really want to get wet at MGM,

673
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,480
you would go around the corner and stomp on the stomp pad

674
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,080
by the singing in the rain umbrella

675
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,600
and then just get soaked by the singing in the rain umbrella.

676
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,880
You could do it on demand.

677
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,680
Oh, I forgot about that.

678
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,600
Is that what you learned to love being wet at a theme park?

679
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,560
Well, it's a process, Michael.

680
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,440
I mean, I learned it everywhere.

681
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,400
But you did that.

682
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,840
Cause I don't have a memory of doing that,

683
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,800
singing in the rain.

684
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Oh, well, we'll have to get that, get to that.

685
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,360
See if I find any dirt on that

686
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,720
with the singing in the rain umbrella.

687
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
How long was that there?

688
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,760
It was there for a while.

689
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,040
It was certainly there for a while

690
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,920
cause there's a singing in the rain animatronic

691
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,120
in the great movie ride.

692
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,960
I remember that.

693
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,760
So that's interesting.

694
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,080
Yeah.

695
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,920
All right.

696
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,720
So episode eight of the singing in the rain umbrella saga.

697
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,760
Today we're talking about the back right side of the umbrella.

698
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,440
Now this is the part that yes, everyone say together

699
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,000
is attached to the lamp post.

700
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,640
That's making the illusion possible.

701
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,880
Now, what I liked about this, it's going to be essential.

702
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,000
It's going to be a good series.

703
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,520
We were just talking about, I made this,

704
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,880
I had this memory of, well, yeah, why did it,

705
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,240
as a kid, I felt refreshed by theme park water.

706
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,720
And now I do not, I don't actively avoid it super hard,

707
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,680
but I would never like in a taking a nice shower way,

708
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,600
seek it out.

709
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,080
But thinking about this place took me right back to,

710
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,360
oh yeah, I would get sprayed in there

711
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,120
for as long as my parents would allow.

712
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,880
I think a more, you're right that the super soaker

713
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,360
left something to be desired.

714
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,360
I think the stronger area was the broken hose.

715
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,880
Like really sort of randomized spurts

716
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,600
would come out of a broken hose to where, you know,

717
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,680
you chase it around.

718
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,040
Is it going to come out here this time or here this time,

719
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,440
or you'd get surprised.

720
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,240
You try to trick your mom,

721
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,480
then she gets splashed and unhappy.

722
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,640
I don't know if I did successful.

723
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
She might've been ahead of the pattern, but.

724
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,480
She was tracking it, she knew.

725
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

726
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,520
Adults are smarter.

727
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,200
Yeah, I'm wondering, cause when I was a kid,

728
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,680
I did like, yeah, like getting soaked this way probably.

729
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,280
Is it easier to dry a little kid

730
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,640
cause there's less surface area

731
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,880
as far as the sun is concerned?

732
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,440
Well, it's probably feel like in Orlando,

733
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,240
it's easier to dry anything.

734
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,120
Yeah, that's true.

735
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,720
So maybe it was just not an issue

736
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,800
if you were in Orlando when you were little.

737
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,160
Sun would dry you in two seconds

738
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,000
cause there was no surface area.

739
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,080
Yeah, sure.

740
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,480
It's not much clothes to soak, you know.

741
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,880
Weird way to put it, surface area.

742
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,440
You mean a body, a smaller body.

743
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,920
A small person, less surface area.

744
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,240
It's technically correct.

745
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,600
Yes, very clinical.

746
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,280
It's a strange thing to say.

747
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,760
I guess it is.

748
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,280
But I stand up, I stand by it.

749
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,440
Not false, not false.

750
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,960
Less surface area, unlike the giant disembodied dog nose,

751
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,440
which has a lot of surface area.

752
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,080
You could also get lightly wet there

753
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
cause it would kind of mist sometimes.

754
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,280
Yeah, I didn't remember this part of it at all.

755
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,000
That the dog was poking its cork.

756
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,520
Cork is the dog, I think.

757
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,360
So corks poking in as he would at the end of the film,

758
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,840
eventually, honey, I shrunk the audience

759
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,560
and shooting out little sprays.

760
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,440
But yeah, why don't I remember that?

761
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,680
I remember, cause it rhythmically breathed,

762
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,760
it would like make a noise every like 30 seconds, seemingly.

763
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,920
Huh, huh.

764
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,280
And did the ant also make noise?

765
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,440
This was indicated somewhere I was looking.

766
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,920
That they kind of like, not, it kind of screamed a little,

767
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,760
didn't it?

768
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,280
Kind of like chittered a little, something?

769
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,960
Or like, yeah, how to describe it?

770
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,560
Like, was it like a rattle?

771
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,240
Like almost snake-ish?

772
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,640
I'd like, can we both say what we think it was like?

773
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,580
I think it was like,

774
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,040
I think it was more like a sound in a jungle,

775
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,240
like 하기ating

776
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,280
Oh, it was like that.

777
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,360
Okay, okay, yeah.

778
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,200
But I could be wrong.

779
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,040
I have no idea.

780
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,880
Maybe yours is right.

781
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,920
Weird scream seems like-

782
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,840
Jason, one more time.

783
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
Scott, one more time.

784
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,000
I don't remember.

785
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,360
Cause the ant is their friend and then protects them

786
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,000
and then it dies, right?

787
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,360
Does he die at the end?

788
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,200
I've never seen this movie

789
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,800
Don't they witness the ant?

790
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,040
They all, then they all eat it to survive.

791
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,520
They all dig into ant guts.

792
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,720
The ant dies at the end?

793
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,640
I thought the ant,

794
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,040
I thought they get real sad cause the ant dies.

795
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,120
Maybe you're right.

796
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,920
Maybe, it was that kind of movie

797
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,400
that had like unpleasant things like that.

798
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,240
Yeah, there's some-

799
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,360
That were very scary at the time.

800
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,160
I think what you honed in on was,

801
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,920
I did watch this movie a number of times.

802
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,560
I feel like if you were at a friend's house

803
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,120
or a cousin's house, this was not a movie we had,

804
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,880
but it was put on.

805
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,960
Like they'll watch this or it comes on TV all the time.

806
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,560
So just put that on.

807
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,680
And I feel like I liked this movie,

808
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,400
but I was unnerved by this movie.

809
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,880
Yeah, I have found you are correct.

810
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,960
The ants name was Anty.

811
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,480
I apologize for the spoiler.

812
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,360
And I found the first thing that comes up

813
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,280
is a website called Comic Vine.

814
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,080
And somebody has posted the question,

815
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,760
sadder death, Anty's death and honey I shrunk the kids

816
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,040
or Superman's death and Batman versus Superman,

817
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
dawn of justice.

818
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,960
Why equate these two?

819
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,720
These are not the same era or type of film.

820
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,440
I don't know, but I will say this.

821
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,160
It's all tied up at 50%.

822
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,440
I will say that.

823
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,240
Or the mother's death in mother.

824
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,880
Like why are you putting all these together?

825
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,480
I have no idea what the thought process was,

826
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,080
but this person wanted to pose it.

827
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,960
So what do you Jason, what do you think?

828
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,000
Sadder, even though you have.

829
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,840
No, I did.

830
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,880
I watched the, I have seen Batman

831
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,640
versus Superman, dawn of justice.

832
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,720
I think it's Anty.

833
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,760
I bet it's Anty.

834
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,600
And I haven't seen it.

835
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,440
Yeah, it's gotta be Anty.

836
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,280
I bet it's Anty because you know Superman's coming back.

837
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,120
Also.

838
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,920
Once doomsday shows up, if you were a kid in the night,

839
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
you're like, oh yeah, he's gonna kill Superman,

840
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,480
but Superman won't be back.

841
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,120
Superman pulls himself through the, on the spear.

842
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,960
You know what I mean?

843
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,000
Yes, yeah, yeah.

844
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,800
Impaled and they pull themselves through

845
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,520
to get closer to kill doomsday.

846
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,360
Yeah.

847
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,200
I think it's Anty.

848
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,040
Yeah, I set aside half a day

849
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,960
to watch the director's cut of dawn of justice.

850
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,080
Yeah, cause I told you to.

851
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,320
Yeah.

852
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,240
And then I tapped out on justice league.

853
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,080
Once the people started,

854
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,440
just a bunch of Norwegian women started singing

855
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,880
the Aquaman back to the sea.

856
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,600
And I was like, I'm gonna take a break.

857
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,880
I didn't make it.

858
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,480
I love justice league.

859
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,200
I tapped out after 30 minutes.

860
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,360
I was ready to, I was like, I would like to like this.

861
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,160
It seems interesting to like it,

862
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,960
but as I, you know, my new parent movie schedule,

863
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,280
as I got into like night six, I'm like,

864
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
how much longer am I gonna do this?

865
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,120
I've fallen asleep every time I have tried.

866
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,520
I mean, the first, there's a lot of nonsense

867
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,680
and I don't even mean that in a bad way.

868
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,440
There's a lot of nonsense the first two chapters,

869
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,560
two or three chapters.

870
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,520
I mean, you certainly won that in a comic book movie,

871
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,920
but I think I was trying to do it

872
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,360
after Batman versus Superman.

873
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,200
Oh yeah, that's not good.

874
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,320
And I, one of the things I liked about Batman

875
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,160
versus Superman was like,

876
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,400
ah, look at this majestic wide screen

877
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,080
with these big action sequences.

878
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,280
And then I switched over to the other.

879
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,960
I was like, mm, square.

880
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,360
Yes, very good.

881
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,200
Square.

882
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,280
Square, baby.

883
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,840
Well, I think you give it another chance.

884
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,800
I'll get, yeah, I just need another half a day free.

885
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,920
And a lot better.

886
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,920
It's better, believe it or not, than the Joss Whedon version.

887
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,520
No, all right, okay.

888
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,600
So I think the mention of that name,

889
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,240
it took the air out of the room, evidently.

890
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,280
I'm sorry about that.

891
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,200
I mean, because what I said was so insulting

892
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,440
to Joss Whedon's version of Justice League.

893
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,280
You guys were offended by that.

894
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,480
That's why I couldn't get through.

895
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,200
I was so married was I to the original.

896
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,120
Not that his brand of non-humor

897
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,920
just strangled American comedy for years.

898
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,720
Well, there's this weird thing

899
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,360
you were mentioning, Jason, about that we keep,

900
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,080
you might notice how stiff we've been saying,

901
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,440
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids movie set adventure,

902
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,840
because there's a weird thing with it.

903
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,440
Would you like to detail that?

904
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Okay, so the big themed sign for this ride

905
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,120
says Honey, I Shrunk the Kids movie set adventure

906
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,960
with a stamp font.

907
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,600
And on the map, that's what it's called.

908
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,800
But if you entered through a marquee

909
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,880
on the streets of America,

910
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,960
the sign reads Honey, I Shrunk the Kids play set adventure.

911
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,160
And they had plenty of room to write movie.

912
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,800
It'd be only one more.

913
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,160
Yeah, I'm looking at that line.

914
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,600
They got nothing but room.

915
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,960
Yeah. Absolutely.

916
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,920
The letter M is not that wide.

917
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,160
It's unclear why these signs say different things.

918
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,840
Yeah, not sure.

919
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,400
But I always like stuff like this.

920
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,920
I like when they're not paying too close of attention.

921
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,760
I liked the human feel of just genuine mistakes

922
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,800
in what is this thing called

923
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
in the era of hyper ride branding.

924
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,640
I love it.

925
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,960
Like, what is this again?

926
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,800
Yeah.

927
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,560
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids run around place.

928
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,600
And then either the options are either

929
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,560
no one ever noticed a difference

930
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,520
or a bunch of people noticed in the company went, eh.

931
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,480
We're gonna have to pay a guy to go up there

932
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
and change that.

933
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,080
Like, cause that wouldn't happen now.

934
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,480
That would be a big deal.

935
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,000
Josh DeMorrow would have somebody's head on a swivel

936
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,320
or swivel on a platter.

937
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,640
No, that means he's looking around a lot.

938
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,760
A head on a platter means he's murdered someone

939
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,800
because he's upset.

940
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,240
He'd put a head on a swivel platter

941
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,400
and spin it round and round and round.

942
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,480
What an insults to a dead body that would be.

943
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,320
Of course, yeah.

944
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,240
He would not go for something misbranded.

945
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,080
Yeah.

946
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,760
So, yeah, the old days, it's good when it was just like,

947
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,720
I don't know.

948
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Oh man, what did you write?

949
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,400
Oh no, that's not it.

950
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,160
Well, it's gotta be due to the however, whatever.

951
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah, Christmas is coming.

952
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,160
We need the space.

953
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,680
Just put it up.

954
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,800
Doesn't matter.

955
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,160
That's what I remember about this going in.

956
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,960
Not that I was at this park before this,

957
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,920
but they did sort of rush out the opening

958
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,640
of Disney MGM Studios because they were in a turf war

959
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,760
with Universal Studios.

960
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,680
And just like, if we get something open first

961
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,120
and the stuff works, then we're doing great.

962
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,920
And they did, they did open before Universal

963
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,520
and everything at Universal didn't work,

964
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,320
so they were just ahead of the game.

965
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,520
But very quickly, I think they'd conceived of it

966
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,440
as maybe more of a half day park.

967
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,000
And whenever they think that, they're always wrong.

968
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,120
That's like, nobody, audiences cannot calibrate

969
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,440
their expectations to get less of a theme park.

970
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,520
And they shouldn't, that doesn't make any sense.

971
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,680
So there was a lot of space in this park

972
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
that you would only see from the tram,

973
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,800
all this back lot area that you just pass by.

974
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,520
You'd pass by a fake back lot

975
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,400
where nothing's ever been filmed

976
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,280
because this was a swamp nine months ago.

977
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,040
So very quickly, it was like, well, we gotta do something.

978
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,760
Let's at least, hey, let's let people walk around

979
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,960
the back lot, we can do that.

980
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,920
But what are they gonna do when they're there?

981
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,160
I don't know.

982
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,960
Do we have any of those blades of grass around?

983
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,040
Can we pull an attraction together?

984
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
Which for being pulled together,

985
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,800
I might be wrong about the slapdash nature of this,

986
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,120
but if this was like a get something in there,

987
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,560
we need something for kids to do,

988
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,360
it is really well done for being sort of a

989
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,440
after the fact rush job.

990
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,840
Yeah, and fast, like fast after the movie came out.

991
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,680
Pretty quickly by Disney standards.

992
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,840
Right, right, yeah.

993
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,480
And I, you know, also in the getting lost area,

994
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,920
this might've been my first awareness of,

995
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,040
oh, so it's like map paintings, like it's physical.

996
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,840
Why does this seem like it goes on forever?

997
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,320
Well, it's lots of physical blades of grass,

998
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,280
but then there's a painting back there

999
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,920
that gives you the notion that it goes and goes

1000
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,640
into infinity, which is probably how they did the movie

1001
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,680
to some extent.

1002
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,080
Pretty clever, pretty cool.

1003
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,320
Yeah, it's, I was looking back through it

1004
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
and I was like, I did not, I mean,

1005
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,720
obviously we don't appreciate, you know,

1006
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,080
theming, you don't think of it as when you were a kid,

1007
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,320
but I was like, I bet I would appreciate this more now

1008
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,120
if I were to go into it, which apparently,

1009
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,680
according to the web, according to the internet,

1010
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,880
the 2016 I could have and didn't even realize

1011
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,760
it was still there.

1012
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,000
It was very surreal to think, like to find HD footage

1013
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,920
of this attraction that is so glued into the early 90s

1014
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,680
for me and to see HD footage and go like,

1015
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,640
the 2016 presidential election is going on

1016
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
as this is being recorded.

1017
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,480
Oh my God, Jesus.

1018
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,520
That's not long ago.

1019
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,640
Trump, Hillary is occurring.

1020
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,480
The primaries.

1021
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,280
People are on the honey, I shrunk the kids thing.

1022
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,600
Yeah, the primaries are wrapping up.

1023
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,080
That doesn't make sense in my timeline,

1024
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,400
but yeah, I could have done it.

1025
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,000
And I would have really been like, wow,

1026
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,640
look at this, this is pretty good.

1027
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,120
Like, this is really pretty cool for being very simple thing.

1028
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,600
And I think it looks better than some of the Bugs Land

1029
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,840
stuff, which is now of course gone.

1030
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,280
Oh, I think it for sure looks better.

1031
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,240
Yeah, which.

1032
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,080
Serves a similar need of like, oh yeah,

1033
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,560
children are coming to this park.

1034
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,200
They would like things to do.

1035
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,280
I don't know, I'm sure somebody mentioned this probably

1036
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,400
as an idea of a Bugs Land, but if they're moving Ant-Man

1037
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,520
and they could have just moved some of this stuff

1038
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,080
into Ant-Man's world, like you can do the same thing

1039
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,280
with Ant-Man.

1040
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,120
Probably.

1041
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,960
They did.

1042
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,560
They kept some big things.

1043
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,960
There are a lot of you are small attractions.

1044
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,880
There's a ton if you add them up.

1045
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,720
Like I didn't write a list, but just off the top of my head,

1046
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,640
there's this and the honey I shrunk movie.

1047
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,520
There's Files Playland Universal.

1048
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,840
There's Ant-Man.

1049
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,920
Wait, there is an Ant-Man attraction.

1050
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,320
Well, there's Hong Kong.

1051
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,280
And Bugs Land was there in the same area before.

1052
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,800
Right.

1053
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,720
Rat Tatooie are small.

1054
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,240
Right.

1055
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,640
Body Wars and Inner Space.

1056
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,840
Body Wars, we just did Adventures Through Inner Space.

1057
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,680
Adventure Through Inner Space, not plural.

1058
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,120
I'll start learning this, I swear.

1059
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,800
And those are, there's a big spectrum.

1060
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Like in Inner Space, you're microscopic.

1061
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,560
In others, you're an inch or a few inches

1062
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,400
or however big a rat is.

1063
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,560
Do you get shrunk on Minion Mayhem?

1064
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,600
Maybe.

1065
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,200
Maybe.

1066
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,760
Do you get his account is getting.

1067
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,200
No, you get turned into a minion.

1068
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,280
So you are a tiny.

1069
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,360
That is shrinking.

1070
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,760
It's not as far.

1071
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,400
Yeah.

1072
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,080
That's about it.

1073
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,640
That's like if you got shrunk into a South Park kid.

1074
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,440
Right.

1075
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,160
I mean, I guess you'd get turned into a pet

1076
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,480
and Secret Life of Pets too.

1077
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,360
So that's shrinking.

1078
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,520
It's kind of shrinking.

1079
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,160
Yeah.

1080
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,440
It's a really common thing.

1081
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,760
And you go back to, I never got to do this.

1082
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,720
This was too early for when I was going to Universal Studios

1083
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,360
Hollywood.

1084
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,360
But I think a big thing on the tram tour was

1085
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,920
you stopped somewhere, got out, and looked

1086
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,200
at a bunch of props, including like a huge phone.

1087
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,440
It's a giant phone way bigger than you.

1088
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,800
And it's a foam phone.

1089
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,280
So you can pick it up.

1090
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,200
Do bits with whoever you're talking to on the foam phone.

1091
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,680
You're kind of inadvertently.

1092
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,480
Scott, we both stayed at Pop Century

1093
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,920
the last time we were in Florida.

1094
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,400
Oh, yeah.

1095
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,920
You are kind of, there's giant versions

1096
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,080
of like cordless phone, internet computer, you know?

1097
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,720
Yo-yo and jukebox.

1098
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,440
Yeah, I guess Pop Century is a shrinking experience

1099
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,720
without you.

1100
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,280
Like as if you've been shrunk in a museum of pop culture

1101
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,800
history.

1102
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,480
Well, all the All-Star resorts really have large elements.

1103
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,120
Yeah, big helmets, big baseballs.

1104
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,440
Big Netscape navigator open on the computer.

1105
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,600
Big Roger Rabbit.

1106
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,400
Yeah.

1107
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,840
You ever, yeah, I don't think people maybe

1108
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,560
take that in when they stay at the cheaper hotels on Disney

1109
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
World property.

1110
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,240
This lets you experience what it's

1111
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,680
like to be tiny amidst big items.

1112
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,320
Maracas.

1113
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,520
You see, you're shrunk, but the savings

1114
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,200
are big, you know?

1115
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,640
So you've got to keep that in mind.

1116
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,160
Yeah, sure.

1117
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,600
The benefits of staying on site are very large.

1118
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,920
Is there a shrinking movie or TV,

1119
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,160
like they haven't done that's like an obvious one?

1120
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,480
Like you're more the incredible, I don't know,

1121
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,080
there's incredible shrinking something.

1122
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,200
What's that old movie?

1123
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,120
Incredible Shrinking Man?

1124
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,400
The Incredible Shrinking, I know what you're talking about.

1125
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,440
The Woman, I believe, with the late Charles Gruden.

1126
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,160
Watch that.

1127
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,360
They probably want to make a movie out of that.

1128
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,680
Oh, The Incredible Shrinking Woman, 1981.

1129
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,200
Yeah.

1130
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,520
Mm-hmm.

1131
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,880
So.

1132
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,720
Very, just like a big recurring part of the theme park

1133
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,720
experience.

1134
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,760
And you know, so now that we've had this realization,

1135
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,320
next time you're pulling into one of those hotels,

1136
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,800
make like a shrink ray sound in your car.

1137
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,640
You're maybe being driven in potentially from the airport.

1138
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,440
Right.

1139
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,280
But I think the driver will find it cool.

1140
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,920
Just go like shrinking beginning.

1141
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,840
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

1142
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,080
And then turn to your child, put your hands

1143
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,400
on the side of their face and say, we're shrinking now.

1144
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,800
We're going to be little.

1145
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,040
We're going to be very little.

1146
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,320
We're going to be so little, we're

1147
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,120
going to have next to no surface area.

1148
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,560
No surface area.

1149
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,120
You'll have even less surface area than usual.

1150
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,520
And then they'll be immersed from that point on.

1151
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,120
Are you ready?

1152
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,160
Get ready.

1153
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,920
You don't look ready.

1154
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,600
Be ready.

1155
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,960
Hey.

1156
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,720
Sort of an Affleck Batman voice you got going.

1157
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,200
Wow, without even having finished the film.

1158
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,040
You know, one of the things I really

1159
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,000
liked about this as a kid was that it seemed as in terms of

1160
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,240
like I knew it was a playground.

1161
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,320
I knew it was a play area.

1162
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,840
But it seemed more real than reality to me.

1163
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,360
Like it seemed more real than the film sets on the back lot

1164
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,680
because it's gussied up.

1165
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,520
It's a themed attraction.

1166
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,760
There's like four walls.

1167
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,960
Yeah, there's four walls.

1168
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,640
It's not like, yeah, that all the stuff in the back lot.

1169
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,920
You're like, I can see.

1170
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,280
Yeah, but it's not a flat.

1171
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,720
It's not a, you know, it's not a sun

1172
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,920
bleached like car or tiny spaceship or anything.

1173
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,280
It's like a navigator.

1174
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:40,640
Yeah.

1175
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,000
Wow.

1176
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,120
Flight of the navigator.

1177
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,400
Cool.

1178
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,920
But I had not seen it to that now.

1179
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,040
Yeah.

1180
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,760
But I just like that.

1181
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,120
It's like, oh, this is a simulation of a film of like

1182
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,520
what you were in in the film.

1183
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,960
Like you it's still like making the film versus being in

1184
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,720
meshed into the film.

1185
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:02,320
It feels like if you got to run around the set, it completely achieves that.

1186
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,160
Like if after hours there was not a movie to be made, but they left everything up.

1187
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:07,760
Yeah.

1188
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,240
Even though in actuality, the actual set was probably like, well, one,

1189
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,640
two sides were themed.

1190
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,600
And if you turned around, you would just see a bunch of people

1191
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,880
milling about, and if you turned another direction, it would mostly be cables.

1192
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,600
Uh huh. Stands.

1193
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,320
It doesn't apparently film the movie in Mexico weirdly is what I, what I learned.

1194
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,120
Yeah.

1195
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,560
So that's an odd and like the neighborhood you see in it is completely fabricated.

1196
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,640
That's not even like a backlot set or a real neighborhood,

1197
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,680
like completely built from scratch.

1198
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,600
I watched a making of special hosted by Rick Moranis, which I could not believe

1199
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,360
that he's also the host of the, it's supposed to be like a big step down.

1200
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,200
Like when there's the back to the future making of hosted by Kirk Cameron,

1201
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,160
the biggest step down that could ever you could ever imagine.

1202
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:53,840
Well, yeah.

1203
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,160
And just seeing Rick Moranis and so much stuff and then nothing for 30 years

1204
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,880
until of course he's coming back to do another one of these.

1205
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,240
Yeah, that's right.

1206
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,840
Wayne is back.

1207
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,400
Wayne is back.

1208
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,280
So maybe, yeah, bring this back.

1209
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,520
Will Auntie be back or a relative of Auntie?

1210
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,960
Auntie's Auntie, they bring him, that's a bot bringing Auntie back from the dead.

1211
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,320
Yeah.

1212
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,960
Uh, Wayne Zelinski has conquered death.

1213
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,200
Yeah.

1214
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,240
It's like, it's like a justice league.

1215
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,160
It's like Auntie has to, they have to go to the ship and find Auntie's corpse and,

1216
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,400
uh, bring the mother box.

1217
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:26,920
Electrocute it.

1218
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,320
Yeah.

1219
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:27,360
Yeah.

1220
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,400
You dump a mother into a kiddie pool.

1221
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,200
You dump a mother box in a kiddie pool.

1222
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:32,560
Yeah.

1223
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,760
Then you use a speed force to electrocute it.

1224
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,320
That's right.

1225
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,560
And then Auntie comes back.

1226
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,960
So you got to go to, you're going to the after world, but also shrunken.

1227
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,080
There's two processes.

1228
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,120
Unless you can hook it up to the same device.

1229
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,640
Right.

1230
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,000
Unfortunately, once he's back, three giant Dalmatians tackle Auntie off a cliff

1231
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and he eats it.

1232
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,920
Like, well that's just to tie the universes together.

1233
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
Well, that's the tie.

1234
00:45:59,160 --> 00:45:59,560
Yeah.

1235
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,800
This is something from Cruella has leaked that is, uh, that is, that is,

1236
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,800
that's a shocker.

1237
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,240
It's a bit of a shocker.

1238
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,560
I mean, it changes everything.

1239
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,600
I gotta say.

1240
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,040
Do I like it?

1241
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,800
Maybe I like it.

1242
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:13,800
Yeah.

1243
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,320
And if that's the case with every, you know, Jafar's parents were

1244
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,920
killed by three genies.

1245
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,160
Yeah.

1246
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,720
Like by Shazang.

1247
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,960
And then, yeah, then a cave of wonder ate them and pooped them out of his head.

1248
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,360
Somehow.

1249
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:39,320
Every villain was always killed by three of three of whatever.

1250
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:39,800
Yeah.

1251
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,920
If whatever the good guy has on the team, I don't know.

1252
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,840
Dalmatians are what would, uh, Bruce, Bruce Wayne's parents killed by three

1253
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:54,440
super men that would have been explored in the second sack Snyder justice league.

1254
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:54,920
Yeah.

1255
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,600
They were going back in time for that.

1256
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,640
Oh, great.

1257
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,440
You get a Routh and, uh, Cabell, yeah.

1258
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,760
CGI Reeve and you see them all get together to kill Bruce Wayne's parents.

1259
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,040
Still in the alley.

1260
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,280
They look up.

1261
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,880
It's still the pearls falling.

1262
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,640
They could catch the pearls.

1263
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,920
They could move super fast and catch all those pearls.

1264
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,400
That's a way to twist it.

1265
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,480
The pearls do not fall on the ground.

1266
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:18,840
Yeah.

1267
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,160
Right.

1268
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,000
They pick them up.

1269
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,200
And then they look at young Bruce and go, we're going to pawn these.

1270
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,840
And then not even for an insultingly low amount of money.

1271
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,520
Then they like reanimate his mother and then they like create pearls by holding

1272
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,280
rocks and like squeezing them so tight.

1273
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,280
And that's how you make pearls.

1274
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:36,560
Right.

1275
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,240
Like diamonds, the same way.

1276
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,480
And they make more necklaces and then they break those as well.

1277
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,120
And pick them up just to again, to Shazam the moment really make it over the top.

1278
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,920
It's just a movie.

1279
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,800
It's a movie that's an hour's worth of Bruce, young Bruce Wayne, Pearl torture.

1280
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,680
Yeah, exactly.

1281
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,160
Look, if it's, if one of those isn't in the Pattinson one, I'm not going to be

1282
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,040
able to follow it.

1283
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,040
I think for the Pattinson, I think we're going to get to see it.

1284
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,440
This scene that's been in every single Batman ever.

1285
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,720
Martha Wayne's pearls fall.

1286
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,800
You have to have it in there.

1287
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,440
How would, how would we know?

1288
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,080
How do we know what happened if we didn't buy comparison?

1289
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,480
We've only seen Wayne Zelinski say, honey, I shrunk or blew up.

1290
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,680
Not that many times.

1291
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,320
That's true.

1292
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:23,760
Yeah.

1293
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,840
Seeing it again, a fourth time wouldn't be so crazy.

1294
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,840
Although, well, this is what I'm, I'm coming into this episode with, because I

1295
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,680
was thinking, yes, that's true.

1296
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,000
And you're talking about Rick Moranis is Wayne Zelinski, but you're leaving out

1297
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,960
Peter Scolari's, yes, Wayne Zelinski from the three seasons of television.

1298
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,040
From three seasons where I was shocked that that discovery 66 episodes.

1299
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,720
Not each season, though, is the full total of that series is 66.

1300
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,640
Amount of money you'd make from doing that.

1301
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,520
It's crazy.

1302
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,640
There's, you know, like little Netflix shows that are like 10 seasons that

1303
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,280
had to have cultural impact.

1304
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,720
This thing, they were, they cranked out so many.

1305
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:13,320
Honey, I shrunk the kids like syndicated Canadian produced television episodes.

1306
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,240
This ran from 97 to 2000.

1307
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:21,920
And just on the way out the door, I was going, I don't know anything about this

1308
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,320
show and I was just curious for the vaguest sense of the kinds of things that

1309
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,440
happened on the show.

1310
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,480
Have you guys ever seen it?

1311
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,240
Oh, I watched it all the time.

1312
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,600
This was definitely in my sleepy Saturday.

1313
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,680
You know, like with her.

1314
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:42,160
I think it would usually air around then it might be on Disney Channel or no, I

1315
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,560
think it was on broadcast.

1316
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,840
I think it was on like WB or UPN.

1317
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,440
Yeah, but syndicate.

1318
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,120
I think it was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1319
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,520
It's a different place for depending on where you are.

1320
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,120
I think they did.

1321
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,200
I think they showed them on Disney Channel at some point too.

1322
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:00,200
But like, then you might know this already, but when you take in the sum of

1323
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,440
Wayne Zelinski's accomplishments, if you count the TV show as Canon, I don't think

1324
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,760
inventing a shrinking machine would even be in his obituary headline.

1325
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,520
It's far down the list of what he achieved.

1326
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,480
If I could just spit out, I mean, time machine, but that's a given.

1327
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,600
Like, obviously that's not even a, that's not even creative because similarly a

1328
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:28,080
machine where you can see yourself in the past, I guess, without the travel.

1329
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,600
I don't have a lot of details on these.

1330
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,360
I'm just going off of Wikipedia bylines, but so separately.

1331
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,600
So if you enter his gallery of machines, do you want to travel through time or are

1332
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,280
you too lazy and you just want to look at yourself in the past?

1333
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,120
That's also on the table.

1334
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,000
There's a machine that makes you go faster than the speed of light.

1335
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,840
There's a machine that makes you go inside of your own dreams.

1336
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,840
He invented invisibility.

1337
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,440
There's a machine that makes your vision so perfect.

1338
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,600
You can see everything, including dead people.

1339
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1340
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,080
What?

1341
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,080
What?

1342
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
It's a vision issue.

1343
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,800
It's not that you, you know, Haley Jalosman does, that's not, he just had very good

1344
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,280
vision.

1345
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,160
Wait, if you all, if we all got our eyes just super tuned up, we'd be able to see

1346
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:11,520
ghosts.

1347
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,400
So like, so it was ghosts basically saying, so if we have good enough vision, we can

1348
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,800
see heaven on earth.

1349
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,640
I get, well, that's a whole other, I feel if heaven is indeed laid on top of earth.

1350
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,120
Heaven vision would be sim, that would be different.

1351
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,480
Ghosts are stuck in limbo, right?

1352
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:28,680
Okay.

1353
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,120
So they've got unfinished business.

1354
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,720
So he's seeing like ghosts that are haunting, that are stuck on earth because of

1355
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,680
unfinished business.

1356
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,200
He's not seeing into the kingdom of heaven.

1357
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,800
Or they weren't baptized.

1358
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,680
It depends on what Wayne Zolinski sees.

1359
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,560
So he made a Christian invention.

1360
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,680
Who's blessed with holy water.

1361
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,960
Masturbating while thinking about someone other than your spouse.

1362
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,480
And then yeah, you're stuck on earth your whole life as a ghost.

1363
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:58,320
Yeah.

1364
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,400
He invented a cinnometer.

1365
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,920
He can scan and go like, well, this is how much you've said.

1366
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,880
This is how many rosaries you have to say.

1367
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,320
Yeah.

1368
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,520
The stats appear.

1369
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,160
The stats.

1370
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,880
Very much like an infinity train setup.

1371
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,320
There's a counter.

1372
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:13,800
Yeah.

1373
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,320
He invented an infinity train, done already.

1374
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,800
Done on this syndicated show.

1375
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,480
Sorry to say.

1376
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:26,920
Brain swab machine, a machine that is to find gold and which causes the family to

1377
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,800
run a foul of a leprechaun.

1378
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,200
Is after the same pot of doubloons.

1379
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,760
This sounds fantastic.

1380
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,200
This show.

1381
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:33,720
That's a way.

1382
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,400
Yes.

1383
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,320
Long story short, this seems like the best show.

1384
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,640
This seems like a show I would like to write for.

1385
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,200
I was going to say, like, can we bring it back?

1386
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:41,560
Yeah.

1387
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,000
If it's, if they would let something be this crazy.

1388
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,680
Every episode of the premise for a television show.

1389
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,320
Yeah.

1390
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,080
There's like in every one of these, yes, there'd be a full show about it and the

1391
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,440
show would get really boring.

1392
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:54,640
Yeah.

1393
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,240
And the network would say, well, can it like not really be about the brain

1394
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,800
swap?

1395
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,600
Like, don't you think that's going to run out of steam?

1396
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,080
You want to say no, it should always be, it should be crazy machines

1397
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,440
as frequently as possible.

1398
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:05,880
Yeah.

1399
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,840
It's like quantum leap took one of these machines and made the whole series about it.

1400
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,840
This is a new quantum leap.

1401
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,600
Every episode.

1402
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,000
Yeah.

1403
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,600
It's like at the end of the first season, they're like, all right, let's take off

1404
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,080
the gloves.

1405
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,320
He's not a genius anymore.

1406
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,080
He's a God.

1407
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,640
What could God, God in man's body?

1408
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,600
What could he do?

1409
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,720
Well, what problems could he go?

1410
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,120
Well, okay.

1411
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,440
Death time.

1412
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:27,760
Go.

1413
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,400
Okay.

1414
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,160
Gold, uh, human folly.

1415
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,480
Like can end.

1416
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:32,720
Yeah.

1417
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,640
It can end death.

1418
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,720
He could like zap a caveman millions of years into the future and just make him

1419
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,440
deal with it.

1420
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,120
Dara, does he give like the Darth Plagueis speech at some point, how he's

1421
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,240
learned how to cheat death?

1422
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,440
Wayne Zelinski can cheat death now.

1423
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,920
Does he encounter, is there like a two parter where he's like, okay, so if we kill

1424
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,400
Hitler, but okay, but for Hitler, like he does the paradox of like, well, if you

1425
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,160
kill baby Hitler, you know, if you, or if you kill Hitler, when he's at his height

1426
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,480
of his power, what happened?

1427
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,760
He's got a bit like he's over the course of it.

1428
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,880
He tries to kill Hitler at every possible age, like every possible month and just

1429
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,640
see what happened.

1430
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,880
But also the machine lets you see the effects without them occurring

1431
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,880
practically.

1432
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,840
So you, so there is no butterfly effect, but it's a butterfly effect simulator.

1433
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:21,560
Right.

1434
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,080
Cause it's saying, cause you don't want it to actually happen.

1435
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,360
Cause what if everything unravels?

1436
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,120
Yeah.

1437
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,920
Did he come up with just a machine that's a Hitler, it just kills Hitler, a

1438
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,040
Hitler killing machine.

1439
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,400
And that's all it can do.

1440
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,040
It can track wherever Hitler was anywhere in time.

1441
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,720
And if you want to zap Hitler out of one time and kill him in the year 3000, you

1442
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,440
can do that too.

1443
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:42,840
Do that.

1444
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,840
Oh, can you, can you transport him through time, shrink him, then kill him.

1445
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,600
Then have sick auntie after him, bring auntie back to life.

1446
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,000
Right.

1447
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,400
Auntie devours Hitler.

1448
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,600
Auntie's forces are on the march.

1449
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,760
He's conquered most of Europe and I.

1450
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:07,200
We salute our brave aunts doing the ultimate job saving the planet.

1451
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,080
Oh no, I was going the other way that auntie becomes the fascist.

1452
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,000
Oh, we know that.

1453
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,360
In the 20th century, inevitably fascism rises.

1454
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,200
It's just a different figurehead.

1455
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,520
Oh man.

1456
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,880
Oh, we've, yeah.

1457
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,200
Oh, you can't kill Hitler.

1458
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,720
A giant and immediately.

1459
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,800
Oh, it takes his place.

1460
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,000
It's a power vacuum.

1461
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,200
Mussolini deposed by Auntie Hitler's friends, sometimes foe.

1462
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,840
There's only one answer.

1463
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:37,960
A giant poisoned oatmeal cookie only through poison cream.

1464
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,840
Can we stop the Auntie forces?

1465
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,600
This is also sounding like Rick and Morty pitches.

1466
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,520
He really is.

1467
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:49,680
That's exactly what I thought, which is that he invents a protozoa that exists

1468
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,400
to that can eat anything, including garbage.

1469
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,440
So it's a potential solution to the waste problem that this will just eat all the

1470
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,360
garbage that feels extremely like machines.

1471
00:55:59,360 --> 00:55:59,720
Sure.

1472
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:04,720
That's Wayne Zelinski's bread and butter, but inventing like a being that's very

1473
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,880
Rick and Morty, but that's also very flux capacitor, right?

1474
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,960
Doesn't he start feeding a garbage in the second?

1475
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,320
Doesn't it run on garbage?

1476
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:11,960
Oh, that's true.

1477
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,520
Yeah, it's a living thing, which the only other thing like when you're talking

1478
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,080
about living beings eating garbage, the only other example is the Flintstones.

1479
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,120
So it's these are two very unique pieces of work.

1480
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,120
I don't want to just go on and on about that.

1481
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,480
Well, of course I do, but I won't.

1482
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:36,440
The there's one where wrestlers Brett and Owen Hart are injured at the

1483
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,880
Zelinski's house and thus Wayne has to take.

1484
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,840
And his brother or somebody, I don't know.

1485
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,200
I don't know who the chief is.

1486
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,800
Wayne and the chief, the chief.

1487
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,080
Not sure.

1488
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,640
Couldn't tell you crazy.

1489
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,320
I'm one day from retirement.

1490
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,240
If you invent one more cockamamie machine that I have to clean up the mess,

1491
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,880
so he's a cop in this episode.

1492
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,240
The Linsky's a cop.

1493
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,000
You can't do it.

1494
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,320
I'm revoking your inventor badge.

1495
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:04,720
I've got you.

1496
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,080
I'm going to have your inventor badge and gun for this.

1497
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,120
Wow.

1498
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,680
Yes, to basically Wayne's.

1499
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,480
Lindsay has to be in a wrestling match.

1500
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,120
We in a robot suit to replace Brett, the hitman heart.

1501
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,000
This sounds like the best show I've ever not seen.

1502
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,400
It seems so good.

1503
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,920
It is, you know, there's a lot of talk about like what streamer has what

1504
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,680
Disney plus does not have.

1505
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,760
I'm looking at doesn't they don't.

1506
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,320
I almost thought it was like one of the oddball things that they had that I

1507
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,320
would have made fun of on Twitter or something.

1508
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,320
Now I realize that would have been very foolish and also they are the fools

1509
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,440
because they haven't posted this incredible piece of science fiction on

1510
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,560
their platform.

1511
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:47,000
The only way to see it is on Daily Motion, where the Wild West of content,

1512
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:52,440
where it's all flip, it's like mirror affected, like it's reversed so that

1513
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,160
they don't catch the copyright.

1514
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:54,520
Right.

1515
00:57:54,520 --> 00:58:00,320
And on there, there is a scene that'll probably refresh it where I have to get

1516
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,480
through like a Joe Rogan vape ad.

1517
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,680
I'm so no, it's Allegra.

1518
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,680
You won't be able to see it.

1519
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,520
So I'll just describe it.

1520
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:12,640
There is an episode where Wayne and his brother are, I'm not sure if the

1521
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,600
brother is chief.

1522
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,120
I think, I think it's not.

1523
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,120
But Wayne and his brother are shrunken at a fast food restaurant and mistaken

1524
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,120
for kids meal toys.

1525
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,600
And you might wonder, so is it like a McDonald's equivalent?

1526
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,120
It's like McHappies or something.

1527
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,760
No, it's McDonald's.

1528
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,520
They use real McDonald's.

1529
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,960
McDonald's cooperated in the making of this.

1530
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:34,880
There's Big Mac.

1531
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,360
They land on top of giant Big Macs.

1532
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,400
There's a thing where they have to get to something that's across the

1533
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,480
burger fryer.

1534
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,880
So they have to take ice cubes out of a soda and ski.

1535
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,960
Yes, essentially they have to, they use the natural fission of the melting of

1536
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:59,040
the ice to like skate, extreme skate across a griddle.

1537
00:58:59,160 --> 00:58:59,840
Wow.

1538
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,400
It's so good.

1539
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,560
I've, where has this show been all my life?

1540
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,480
Yeah, really?

1541
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:10,600
This is, this is crazier than any adult swim show where it's just like nonsense.

1542
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,200
Yeah.

1543
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,760
I know it's a dream of like, all right, so it's just a guy with like not just one

1544
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,800
machine, but like 30 machines that make any plot in the universe possible.

1545
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,920
You just, all you gotta do is like bring it back to a family and a house and the

1546
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,080
effects can't be that good.

1547
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,440
Whoa, no problem.

1548
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:27,840
Great.

1549
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,600
Better.

1550
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,280
Better with the effects of being worse.

1551
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,000
Wow.

1552
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,960
Um, so I don't know.

1553
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,280
I bring that all of just like go to daily motion.

1554
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,120
I'm by apologize for any viruses that you get while you're there.

1555
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,240
I've been checking out the show.

1556
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:46,120
If the video never finishes playing, like you never get through a full video,

1557
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,200
that's a feature, not a bug.

1558
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,680
That's how the website operates.

1559
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,240
Yeah.

1560
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,640
Look, you're not going to come out of it with your social security number and your

1561
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,040
identity, um, not thieved.

1562
00:59:59,080 --> 00:59:59,440
Yeah.

1563
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,720
It's going to happen, but you're going to get to see.

1564
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,800
Winslensky skate on ice across a McDonald's official McDonald's.

1565
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,360
Yes.

1566
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:06,760
Yeah.

1567
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:11,200
How much better is it that they like the branding in the attraction?

1568
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,280
How much better is it that they went for that?

1569
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,880
McDonald's participated.

1570
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:20,280
Man, I wonder if they go through the whole like, you know, the, the McDonald

1571
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,200
brother system, the efficient system where it's like, you do this and you do

1572
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:29,040
that, like they went around the whole mustard before mustard before this.

1573
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:33,520
No, the on you go clockwise with the onion machine, Darryl.

1574
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,200
They're running in or they're like, you know, running, trying to cross the

1575
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,160
burger fryer and they're just like, well, the McDonald's brothers invented this,

1576
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,960
but Ray Crocks sure perfected it.

1577
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,320
He was a real founder.

1578
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,080
You know, he was willing to franchise.

1579
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,000
That made all the difference.

1580
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,320
You know, you talk about, but that's sort of what I was looking into the show for

1581
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,440
is like, well, were there other shrinking examples here because honey, I think the

1582
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,600
kids is great and this attraction is great, but you are married to the

1583
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,400
backyard, which is a very clever, cool setting.

1584
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,440
But I wanted to pose this question.

1585
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,520
Where, where else would you want to be?

1586
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,720
I had the same question for you guys.

1587
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,080
Okay.

1588
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:11,440
Okay.

1589
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,600
We're thinking the same thing.

1590
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,080
Well, I think this might've taken, it might've provided me with an answer,

1591
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:22,440
which is witnessing the McDonald's burger construction process and maybe

1592
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,480
getting to like, could I just like dive into the cheese?

1593
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,720
Could I swim around in it?

1594
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,360
Could I just get like a splur to ketchup and get covered in it and see how that

1595
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:35,480
fit you're playing with fire because you might get eaten, but if you, if you make

1596
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,040
it out, okay, that's the problem with a lot of my answers, it would be like, it's

1597
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:43,720
a deadly game you're playing because it would be like a factory, uh, like, you

1598
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,440
know, the Mr. Rogers making of little film strips, crayons, candy.

1599
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:53,640
I would love to be, you know, immersed in like, uh, the, the Skittles thing where

1600
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,520
they're shaking the Skittles up to make sure that the color gets stuck in there.

1601
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,640
Ooh, like a cheese it dusting.

1602
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,600
Oh yeah.

1603
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,720
Like the machine that's kind of shaking it around to make sure it all gets on

1604
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:04,880
there.

1605
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,000
Even unwrapped.

1606
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:06,440
Yeah.

1607
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,760
Some of us are showing when it's like the, they're shaking around very

1608
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,520
colorful candy or, uh, uh, delicious treats.

1609
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,800
Yeah, absolutely.

1610
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,440
But danger seems dangerous.

1611
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,800
You probably would get like killed by the juice pummeled to death with giant

1612
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,360
Skittles.

1613
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,840
Yeah, I think so.

1614
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:28,400
And if you, if you didn't escape before the plastic wrapping stage, then you

1615
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,600
probably suffocate in transit.

1616
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,320
Like you don't, you don't make it to the seven 11 you die on the flight.

1617
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:34,680
Yeah.

1618
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,280
Unfortunately.

1619
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,640
Uh, I guess if it was like in a less, uh, less scary area, like if you just had,

1620
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:46,360
you know, 30, maybe too much, 30 gummy bears on the ground.

1621
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,440
Um, and then you were just like climbing all over the gummy bears.

1622
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,200
That would be fun.

1623
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,240
Cause that's soft.

1624
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,920
You wouldn't get so hurt.

1625
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:53,760
Man.

1626
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,160
You're gonna have a nibble to a gummy bear.

1627
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:56,880
You could have it.

1628
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,800
You certainly have a nibble.

1629
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,840
You could eat your way into its stomach.

1630
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:00,680
Yeah.

1631
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,600
Or its face.

1632
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,760
Oh yes.

1633
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,400
And then you could, I mean, that's also dangerous.

1634
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,400
You could get stuck inside potentially, but you'd eat your way out.

1635
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,400
Mm hmm.

1636
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,040
True.

1637
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:09,520
True.

1638
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,680
I just want to like sit in one's lap for a while.

1639
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:16,320
Maybe all you need is one gummy bear to hang out on.

1640
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,360
You'd have a pretty good time.

1641
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:17,880
I think.

1642
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,240
And I think you'd have a good, a good fun time.

1643
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,280
I mean, on his tummy.

1644
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,640
Can't you get sleep?

1645
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,240
Jason, you have a little nap on his tummy.

1646
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,560
I mean, that sounds great.

1647
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,200
Yeah.

1648
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,280
I was going to say like a little, well, my mind first went to like pop up book,

1649
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:35,520
like, like, you know, that has a little castle or house or something like that.

1650
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,720
But then I started thinking about like, you know, uh, I think this was kind of a

1651
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,120
go-to in kids and movies for a while or something like you would be in the dolls.

1652
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:49,400
They would go in the dolls house or like the GI Joe headquarters or Wayne man or

1653
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,120
the X-Men man, like whatever the kid's toy was.

1654
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:56,920
This is, this is the question I have that it does depend how small you are.

1655
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:57,480
Yeah.

1656
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,000
They're very small and honey.

1657
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,040
I shrunk the kids.

1658
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,680
Microscopically small.

1659
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:01,920
Right.

1660
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,760
They're riding on the back of the fly or the bee.

1661
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:05,440
Yeah.

1662
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:05,760
Yeah.

1663
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,200
So they're so tiny.

1664
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,200
So even going into like your toys, it would be crazy.

1665
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,680
It would be like, oh, giant.

1666
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,520
But if you were like doll sized, now that's a whole different game.

1667
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,640
That's a little different because I am definitely hanging out with my toys.

1668
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:25,920
If I'm like doll sized, you can finally spend time with them.

1669
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,320
I'm not intimidated by you and your size.

1670
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,240
Yeah, I'm never coming back.

1671
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,560
It depends what scale I'm in.

1672
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:36,200
If I'm in a quarter scale, like my Rafael undercover NECA turtle, that's pretty big.

1673
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,440
That's kind of baby sized, but then I'm going to hang out with a different set of

1674
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,360
toys versus, you know, the regular six inch scale action figure, like Marvel legends.

1675
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,560
Do you have to go, do you go with sort of the highlights?

1676
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,440
Like you have an Adam West Batman behind you.

1677
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:55,000
Are you that size because those are kind of the more, uh, the detailed, like the

1678
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,440
big ticket items or do you go with what you have more of and go with like Funko

1679
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,120
pop slash, uh, Disney park stars?

1680
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,880
So then you have lots of friends of your same size.

1681
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,920
Yeah, I think it's probably getting smaller because I have more figures that are

1682
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,120
smaller, um, and all the figures are different scales and sizes, but I think

1683
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,920
probably I would go with whatever I have vehicle, like whatever size I could fit

1684
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,920
into the vehicles, because I have several batmobile, I have a 66 batmobile.

1685
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,920
That's about this big.

1686
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,520
I have the animated batmobile, which like this big.

1687
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,080
And if I could be whatever that six inch scale is, and I could get in that

1688
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,960
batmobile and drive it around, I mean, someone would have to push it.

1689
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:38,240
It doesn't, it's not a motorized batmobile, but I feel like if I can hang

1690
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,640
out, I just got a playset.

1691
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,000
I just got a Ninja turtle playset and that's not really a place.

1692
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,280
It's it's a diorama.

1693
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,720
That's what adult collectors do.

1694
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,680
They have dioramas not play sets, but I could hang out on the street with the

1695
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,920
Ninja turtles in like a six inch scale.

1696
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:58,480
So yeah, it's like so, so perversely what you want.

1697
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,640
I feel like this is everything you want.

1698
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,400
Yeah, probably.

1699
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,360
I mean, would it, would it be the situation like, uh, on that Simpson

1700
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:09,160
episode where crusties in the dollhouse with Malibu Stacy and he like comes home

1701
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:14,040
to life with Malibu Stacy and I have like, I come home to rogue,

1702
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,840
swinging Teddy bearer.

1703
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,960
Hey baby.

1704
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,840
Another day in the office coming home to you makes it all worthwhile.

1705
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,120
Head head falls off.

1706
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:33,120
Getting to bask in the shade of your umbrella, your parasol.

1707
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,000
And then I go to sleep in like a little napkin bed that I wanted for the

1708
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,560
ghostbusters that my mom threw out.

1709
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,160
Fire hazard.

1710
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:40,280
Death.

1711
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:40,720
No, I know.

1712
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,800
Death is waiting for you.

1713
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:46,360
But as an adult, you're going to need Wayne Zelinski to find you,

1714
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,200
bring you back from the, bring you back.

1715
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:48,520
Yeah.

1716
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,400
Kingdom of the dead.

1717
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,560
It is God powers.

1718
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,320
So yeah, could I live with my toys?

1719
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:56,320
I love, yeah, that would be, that would be the dream scale.

1720
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:01,720
If I could choose how small I was going to be, I think like, so pulling up a

1721
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:05,720
napkin blanket and saying like, good night, Venkman.

1722
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,520
That's a good night's spengler.

1723
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,760
Uh, I think I have recently bought are the reissues of all the old ghostbusters

1724
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,000
that I had as a child, those real, the animated ones.

1725
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,960
And you also bought a pack of napkins.

1726
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,400
And I have napkins.

1727
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:24,400
They have not made a new firehouse, but I feel like it might be on the way.

1728
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,720
I feel like there might be a chance to fix history.

1729
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,040
Well, where are they going to hang out?

1730
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:34,560
Otherwise they say, yeah, no, they, the, I have the, uh, Ecto one on preorder.

1731
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,800
So it's coming out soon.

1732
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,760
They, uh, they just reissued the monster.

1733
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,560
That's a toilet.

1734
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,560
I love that.

1735
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,600
I don't believe I had it, but I loved it.

1736
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,200
He's back.

1737
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,200
So you should get a toilet monster.

1738
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,720
I have amassed the weirdest collection of toys since you've

1739
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,200
gotten me into some stuff.

1740
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,480
And it's just the weirdest assembly of.

1741
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,880
Listed for the people.

1742
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,200
I'm more, I don't know.

1743
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,680
Well, I was stacking up toys.

1744
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:03,000
You, I found toys that you had given me as a rearranging stuff over the years.

1745
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,080
And yeah, yeah.

1746
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,760
Let's fund the mutt Williams twice after he said,

1747
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:09,680
I'm not right here.

1748
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,920
And I find a son Williams.

1749
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,200
You have a mutt Williams.

1750
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:13,520
Yeah.

1751
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,240
You have to separate the character from the actor.

1752
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:16,920
Sure.

1753
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,720
Uh, uh, Todd McFarlane, the Todd McFarlane action figure made by the McFarlane

1754
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,000
toys, Todd, the bum, Todd, Todd, the artist, the artist.

1755
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:26,480
Okay.

1756
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,760
Uh, but next to your Duffer brothers, your Duffer brother Funko pops.

1757
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,320
Oh, did I buy?

1758
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:36,040
I'm obsessed with this fact that like, yeah, I will give me those.

1759
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:40,400
Give me the behind the scenes creators of stranger things.

1760
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,080
Oh, I thought you were talking about the Boondock saints.

1761
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,000
I thought they had made a thing out of the guy from overnight.

1762
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:46,800
Uh, no, no, no, no.

1763
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,480
I'm a stranger.

1764
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,040
Things directors.

1765
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,320
Yeah.

1766
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:49,560
Yeah.

1767
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,720
There's toys of them.

1768
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:57,520
So mud McFarlane, uh, former wrestling, uh, manager characters, Zeb Coulter.

1769
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:57,960
Oh yeah.

1770
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,200
Right.

1771
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,240
He was a tea party guy with a big beard.

1772
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,400
All your toys are getting canceled.

1773
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,840
A lot of guys, toys that you're problematic.

1774
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,080
And then you did get me Gambit.

1775
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,480
You got me the he hasn't, yeah, he's fine.

1776
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,360
But it's fine.

1777
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,440
But your Linwood toy.

1778
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,440
Well, that that's not a toy.

1779
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,320
That's a Patriot.

1780
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,960
Mike Lindell toy.

1781
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,160
I got you seven years ago.

1782
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,640
Well, he's just a businessman.

1783
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,920
It's tiny little pillow.

1784
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,800
Not a fire hazard, not flammable.

1785
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,360
Yeah.

1786
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:28,920
Right.

1787
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:29,440
Hmm.

1788
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,960
Um, good lineup.

1789
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,640
I, is there, how about this?

1790
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:37,280
Is there any, um, oh wait, I have another answer and it's also food, which is like,

1791
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:43,600
I think if I could like land on top of a, um, like ice cream melting on top of a

1792
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,200
brownie and just kind of like, you know, have fun in there until everything's

1793
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,960
melted and, uh, and hopefully make a, a, um, you know, a safe escape.

1794
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,760
Not that there's hopefully not somebody there about to eat it, but just to like

1795
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:03,600
sort of imagine like sliding down ice cream into a warm brownie.

1796
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,520
And then, you know, and you, and you could start eating it and, and, you know,

1797
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,400
like you would have consumed 0.5% of it.

1798
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,800
And yet you'd be so full just bursting at the same.

1799
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,960
You'd be soaking wet with ice cream.

1800
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,040
You'd be just head to toe soaking, dripping in ice cream.

1801
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:23,560
I'm not usually about the wetness, but in this case, I mean, that sounds

1802
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:29,120
take the cherry and just like, wave it around like, like a victorious,

1803
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,600
after a, after a sports victory.

1804
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,040
Big ball and chain.

1805
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:41,280
I hope Wayne's Alinsky has like a little, uh, pool or not pool, uh, like a little

1806
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,360
fish aquarium net to pick me up.

1807
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,720
Cause I'm going to have a full tummy after that outing.

1808
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,800
I love an ice cream brownie.

1809
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,840
Doesn't that sound nice?

1810
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,080
Yeah.

1811
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,840
It's like, yeah, just swimming in a brownie.

1812
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,000
Like a Pazuki too.

1813
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,120
Or Pazuki.

1814
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:55,320
Yeah.

1815
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:55,680
Yeah.

1816
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:00,800
We have watching up close that process of it, but going from a hard dessert to a

1817
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,800
soft dessert and just being, being part of it, the aromas would be so much more

1818
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,760
intense because you're in the thick of it.

1819
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,880
Some of it, you have to be careful because some pockets, like a hot chocolate

1820
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,520
chip melting might be piping hot.

1821
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,400
That might be like, that might scold you.

1822
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,680
That could kill you.

1823
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,560
It might.

1824
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:19,880
Yeah.

1825
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:24,040
Now that I think about it, maybe Pazuki's too, maybe chocolate chips.

1826
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,000
You can't have any part of, because those are like, those are like landmines.

1827
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:28,240
Yeah.

1828
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,640
Step on one and you're done.

1829
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,640
You know what I'd also like to do is go get shrunken, get in a

1830
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,000
pneumatic tube at the bank.

1831
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,760
That's a good one.

1832
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,400
That's a really good one.

1833
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,160
Ooh.

1834
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,120
Yeah.

1835
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:44,480
It's like Tim, maybe like grab a hold of the wall and then go through the, go do it.

1836
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,160
I don't know where you can even do that anymore.

1837
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,440
Well, some of the CVS is still have them.

1838
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,080
And let me just say they have not kept them up very well.

1839
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:53,320
Okay.

1840
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,160
Wood, Scott, would you do that?

1841
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,680
What are you too afraid to do that?

1842
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,680
Is that like a launch?

1843
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:57,920
Yeah.

1844
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,920
Is that, it is a launch.

1845
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,520
I'm a no pneumatic queen.

1846
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,720
Um, I'm not sure.

1847
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,560
Yeah, that does sound a little scary, but it also sounds like the big, you

1848
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,360
know, the Futurama tubes.

1849
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,080
Yeah, that's true.

1850
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,160
That sounds, it does seem kind of fun.

1851
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:15,160
I'd like to maybe, if you could be like in a, um, like a little marble, like a

1852
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,040
miniature, um, Jurassic world gyrosphere.

1853
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,720
And you know, those machines at the mall, not machines, but the, like, whatever,

1854
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:28,440
the, the things at the mall where a penny goes around and around until it gets to

1855
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:32,080
the bottom, if you could do that, be impossible to do it on a penny.

1856
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,960
Unless you're in some sort of like wheel, like a American gladiators kind of

1857
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,840
thing, if I could do that effect, like spiraling and spiraling, I'd probably get

1858
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,080
very dizzy and that end would be pretty intense, like just whips and whips, but

1859
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,920
it seems like fun to do from a small perspective, like a drop slide at the end

1860
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,000
where you just like sink eventually.

1861
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,200
It would be, it would be scary.

1862
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:51,560
Yeah.

1863
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,320
I might, I might barf through the entire, that might be sort of jackass, like

1864
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,360
throwing up in a, uh, in a porta potty.

1865
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,360
Oh man.

1866
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,520
There's so many good things to do when you're shrunk.

1867
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,680
I'd rather maybe the jackass guys get shrunk than, than me.

1868
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,960
They'd be more creative.

1869
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,800
They'd think of all kinds of great stuff.

1870
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:11,200
Yeah.

1871
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,760
I think they're after this next one.

1872
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,440
I think they're done.

1873
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,560
They're getting a little old.

1874
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,280
Well, they, then they gotta, if this is, they gotta go out strong.

1875
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,960
They have to find a shrinking ray.

1876
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:20,480
Yeah.

1877
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,840
Do it all small micro jackass.

1878
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:27,320
And they like, cause that, you know, there's always like body functions involved,

1879
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:32,680
but they could like get shit at, they could be in shit and go through a body.

1880
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:33,880
Oh man.

1881
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,920
What a good idea.

1882
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,040
Yeah.

1883
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:36,600
Yeah.

1884
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,880
Micro jackass.

1885
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,840
They get swallowed alive.

1886
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,080
They don't get somehow, don't get killed by stomach acid.

1887
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,640
Uh, yeah, they'd maybe have to enter.

1888
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,760
Um, they'd have to put a, they'd have to have like a suit on, like a hazmat suit.

1889
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,360
It would probably be bad for the person.

1890
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,280
Yeah.

1891
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,800
Although, hmm, there's gotta be a way to do it.

1892
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,120
You would have maybe like put them in like a little capsule or something or whatever

1893
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,880
that camera they can put inside, you know, you know how they have cameras now where

1894
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,840
you can swallow it.

1895
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,080
Oh yeah.

1896
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,640
Or a camera for like a rectal exam.

1897
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,840
That's what they should do.

1898
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,680
They should go into a camera that checks your colon.

1899
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,120
They can check up your butt.

1900
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,360
They can check through your pee hole.

1901
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,680
They can do a lot of different things.

1902
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,840
So, and however they protect them, it can be a three camera shoot in there.

1903
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:25,720
When they get resized, they should immediately be brought back to normal human

1904
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,440
size and then get smacked by the giant hand.

1905
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:28,960
Of course.

1906
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,400
The giant swinging hand is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

1907
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,720
The giant hallway hand.

1908
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,000
Yeah.

1909
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,280
Yeah.

1910
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,040
That happens at the, at the end of like going through the banal cavity.

1911
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,120
There's a big hand waiting for them.

1912
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,560
I'm Johnny Knoxville and this is the colon cancer screening.

1913
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,520
There's a big profile of him in GQ recently.

1914
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,400
I don't know if they touch on the shrinking.

1915
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:51,640
God damn.

1916
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,880
They haven't revealed if they've invented a shrinking rate for the new movie.

1917
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:01,800
No, but Johnny Knoxville did let his hair grow white and I think it looks good.

1918
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:02,560
Whoa.

1919
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,000
Yeah.

1920
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,240
That's, that's a mind blow.

1921
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:05,920
It is.

1922
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,000
Johnny Knoxville looks old.

1923
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:07,920
I gotta see this now.

1924
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:11,800
Um, I'd like to get my, I'd like to be microscopic and Johnny Knoxville's new

1925
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,000
white hair run around.

1926
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,880
So it's like, um, all right.

1927
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,640
Well, anything else to say about all this or about shrinking anywhere you'd like to

1928
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,200
be, what's the way, how do we, how do we go?

1929
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,800
I have one last thing I really liked about the attraction and that is when exiting

1930
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:31,920
this big that's a wrap, thanks for playing a sign, the film clapper sign as a kid.

1931
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,560
Again, probably just hours spent at Disney MGM studios.

1932
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,320
I loved film clappers.

1933
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:41,320
I was always, I had at least one or two little toy ones or like

1934
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,040
souvenir ones and stuff.

1935
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:48,240
Uh, I, I was not crazy as about as a kid when I would see behind the

1936
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,120
scene stuff and like, Ooh, they're, they switched to a digital one.

1937
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,880
I liked the black and white one with the chalk.

1938
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:53,480
Chalk.

1939
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:53,960
Yeah.

1940
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,560
Tactile right on it.

1941
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:01,560
Um, yeah, I think I must've had, uh, clapboards from places.

1942
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,120
Did I?

1943
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,480
Yeah, maybe I had one.

1944
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,040
Correct.

1945
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:04,720
Is that the prompt?

1946
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,880
That's the proper term.

1947
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:06,640
Yeah.

1948
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,760
Um, I just bought one for a practical riff or like I actually needed it.

1949
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,040
I needed to sync sound.

1950
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,000
And I was like, wow, I've never had to like actually have one.

1951
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,760
Um, it's so satisfying to do.

1952
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,480
Yes.

1953
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,120
One of those it's, it's much more satisfying than like, all right,

1954
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,720
everyone, everyone clap.

1955
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:23,520
Yeah.

1956
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,000
The, the non theme park souvenir ones have a little magnet in it.

1957
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,600
They're really like drag together and that's very, that, that like

1958
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,160
makes it go at super speed.

1959
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:33,560
Yeah.

1960
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:36,200
When you let it go and that, that magnet hits, right.

1961
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:40,040
You can get, you get a little aggression out every time you do it, do a big clap.

1962
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,080
It feels really good.

1963
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,720
Wow.

1964
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,760
I mean, that's a little stress relief for you at home.

1965
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:44,600
Get a clapboard.

1966
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,600
It's like get a clapboard fidget spinner.

1967
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,080
It's like new cause a clapboard.

1968
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:48,520
Yeah.

1969
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,320
Recommended.

1970
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:53,920
I do respect though, the people on set who actually do have to do those things

1971
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:57,920
and can do it with like two finger, like they're like barely holding onto the

1972
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,200
clapboard and they can like do it, holding it with half their hands.

1973
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,440
Oh, slide it in where, cause there's barely room for once.

1974
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,960
And as they have to use a mini one.

1975
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:05,480
Yeah.

1976
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:05,880
Yeah.

1977
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,440
Like getting it into the frame is a real challenge.

1978
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:08,880
Yeah.

1979
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:09,480
Yeah.

1980
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,520
Absolutely.

1981
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:10,920
Yeah.

1982
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,800
Well, here's to the clappers.

1983
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,680
You make movies possible.

1984
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,920
It's the funnest movie toy, almost as fun as a day at the honey.

1985
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,520
I strength the kids movie set adventure.

1986
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,080
Which is they were the big megaphone thing.

1987
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:23,160
Yeah.

1988
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:23,320
Yeah.

1989
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,120
The rectors used to use.

1990
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,960
Oh, well we want that back.

1991
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:26,320
Yeah.

1992
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,800
Well with the, yeah, it comes with the ascot and the Jod hoppers or whatever.

1993
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,320
Hey, oh, just to follow up from the beginning of the show, it's a Peppy is

1994
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,840
the name of the wise owl and the young lady on the UTS bag is Sally UTS.

1995
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,920
And happy and Peppy the owl and Sally UTS.

1996
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,160
What were the three companies again?

1997
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,800
Uh, well, wise UTS and hers.

1998
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:46,440
Okay.

1999
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,080
How many potato chip companies can you name off the top of your head?

2000
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,920
Uh, I don't know.

2001
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,680
Wise, it's hers.

2002
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,760
Lays Pringles.

2003
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,600
Are you counting Pringles?

2004
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,200
Yeah, sure.

2005
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:56,800
Pringles.

2006
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,600
Fritos.

2007
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,600
That's six.

2008
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,800
I'm sure there's plenty I'm missing.

2009
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,040
Yeah.

2010
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,520
Ruffles is probably in there.

2011
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,600
Um, who makes those kettle chip ones?

2012
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:06,520
I don't know.

2013
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,480
You gotta get into the Hawaii area.

2014
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,080
Yeah.

2015
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:10,640
Yeah.

2016
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,960
Um, zaps zaps real good.

2017
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,760
Do potato crisps count?

2018
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:18,400
Because if so, yeah, there's a good friend of ours that hasn't been mentioned.

2019
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:18,880
That's right.

2020
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:20,840
Oh, Mr.

2021
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:21,320
Tato.

2022
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:21,800
There you go.

2023
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,120
That's right.

2024
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:22,920
Yeah.

2025
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:27,720
Um, there's so yeah, we, Hey, there's potato friends all over the world.

2026
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:28,360
That's right.

2027
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,680
International potato.

2028
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,400
Not just in the Pennsylvania area.

2029
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:36,960
Um, well, uh, Hey, I guess, um, uh, that's a wrap.

2030
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,200
Thanks for playing.

2031
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,680
Uh, you survived.

2032
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:43,680
If I'd guess the ride, the second gate, uh, keep tuned here to, I guess, read

2033
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:47,040
the second gate for three bonus episodes every month.

2034
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:53,000
Um, and, um, well, uh, what else?

2035
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,040
Um, uh, are you all right?

2036
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,880
I know I'm not, I'm blanking.

2037
01:18:58,880 --> 01:18:59,760
We don't have to have anything else.

2038
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,000
Yeah.

2039
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:05,120
I feel the pressure to have another one more way to go out, but then you don't,

2040
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,800
that's a made up piece of the format.

2041
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,320
I was trying to remember in the, during the, uh, downtown Disney ordeal, did

2042
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,960
someone shrink and climb up Mike Mitchell's urethra?

2043
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,960
I think so.

2044
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,840
When he was possessed by, uh, one of the owners, which I can't think of who it was.

2045
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,720
We blocked it.

2046
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,320
So much has happened since then.

2047
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,240
So much happened during that.

2048
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:28,600
We went from one traumatic period, the downtown Disney ordeal,

2049
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,960
right into a pandemic.

2050
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,000
Hard to say which was worse.

2051
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:34,280
Yeah.

2052
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:34,880
Hard to say.

2053
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,640
Hard to say.

2054
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,200
More impactful on the world.

2055
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,840
Um, but anyway, I don't know.

2056
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,160
I, that's a thought I had.

2057
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:41,840
Yeah.

2058
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,800
It doesn't feel satisfying as far as a way to end it.

2059
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,120
I think it's a totally, yeah.

2060
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,160
Just shout out to Mike Mitchell's urethra.

2061
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,440
We should end every episode saying that.

2062
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:51,960
Yeah.

2063
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,760
And go see tomorrow war.

2064
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,400
Tomorrow war.

2065
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:54,680
Yeah.

2066
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,360
Mike Mitchell's urethra.

2067
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,560
It's covered in clothes, but Mike Mitchell's urethra is in the movie.

2068
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,280
It does appear.

2069
01:19:59,280 --> 01:19:59,600
Yeah.

2070
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:05,680
It's probably, there's probably some pervert urethra site that like clocks

2071
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,920
actors, urethras, but Wiki, your wiki, your e-thra.

2072
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,040
Thanks for listening.

2073
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,240
Let's get out of here.

2074
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:11,600
I don't know.

2075
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,280
I think we have about five minutes more on wiki.

2076
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:13,640
Your either.
