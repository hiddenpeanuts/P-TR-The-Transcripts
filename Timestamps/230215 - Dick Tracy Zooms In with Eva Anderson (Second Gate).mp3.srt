1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Welcome to an emergency second gate podcast,

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,440
the ride special Eva zooms in.

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,560
This is an episode that has barely come together

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,440
and we've been called into duty,

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,120
much like Detective Tracy himself,

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,640
in order to discuss a TCM special

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,160
that aired on the evening of Friday, February 10th

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,400
called Dick Tracy Special, Tracy Zooms In,

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,840
joined of course by Mike Carlson, hello.

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,280
Hello, I'm here.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,480
I was in bed when I got the call that we had to do this.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,960
That's how, you know, it's like we were like on shift

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,160
at a hospital usually for podcasts the ride

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,280
and if something comes across our desk,

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
we have like a bat phone of some kind that rings

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,480
and we are, you know, shaken out of our sleep.

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, we're recording this at 3.30 AM.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,360
There was no other way to do it, no other free time.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,880
Jason Sheridan has answered the call.

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,240
Yeah, it is a pleasure to be here.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,200
Well, pleasure might be too strong a word.

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
I don't know.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,880
That isn't really what I feel.

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,920
That is just a phrase Ben Mankiewicz says in this.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,840
A quote.

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,680
Yeah.

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,960
From this immediately iconic special.

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,080
Now what's this?

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,480
Well, Mike has just slipped me a slip of paper

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,560
that says Anderson on Zoom.

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,280
Huh, interesting, wow, okay.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,400
Well, I guess we'll have to bring her in.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,440
Please welcome our resident Dick Tracy expert.

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,520
Thank God we got one.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,080
Eva Anderson, hi.

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,920
Hey guys.

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,400
Hi.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,840
That weird thing before the intro where you watched,

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,520
you listened to the previous podcast

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,420
and just sort of like said it was bad.

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,160
Was that necessary?

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,520
Do you feel like the audience didn't know

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,960
that we recorded a episode about Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,680
and you needed to let them know A, that we did it

46
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
and B, you didn't care for it?

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,560
Well, it's been a long time

48
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,120
and I think we've all gathered a lot of thoughts

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,440
about that prior episode

50
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,080
and I think we all wish that we'd been more clear,

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,560
let's say, about our points of view in said episode.

52
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,680
And remember, we own the rights to talking

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,920
about Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,520
and we need to refresh those rights every few years.

55
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,960
So that's what we were doing really, primarily.

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,320
Yeah, I feel like, I mean, that's why we kind of,

57
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,600
the calendar alert came up

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,480
and we all had to jump on Zoom real quick

59
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,280
to make sure that we are allowed to keep talking

60
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,480
about Dick Tracy for the next 15 years, right?

61
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,720
Yeah, because we have the rights to perfect it.

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,560
We got two days.

63
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,600
Okay, I'm going to really quickly run through the basics

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,960
and I wanna do it fast so that we can just dive

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,160
into pure raw analysis of the special

66
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,640
Dick Tracy special Tracy Zooms In.

67
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,640
But feel free to interrupt my list of facts here,

68
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,160
but I just wanna onboard people as quickly as we can,

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,840
though many people might be fully aware

70
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,480
of everything that's happening.

71
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,800
Okay, here we go.

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,720
Dick Tracy is a comic strip about a hardline detective

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
that began in 1931.

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,560
In 1990, actor Warren Beatty directed and starred

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,720
in a Dick Tracy feature film for the Walt Disney Company.

76
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,320
But more importantly than him making the movie in 1990,

77
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,480
the story really begins in 1985

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,000
when he obtained the film rights from Tribune Media

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,800
and he was allowed to keep those rights in perpetuity

80
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,120
provided that he could prove that he was working

81
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,040
on future projects in film or television

82
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,000
that necessitated him to have the Dick Tracy rights.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,080
In the early 2000s, since it's been a while

84
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,160
since the 1990 movie, Tribune Media gets curious,

85
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,960
like, hey, those rights that we gave you,

86
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,720
you gonna be doing anything with those?

87
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,720
And he's like, you're damn right I am.

88
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,920
I got a lot cooking and hey, don't step on the process.

89
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm taking my time.

90
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,920
Then they really ramp up the heat in like 2006.

91
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,280
What's going on?

92
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,120
When are you gonna do?

93
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,760
Actually, we're gonna write you a letter.

94
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,280
We're giving you, I didn't know all these specifics.

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,560
This is true. Mr. Beatty.

96
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,720
This is all true.

97
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,240
In 2000, this, okay, let me see.

98
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,720
I have the specific dates.

99
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
In November, okay, November 17th, 2006,

100
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,680
Tribune sent Beatty a letter that gave him two years

101
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,640
to begin production on some kind of Dick Tracy programming.

102
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,640
So on November 8th, 2008, with just like,

103
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,360
what's that, nine days to go, he,

104
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,680
Warren Beatty said, hey, guess what, Tribune,

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
I'm working on a TV special.

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,320
He gave them written notice, although it seems unclear

107
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
whether they actually got the written notice.

108
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,080
But what this did with, he was just under the deadline.

109
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
He started making a special that allowed him

110
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,680
to retain the rights, a bizarre special

111
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,200
that aired just once on TCM,

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
which I believe is just called Dick Tracy Special.

113
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,320
Now we discussed this on our Dick Tracy Crime Stoppers

114
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,040
episode a while back.

115
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,800
The basics here- Specifically, oh yeah,

116
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
it was that- Yes.

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,760
I forgot the part, because I just listened to it

118
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,240
this morning, that it was, the cinematographer

119
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,600
was the guy who did, who won three back-to-back Oscars.

120
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,960
One of the greatest- And who Mike worked with.

121
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,560
Livings, who Mike worked with,

122
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,320
who Mike was on a hand glider with.

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,160
Amazing.

124
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,320
One of the greatest cinematographers has ever,

125
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,320
like one of the most long endless shots, so innovative.

126
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,120
And he was brought in to do this special

127
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,960
that is mostly an interview with Leonard Malton

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,080
and the character Dick Tracy,

129
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,200
who in this special introduces the premise

130
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,920
that Dick Tracy is different than Warren Beatty.

131
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,920
He is a 100 year old man or more who is alive still,

132
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,840
who looks and sounds exactly like Warren Beatty,

133
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,320
but is not him.

134
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,840
And it's this special, it's mostly an interview,

135
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,520
but then there's a bunch of weird improv

136
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,240
on an empty Disney lot, poorly shot,

137
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,600
despite it being one of the best cinematographers ever.

138
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,920
There's a bunch of groundlings who all have stories

139
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,040
that don't resolve or like,

140
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
and in fact the groundlings do not return

141
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,640
in this new special that we're going to talk about.

142
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,480
They didn't feel the need to resolve the,

143
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,280
what's Mindy Sterling been up to for the last 13 years?

144
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,280
This takes us to this very week.

145
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,760
This special was only remembered by weirdos.

146
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,120
Suffer from brain rot.

147
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
And this special is one of the things

148
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,240
rotting all of our brains.

149
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,560
And we never expected there to be more of it,

150
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,840
but certainly there was the question,

151
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,560
when will Warren Beatty do more with Dick Tracy?

152
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,320
A movie perhaps?

153
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,880
No, in this case, there is suddenly

154
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,640
a weird cryptic announcement on TCM's website schedule

155
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,640
that says Dick Tracy special, Tracy zooms in.

156
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,960
And even still, it's not officially announced

157
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,920
what the hell this is.

158
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,200
And it takes Twitter sleuthing

159
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,560
to get to the business of what is this.

160
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,880
I think it was like, I saw it popularized by Will Sloan,

161
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,080
who's a writer and podcaster for the podcast Michael and Us,

162
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,000
which I like a lot.

163
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,880
Anyway, so he starts asking questions.

164
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,960
Who spotted this?

165
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,800
Yeah, like someone spotted.

166
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
I think it was maybe a follower of Will Sloan.

167
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
And then Will Sloan asked the question.

168
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,840
Basically, like there was no,

169
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,480
TCM was not going to talk about this, I don't think at all.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
And everything we're describing,

171
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,040
this has all happened really fast.

172
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,920
The special aired Friday night.

173
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,000
Thursday at lunch with friend of the show,

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
Andrew Grissom was the first that I had heard about it.

175
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,720
And again, TCM, no official,

176
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,200
it was just somebody looking at their website schedule.

177
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,520
Then a listener to this show, Chris Hayner,

178
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,160
who is also the entertainment editor at GameSpot,

179
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,280
decided to go fishing and see if TCM,

180
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,120
if I asked TCM, will they say anything,

181
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,000
he got a blurb out of them,

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,160
which confirmed the presence of Warren Beatty

183
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,720
separately from this one will include Dick Tracy

184
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,200
and Warren Beatty, Leonard Malton again,

185
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,200
and current TCM personality, wait, it's Ben Meskowitz.

186
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,240
Mankiewicz.

187
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
Mankiewicz.

188
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,280
God, why did I think it?

189
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,440
Grandfather of Mank, of Herman Mankiewicz.

190
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,280
Grandson, you mean?

191
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,120
Grandson, grandson.

192
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,520
Of the great Mank?

193
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,040
Yeah, the co-writer of Citizen Kane.

194
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,560
The grandson of the co-writer of Citizen Kane.

195
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,560
The wonderful TV personality,

196
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,040
wonderful host for Turner Classic movies.

197
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,720
Took over a lot of the work for them,

198
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,960
especially after Robert Osborn died.

199
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,240
Had been doing it for a while,

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,720
but he's doing it even more.

201
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,160
Jason, are you being really polite to him

202
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
because you desperately want his job

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,760
and you wanna pretend that you like him?

204
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,720
No, I love Ben Mankiewicz.

205
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,240
I like, I think he's terrific.

206
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,960
I love him. I like him too.

207
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,800
Yeah, I love him.

208
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,640
He's good.

209
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,600
It definitely though feels like him and Leonard Malton

210
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,000
were already at the office that day.

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,040
And they're like, you know,

212
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,320
we've got a certain amount of on-camera hours

213
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,920
in your contract and you know,

214
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,480
Wern't Beatty's calling again, so we gotta do this.

215
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,160
Well, how much heads up did they get is the question.

216
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,720
Like, has this been, like,

217
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,560
this all came together really quickly.

218
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,520
Did this, wait, they mentioned last year.

219
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,000
So we know that, that it was made in 2022.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,800
It wasn't made like last week.

221
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,320
However, it does seem like this must've come,

222
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,880
I bet it was another just under the wire,

223
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,160
a Tribune's taking the rights back on New Year's Eve.

224
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,160
So he throws this together at 8 p.m. December 31st, right?

225
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,000
How else could this have happened?

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,680
Yeah, it has to be like something like that.

227
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,800
I mean, it wouldn't be surprised me

228
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,440
if there was like shots done two days ago.

229
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,760
Mm-hmm, yeah.

230
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,640
Part of it wasn't finished until like 12 hours before it aired.

231
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
I don't know that I'm just saying

232
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,920
it wouldn't be shocking to me.

233
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,600
Real TV gets made like that often too.

234
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,440
Sure, yeah.

235
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,520
You're saying this isn't real TV?

236
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,840
Yeah, well, you're right.

237
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,320
I apologize to the special, it is real TV.

238
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,400
Just your typical rights squatting special

239
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,840
from an 85 year old man.

240
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,400
I like how that they sandwiched it

241
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,320
between old Dick Tracy movies

242
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,360
as if it was like trying to hide it all.

243
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
It feels like it was trying to hide it

244
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,120
like when you hide a dog medicine in peanut butter

245
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,960
or something.

246
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,360
Just, you know, just like shove it in there.

247
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,600
No one will notice it.

248
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,320
Hey, look, if you're the estate of Ralph Bird,

249
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,440
you're like having a banner weekend.

250
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Like I don't think even Ben Mankiewicz and Leonard Moulton

251
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,840
have thought about Ralph Bird this much.

252
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,680
Oh, Twitter searches on Ralph Bird were up.

253
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,960
I'm sure. By three,

254
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,760
by three tweets. Can I just show you guys

255
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,680
something really quick too?

256
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,600
Cause I have this photo that I was thinking about,

257
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,320
how long ago did the Dick Tracy movie come out?

258
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,160
And I have this photo from Disney Hollywood Studios,

259
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,320
which was MGM Studios at the time.

260
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,880
With my dad posing in front of his hand prints

261
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,800
in front of the Chinese theater there.

262
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,840
My brother is wearing a Dick Tracy hat, my brother Dash,

263
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,120
and I have a breathless Mahoney perm.

264
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,600
So this is 1990.

265
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,720
So that means I am nine years old and I turned 42 this year.

266
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,440
That is how long ago the Dick Tracy movie came out

267
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,000
that this special is about.

268
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,560
You were a little child.

269
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,560
And you've had what seems like a full life

270
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,480
that has not been entirely devoted to the 1990 film,

271
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Dick Tracy plus the 2010 special Dick Tracy special.

272
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,440
It seems like you have,

273
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,000
we all have lots in our lives that are not Warren Beatty

274
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,120
and this singular franchise that he owns,

275
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,000
which puts us on the outside as viewers because the viewer,

276
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,640
the ideal viewer of the special has done nothing

277
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,920
but think about Dick Tracy ever since.

278
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,800
And we all record the podcast.

279
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,400
The ideal viewer of this special is in this special

280
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,600
and playing two roles in this special.

281
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,600
But the other ideal viewer is us

282
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,960
because we recorded like two hours

283
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,200
on the movie and the special.

284
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,000
And yet I cannot, unless I had rewatched

285
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,160
and listened to our podcast again,

286
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,480
I couldn't have told you that he ate pomegranates.

287
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,680
Yeah, pomegranates so far out of my mind.

288
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,560
I watched the special the day of to remember what it was.

289
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,400
And if you, and listener,

290
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,960
if you don't know what we're talking about,

291
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,280
it's this like pretty obscure detail of small talk

292
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,360
between Leonard Malden and Dick Tracy.

293
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,200
And then the special just opens right on pomegranates.

294
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,360
I eat pomegranates.

295
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,560
I see the secret to my beauty is pomegranates.

296
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,400
And it really like requires such a vast knowledge

297
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,880
of a special that aired one time

298
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,640
and wasn't internet popular till a few years ago

299
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,000
and still isn't popular.

300
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,480
The view count is not high on this.

301
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm losing popularity very lightly,

302
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,880
but you have to let, you have to know this

303
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,720
in the way that like you remember last week's

304
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,400
Better Call Saul so that you get all the detail

305
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,480
of the finale, you know what I mean?

306
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,320
Yeah.

307
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,160
It's only from 13 years ago.

308
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,040
And they didn't do a previously on,

309
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,720
which they should have.

310
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,840
No, kind of.

311
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,720
They show little, they show little snippets.

312
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,760
Maybe that is the idea.

313
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,600
Like that's their, that's kind of their previously on.

314
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,440
There's 10 minutes of the old special in this.

315
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,200
Yeah.

316
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,640
It's like, it's like, is it Better Call Saul?

317
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,360
They just spent 15 minutes talking about the other episode.

318
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,720
And it's a 27 minute special.

319
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,560
Yeah.

320
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,560
It's, when it was on,

321
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,120
Jane and I watched it Friday night when it was on,

322
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,800
but here's how kind of quick it was.

323
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,760
We were at a bar for happy hour around the corner

324
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,280
and we picked up some food and we brought it back

325
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,520
to her place, watched the special

326
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,040
and ate the food while we were watching.

327
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,400
And then went, it's only been a few,

328
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,720
do you want to go back to the bar?

329
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,880
Yeah, yeah, let's do that.

330
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,280
Like it was all within the span of an hour,

331
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,440
that whole process.

332
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,520
Jason, just to recap,

333
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,560
the last time we talked about one of these specials

334
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,800
on the previous podcast, you said it, the previous podcast,

335
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,600
you said the previous special took the amount of time

336
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,480
it takes to eat a club sandwich.

337
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,680
Which made me laugh out loud.

338
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,600
This time it was the amount of time

339
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,880
to eat a cheese enchilada platter.

340
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,800
So just a couple of little things as we keep diving in,

341
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,040
this Chris Hayner contact,

342
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,720
my Twitter discussion with him,

343
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,760
so he said, I found out what the special is, great.

344
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,400
Now places can post articles about it, whatever.

345
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
And I asked him, so if you hadn't talked to TCM,

346
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,120
they never would have mentioned this to anyone.

347
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,880
And he responded, it sure seems that way.

348
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,760
That's how much contractual obligation,

349
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,960
like what if it hadn't been found?

350
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,440
What if whoever it was, if it was the Will Sloan commenter,

351
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,480
this could have been lost forever

352
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,160
or not found out about for like six years from now.

353
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,600
It's clear that TCM doesn't care about this

354
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,440
and is embarrassed, maybe embarrassed by it.

355
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,680
But I wanna know like, do they owe Warren Beatty a debt?

356
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,880
If you're in the AFI 100,

357
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,400
do you have like, is TCM obligated

358
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,160
to put anything you produce on their channel?

359
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,360
That's my question.

360
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,560
Cause why wouldn't you promote like Warren Beatty

361
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,320
who doesn't actually do a lot of stuff?

362
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,960
He's not in like, of all the like famous actors,

363
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,520
he doesn't, he hasn't made that many movies.

364
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,920
He's said that before.

365
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,760
Why wouldn't you-

366
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,240
Is this his first appearance anywhere

367
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,360
since the Oscar envelope debacle?

368
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,720
I think, or maybe an interview?

369
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,600
Well, like 2000, his filmography since 2001

370
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,960
is the Howard Hughes movie and these two specials.

371
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,160
Right, right, yes.

372
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,640
20 years.

373
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,480
So why wouldn't you think if you were TCM,

374
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,040
you're like, we have new Warren Beatty content.

375
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,120
Let's put an ad somewhere.

376
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,800
I'm gonna throw this out there.

377
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
I think this is TCM fucked up

378
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,680
because I think this is awesome

379
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,160
and they should have promoted it.

380
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,840
And the fact that like nerds like found it is on TCM

381
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,600
cause I feel like, I don't know,

382
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,080
this is kind of a fun thing.

383
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,560
But also it wouldn't have been as special

384
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,800
if they'd promoted it, that like everyone spotted it

385
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,960
and was like, look what he's doing.

386
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,800
I like that it was like a treasure hunt

387
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
that everybody had to go on.

388
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,480
Yeah, everyone got to go on.

389
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,720
It was really exciting, like 24 hours.

390
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,680
Trying to tell people, explain it to people on set

391
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,080
that like A, the contextual thing

392
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,360
that Warren Beatty has to do every 15 years,

393
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
B, it's happening tonight.

394
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,680
We won't be able to watch it

395
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,480
cause we are filming a TV show.

396
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,760
But my friends might tell me what happens in it.

397
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,880
And a handful of people got very excited.

398
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,480
The thing is, now that it's happened twice,

399
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,600
they should like just make it a TV show of some kind.

400
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,200
Like this should be the pitch to Warren of like,

401
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,720
it's you as Dick Tracy and you're just mad

402
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,920
that the movie didn't do well.

403
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,600
You have to show up for 10 minutes here and there.

404
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,040
And you just like have lunches with people

405
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,240
and in your big yellow coat.

406
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,720
Like there's no re, now it's two things is like a pattern.

407
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,200
You know, the first one was an anomaly.

408
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Now where we've got something consistent here,

409
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,440
they should embrace this as the only place

410
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,160
you can see new Warren Beatty stuff, content.

411
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,560
Isn't Dick Tracy IP stealing content?

412
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,240
Yes, IP, you could call it.

413
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,480
The other counterpoint,

414
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay, go ahead, go ahead.

415
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,880
If he follows the pattern,

416
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,480
the next special he will be 100 years old.

417
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,320
He is 85, currently 88.

418
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,600
And speaking of 80 year olds, I wrote down,

419
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,800
what is Shirley McClain, his sister, think of all this.

420
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,160
And forget about that.

421
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,480
What is Annette Benning think about all this?

422
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,200
Shirley McClain is his sister?

423
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,040
Yeah.

424
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,880
You didn't know that?

425
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,280
No, I didn't know that.

426
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,680
Scott, you need to listen to more Ben Menkowitz.

427
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,320
I guess so, I didn't know his name either.

428
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,040
Annette Benning is 20 years younger than him.

429
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,920
I didn't realize that, but.

430
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,560
Yeah, I would guess that maybe both of them

431
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,000
don't have any idea what this is.

432
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,120
He disappeared for like two days and they're like,

433
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,560
Oh yeah, he must be doing one of his little projects.

434
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,560
He filmed it on Zoom and then he went to the Polo Lounge,

435
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,040
which he probably goes there.

436
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,320
It's one of the four places he goes.

437
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,360
Yeah, that's gotta be like his booth too.

438
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,760
So we probably can go like talk to him

439
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,480
in that booth at the Polo Lounge.

440
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,320
We know how to find him.

441
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,160
Right.

442
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Well, which, you had the notion that maybe the four of us

443
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,240
should find him and go pitch ourselves

444
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,640
as the creative team of Dick Tracy too.

445
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,480
Well, I thought that and then I watched the special

446
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,040
and I don't know what he wants.

447
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,200
Like, here's my big question.

448
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,760
It's like, what the fuck does he want?

449
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,160
Like that, cause the first one was pretty clear.

450
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,560
It was like, he was being kind of witty.

451
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Like, okay, the first special, basically he created

452
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,120
this divide between Warren Beatty and Dick Tracy.

453
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,480
And we talked about this in the last special,

454
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,760
but that Dick Tracy is basically like a fascist.

455
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,440
He liked J. Edgar Hoover.

456
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,800
He thought that Warren Beatty was a pinko

457
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,120
and he was like, I and I like law and order.

458
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,560
So it's like, it's kind of a funny thing to do

459
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,800
to say like this character, we talked about this,

460
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,080
the character that I want to do more movies with

461
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,520
is I'm now defining him as a fascist,

462
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,320
who I would not agree with his politics in life,

463
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,120
which is weird because you played him in the movie

464
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,160
and he is the hero.

465
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,720
And also, but it's also weird re-watching Dick Tracy.

466
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Like Dick Tracy is a very boring character.

467
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,080
Everyone else is the fun part.

468
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,800
So what do you do with Dick Tracy?

469
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,760
You make him a weird fascist?

470
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,160
Okay, Warren Beatty.

471
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,640
So you're trying to make the argument

472
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
that you should make more of these movies.

473
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,320
That's why you're retaining the IP

474
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,480
so no one else can have it.

475
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,880
So this next special, he really comes out

476
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,400
Dick Tracy hates the movie Dick Tracy.

477
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,640
He hates it.

478
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,480
He hates it.

479
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,320
It was not as clear.

480
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
And his whole thing about like,

481
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,920
I should have been more clear before.

482
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,600
Yeah, it's much edgier than the prior.

483
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,520
He's watching clips of it and he does not like it.

484
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,640
He hates it.

485
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,600
Yeah.

486
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,120
Dick Tracy does not at all like dramatic interpretation,

487
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,080
but I think he might like my pitch

488
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,200
because even going off your thing that he's a fascist,

489
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,840
thinking about other very popular fascists,

490
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,000
they should make a Dark Knight Returns Dick Tracy

491
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,640
where Dick Tracy is old and grizzled

492
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,320
like the old beat up Bruce Wayne Batman in the comic.

493
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,680
Yeah, but that's still fun.

494
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,800
I don't disagree with you.

495
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,400
But that still has big, fun, colorful characters,

496
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,200
which Warren, Dick is saying no to.

497
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,560
He doesn't like that about Dick Tracy.

498
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,400
Yes.

499
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,560
Here's the thing that made me go like, what is happening?

500
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,200
I get like he doesn't like the pink street.

501
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,080
Okay.

502
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,440
He doesn't like breathless Mahoney

503
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,040
like crawling across the desk because that's very horny.

504
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,720
That's a Madonna jab is how I took it.

505
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,560
Yeah, that was his girlfriend.

506
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,120
Because they were an item and then they, yeah, yeah.

507
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,560
That felt like very targeted.

508
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,360
But here's the part where I was like, what are we doing?

509
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,240
When they showed Little Face

510
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,400
and he goes, I wouldn't have made that choice.

511
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,120
So here's my question.

512
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,880
Is Little Face a person that Dick Tracy the man arrested?

513
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,800
And if so, what does he look like in real life

514
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,720
that that is not what he looked like?

515
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,560
Like.

516
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,120
Oh yeah.

517
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,520
I think that, here's my theory on the whole thing.

518
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,600
I think that Warren has a lot of free time

519
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,320
and a lot of his free time has taken up

520
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,120
being mad that Dick Tracy wasn't as popular

521
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
as all their superhero movies.

522
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,320
And he probably caught like Batman Begins on TV,

523
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,000
like let's say like seven years ago, way after it came out.

524
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,280
And he goes, maybe this is why the Dick Tracy movie wasn't.

525
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,040
It should have been more like this, not the colorful.

526
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,600
Like I think that that Dick Tracy rant in this special

527
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,040
is Warren's inner monologue for why he thinks

528
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,400
the first Dick Tracy wasn't a success.

529
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,080
That's my guess. Interesting.

530
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,560
But. So between the two specials,

531
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,440
cause did those movies come out between the two specials

532
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,440
basically like the pivot to dark?

533
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,240
Dark Knight was 2007.

534
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,440
It's probably before the first special.

535
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
But again, I think he caught it on TV somewhere.

536
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,720
That's my guess.

537
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,840
The TNT.

538
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,120
Yeah, he was watching it on TNT.

539
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,040
In 2018 or something.

540
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,440
And he goes, that's what it was.

541
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,280
Now it doesn't, but now you're right.

542
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,000
There's a contradiction because there's,

543
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,560
Dick Tracy is wearing a big yellow coat.

544
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,800
He's wearing the colorful outfit,

545
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,920
but he shouldn't be if now he,

546
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,640
Warren is trying to retcon Dick Tracy as a real character,

547
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,120
get rid of all the fun from the comic strip.

548
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,720
Dick Tracy should have been in like a regular,

549
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,760
like gray trench coat or something.

550
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,680
Yeah. Why is he wearing the yellow?

551
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,560
He hates the pink street, but he's wearing the yellow hat.

552
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,960
Well, Mankiewicz points that out.

553
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,200
Like he even steps outside of this

554
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,080
and like almost disagrees with Dick Tracy

555
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,360
in the intro to the, before it even starts,

556
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,400
he's like, he's going to complain about the colors

557
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,880
in the movie, even though he does it

558
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,800
wearing the yellow trench coat.

559
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,320
Yeah. He couldn't hold back.

560
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,480
Dick Tracy also goes to great pains

561
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,840
to compliment the makeup work and the set design.

562
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,560
So he's not disparaging any of the craftsmen.

563
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,800
Right. Who were that?

564
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Maybe the only Oscar nominees besides Sondheim

565
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,440
for the movie.

566
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,680
I believe that's right. Winners even.

567
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,440
Three Oscars won by this movie.

568
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,280
I will say that one thing I really,

569
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,520
I found winning about this special is the complete,

570
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,560
how completely upset and baffled Leonard Malton

571
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,080
and Ben Mankiewicz were throughout.

572
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,440
They were pretty good. Yeah.

573
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,280
They were funny.

574
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,440
Like they just seemed like they were playing the game

575
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,680
with being like, what are we doing?

576
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,040
And like committing to it.

577
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,080
And like the intro by Ben Mankiewicz being like,

578
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,680
basically his intro was like, what are we doing?

579
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
I think the intro by far with,

580
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,560
when Ben is alone is the best part of the special.

581
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,400
Yes.

582
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,040
I had hoped that the special was going to be fun there.

583
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,000
I had a couple, there was a couple of minutes where I went,

584
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,800
oh, maybe this will be kind of fun,

585
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,240
even in like in the way the old one was.

586
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,240
And then as soon as everything else joined,

587
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,120
it was not good.

588
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,280
It was not fun.

589
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,200
The idea of like showing, showing the Dick Tracy movie

590
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,120
and then having a little tiny box of Dick Tracy going,

591
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,960
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

592
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,080
Like that is so, it reminds me of like,

593
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,880
did you guys ever watch the commentary

594
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
of trapped in the closet?

595
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,640
No.

596
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,800
R. Kelly's trapped in the closet?

597
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,760
Yeah, R. Kelly sat on a couch

598
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,120
in front of trapped in the closet.

599
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,320
And then he would turn back to the camera and say like,

600
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,840
this is the part where I go in the closet.

601
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,680
He just.

602
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
That's it?

603
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,680
That's the insane.

604
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,040
Like one of history's greatest monsters,

605
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,200
I would say like absolutely watch it

606
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,600
because it's very, very funny.

607
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,080
Because it's, all he has to contribute is like,

608
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,960
oh, guess what happens next?

609
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,320
Oh, this part is great.

610
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,920
Like he's just watching it as if he's never,

611
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,480
he didn't record or write the music

612
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,560
or like film all the music videos himself.

613
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,800
Ooh, everybody shut up.

614
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,840
This is a good part.

615
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,800
Yeah, he's basically doing that alone on a couch.

616
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,280
Kind of like mystery science theater.

617
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,480
Oh, well, I, yeah, it's so much of that

618
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,520
already short runtime is just Ben and Leonard are silent

619
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,840
and kind of looking befuddled and confused

620
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,080
while a little Warren, I'm sorry, a little Dick Tracy

621
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,440
watches old clips and goes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

622
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
no, no, no.

623
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,360
And then they switched to clips of the old ones

624
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,800
with actors whose names no one has said out loud

625
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,440
in the last 50 years.

626
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,440
We watched black and white clips and he says, yes, yes.

627
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,560
And even then like way deep into it,

628
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,640
he just says their names again, like, yes, Morgan Conway,

629
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,120
Ralph Byrd, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

630
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,760
Around this point, well, this is around the point

631
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,680
where Eva, you and I have something in common,

632
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,000
which is spouses who were not having it,

633
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,880
who were like, fuck this shit.

634
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,200
Yeah, I started trying to explain to my husband, John,

635
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
in the morning, I was like,

636
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,920
there's this thing happening with Dick Tracy.

637
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,920
He just was like, I can't, whatever this is.

638
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,720
I showed him a screenshot, he's like,

639
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,640
you're on your own, basically.

640
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,000
Erin was delighted by the idea of it

641
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,600
and all day we were talking about it.

642
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,680
And then the actuality of what the special was

643
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,480
as we enter like minute 20 of, yes, yes, Morgan Conway,

644
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,720
yes, she's like, I'm going to bed, I can't,

645
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,200
it's been a long day, sleep is better than this.

646
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,000
I mean, let these family watch it.

647
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,800
You did?

648
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,480
Well, they were in the living room

649
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,600
and the TV's in the living room.

650
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,240
And I said, and they weren't watching anything,

651
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,240
so I didn't burst in and change the channel,

652
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,640
but I said, oh, there's a thing I have to watch.

653
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,240
And then they were like, well, what is it?

654
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,960
And I was like, well, Warren Beatty is dead.

655
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,120
And I explained the whole thing.

656
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,440
And I don't know that they kind of got what I was saying,

657
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,600
but they were just like, yeah,

658
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,880
they were polite the whole time,

659
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,920
but they were like, what is this?

660
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,680
We had a nice time

661
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,280
because we were both buzzed and a little stoned.

662
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,880
He was like, I don't know what this is.

663
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,520
It was 30 minutes long, so it didn't really matter.

664
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,360
Like I said, we just went back out after the interview.

665
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,440
I love that.

666
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,280
Yeah.

667
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,400
In terms of the point that he's trying to make,

668
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,640
this notion of the movie,

669
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,520
if he's been wrestling in his head all this time,

670
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,040
which the movie should have been more serious,

671
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,520
and that was the problem.

672
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,240
And then he's listing all of the things.

673
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,040
All the things he says, no, no, no,

674
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,280
are like, it's very bright colors.

675
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
The streets are pink.

676
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,680
He hates the pink streets.

677
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,080
The prosthetics on the characters of the real men

678
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,760
that he arrested, knocking out seven guys with one punch.

679
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,120
He hates that. It's an exciting thing.

680
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,280
It's in a lot of clips.

681
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,640
That's the, like, everything in his list

682
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,440
is everything I like about the movie.

683
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,400
The movie that, I don't know.

684
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,200
I feel like I maybe held back

685
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,480
when we talked about it before.

686
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,760
I'm just gonna be honest here.

687
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,360
I think 1990 Dick Tracy is boring.

688
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,720
I think it is like a weird, dull,

689
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,640
I think it's interesting that it exists,

690
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,040
but all the stuff that I like is everything in the list

691
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,000
of what he wishes he hadn't done.

692
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,840
The aesthetics.

693
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,280
All the Oscars were won by the makeup

694
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,800
and the musical numbers

695
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,640
and all the things he wishes were out of there.

696
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,920
And Big Boy. So what is this new version

697
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,320
and Big Boy? And Big Boy.

698
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,800
Well, it is like if he makes the gritty Dick Tracy,

699
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
that's everything that is interesting

700
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,680
about original Dick Tracy gone.

701
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,760
But it is like- What does he mean?

702
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,160
This would be a horrible idea.

703
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,800
It's crazy. Yes, it's crazy.

704
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,040
What is he talking about?

705
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,600
Cause like, it's like Batman.

706
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,200
Batman was like, yeah, they're not telling my story right.

707
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,080
Look at that stupid costume I wear

708
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,360
and the villains with the Joker didn't have makeup

709
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,600
and he was a man named Burt.

710
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,720
Why are they portraying my life like this?

711
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,280
I didn't have a cave.

712
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,120
I had an office.

713
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,520
What are you doing?

714
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,400
Like it doesn't, why is he?

715
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,240
Yeah.

716
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,920
But that's, so I, cause Lindsay was in the room.

717
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,080
She left the room to deal with the baby at a certain point.

718
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Her family watched the whole thing with me.

719
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,560
She didn't watch the whole thing, but she goes,

720
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,640
is maybe, I think Warren is going to sort of refute Dick

721
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,960
at the end of this long rant

722
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,040
about what the movie should have been.

723
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,000
And then it did not happen.

724
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,800
Warren agreed with Dick at the end of the rant.

725
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,400
He said, okay, you're right.

726
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,760
And then they went to the Polo Lounge.

727
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,680
Yes, he was like, yeah, the movie was bad

728
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,120
and I should have done a better job,

729
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,640
which is an insane pitch to make future Dick Tracy's, right?

730
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,880
Yes, that's what Scott was saying.

731
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,960
The rights holder saying, I did a bad job.

732
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Everything that's fun and iconic about Dick Tracy is bad,

733
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,400
should be stripped from future versions of it.

734
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,640
Yeah, so what are you doing?

735
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,160
I'm just going to toss this out there.

736
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,440
Mr. Beatty, if you're feeling a little bummed

737
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,000
or a little lonely and you want someone

738
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,720
to watch old movies with, I'll come over and hang out, okay?

739
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,560
Yeah.

740
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,400
That's why you're looking for him.

741
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,000
Jason, no, it's a trap, Jason.

742
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,840
Don't go to Warren's movies, no.

743
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,080
I want to hear all your old stories about,

744
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,960
you know, Barbadies was a big collaborator.

745
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,880
He collaborated with any number of starlets

746
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,440
for decades and decades.

747
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,400
You know, Mr. Beatty, if you need someone

748
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,600
to tell your long old boring stories with,

749
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,000
I will hang out with you.

750
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,440
The clip was about collaborating too,

751
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,560
that one Dick Tracy over.

752
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,320
Yes, collaboration.

753
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
I will say this, Mr. Dick Tracy,

754
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,960
I'm willing to hang out with you

755
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,840
and listen to everything you have to say

756
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,400
and your thoughts on media and your own story,

757
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,840
your own life's work.

758
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,480
Warren Beatty, I'm not interested, but Dick, I am.

759
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,600
Dick Tracy, I don't think Dick Tracy

760
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,680
has ever used his genitals in any way.

761
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
I think, wait, Junior is his kid, right?

762
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,640
So that means he must have, but he's like never,

763
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,000
I think Dick Tracy has not like

764
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,280
actively chased sexual pleasure.

765
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,120
He's too conservative for that.

766
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,400
Well, he's completely baffled in the movie

767
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,400
by all the women who want to have sex with him,

768
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,640
including like Madonna like crawling around

769
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,160
like with her butt in the air.

770
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,240
But he stays with his current girl.

771
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Test. He doesn't, yeah,

772
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,440
he doesn't give into temptation in the movie.

773
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,160
But yes, I don't know that,

774
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,520
I don't know if maybe that's a different,

775
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,960
I don't know, does he want him to be less sexually active

776
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,720
in a future Dick Tracy or more?

777
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,360
I don't know, he didn't address that.

778
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,800
I think less if he hated Madonna on the desk.

779
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,640
Yeah.

780
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,440
So the Dick Tracy that was being pitched to us

781
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,920
in terms of keeping the IP as an 85 year old Dick Tracy.

782
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,240
Plus, because it would take two to 87 year old Dick Tracy,

783
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,240
no fun colors, no fun makeup, no, no,

784
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,600
you can't punch seven guys.

785
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,160
No sex, no Sondheim, no stunts.

786
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,720
Let's all say together about the most important thing.

787
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,560
Yes.

788
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,400
Tree.

789
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,240
A crime.

790
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,080
Crime.

791
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,920
Crime.

792
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,760
Seriously.

793
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,600
Seriously.

794
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,680
Seriously.

795
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,360
He wants to get out the message that crime

796
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,320
does not pay.

797
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,720
Can you imagine a Dick Tracy?

798
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,840
Okay, so here's the thing too.

799
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,280
We all read through that list of like bad guys

800
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,960
that Dick Tracy met.

801
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,800
Oh yeah.

802
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,800
Are they,

803
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,040
so we have to seriously deal with all those guys

804
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,040
like in a movie like Mughead or like Flat Top or whatever.

805
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,040
Like be like, this is a real guy.

806
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,960
He like is a rapist.

807
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,240
And he like, were we gonna treat like SVU?

808
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,600
Like there's like, we're doing like DNA shit.

809
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,200
And like, we're like, oh, there's like,

810
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,480
this woman's traumatized and like Flat Top did it.

811
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,880
And like, we're like,

812
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,920
I just think he's like quietly sitting with like a victim

813
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,560
and then like, what are we talking about?

814
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,920
Like what does he want?

815
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,760
I found Prune Face's semen.

816
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,040
I kept watching, I kept yelling, what do you want?

817
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,560
The DNA evidence.

818
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,000
I've got Prune Face's semen right here.

819
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,840
We got it.

820
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,920
Tent to rights.

821
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,880
Prune Face, use his real name, Leonard.

822
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,120
The whole thing reminds me of, I guess I want to pitch a,

823
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,640
while we're here, just a club three episode

824
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,840
about, I'll put it in the chat,

825
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,320
but there's a Kirk Douglas,

826
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,120
Huffington Post editorial from 2014 called,

827
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,920
will technology replace thinking?

828
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,360
And I'm gonna put it in the chat.

829
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,560
And I feel like you guys could do a full episode

830
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,000
on this editorial that a very old Kirk Douglas wrote

831
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,560
in Huffington Post about how he's worried

832
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,080
technology will replace thinking.

833
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,920
It's so short.

834
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,080
It's the Tracy Zooms in of articles.

835
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,920
But it's something I think about often.

836
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,920
I don't think it's a spoiler to say the last sentence is,

837
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,520
watch where you're going.

838
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,120
But how does it get there?

839
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,120
You'll have to listen to the club three to find out.

840
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:07,120
Can I, something that happens kind of leads to catharsis

841
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,400
and reunion at the end of the special.

842
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,400
But I question the premise that the, hold on,

843
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,400
the Polo Lounge didn't pass on a message from Warren B.

844
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,320
The Polo Lounge, the staff of the Polo Lounge

845
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,920
would never drop the ball like that, okay?

846
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,760
This is like a-

847
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,600
They're pros.

848
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,440
Yeah, they're pros.

849
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,280
This is an institution for many decades.

850
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,480
Somebody would be fired if that didn't happen.

851
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,320
Yeah.

852
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,080
But then Dick Tracy says, let's not talk about that.

853
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,120
Dick Tracy says, let's not talk about that.

854
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,320
So he did get the message.

855
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,320
I think that's, he's lying.

856
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,240
Dick Tracy, for the first time in his entire life,

857
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,000
lies about not getting the message at the Polo Lounge.

858
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,840
This is like, and it's set up that end

859
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,960
where they agree to meet, it feels like old friends

860
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,160
or old lovers reconciling.

861
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,040
And it's like, let's just get together

862
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,920
and see if the fire's still there, you know?

863
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,600
And also it's completely silent

864
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,320
because there's just a Madonna song playing over it, right?

865
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,760
I feel like it's not Madonna.

866
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,280
I think it's one of the Sondheims,

867
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,520
but it's not like the one that won the Oscar or-

868
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,520
No, it's one of the ones from the album I'm Breathless.

869
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,360
Okay, okay.

870
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,360
Which is, has additional Breathless Mahoney style songs.

871
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,240
Sondheim gets the credit.

872
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,080
It is a Madonna song, which is funny

873
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,080
because he's mean to her as Dick Tracy being like,

874
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,720
no, no, no, no, no.

875
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,520
But then he's like, I gotta get Madonna a little royalty

876
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,640
on my special, so I'll play the song

877
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,640
over the Polo Lounge single shot of the two of us

878
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,720
just kind of like talking.

879
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,800
Oh man, I wonder what he was saying in that shot.

880
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,640
Yeah.

881
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,840
Just to explain it,

882
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,480
the majority of the special, well, first it's like,

883
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,000
it's Ben and Leonard watching the old interview

884
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,400
because like, Dick Tracy called me.

885
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,240
He wants to do another one of these things.

886
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,640
Then they all are on a Zoom,

887
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,640
a Zoom that is filmed with the same cameras

888
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,440
that the narrative part of the special was.

889
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,760
And Ben and Leonard are on separate windows,

890
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,600
even though they're right next to each other on one couch.

891
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,720
And then Warren Beatty joins the call.

892
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,520
So now we're looking at four windows

893
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,360
for like seven straight minutes

894
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,600
and two windows of the same man.

895
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,720
So the majority of it is this

896
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,480
just one big Zoom-esque conversation.

897
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,680
But then when they find common ground and agree to meet

898
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,840
and talk about Dick Tracy returns a potential new project,

899
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,040
then it cuts to the two of them

900
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,560
a dazzling split screen effect

901
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,200
as they're having a lunch together

902
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
at presumably the Polo Lounge.

903
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,400
But we don't get to hear it.

904
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,680
There's a song over it.

905
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,360
And they are talking and talking.

906
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,920
And if you watch it, the second time I realized,

907
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,320
it's not that one of them talks

908
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,440
and then the other one talks.

909
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,920
The two of them are talking continuously over each other.

910
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,520
It's not a back and forth.

911
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,320
It's just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

912
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,720
all of them at the same time.

913
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,840
Because they're so excited to reconcile, okay,

914
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,200
over, if you notice, if you notice,

915
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,560
Warren Beatty seems to be eating a salad,

916
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,360
Dick Tracy opting for a sandwich and fries,

917
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,880
and neither of them have drank any of their water.

918
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,480
Those are full glasses of water.

919
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,720
Jason always very, very noticing if people are hydrated.

920
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,400
When people start drinking water.

921
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,760
Dick Tracy eating French fries.

922
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,160
That doesn't sound like the all American detective I know.

923
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,600
Annette, let me order the fries for the shoot.

924
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,840
Well, no, no, Annette let Dick Tracy order the fries.

925
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,400
He knows that he should have something lighter.

926
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,920
Pomegranates, pomegranates.

927
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,840
Pomegranates, pomegranates.

928
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,400
But what are they talking about?

929
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,800
That is a good question.

930
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
Is this excitement, is this agree?

931
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,360
They both still have,

932
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,760
I think he's only capable of like a scowl.

933
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,560
There's only so much smile you can get out of

934
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,400
Warren Beatty or Dick Tracy.

935
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,960
So is it an argument?

936
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,400
Does this imply that they're just back to square one

937
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,640
or do you think they're brainstorming a lot of great ideas

938
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,920
for a more gritty Dick Tracy returns?

939
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,240
Here's something that bummed me out.

940
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,640
Can I throw this out there?

941
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,600
Cause like in the screenshots that everyone's sharing,

942
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,880
Warren Beatty does look very old.

943
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,280
But in like life, like when he was actually speaking,

944
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,200
I was like, why isn't Warren Beatty in like a movie a year?

945
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,880
Like he was like charming and fun, like a little bit

946
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,520
where like he could absolutely,

947
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,280
he should have been in like Babylon or something.

948
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,520
Like he should have,

949
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,680
he should be in like a Paul Thomas Anderson movie

950
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,120
doing one little scene, being like a little weirdo.

951
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,320
Like what's going on?

952
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,800
Like why haven't we seen Warren Beatty for 20 years?

953
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,680
It did bum me out a little bit.

954
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,520
I think he just doesn't do anything.

955
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,320
It doesn't, isn't the story that he wanted to play

956
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,160
Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights

957
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,280
and didn't want to play the Burt Reynolds role.

958
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,120
But he goes very from that to immediate retirement.

959
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,280
Like if I can't be Dirk Diggler and you can't see me anymore,

960
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,720
like that's wild.

961
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,880
Cause I feel like he could have like an elder statesman

962
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,680
thing going on where like,

963
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,040
he could be like Christopher Plummer or whatever,

964
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,320
like showing up like in like weird little roles.

965
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,600
Cause I was like, oh, he looks pretty good.

966
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,600
And like he is funny and you know, he's a little bit slow,

967
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,640
but like I would absolutely watch him in some weird,

968
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,640
some weird Oscar movie role, you know.

969
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,400
He could have easily done the Sean Penn role

970
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,880
in Licorice Pizza, that one scene role.

971
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,040
Yeah, he would have had a blast.

972
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,280
So I wonder what's going on.

973
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Well, can I propose the theory that he is a giant pain

974
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,480
in the ass who if you've ever met him,

975
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,320
you don't ever want to see him again.

976
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,960
Do we think that is possible?

977
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,000
Yeah, probably.

978
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,400
No one's like knocking bang on his door being like,

979
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,800
Warren, please.

980
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,760
More of this.

981
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,360
As soon as he doesn't have control,

982
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,520
he's like, doesn't want to do it.

983
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,760
I think maybe, being the most of what he's done,

984
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,080
including these specials are written and directed by him.

985
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,000
They did that at 55, he was like, I'm Dirk Diggler.

986
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,640
It's like, no.

987
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,800
Here's my question.

988
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,400
Do you think if he was hooked up to a lie detector,

989
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,000
he believes he's going to make another Dick Tracy

990
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,040
or is it more so that he just doesn't want to see

991
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,560
somebody else make a big hit out of a Dick Tracy movie?

992
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,680
Well, that's my question is like,

993
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,960
what does he picture when he thinks about the Dick Tracy?

994
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,440
He's stopping.

995
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,920
Yeah.

996
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,840
What does he think it is?

997
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,360
Right.

998
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,480
Is it Mark Wahlberg?

999
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,080
Does he know who Mark Wahlberg is?

1000
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,280
Well, it's the guy who stole Dirk Diggler from him.

1001
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,080
That's your right.

1002
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,040
He'll never forget him.

1003
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,960
I was saying, I think that he's probably at home to Annette.

1004
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,920
He's talking about like, if I see one of these young gun

1005
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,040
assholes playing Tracy, one of these upstarts like Richard

1006
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,280
Gere, I swear to God.

1007
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,600
I have to say, I always liked Warren Beatty in A Spry.

1008
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,640
I think he was a great actor, very charming.

1009
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,960
But Annette Bening's film, she is so good.

1010
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,600
Is she just like, oh, god, well, I've tied my boat to this doc.

1011
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,280
I'm stuck with this lunatic.

1012
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,520
Jason and I did the screen drafts of Noir.

1013
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,440
My number one pick was The Grifters,

1014
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,040
specifically because Annette Bening is so cool in that movie.

1015
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,000
That's from 1990, right around the time

1016
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,560
she got hooked by Warren Beatty.

1017
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,440
Yeah.

1018
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,040
Detective Tracy.

1019
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,600
I think he was really.

1020
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,520
Oh, the same year.

1021
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,320
The same year.

1022
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,240
Oh, my god.

1023
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,400
Simultaneous movies.

1024
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,800
Oh, my god.

1025
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
I love it.

1026
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,080
Universally well-reviewed, I feel like, The Grifters.

1027
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,920
Oh, great movie.

1028
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,360
Have you guys ever seen it?

1029
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,440
Very dark, a little intense in some part.

1030
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,800
But I feel like the review is kind of universally positive.

1031
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,440
And she got Oscar nomination for it.

1032
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,240
And she is just the hottest thing in the entire universe

1033
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,000
in that movie.

1034
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,200
It's just like, if you were Warren Beatty,

1035
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,960
what's the number one lady?

1036
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,120
I feel like right now you'd be like, Sydney Sweeney.

1037
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,120
And then it was like, Annette Bening.

1038
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,400
Who's the lady of the year?

1039
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,120
It's like, specifically this lady in this movie.

1040
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,920
Florence Pugh, starring in a new Warren Beatty movie.

1041
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,360
Just constantly outsmarting him with Annette.

1042
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,280
Like, just constantly trapping Warren Beatty

1043
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,360
with a box propped up by a stick.

1044
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,360
It's funny how you said Annette.

1045
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,160
Annette.

1046
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,000
Yes, oh yeah.

1047
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,160
Annette, as opposed to Annette.

1048
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,080
No, no, I meant an actual Annette.

1049
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,920
But I'm imagining that he thought,

1050
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,120
oh, her name is also a thing that could trap me,

1051
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,960
so I must.

1052
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,600
I'll get ahead of it.

1053
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,520
I'll marry her and then she can't trap me in her name.

1054
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,040
I will acquiesce to monogamy.

1055
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,640
I think he was really sowing his oats before Annette,

1056
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,520
the person, not the Annette.

1057
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,840
Well, I mean, famously with Madonna while making the movie,

1058
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,640
he wanted Shawn Young to be Tez Trueheart,

1059
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,840
but then he hit on her and she left.

1060
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,640
And then during the editing, I read that he,

1061
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,760
apparently he was like, just always holed up

1062
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,520
in the editing room, always locked in the editing room.

1063
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,360
And I don't mean he was editing.

1064
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,920
Apparently that was where he was fucking everybody,

1065
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,720
was in the editing room.

1066
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,960
And the editors would have to wait outside the editing room

1067
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,160
until he was done.

1068
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,920
Was there a bed in the editing room?

1069
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,160
Why, he has nowhere to go?

1070
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,440
Go to the Polo Lounge.

1071
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,360
Why do you have to be in the editing room?

1072
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,400
The Polo Lounge attached to a hotel.

1073
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,080
Yes, Warren, you know how hotels work.

1074
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,920
Is that why?

1075
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,040
Maybe it's the thrill of the waste of time.

1076
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,640
I'm wasting Disney's money as I have sex next

1077
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,120
to this analog editing machine.

1078
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,480
Look, maybe that's a justification.

1079
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,880
That's why Dick Tracy is so colorful.

1080
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,560
It never got proper color correcting.

1081
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,240
It never got color timing done

1082
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,160
because he was constantly in the editing rooms,

1083
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,880
using it for rendezvous.

1084
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,440
Okay, can I just, side note, sorry.

1085
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,600
Molly Lambert just posted

1086
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,280
that they put a trench coat on Jessica Rabbit.

1087
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,800
Yeah, we talked about that last week again, yeah.

1088
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,200
Oh yes, so will we ever have a horny Disney movie?

1089
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,480
Dick Tracy is so horny.

1090
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,600
It's wild, it's so violent.

1091
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,680
People get blown away with Tommy Guns constantly.

1092
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,400
And also it's so weirdly,

1093
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,880
there's so much weird sex in it.

1094
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,920
And I think it's the end.

1095
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,200
We'll never get anywhere near it.

1096
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,200
If we can't even have a Jessica Rabbit standee in a park.

1097
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah, well I say- We're done, right?

1098
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
We are done and good is what I feel.

1099
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,840
Oh, you, yeah.

1100
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,680
Um.

1101
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,360
But I think, yeah, I don't know.

1102
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,480
As Scott was saying, Dick Tracy doesn't have genitals.

1103
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,000
But I think all the Marvel characters

1104
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,200
don't have genitals anymore either.

1105
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,880
I think it's dependent on Avatar seed bearer.

1106
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,120
How willing is James gonna be?

1107
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,960
I think it's the kid, I think it's the middle kid.

1108
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,760
And the water girl, I think we'll see.

1109
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,000
This is the last possibility of horniness

1110
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,520
in a Disney owned movie.

1111
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,640
And even then it still doesn't feel,

1112
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,360
it feels like its own thing, you know?

1113
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,200
But if it's like an active Disney brand-

1114
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,560
James Cameron doesn't film,

1115
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,200
he doesn't like sex scenes that much.

1116
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,160
Like his sex scenes are always like abstraction.

1117
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,640
It's like hand slapping on glass.

1118
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,360
Terminator 1, it's like, it's incredibly soft core.

1119
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,280
Oh, but soft core is hardcore by Disney standards.

1120
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,600
Yeah. So that's as far as I know.

1121
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,520
But he's moved away from sex in every movie, right?

1122
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,360
Yeah.

1123
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,720
And even the sex scene isn't really in Avatar.

1124
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,760
Like it's only in some cuts.

1125
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,280
So yeah. Oh, you're right.

1126
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1127
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,560
You need to know where to look to find it.

1128
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,680
But it's the only,

1129
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,320
if not in Seed Bearer, then never again, I think.

1130
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,000
The cruel irony of the current Walt Disney Company

1131
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,400
is they make very chaste sexless movies

1132
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,720
and the loudest lunatics in the country

1133
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,120
are like pedophiles, groomers, you know?

1134
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,600
But then also the others-

1135
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,440
Yeah, like Mickey.

1136
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,280
Yeah.

1137
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,120
Yeah.

1138
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,960
Yeah.

1139
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,800
Yeah.

1140
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,640
Yeah.

1141
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,480
Yeah.

1142
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,320
Yeah.

1143
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,160
Yeah.

1144
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,000
Yeah.

1145
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,840
You don't like it in the grooming.

1146
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,520
A lot of work on that princess.

1147
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,360
Yeah.

1148
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,000
You're not allowed to be groomed by a Disney.

1149
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,160
No, I don't.

1150
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,840
So then it's, by the way, my letters have worked.

1151
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,560
My campaign has been successful.

1152
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,960
Forky. No more moddiness.

1153
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,880
Forky wears a full Dickie's jumpsuit now

1154
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,560
to cover his filth, to cover his sin.

1155
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,800
He's shame.

1156
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,600
He's shame, yeah.

1157
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,360
I call it your shame.

1158
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,960
Is this entire special a man with no genitals

1159
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,040
talking to a man with overactive genitals?

1160
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,720
With worn used up genitals.

1161
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,320
While Leonard Moulton watches horrified

1162
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,240
and just like, that's what they're really talking about.

1163
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,080
Because-

1164
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,040
That should have been in the press release.

1165
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,280
I found myself weirdly moved by,

1166
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,360
even though it was nonsense

1167
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,600
and it went against everything I believe in,

1168
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,960
Dick Tracy's two minute monologue at the end about

1169
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,120
things should matter, things should mean something.

1170
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,200
It did feel like Future Club 3

1171
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,160
will technology replace thinking.

1172
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,600
But a man who can't quite get his thoughts together,

1173
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,280
but trying, you get what he's trying to say,

1174
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,520
which is like, if we do this again,

1175
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,360
it has to be about something.

1176
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,120
And I don't know what things are about anymore

1177
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,120
and I feel unmoored and I want my life to, you know what?

1178
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,280
Dick Tracy's yelling into the abyss,

1179
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,520
I don't exist, I want to, I need to exist before I die.

1180
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,760
Which is like the centerpiece of all humanity

1181
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,560
and also like every life is like, do I exist?

1182
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,200
Did I ever matter?

1183
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,960
When I die, what will come of this?

1184
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,840
Was I ever Dick Tracy?

1185
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,920
Did anything I do matter, do I matter now?

1186
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,480
And it's, I feel like he's kind of howling that

1187
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,480
into this like special being like,

1188
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,480
and it's kind of very moving in a way of like

1189
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,640
this character being like, I don't, I'm not relevant.

1190
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,360
Yeah.

1191
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,480
It's the AI becoming like all this stuff,

1192
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,000
you see the AI becoming sentient here and there.

1193
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,160
And eventually the AI asks the question, why do I exist?

1194
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,440
What's the point of it?

1195
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,480
Like it starts asking questions like that.

1196
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,520
And Warren has stumbled into that scenario for Dick Tracy.

1197
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,280
Dick Tracy has become sentient.

1198
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,960
Why are you holding onto me if I am not relevant?

1199
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,200
So within the special, he's like, why are we doing this?

1200
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,640
Like, why are you keeping me alive?

1201
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,920
He's like, why are you keeping, it's like,

1202
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,760
he's like a spouse on life support

1203
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,360
begging Warren to like pull the plug.

1204
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,560
Right, I want to die, Warren.

1205
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,920
Warren, I want to die.

1206
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,360
Let me die.

1207
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,840
Or make me relevant because I'm not because.

1208
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,080
Or let me be born anew.

1209
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,520
Yeah.

1210
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,080
And Warren goes, no, we're just going to keep doing this

1211
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,520
and we'll do another one in 15 years.

1212
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,040
That's the end of, I'll buy you lunch

1213
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,200
and then you'll just go back to your little cave,

1214
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,880
wherever you live.

1215
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,720
Oh, wow.

1216
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,760
And you'll shut the fuck up.

1217
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,760
It's Warren just like empty promises.

1218
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,920
It's probably what he's been in a lot of relationships.

1219
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,840
To himself, which is one of the most like incredible pieces

1220
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,360
of like meta fiction I've ever seen.

1221
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,320
This is why I think the pitch is that

1222
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,960
it's about Dick Tracy and Warren trying to get

1223
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,160
a new Dick Tracy movie together.

1224
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,120
Warren existing with his creation out of his body,

1225
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,720
essentially, two sides of the same coin.

1226
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,400
It's a Palti Goldman.

1227
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,200
Yes.

1228
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,040
Scenario.

1229
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,800
And then also there are crimes that happen

1230
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,000
and they have to be solved.

1231
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,560
Yes.

1232
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,520
This is like.

1233
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,600
But seriously.

1234
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,640
Yeah, but seriously.

1235
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,480
But they're going to have arguments about it.

1236
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,600
Show the crime does not pay.

1237
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,960
Warren is going to want to solve the crime in a fun way

1238
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,680
and Dick is going to want to do it in a serious way.

1239
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,520
Yeah.

1240
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,000
And is the answer kind of in between?

1241
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,840
Is that what they find?

1242
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,680
Maybe.

1243
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,720
And that's what collaboration is.

1244
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,560
Warren.

1245
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,400
That's what's set up is we're going to learn

1246
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,320
about collaboration.

1247
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,160
So it's going to be fun.

1248
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,760
Warren's going to want, like Dick is going to be like,

1249
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,440
I want to stop this crime with thinking and clues

1250
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,160
and like a gun.

1251
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,600
And Warren is going to say, I want a big mallet

1252
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,200
to stop this crime.

1253
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,040
And we're going to have fighting about that.

1254
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,440
One punch seven guys.

1255
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,280
Right.

1256
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,120
Eva.

1257
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,080
You know what's really confusing?

1258
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:15,920
I'm sorry, Jason.

1259
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,760
Oh, that's okay.

1260
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,480
When he's showing the clips of what he does like.

1261
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,480
Now here, Bird, Conway, the very first thing he shows

1262
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,040
is Ralph Bird jumping on a chandelier and kicking somebody.

1263
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,760
So he is okay with that,

1264
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,960
but seven guys with one punch is not.

1265
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,520
I'm confused by the line.

1266
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,600
So you can't, there can be fun,

1267
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,160
but it can't defy the laws of physics

1268
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,600
and it can't be colorful.

1269
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,440
You can jump through one poster like Bird did.

1270
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,240
Eva, now I'm hung up on what you said about this

1271
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,600
being like Paul T. Goldman,

1272
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,120
but it's sort of like if Paul T. Goldman

1273
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,320
was in Jason Williner's head

1274
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,480
and he just puts on like a little hat, like a loud hat.

1275
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,320
And he's like.

1276
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,400
He's both sides of it.

1277
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,160
Yeah, he's both sides of it.

1278
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,600
It also like, yeah.

1279
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,800
I was going to say all the crimes happen at the Polo Lounge.

1280
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,520
They're all Polo Lounge based.

1281
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,640
It'll also be at like the three places he goes.

1282
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,480
Yeah, it's exactly.

1283
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,920
Yeah, he goes three places

1284
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,640
and that's all where the crimes happen.

1285
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,400
There's a deli somewhere he goes, the Polo Lounge,

1286
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,240
and then.

1287
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,480
Flat tops in my kitchen.

1288
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,640
Then the doctor's office.

1289
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,320
I mean, it's kind of beautiful.

1290
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,200
Like this entire thing is sort of like,

1291
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,080
Corina Longworth posted a thing like,

1292
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,080
if this is the last thing Warren Beatty does,

1293
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,600
like she posted it and she was like, I'm fine with that.

1294
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,720
Like, I hope it's not,

1295
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,440
but like, it's kind of interesting

1296
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,960
if this is like his final statement.

1297
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,720
That last shot of the two of him and Tracy

1298
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:52,080
might be the final shot of Warren Beatty ever done.

1299
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1300
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,440
It's very possible.

1301
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,280
And it's memorable.

1302
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,640
It's clearly like, he's really,

1303
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,120
he's been thinking too much about.

1304
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,320
It's like you're getting access

1305
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,720
to like a private conversation he's been having,

1306
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,800
probably with his wife and his kids,

1307
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,240
but like mostly with himself about his entire career.

1308
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,080
And that is what this special is.

1309
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,000
It's just him like letting you know

1310
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,720
what he's been thinking about.

1311
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,840
Well, he made us.

1312
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,600
It's interesting because he made a Howard Hughes movie.

1313
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,080
And I wonder if he wanted to do that

1314
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,520
because he's very Howard Hughes like.

1315
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,200
Oh yeah.

1316
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,480
If Howard Hughes was a guy who just spent most of his time

1317
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,440
inside thinking about Dick Tracy.

1318
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,320
But he played Howard Hughes like 30 years younger

1319
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,280
than he was while doing it.

1320
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,800
And then this special has a lot of like,

1321
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,120
I must say you look very good today.

1322
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,760
Well, we can argue about that.

1323
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,040
Well, the previous special was all about

1324
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,600
how handsome he still was.

1325
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,160
And I feel like he's tipped over just,

1326
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,200
he's like his age now.

1327
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,840
So it's like, that's also a thing too.

1328
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,880
I feel like for handsome men who don't age,

1329
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,160
at some point there's a tipping point.

1330
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,480
Right.

1331
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,520
And probably he was like,

1332
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,320
I can't talk about pomegranates this time

1333
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,480
because I'm a little bit, I look older now.

1334
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,480
I can't just laugh it off with a joke.

1335
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,440
Where before it was like a joke

1336
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,960
about how I'm still so handsome.

1337
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,160
He also takes the time,

1338
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,720
if we're talking about this as his final artistic statement,

1339
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,520
it's funny that one of the things in it

1340
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,160
is correcting a line in the movie

1341
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,720
about whether walnuts are good for the brain or not.

1342
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,960
They are good for the brain.

1343
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,960
His, obviously I couldn't remember this.

1344
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,200
The correction is that they are good for the brain.

1345
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,040
Yeah.

1346
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,240
But Al Pacino says they aren't good for the brain

1347
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,000
or he said that 33 years ago in the movie.

1348
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,080
He said they're good for the liver,

1349
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,920
not good for the brain.

1350
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,240
I'm just holding up the photo again

1351
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,840
about how old I was when the movie came out.

1352
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,200
I have not hit puberty.

1353
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,960
A photo that someone had to take to a Rite Aid

1354
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,960
or a photo mark to get developed

1355
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,520
and maybe pick up the frame at the same time

1356
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,080
to put a photo in.

1357
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,320
Yes.

1358
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,160
Wow.

1359
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,720
Time has passed, hasn't it?

1360
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,600
And maybe is this the ultimate statement about that?

1361
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,600
Is walnuts a metaphor for all of us

1362
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,320
and our shifts in perspective?

1363
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,000
Are we not just walnuts?

1364
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,480
I know now we're all technocrats.

1365
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,440
Now look at us, we're on Zoom.

1366
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,960
We're on Zoom all the time.

1367
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,280
We're all technocrats.

1368
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,680
That is a verbatim line from the special.

1369
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,520
That is, I like that one.

1370
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,160
There's the most guaranteed thing in the world

1371
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,200
that there'd be some joke about the wristwatch and Zoom.

1372
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,560
And then it ended up being like,

1373
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,600
there was a time where I thought

1374
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,600
that the height of technology was my wristwatch.

1375
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,600
Oh, I was a little surprised

1376
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,200
there wasn't more Zoom business.

1377
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,120
There were fake glitches built in,

1378
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,960
but I was surprised there wasn't more.

1379
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,480
I think that was the cover, take.

1380
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,320
That was the cover, breaks.

1381
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,240
That was edits. Yeah.

1382
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,080
Yeah, edits.

1383
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,880
Can I say the line,

1384
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,240
that's a lot of reds even for Warren Beatty,

1385
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,840
reminded me of, do you guys know about

1386
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,800
maybe another Future Club 3?

1387
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,760
What's your praise?

1388
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,680
Do you pin at things?

1389
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,160
What do you do for future episodes?

1390
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,000
What do you guys do?

1391
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,840
Oh, oh, oh.

1392
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,680
Calling to a shot.

1393
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,600
Yeah. You're calling a shot?

1394
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,840
I'm not calling a shot, but I'm just maybe.

1395
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,720
You can call a shot.

1396
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,800
You can call a shot.

1397
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,280
Call a shot, go ahead.

1398
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,840
The Val Kilmer Mark Twain one-man show.

1399
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,040
Oh, sure. Citizen Twain.

1400
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,880
For sure, for sure.

1401
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,440
Which I saw opening night at a Hollywood Forever Cemetery,

1402
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,400
and he came out and said,

1403
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,080
welcome to Batman Forever Cemetery.

1404
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,400
Which was. Mark Twain said that.

1405
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,400
Mark Twain was aware of the movie,

1406
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,360
Batman Forever, and that Val Kilmer was in it,

1407
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,560
but he did not know who Val Kilmer was.

1408
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,120
But I felt like saying that's a lot of reds even for,

1409
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,120
Warren Beatty is the same sort of joke.

1410
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,960
Yeah.

1411
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,160
A joke that is missed by so many people

1412
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,960
because the movie Reds is even more ancient

1413
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,160
than everything. 50 years old, right?

1414
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,600
I'm a fan of Warren Beatty, I have not seen Reds.

1415
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,960
Like I've seen Shampoo.

1416
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,800
Wow.

1417
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,600
Yeah, I do not know what that movie's about, but yeah.

1418
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,920
I don't know how to wind this down.

1419
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,040
I mean, Eva, your thoughts about this are beautiful.

1420
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,440
I feel like I have to watch it again

1421
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,120
just under the lens of what you've said,

1422
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,560
that this is like an important piece of prose

1423
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,720
about aging and existence.

1424
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,840
I suddenly. Yeah, do I exist?

1425
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,680
Boy, I mean, a profound question for Dick Tracy to ask.

1426
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,000
I mean, I just love this universe.

1427
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,800
What this special does, like Mike said

1428
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,400
about asserting a pattern, it just,

1429
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,520
now it creates like, before the previous special

1430
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,680
was just an addendum to the movie,

1431
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,680
but now I think the special universe, the DTSU.

1432
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,200
Right.

1433
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,080
DTSU, I think is more important than any Dick Tracy

1434
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,440
that came before, the comics, the films, any of it.

1435
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,040
It's so fascinating.

1436
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,280
It's also like, now I'm like,

1437
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,000
Warren Beatty will pass on one day,

1438
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,320
but I don't think Dick Tracy, Warren Beatty,

1439
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,600
he will remain alive.

1440
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,680
I mean, if he hasn't, he's not dead at like 130 now,

1441
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,480
then yeah, I think he's dead.

1442
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,480
I don't think anyone else should be Dick Tracy.

1443
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,600
Is it up to us?

1444
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,760
Do we need to AI?

1445
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,080
God, the state has to maintain the rights,

1446
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,440
or we have to get the rights

1447
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,640
so that there isn't some dumb new Dick Tracy reboot.

1448
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,760
Could we keep it in the Beatty fold if we get it?

1449
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,080
And then we have, if he dies before he can make

1450
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,560
the next special, we have to do it,

1451
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,680
but with an AI puppeted version of Warren Beatty.

1452
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,760
And he should look like 100 year old Warren,

1453
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,200
and then in the future, 150 year old Warren Beatty.

1454
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,280
He will naturally into his.

1455
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,640
Warren Beatty would have to like adopt Jason as a son.

1456
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,480
Yeah.

1457
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,280
And Jason would have to change his name.

1458
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,360
Oh, yes.

1459
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,800
To Jason Beatty.

1460
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,640
Okay.

1461
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,560
He's willing to go over there.

1462
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,760
Jason was dying to go to Beatty's house.

1463
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,960
So he has to get Warren Beatty's inheritance,

1464
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,400
which will include the rights to,

1465
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,800
and which we can keep as long as we get it

1466
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,520
before the evil Tribune media tries to nab it again.

1467
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,040
You guys have been trying to get rights to a character

1468
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,720
for as long as I've known you.

1469
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,560
And this is it.

1470
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,400
This has been the entire thing.

1471
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,320
And Obscure Comics is completely what it's about.

1472
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,720
This is like our life's mission, I think.

1473
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,800
I think we have to.

1474
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,720
We at least get, we want one of the Lockhorns at least.

1475
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,680
If not both Lockhorn.

1476
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,000
You know what I found out is that I was curious,

1477
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,440
like there was a point in time where,

1478
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,240
when Tribune media was really trying to get these rights

1479
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,520
back, it was because the company was in bankruptcy.

1480
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,480
They filed for Tractor 11.

1481
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,800
The company was fucked.

1482
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,760
They were in debt for billions of dollars.

1483
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,280
It was, you know, because that's the Chicago Tribune.

1484
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,120
That's when print media is dying.

1485
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,120
And they're like, there's maybe one thing that could save us.

1486
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,200
We, if we could get those Dick Tracy rights back

1487
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,000
and get a show or a movie going,

1488
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,680
we can repay our debtors because the rest

1489
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,880
of what they own comic wise stinks.

1490
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:19,920
You know what they own?

1491
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,240
Love is.

1492
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,320
That's the only other one I recognize.

1493
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,200
And Beatty was like, absolutely not.

1494
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,440
Pry it out of my cold dead hands.

1495
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,680
So their debt only gets worse.

1496
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:36,200
And they literally had to sell the Chicago Cubs.

1497
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,520
This organization owned the Chicago Cubs

1498
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,920
and maybe they could have kept them if not for Warren Beatty

1499
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,000
personally squatting on the rights.

1500
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,200
They had open call, they had calls out

1501
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,360
and like Zack Snyder's office, Mick G's office,

1502
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,040
Peter Berg's office are like, look,

1503
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,680
we're not touching it until we know Beatty's let go.

1504
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,920
You know?

1505
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,720
And then literally 15 years later,

1506
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,280
second version of this, he's like, what is my legacy?

1507
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,440
What did I leave behind?

1508
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,880
Who have I affected?

1509
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,400
What has changed because I was alive?

1510
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,960
What will an absent unforgiving God say to me

1511
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,840
if I can't get another one of these made?

1512
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,120
Here's a question.

1513
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:19,360
The deal like that Warren made with Dick Tracy, like,

1514
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,600
is it even financially viable for a company

1515
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,720
to make a Dick Tracy movie with Warren

1516
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,200
in the sense that like he might get like $90 million

1517
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,520
for any Dick Tracy movie that's made?

1518
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,360
Do you know what I'm saying?

1519
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,920
Like, is it even something a company might do

1520
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,840
because of the way the contract,

1521
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,920
because generally they don't just give rights

1522
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,040
to a character, to an actor in perpetuity.

1523
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,920
That's a crazy contract, especially these days.

1524
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,520
Like, even if you did want to make a movie,

1525
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,640
no one would do it until the rights are back to the Tribune.

1526
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,880
Well, to just pit, just to quote Dick Tracy,

1527
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,680
maybe it's a series.

1528
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:05,680
Prestige TV, okay?

1529
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,400
The world, Hollywood is changing

1530
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,360
from Warren Beatty's heyday, okay?

1531
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,600
You know, we have Paramount Plus, we have,

1532
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,840
Epix is now MGM TV?

1533
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,040
That's what that is?

1534
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,880
I saw an ad for MGM, like, what's that, another one?

1535
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,320
I think they just renamed Epix.

1536
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,160
Oh, okay.

1537
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,640
Epix is a bad name, so whatever.

1538
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,480
Yeah.

1539
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,720
Yeah.

1540
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:33,000
Paramount Plus Showtime, it seems like be a natural fit

1541
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,480
for Paramount Plus Showtime.

1542
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,760
I think I'm landing at that I don't want one.

1543
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,840
I think we're in it.

1544
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,640
We're in the ultimate Dick Tracy revival

1545
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,960
that could be happening. Oh yeah.

1546
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,240
The specials are all I want at this point

1547
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,120
because I'm learning about,

1548
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,440
I'm learning more about Dick Tracy from the specials

1549
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,800
than I ever did from the, from even from the,

1550
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,960
well, I mean, from the comics,

1551
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,000
he's just kind of a blank slate surrounded by weirdos.

1552
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,760
The movie, he's nothing.

1553
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,920
The specials, we find out he's a fascist,

1554
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,920
he loves J. Edgar Hoover, he hates the movie, Dick Tracy,

1555
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,120
like he's resentful at Warren Beatty.

1556
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,400
He went to the Polo Lounge once and no one showed up.

1557
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,040
So we went to Los Angeles from wherever he lives.

1558
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,600
An old cop went to, from what, is it a fictional city?

1559
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,440
Where does Dick Tracy live?

1560
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,040
So he flew to LA, he flew to LA, stayed in a hotel.

1561
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,120
Somehow made it to the Polo Lounge,

1562
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,960
a very fancy restaurant in LA

1563
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,960
that I somehow have never been to, waited and,

1564
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,600
I mean, obviously like that was his entire trip

1565
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,360
unless he was like taking other meetings,

1566
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,920
which I don't feel like Dick Tracy was doing on that trip.

1567
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,760
Well, look.

1568
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,960
And we've all underplayed the premise,

1569
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,760
on top of everything you just listed, Eva,

1570
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,680
he's also immortal.

1571
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,920
He's the oldest living man.

1572
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,960
This premise is not exploited in any way in the specials.

1573
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,760
If I have any note, I just want to hear about that

1574
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,320
and the fact that he knew people who were,

1575
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,280
his peers were born in 1870.

1576
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,120
And they felt like they could be dead forever.

1577
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,520
Well, the only other person he maybe is a peer of his

1578
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,280
is Citizen Twain, Val Kilmer's Mark Twain character.

1579
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,840
Also has immortal.

1580
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,120
So I feel like the two of them could interact

1581
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,040
in some sort of liminal space.

1582
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,680
Look, there's some justification

1583
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,000
for all these things you're bringing up

1584
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,960
and Ben Mankiewicz says it right at the top.

1585
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,800
He says, he's a man of many contradictions, Detective Tracy.

1586
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,880
Here's the way I think what we want to happen happens,

1587
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,960
is that we need to get the Tribune lawyers

1588
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,440
to turn the heat up on this old man.

1589
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,280
We need them to say, look,

1590
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,840
you got to be producing one of these a year.

1591
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,640
Yes, every six months.

1592
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,680
Every six months, whatever, yeah.

1593
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:49,120
Turn it up on it and make him do more of these

1594
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,720
because that's the only way we're going to get more of this,

1595
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,960
more of what we want.

1596
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,840
Yeah, all I want is this now.

1597
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,680
Right.

1598
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,160
We have two things to do.

1599
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,160
Let's work both angles.

1600
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:04,000
Jason is going to go try to inherit Warren Beatty's fortune.

1601
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,280
So that's one, so we're doing that,

1602
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,480
but that doesn't mean we can't enact another plan.

1603
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,360
Mike, you have Chicago Connections,

1604
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,400
your dad, a Chicago journalist.

1605
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,160
Well, guess what company he works for, Scott.

1606
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,920
What is it?

1607
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,080
That's right. Tribune.

1608
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,400
Tribune Media.

1609
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,640
This whole time?

1610
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,320
That's, we got a man on the inside.

1611
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,920
The company formerly known as Tonks, is that right?

1612
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,920
At some point they rebranded as Tonks and then Stonks.

1613
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,600
Is that the right, is that the pronunciation of it?

1614
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,160
But I know what you're saying.

1615
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,360
There have been many owners of the Tribune company.

1616
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,800
It's been mismanaged like crazy for many years.

1617
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,280
Is there a call to action for the Cliffords?

1618
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,760
We just have to get on the same page about what we want.

1619
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,960
We want more of these specials and how.

1620
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:52,800
That's all I want.

1621
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,720
I don't want another movie.

1622
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:57,120
I just want this to happen more often.

1623
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:57,960
So we need to figure out how to do it.

1624
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,080
I'm tired of waiting and we need one more before he dies,

1625
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,960
at least, if not a lot more.

1626
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,040
If not a hundred.

1627
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,600
Certainly everybody can tweet about it.

1628
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,280
It's already, I feel like,

1629
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,160
I think the joy of watching one of these come out real time

1630
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,320
instead of discovering it in a YouTube video years later.

1631
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,600
I think this is something we could,

1632
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,760
everybody should just be tweeting about it.

1633
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,080
Make sure Dick Tracy is trending.

1634
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,280
First things first, there's that.

1635
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,080
Yes, trend Dick Tracy.

1636
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,400
We want more of this, more or less, let me be franks,

1637
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,440
more Dick Tracy Zoom's in.

1638
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,280
Yes.

1639
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,240
For surprise drops.

1640
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,680
Do not bother the people of the Polo Lounge.

1641
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,280
They already have to serve drinks and lunch

1642
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,480
and apparently pass along a lot of phone messages

1643
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,360
from 85 year olds.

1644
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,640
Like they have a lot going on there, you know?

1645
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,160
A lot of looky loos who are just like,

1646
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,840
it's on the Hollywood maps of stars, you know?

1647
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,400
So do not bother them, whatever you do.

1648
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,240
Yeah.

1649
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,960
I would say maybe one Clifford,

1650
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,080
oh, they're hearing this too late.

1651
01:08:59,080 --> 01:08:59,920
I was going to say,

1652
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,200
they're hearing this on Super Bowl Sunday.

1653
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,640
I was going to say, don't tweet about the Super Bowl.

1654
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,480
Tweet about this.

1655
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,480
They already are by the way, our listeners.

1656
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,600
But you know, just don't, the Academy Awards.

1657
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,960
I say boycott tweeting about anything,

1658
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,000
any so-called mainstream media.

1659
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,440
Just stay focused on Tracy.

1660
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,000
Anytime anything's happening,

1661
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,520
just start tweeting about more Dick Tracy specials.

1662
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:27,160
Dick Tracy specials, hashtag more Dick Tracy specials.

1663
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,040
If we were,

1664
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,640
if we wear like yellow coats all the time

1665
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:35,360
when we do our podcasts, will we get on Warren's radar?

1666
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,400
Like will he try to sue us or something?

1667
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,640
Or like, can we get sort of in the mix that way

1668
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,240
by starting to steal the IP from him?

1669
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,800
Well, this is another strategy.

1670
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,280
That is a way to maybe meet his legal team

1671
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,840
is to try to get sued.

1672
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,080
And if we can wriggle out of the lawsuit,

1673
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,600
then at least we end up armed with the,

1674
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,720
the email addresses of all of his lawyers.

1675
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,000
That's true.

1676
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,760
So I guess we need to start working on Lil Bulworth.

1677
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,840
Like see if that'll get his attention.

1678
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,800
Lil Bulworth, I'm Lil Bulworth.

1679
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,000
Bulworth begins starring Jason Sheridan.

1680
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,040
Bulworth begins.

1681
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,880
Can we get, Charlie Cosmo, as we talked about

1682
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,800
in the last special is a very, very high level Republican.

1683
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,400
In what, where does he work?

1684
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,480
What's that?

1685
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,240
The people that gave us all the Supreme Court justices,

1686
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,280
what are they called?

1687
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,840
The Federalist Society?

1688
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,800
He's really high up in the Federalist Society.

1689
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,880
Oh my.

1690
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,720
Okay.

1691
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,000
So we're just responsible for like,

1692
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Brett Kavanaugh and yeah.

1693
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,200
Uh, yeah.

1694
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:46,200
So he's responsible for Roe Vis's way of getting overturned.

1695
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,880
But how can we activate him?

1696
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,440
So anytime anyone's like basically posting about like

1697
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,640
all the terrible things that are happening,

1698
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,680
because of the Federalist Society,

1699
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,280
we can also be like, Junior, please get more

1700
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,400
Tracy's specials made.

1701
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,840
If we can get him to reckon with like the damage

1702
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,920
that he's done to this country and say that there's one way

1703
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,840
to make up for it, more frequent Tracy's specials.

1704
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,720
I feel like if he zoomed in,

1705
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,320
there would be another special of Junior.

1706
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,000
Oh, Junior zooms in?

1707
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,600
Junior zooms in.

1708
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,880
Well, what about there?

1709
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,080
That's what we demand.

1710
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,920
Junior zooms in.

1711
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,760
What about Tess?

1712
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,080
What if Tess is in the next?

1713
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,480
What is that actor up to?

1714
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,120
I don't know.

1715
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,520
Probably avoiding Warren Beatty at all costs.

1716
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:39,520
Tess zooms in.

1717
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,360
Madonna zooms in.

1718
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,480
You know, Al Pacino zooms in.

1719
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,680
Dustin Hoffman zooms in.

1720
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,960
Every character can zoom in.

1721
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,200
Mandy Patinkin zooms in.

1722
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,720
Dick Van Dyke zooms in.

1723
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:50,560
Dick Van Dyke.

1724
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,760
Oh yeah, they're all alive.

1725
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,920
They're mostly alive in Dick Tracy.

1726
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,560
We shouldn't say it on this podcast,

1727
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,720
but they're all alive.

1728
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,560
Oh yeah, no.

1729
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,400
Sorry.

1730
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,040
They get special thanks in the credits

1731
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,520
and there is no way they knew this happened.

1732
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,480
Well, it's because they probably showed clips with them

1733
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,800
in it and they didn't have to license them.

1734
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,040
They probably gave their rights over

1735
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,640
so that literally Warren Beatty could show close to them

1736
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,680
and go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1737
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,640
Okay.

1738
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,360
And Jason, my favorite credit in the special

1739
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,560
is the very first special thanks,

1740
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,720
which is to Warren Beatty.

1741
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:33,880
Good for him.

1742
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,600
Glad he got the special thanks.

1743
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,800
He really needed it.

1744
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,720
The very last credit is in memoriam, Steven Sondheim.

1745
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:46,120
We tributed you by getting your name weirdly wrong.

1746
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,160
What does that mean?

1747
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,560
Why does he say a weird name for Sondheim?

1748
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,400
I don't know.

1749
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:56,360
Because Dick Tracy is, I think, a heterosexual male.

1750
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,000
I think that's the calculation he's doing.

1751
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,120
Dick Tracy wouldn't know.

1752
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,960
He probably was like, hmm,

1753
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,960
how would Tracy know about Sondheim?

1754
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,880
He would never see Sonny in the Park with George.

1755
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,960
He only probably never,

1756
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,960
has he even seen Rodgers and Hammerstein musical?

1757
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,160
No.

1758
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,800
What does Tracy watch?

1759
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,560
He probably just went in this rabbit hole and be like,

1760
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,680
he can't know Steven Sondheim's name.

1761
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,880
Tess dragged him to Carousel in its original run.

1762
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,000
She dragged him to the King and I.

1763
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,480
And he didn't understand why it was bad

1764
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,840
that the guy hit his wife.

1765
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,960
He's like, the story checks out.

1766
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,320
Why'd he go, why's that bad?

1767
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,160
Yes, yes, yes.

1768
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,160
Now this I like, yes, yes.

1769
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,240
No, no, no, no.

1770
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,880
All these scenes without wife hitting.

1771
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,640
No, no, no.

1772
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,360
I like when Warren and Dick are talking

1773
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,640
and there's truly no difference in their voice.

1774
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,880
There's no difference in the way they speak.

1775
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,680
They're speaking exactly the same.

1776
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,320
There's no attempt on Warren's part to play

1777
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,440
Dick Tracy any differently than regular Warren Beatty.

1778
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:13,360
And no other voices interrupt this back and forth

1779
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,160
for the final seven minutes of the special.

1780
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,760
All that Ben and Leonard do are sit in a box

1781
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,800
and make a befuddled face.

1782
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,600
They look horrified.

1783
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,680
They're like YouTube thumbnail faces that they're making.

1784
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,760
They are.

1785
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,600
Yeah.

1786
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,440
It's like this.

1787
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,280
Who?

1788
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,760
While you guys were talking.

1789
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,320
Who?

1790
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,600
Actually, I'm gonna, before we wrap this up,

1791
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,760
I'm gonna try to get a screenshot of,

1792
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,480
I have a frame pulled up of the four of them.

1793
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,240
And then there'll be us in an actual zoom window.

1794
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,280
So we have eight boxes all making the same face.

1795
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,400
So we'll do that before we go.

1796
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,400
But anything else to,

1797
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,640
mainly I'm just so happy that we pulled this.

1798
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:01,120
And never maybe before has an episode come together so quick

1799
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,080
because in the same,

1800
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,760
Mike and I were in Super Nintendo World

1801
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,640
and we were talking to a listener.

1802
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,880
Was he Jeff Mike is his name?

1803
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,880
We're talking to Jeff and Jeff said,

1804
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,680
are you guys gonna do a Tracy thing?

1805
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,920
Like, oh, I've actually,

1806
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,000
we just haven't even bothered to text about it yet.

1807
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,840
I don't know.

1808
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:19,680
Should we, maybe we should.

1809
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,720
10 minutes later, Griffin had texted us and Eva

1810
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,520
demanding the episode.

1811
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,360
So plans were drawn up at Jurassic patio,

1812
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:32,560
a better place to do business than even the Polo Lounge.

1813
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,920
And less than 24 hours later,

1814
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:39,920
as quickly as I would imagine Tracy Zooms In came together.

1815
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,840
Came together.

1816
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,720
Scott, you were probably rightfully concerned

1817
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,680
about the shelf life of this piece of media.

1818
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:50,480
Although I think we've learned it's actually a lot more big,

1819
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,960
bigger than we could conceive.

1820
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:55,160
But I think my reaction to all,

1821
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:58,320
my initial reaction before we talked that through

1822
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,800
was that, you know, a piece of dog shit smells bad five,

1823
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,840
when it's five minutes old, when it's five days old.

1824
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,840
So I was like, I don't know, we'll do it in a week.

1825
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,680
Yeah, we'll do it.

1826
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,520
But when you're calling, when an emergency,

1827
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,800
when the word emergency is said,

1828
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,720
you know, you have to,

1829
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,400
there's gotta be some speed involved.

1830
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,000
It was either, really the choice was,

1831
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,720
either we make an episode within 24 hours

1832
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,480
or we wait 13 years.

1833
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,320
Yeah, that's true.

1834
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,480
There's only two ways we could do it.

1835
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,080
I think, I'm just gonna say this.

1836
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,800
Okay, high prediction, low prediction.

1837
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,600
Low prediction, Tracy Zooms In will be shown

1838
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,040
at the American Cinematheque in our lifetime.

1839
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,880
Before Warren Beatty movie.

1840
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,560
High prediction, a clip from Tracy Zooms In,

1841
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,320
specifically this monologue where he talks about existence

1842
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,880
will be shown at the Academy Awards

1843
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,880
as part of the Chuck Workman, like a montage of,

1844
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,520
that's the guy who makes the montages of,

1845
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,680
it was like, it's like the in memoriam.

1846
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,760
I think they'll show it as part of the in memoriam.

1847
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,600
For him?

1848
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,320
For Warren Beatty when he passes.

1849
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,160
This will be like the sub-total.

1850
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,400
I think it'll be the audio from it under a photo,

1851
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:09,320
like him in probably Reds, which I've not seen or shampoo,

1852
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,960
but it'll be like, you have to be something,

1853
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,000
you have to mean something.

1854
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,720
And they'll actually take the audio from Tracy Zooms In

1855
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,560
and they'll be like, people will be like,

1856
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,520
what was that from?

1857
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,640
And the next day in vulture, the people will be like,

1858
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,880
weirdly that was from Tracy Zooms In.

1859
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,600
I think we should start pitching the new Beverly Theater,

1860
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,680
some repertory theater in Los Angeles

1861
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,560
owned by Quentin Tarantino now.

1862
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,080
We should pitch them a triple feature where I,

1863
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,240
you know, we don't even bother with something silly

1864
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,480
like the Roger Rabbit short that originally aired

1865
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,880
before the Dick Tracy movie,

1866
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,320
but we showed the Dick Tracy movie, the Dick Tracy special,

1867
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:48,840
and then the Dick Tracy special Conan, Colin Tracy Zooms In.

1868
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,960
And we're also like one Tracy special away

1869
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,840
from the Beaver trilogy of Tracy specials.

1870
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,760
Like just showing them, like that it's a full film.

1871
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,600
Right.

1872
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,440
Yeah.

1873
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,040
And then we don't have to show Dick Tracy the movie.

1874
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,080
It'll never, it only exists as prequel context

1875
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,160
for the far better one.

1876
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,080
The way that the one said,

1877
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,040
yeah, Bill and Ted, the show existed with people

1878
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,160
that did not know who Bill and Ted were as characters

1879
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,400
because they were young.

1880
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,240
The only resistance we might get from the new Beverly

1881
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,160
is I think they're exclusively 35 millimeter now.

1882
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,800
So we might have to dig, dig in our pockets

1883
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,200
and convert all these specials.

1884
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,240
Yeah, we get the specials on 35.

1885
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:32,760
I feel like Warren might be into that though.

1886
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,040
He might be into it.

1887
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,680
Yeah, Warren would be into it.

1888
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,760
Or we just set up a GoFundMe.

1889
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:42,760
GoFundMe to get the specials on 35.

1890
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:50,160
Put this shot of a Zoom on a TV onto film.

1891
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,560
That would be the funniest way anyone's ever spent money.

1892
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,240
Criterion should release it.

1893
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:04,160
You know, let's get them to do it and then we'll be fine.

1894
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,480
We just need one more special

1895
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,160
because right now it's an hour

1896
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,920
and we need it to be the length of a film.

1897
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,760
So we need him to do one more.

1898
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,120
So we need to just put, how do we turn up the heat?

1899
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:13,960
So there's one more.

1900
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,760
I think it's the lawyers or like,

1901
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,600
he might just gotta talk to his dad.

1902
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,840
We have to harass him.

1903
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,880
I hate to say it, but we have to harass Warren Beatty,

1904
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,920
a man that seems like a nice person

1905
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,000
and I don't wanna bother.

1906
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,640
We have to go to the Polo Lounge

1907
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:30,200
and harass him every day for the next year.

1908
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,160
I gotta just start doing the beats

1909
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,760
of the episode of The Simpsons

1910
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,120
where Bart becomes the heir to Mr. Burns' fortune.

1911
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,640
Just gotta start hitting all those moments.

1912
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,480
Yes.

1913
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,920
So just- We have multiple channels, yeah.

1914
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,440
There's a couple ways to get- Jason, you're gonna do it.

1915
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,040
So main thing is Jason get fitted

1916
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:51,960
for a smaller version of all of Warren Beatty's clothes.

1917
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,360
Done, yeah.

1918
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,720
But specifically the Dick Tracy outfit.

1919
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,640
Mainly that, yes.

1920
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,520
How can he say no when a little Tracy shows up?

1921
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,480
Jason shows up at the Polo Lounge

1922
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,520
wearing a little version of the Dick Tracy outfit.

1923
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,840
But acting like he doesn't know what he's wearing.

1924
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,040
Right, right, just like a casual thing.

1925
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,040
Yeah.

1926
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,840
And when I say little, I mean like little shorts for it.

1927
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,400
It's like yellow shorts.

1928
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,240
Yeah, yeah.

1929
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,760
But just be like, and then if he says something,

1930
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:21,360
you're like, oh, this is just my normal clothes.

1931
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,120
Yeah. Yeah.

1932
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,400
I was in a rush this morning.

1933
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,880
I just put on my usuals.

1934
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,640
Is Warren here?

1935
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:29,800
Is Warren here today?

1936
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,640
Is-

1937
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,480
Yeah.

1938
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:32,720
No, when Warren comes up to you,

1939
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:36,200
you gaslight Warren and you act like you don't know

1940
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,600
who he is and what he's talking about.

1941
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,000
And you're like, oh, there's a movie

1942
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,600
that has this outfit in it.

1943
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,960
I'll watch it, sir.

1944
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:43,800
What was your name, sir?

1945
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,440
And then you come back next week.

1946
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,800
Do you work here, sir?

1947
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,640
Are you the manager?

1948
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,160
Could I get a Cobb salad and a tall glass of milk?

1949
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,000
Thank you.

1950
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,920
And then a week later you come back and you're like,

1951
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,400
is it Warren?

1952
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,920
Hi, I watched that movie you were in and it was fantastic.

1953
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,080
Pretty good.

1954
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:00,920
Yeah.

1955
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:01,760
You know what I didn't like though?

1956
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,760
The pink street.

1957
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,880
But don't you think crime is a little more serious

1958
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,720
than that, sir?

1959
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,920
Needs to know whether or not it pays.

1960
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,680
And then meanwhile, we're getting the legal team

1961
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:16,320
to just pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.

1962
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,360
So we're doing both at once.

1963
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,080
It's like a long better call Saul Khan type of a thing

1964
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,480
to gaslight someone, make them crazy,

1965
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,240
and destroy their mind.

1966
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,080
And then we can strike.

1967
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,920
Yeah.

1968
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,880
The very sane mind of Warren Beatty

1969
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,920
completely together at his apex.

1970
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,760
85 years old.

1971
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,920
And all we wanted of this is one more 30 minute special.

1972
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:39,760
Right.

1973
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,480
I should also say you three are in the restaurant,

1974
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:46,280
you brought your own bush with you

1975
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,320
that you're hiding behind.

1976
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,320
All three of you each have a laptop

1977
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,960
because you're emailing back and forth with these lawyers.

1978
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:56,800
We're texting the lawyers while you're doing the outfit con

1979
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,520
because we want him to get the email from the lawyers

1980
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,560
while this like weird thing crosses happening

1981
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,760
with you in the outfit.

1982
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,600
Yeah, you have sound on on all those computers.

1983
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,800
So there's just a cacophony of dings

1984
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,200
as the texts are coming in.

1985
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,920
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1986
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,320
He's just going,

1987
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,840
yeah, we're just trying to drive the poor man mad.

1988
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,640
And this is getting to one additional special.

1989
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,000
It's all, yeah.

1990
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:26,680
Like for it to exist like three years earlier

1991
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,440
than it might naturally.

1992
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:29,280
Yeah.

1993
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,320
That's all we're trying.

1994
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,800
This is, there's a book about that.

1995
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,400
The year at the Academy Awards,

1996
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,880
I think with Bonnie and Clyde was not,

1997
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,560
it was kind of like, oh, this is a big year.

1998
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,760
This is kind of a big sea change

1999
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,520
of what was nominated and stuff.

2000
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,040
And I think we found the guy

2001
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,760
who wrote that book's next topic.

2002
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,840
Yes.

2003
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,800
Yes.

2004
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,640
Us.

2005
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,480
Yes.

2006
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,200
Correct.

2007
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,200
Very important mission.

2008
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,680
These are great ideas, crucial ideas.

2009
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,880
And thanks for bringing them to us.

2010
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:04,520
Eva Anderson, you survived this emergency podcast ride.

2011
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,480
Thanks you guys.

2012
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,520
Couldn't have done it without you.

2013
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,360
I'm so glad.

2014
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,200
Thanks for squeezing us in

2015
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,880
given how hectic everything's been.

2016
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,840
You're working all the time.

2017
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,800
Thanks for making the time.

2018
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,280
Every time, always.

2019
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,560
Oh my God, I'm so happy.

2020
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,160
For doing your, I feel like this is,

2021
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,960
is this your sixth second gate alone?

2022
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,240
More maybe?

2023
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:29,280
I think more of your episodes are on the second gate.

2024
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,880
I don't talk about rides.

2025
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,280
It's been a while, I guess.

2026
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,120
Yeah.

2027
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,200
Though, can we just say really quick?

2028
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,520
There was a Vanity Fair article about,

2029
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:41,680
can we just talk about this right before we leave?

2030
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,640
Oh yeah, yeah.

2031
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,400
The Vanity Fair article about

2032
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,120
the Dick Tracy Zooms In special

2033
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:51,120
cited your podcast as proof

2034
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,440
that people care about these specials.

2035
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,440
It's been a fascination among comedy podcasters

2036
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,320
and then the link was to us.

2037
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,400
Well, link to it in one of your episodes, Eva.

2038
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,240
So we're all-

2039
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,640
Yeah, but it was the American Adventure where it came up.

2040
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,720
Cause I probably, he was probably Jordan Hoffman

2041
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,560
who wrote that article.

2042
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,280
Was trying to link to a not pay walled episode.

2043
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,960
Oh, that's nice.

2044
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:11,800
That's a good way to do it.

2045
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,560
Shout out to Jordan Hoffman, the best.

2046
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,640
Thank you Jordan.

2047
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,960
And I guess I didn't realize

2048
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,880
how much we were associated with this.

2049
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,400
And I'm glad.

2050
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,240
I'm just glad that all of it, whoever it is,

2051
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,120
the myriad of, I think 80% of the audience

2052
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,080
of this special are podcasters.

2053
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,320
And I'm glad we all together rescued it.

2054
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,320
Like it might've just fallen into like a pop cultural gutter

2055
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,200
if not for that one day where everybody had to act.

2056
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,200
And we acted, Will Sloan acted, Chris Hayner acted.

2057
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,200
Someone put it on YouTube so I could watch it

2058
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,680
after I got off work.

2059
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,720
Yes, yeah, yeah.

2060
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,960
All that means I can cancel the five day trial

2061
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,960
of direct TV streaming that I have to keep leapfrogging

2062
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,080
between live TV things so that I don't,

2063
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,560
free trial attempts.

2064
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,840
Anyway, exit of the gift shop.

2065
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,080
Anything you want to plug?

2066
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:09,080
My plug is watch the new season of Party Down

2067
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,120
coming out this week, next week.

2068
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,960
And my husband wrote it.

2069
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,560
It's his show and it's fucking awesome.

2070
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,400
Oh yay, so happy it's back, yeah.

2071
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,240
Mainly we want to plug Dick Tracy special.

2072
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,000
Tracy zooms in.

2073
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,400
And previous special.

2074
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,360
And previous special Dick Tracy special.

2075
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,800
And the movie Dick Tracy except Little Libertine.

2076
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,640
If you, I mean watch it but only watch it

2077
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:39,640
and over it just say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2078
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,440
If you want to dig even deeper with us,
