1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As we celebrate Feliz Navidad, the way of winter on today's podcast, The Ride.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:01:06,280
The Ride presents Feliz Navidad, the way of winter, a Yuletide celebration of all things

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Avatar, a podcast series that will have no cultural impact.

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,280
I mean, seriously, can anyone even name one of the hosts of this podcast?

7
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Jason Sheridan, can you even name one of the hosts of Feliz Navidad, the way of winter?

8
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,280
No, and like, you know, this podcast, it's just dances with wolves.

9
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,280
It's just freaking dances with wolves.

10
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:38,280
It's freaking, it's freaking Fern Gully, but with microphones and you can't see anything unless you go to the Forever Dog YouTube, but there's plenty for you to see.

11
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Mike Carlson, can you name one host? Just try naming one host.

12
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:54,280
I would say, oh, my favorite character is General Michael Quaritch, the character we all know. We're all very familiar with him, right?

13
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,280
I didn't have to go to IMDB to figure it out.

14
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,280
You certainly didn't have to look that up before.

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,280
And now Mike is descending back.

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Here's where, okay, that's all right.

17
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,280
That all has been said for the podcast audience and welcome to our celebration of Avatar.

18
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:22,280
If there was ever an episode where you should maybe come to the YouTube version, which is on the Forever Dog YouTube or just Google us, this might be the one because a couple things are happening.

19
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,280
First of all, I have gone into the machine.

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,280
I have completed the ritual and I am at last a proud Navi warrior.

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Right.

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:42,280
I have I have done six minutes worth of face paint and I am I'm one of them.

23
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,280
So you're the Avatar program.

24
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
You're you have not become a Navi.

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,280
So you're just being you're able.

26
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
That's a good question.

27
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
Yes.

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,280
Jake Sully, it's the same Jake Sully situation.

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
It's not.

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Are you even able to?

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
I don't know.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
I don't know.

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,280
You know, there's a nerd over here.

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,280
There's a reason we call him the Viper Wolf of the podcast.

35
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,280
He's skulking in the background, hiding in the foliage, you know.

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Well, this is the other thing.

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Okay.

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
So, yes, I have completed.

39
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Yes, Scott is back at home.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
Scott's sleeping in Burbank.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,280
But I but this body has been planted here several miles away in North

42
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
Hollywood.

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,280
And, you know, that because that's what we have to do.

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,280
We're fully embracing the Avatar spirit and not to be left out.

45
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,280
Mike is has descended into a potted plant, a tropical potted plant, where

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,280
we'll see how long you're able to stay away from the microphone with a huge

47
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,280
jungle leaf in front between you and the microphone.

48
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,280
I have camo camo joggers on so people barely can see me.

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Marine, a regular marine.

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
I'm a regular marine.

51
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Some might also accuse me of pulling home improvements.

52
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Wilson.

53
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,280
I mean, has anyone even seen Wilson's face?

54
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Like, oh, yeah, you're a big home improvement fan, huh?

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Then have you even seen Wilson?

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Yeah.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Big cultural impact.

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Nobody knows what the guy looks like.

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
Yeah.

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Oh, I'm such a fan of the actor, Earl Hindman.

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Oh, I don't know.

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
I don't know.

63
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Everybody knows his name.

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,280
Mirror minutes in, we've already gotten a Miles Corich and a Wilson reference.

65
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
We'll keep it up.

66
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,280
This will be this will be Name City.

67
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,280
And Jason is is, you know, you might think that it's just a bunch of bottles

68
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
slightly blocking his face.

69
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
But no, no, no.

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,280
What you were doing is embracing the way of water.

71
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Yeah, I am surrounded by water and, you know, it I feel like I'm

72
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,280
in a little fort, which is fitting because this podcast is a fortress.

73
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Wow.

74
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Yes.

75
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Yeah.

76
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Wow.

77
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Wow.

78
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,280
This yes, this forever dog is our fortress right now.

79
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
I'm thrilled.

80
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,280
I'm so excited that we are doing a celebration here and that we've fully embraced

81
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
the avid spirit.

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,280
And I felt like I needed to Mike's already moving the plan.

83
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
I know you're moving it closer.

84
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
You're going to have you.

85
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
You're putting the leaf.

86
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
You're having it brush up against the microphone.

87
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
I just want it.

88
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
I want it to be a good visual, but I also want to be able to talk.

89
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
So I'm going to go with this.

90
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Does this have a name that people don't like when you chew on microphone?

91
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
And there's some term for that.

92
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
But is there already a term for it?

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Don't put leaves.

94
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
Don't rub leaves on to a mic.

95
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
I don't know.

96
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Yeah.

97
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Similar flora.

98
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Flora phonia is real.

99
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Mm hmm.

100
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Yeah.

101
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Good.

102
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Don't you dare start eating those leaves, you piece of shit.

103
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
If you start chewing on Mike.

104
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,280
If these are eucalyptus, I might take a bite or two because those

105
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,280
those leaves get pant or panda koalas very high from what I

106
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
understand.

107
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Right.

108
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
That's what I understand.

109
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
I could be wrong.

110
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
That could be fake news.

111
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
But let me let me make sure I'm right.

112
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
Mm hmm.

113
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Something I feel like I should mention as you're looking that up is that

114
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,280
me with the Navi face paint led to a funny moment where Mike, you're

115
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
being very cautious as we record in studio.

116
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
You've got a baby at home.

117
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
You can't be too careful.

118
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
So you've been running.

119
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,280
You've been giving us covered swabs sometimes before we record.

120
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,280
So I did have to do the covered swab with Navi face paint.

121
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
That's right.

122
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,280
We'll get that video in front of you on the socials soon on whatever

123
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,280
socials exist by the time this episode comes out, because we're

124
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
recording this pretty far in advance.

125
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,280
A lot could happen between now and with Twitter or anything else.

126
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,280
But we're getting it done and getting it ready because as you're

127
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,280
hearing this, this is the day after a law after a 13 year wait, this

128
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,280
is the day that the way of water comes out that we all get to return

129
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
to Pandora.

130
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,280
It's today.

131
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
You can go see it right now.

132
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
Some of you may have seen it already.

133
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
I don't know.

134
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,280
I don't know the degree of of Avatar head or if it's if it's only us,

135
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
if it's only if it's only me even.

136
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Yeah, I will see.

137
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm excited to see it, but I'm going to see it in an empty theater.

138
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,280
You're going to spend the six hundred dollars.

139
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Oh, yeah, I'm going to pay to buy out all the seats to buy out what they

140
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,280
do and not just encourage, but it is built into the AMC app.

141
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Now they're like, hey, come see.

142
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Do you want to see Black Panther in 3D or do you want to see an IMAX or do

143
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
you want to see it in a private theater?

144
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Like you can rent out the theater within the app.

145
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Well, then I'm going to have to do, I guess.

146
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Yeah, I believe I I believe it's a misconception that they get high.

147
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
They get sleepy.

148
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,280
OK, OK.

149
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Well, so I don't want it to be a martial gate.

150
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
Yeah, I don't want that.

151
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,280
I don't want Griffin to come on here and relitigate the koala bear being high.

152
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,280
So then something else then fundamentally something else happens, which I don't

153
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
want to Google.

154
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Then you start Googling.

155
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
I will never be wrong again.

156
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
I promise that to the audience.

157
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
You have learned your lesson.

158
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
But yeah, look, we're there.

159
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,280
We made it to the day.

160
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,280
And if what I have done to myself in this moment does not indicate that I have

161
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,280
gotten fully on board, I like it's been a journey since we started this podcast.

162
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,280
I feel I think maybe all of us did like like in my head, Mike, you've always

163
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,280
been a fan, but maybe it was just of the ride.

164
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,280
I don't know if I don't even know still if you care about the movie.

165
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Well, here's the thing.

166
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
I went back.

167
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,280
This goes back to if you know, if you know my history of being on the YouTube

168
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,280
show called Movie Fights and I was trying to find the origin of Mighty Akron

169
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,280
because I believe it originates there somewhere predates the show.

170
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Wow.

171
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
I think so.

172
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,280
But I couldn't find evidence and I for some reason didn't want to sort through

173
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,280
about 30 plus hours of content to try to figure out sure it holds up.

174
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,280
You look I think I say look, I say I say some funny stuff, but I'm not saying go

175
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
back and watch everything.

176
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
I'm just saying.

177
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,280
But there's an avatar, you know, questions and stuff.

178
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,280
So I would say things and I believe it originate because we talked about

179
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Botanicus, which is something I said hashtag Botanicus on that show is

180
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
something that we brought over here.

181
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,280
So I still have not found the exact time I said Mighty Akron for the first time.

182
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Wow.

183
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Sure.

184
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
I don't think I realized before the show.

185
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
I think it was before the show.

186
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
I could be I actually could be wrong.

187
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Again, don't Griffin, please.

188
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
I don't know.

189
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,280
So you might have been talking talking about like an absolutely epic face off

190
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,280
where the Mighty Akron is staring at Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas.

191
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
Sure. I found an old old one because it was a question.

192
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,280
It was a show where you would answer like, you know, hypothetical questions about

193
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
entertainment.

194
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,280
So I found one where I was pitching like a Jake Sully Disney Plus show.

195
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,280
Oh, I was pitching out on all the different things you could do with Avatar.

196
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
But I don't say it in there.

197
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I don't say Mighty Akron in there.

198
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
OK.

199
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
So Eekron, excuse me.

200
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:03,280
No, Cameron, Cameron, I saw a video and he says just very quickly, Akron.

201
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Really?

202
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Yeah.

203
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,280
This might end up being like Millennium Falcon Falcon, where it's like there's

204
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,280
official sources that kind of say both.

205
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Where fans have their opinions about it, but the creator of the franchise doesn't

206
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
give a shit.

207
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,280
Yeah, that's also that one's tricky, too, because that's just a normal word that

208
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,280
some people say one way and some say another.

209
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,280
So I could be wrong about it, but I think it originates off the show somewhere.

210
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
But but I could I could be wrong about that.

211
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Well, and look where we're at now.

212
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,280
I prepared this here in the video feed.

213
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Jordan, can you pull up the Google results?

214
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,280
And we've discussed this, but I think it's grown even since the last time we talked

215
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,280
about Avatar in our live show three years ago.

216
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
So these are the results.

217
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:53,280
And it's only if you Google image Mighty Akron, it's only more might get this more

218
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
lines have filled.

219
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
You dominate these results.

220
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,280
And the very first one, if you see it's on the second row all the way on the right.

221
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:07,280
The first thing that is not Carlson or podcast, the right oriented is Lego Avatar.

222
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Jake and Terry something or other.

223
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
And that's that covers the Akron part.

224
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,280
But I went to the page and mighty is because of a link to another Lego item that is

225
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Bowser and they call him Mighty Bowser.

226
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
So that doesn't even count.

227
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
So really, that's that's out.

228
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,280
So the entire first two lines, I see the Disneyland foodies in there.

229
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,280
People have really helped like game these results.

230
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
So your association with my name is right.

231
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
I think or make them more.

232
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Yeah, we're correct.

233
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
You got it.

234
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Yeah, yeah.

235
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,280
You this this land is yours and anyone else encroaching.

236
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,280
You need to chase them away as the Navi chase away the sky people.

237
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Yes, it's good.

238
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Yeah.

239
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,280
So I mean, I I there has to be another precedent for like a character in a movie where

240
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,280
like somebody added a word to it and now they're the search for it.

241
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Right.

242
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
I don't know.

243
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
We'll never be able to know.

244
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Like like another like start.

245
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Did somebody call Yoda cool and you looked up cool Yoda and now it's like some guy from

246
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
a podcast.

247
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
I don't know if there is a precedent for that.

248
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,280
But did a guy invent the phrase gross E.T.?

249
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Yeah, right.

250
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Somebody maybe did.

251
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,280
And now it's all this podcast host.

252
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Yeah.

253
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,280
But this is too much like this is this is out there.

254
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
This has gotten out there, I think.

255
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Well, it's it's it's grown a lot.

256
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,280
The legend of Mike Carlson and the mighty Akron has only grown and it's grown to a point

257
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
and we've talked about this before.

258
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,280
But now that we're at the day, I think we have to address it and we haven't officially

259
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
addressed it on the show.

260
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:42,280
And now I ask for the clip, which I think the word mighty is in the clip.

261
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Spoiler.

262
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,280
But if you have not seen the most official Avatar trailer that came out, it all builds

263
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,280
to this is like the crucial pivot point of the where like the trailer like it's it's

264
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
kind of mysterious until this moment.

265
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,280
And then it picks up steam and gets fast and intense after this.

266
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,280
So it's like really the key moment of the trailer for Avatar, the way of water.

267
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
So what is her heartbeat sound like?

268
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Mighty.

269
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Everything ducks away in an extremely busy trailer.

270
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Everything fades out like all the all the instrument.

271
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Everybody sets the instruments down.

272
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,280
And so that there's one solo and it's seemingly the new Sigourney Weaver character, the young

273
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
girl saying mighty.

274
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,280
What do you think when this dropped?

275
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Well, we talked about this happening in the movie.

276
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,280
We were like, they're going to say it or something in the movie.

277
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
We discussed the possibility of that.

278
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Whether it was on Mike or off.

279
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
I was like, what if it's in the movie?

280
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:56,280
So this isn't quite the phrase, but the showcase of the word mighty, which is not a common

281
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
it's not like they say mighty all the time.

282
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,280
It's not like a Star Wars word where they say credits or something.

283
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
It's like mighty.

284
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,280
I don't think it's something they overuse or use ever in the first Avatar.

285
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Yeah.

286
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,280
So it feels purposeful.

287
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
Yeah, I will say it feels purposeful.

288
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,280
I've been told that the kids because it goes from mighty to a picture of a picture of a

289
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,280
scene of an Akron people.

290
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Somebody who was trying to tell me that these are not Akron's.

291
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
These are a smaller.

292
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Oh, shit.

293
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Well, these are like some sort of I forget which new beast to learn.

294
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Right.

295
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Oh, boy.

296
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,280
So I guess that takes a little of the fun out of it because it feels like mighty.

297
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,280
And then we see a picture, a video of an Akron.

298
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,280
But still, doesn't it feel like someone's talking to me?

299
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
It could be.

300
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
And I don't want to take that that away from me.

301
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
I would rather embrace the joy.

302
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I ran you through the ringer when the time that you thought that you could get Prince to come to your Prince birthday party.

303
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
Yes, you did.

304
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Yes.

305
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,280
And by the way, I was just driving in that area and M bar is really far away from the palladium.

306
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
He's not walking to that.

307
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
That's a long walk.

308
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
He's got a car.

309
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
That's eight blocks.

310
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,280
So now he's got to get in a car, get the whole entourage in the car.

311
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Prince has ever walked more than a block in the last in his last 30 years on the planet.

312
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
I know he gets in the car.

313
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
That's a good point.

314
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280
What was Prince's conditioning like?

315
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,280
You know, well, he was doing three hour plus shows at night.

316
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Well, I know he was in good condition.

317
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Yeah, I but yeah, did he have like a routine?

318
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Did he have a workout?

319
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,280
I know that I know his routine did not involve going to random birthday parties that were tweeted at him.

320
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
He's mysterious.

321
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,280
He shows up sometimes and he happened to have a I'm getting upset.

322
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,280
He happened to have a Twitter account that was active at the time.

323
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
So I was like, you know what?

324
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
Mm hmm.

325
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,280
That is surely he himself was doing the tweeting.

326
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Of course, he doesn't drive himself, but he does do his own.

327
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
Listen, I don't want to know.

328
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
OK, I want to know.

329
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,280
I don't want to get this.

330
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:56,280
But but I was having a birthday at the M bar and it was truly billed as a prince dance party.

331
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
All Prince music.

332
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
I guess you're right.

333
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
That is a bill.

334
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
And you mean build when you emailed your friends?

335
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Well, this is not an event in the world.

336
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Well, I told the M bar and they basically were like, yeah, you can DJ the whole bar, which was something that's not necessarily just like a little tiny room.

337
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,280
It was the entire venue because it was practically a rec room.

338
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,280
They knew that my 30th birthday was going to draw the people in.

339
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
They knew people were going to show up for this event.

340
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
They knew we did.

341
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
We drew.

342
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
We didn't have to pay.

343
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Oh, this is a thank you so much.

344
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Wait, now is this a transit Google map?

345
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Jordan has pulled up a map so we can do the actual mileage.

346
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
This is very OK.

347
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
There is walking point four miles.

348
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
All right.

349
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,280
That's not very far, but it's not like next door.

350
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Prince says somebody carry him that that far.

351
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
But this is a dangerous route, by the way.

352
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Hollywood's it's not the best.

353
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
No, no, no, no.

354
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I don't think they're letting Prince.

355
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
So all I said was, oh, my God.

356
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,280
So basically all of a sudden it was revealed that and I didn't know this.

357
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Prince did a secret show with the plating, which I very much was like, should we just abandon ship on this party and go to the plane?

358
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
We should have done that.

359
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
But I felt bad because people were coming again.

360
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,280
We were going to have this place packed for my birthday.

361
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
So so I said, you know what?

362
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
We should all tweet a prince and tell Prince to come over.

363
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,280
There's a prince dance party going on right here.

364
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
And he's a mystery.

365
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
He does.

366
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,280
You know, he's not, you know, not Bill Murray level showing up in a while, but he does some stuff.

367
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Some awesome, totally on the level.

368
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Good, perfect.

369
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Everything he does is perfect.

370
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Bill Murray.

371
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
No, no, no.

372
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
This is so I said differently.

373
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,280
But I would tell people, oh, you know, Prince is playing show now.

374
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Of course, it's crazy because M.

375
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,280
Bar closed before the show was over.

376
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
So obviously it didn't make any sense.

377
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Oh, well, then.

378
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
But I didn't know this at the time.

379
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
I know Prince was going on.

380
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I didn't know on the set list or whatever.

381
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
But I said, this is crazy.

382
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
He's blocks away.

383
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
I said, let's tweet at him.

384
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
Let's see what happens.

385
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
But it wasn't like I was standing outside the M.

386
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Bar going, why is he playing show?

387
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
You were not doing that.

388
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,280
But I thought like, oh, there's me.

389
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Looks like there's a 10 percent chance.

390
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
10 percent.

391
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,280
OK, that's I maybe thought in your I thought I let's not go crazy.

392
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Let's not go crazy.

393
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Ironically, I think maybe I thought you had like a 50 percent chance in your head.

394
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Ten's reasonable.

395
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
I can't.

396
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
I thought you for that.

397
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Yeah, I don't know what percent.

398
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
I mean, who knows what?

399
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,280
I was so high because of my because I not have eucalyptus because I had alcohol.

400
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Mainlining eucalyptus.

401
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,280
But I definitely probably was excited because I mean, it is a pretty funny coincidence that he's playing a secret show that close.

402
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
It is. Yeah, I understand.

403
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:35,280
I think what I thought was that you that I was like, yeah, but he wasn't going to come and you were mad at me and you're mad at me still for him.

404
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
I'm very upset that maybe Prince would not be.

405
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
I know he doesn't know.

406
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Giant artists is not going to go sing like birthday party with my music.

407
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
That's never happened before.

408
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
I've got to see this.

409
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:55,280
Maybe if it was next door, maybe if it was at the hold on, let's see if it was at the tender greens, which we ate at before.

410
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Yeah, Jason and I ate at that tender greens before we had a typical shitty tender greens meal.

411
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,280
And then we walked to the bar, which I think an hour in we were like, is this bar open?

412
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Like it seemed like they were, you know, just a week away from packing.

413
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Oh, they were waiting for me to pack it.

414
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Pack the place.

415
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Yeah. All friends and well wishers.

416
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Anyway, look, this is not we're not.

417
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
That's when we're not derailing.

418
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,280
I was more than happy to just bring it up quickly, but I know people needed to know the context for instance.

419
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,280
You can tell us if you think Prince would have come if he knew about it or not.

420
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,280
But what I was saying is I don't in that case, I think I ruined the magic for you and I didn't I don't want to ruin the magic for you here.

421
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Now it did occur to me that if you know, because that on the day when we were texting about it, you said, I don't know, she says mighty and then it cuts to an Akron.

422
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:56,280
And what I didn't text was, yeah, but Akron and Akron is like one of the four things you would cut to in the trailer.

423
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
But that's the cynic.

424
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
And you know what?

425
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
I'm not about cynicism right now.

426
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Look at me.

427
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Look how I look.

428
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,280
This is about embracing the other side and joining the party, joining the Avatar party.

429
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,280
And this is I want to talk a little about this before we get into into Navi River journey, the primary if we have time.

430
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
There's a lot to talk about.

431
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
We may not have time.

432
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Right.

433
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,280
But OK, so a couple of weeks ago, I think it was in the the Hapox ghost episode.

434
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,280
We said we're going to do a celebration of Avatar.

435
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,280
And by the way, I think this might be the only one on the main feed, but we're going to do a little more behind the Civico gate, of course.

436
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Oh, nice, nice.

437
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,280
But so a lot of the party will be there.

438
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,280
But anyway, so I think in that episode, I said I'm embracing Avatar.

439
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
I'm blue pilled.

440
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,280
I saw the rerelease and I loved it.

441
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:53,280
And I want to I'm trying to think that this movie is going to be a great and amazing theatrical experience.

442
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,280
And and so in sort of embracing Avatar, I guess I don't know.

443
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
We announced that.

444
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:08,280
And oh, that's what I was getting at was that it seems like more fun on the Avatar side.

445
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Right. The Avatar side is a party and the non Avatar side is a bunch of people like texting about how they don't understand Avatar.

446
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
No one's having fun on that side.

447
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,280
And this is what happened when we announced the series that we said we're going to do some Avatar stuff.

448
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Ninety nine percent of the audience was like, yeah, great.

449
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
Gave us episode suggestions.

450
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Fun. That'll be fun.

451
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Civico, Mighty Akron, all that.

452
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,280
And then a tiny sliver of people are like, yeah, here's a suggestion.

453
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Don't do it.

454
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Don't do this.

455
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,280
I think are we not a little tired of this bit?

456
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
This is nothing but a failed bit.

457
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Can we wrap up the failed bits of talking about the biggest movie of the decade, possibly the century?

458
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,280
It churns my stomach when comedy podcasts I listen to do bits.

459
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
God damn it.

460
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
It is not what I am here for.

461
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Bits that deviates from the topic.

462
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,280
This is we lost those people during the Prince thing already.

463
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
So they're right.

464
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
We're only among friends.

465
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:14,280
This is as bad as when Mother puts her hands in front of her face when we play peekaboo and she disappears forever.

466
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Mother is never coming back.

467
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,280
There is no way to solve this.

468
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
My life is despair.

469
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Object permawuts?

470
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:35,280
No, I think it just really reminded me that I think if you're deciding I don't like Avatar at this point in time, and maybe this movie will not be good.

471
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,280
And if it's not good, well, we should all admit that and move on.

472
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm not going to admit it.

473
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
You won't admit it.

474
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
I don't want to.

475
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
I want it to be a party in the theater.

476
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
I'm excited.

477
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
It feels like the most like here is a mega blockbuster.

478
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
We're seeing movies again in a big way.

479
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
This isn't straight to streaming boring.

480
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Can I ask, are you going to then retroactively apply this new philosophy to all the bits on the show?

481
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,280
You're going to embrace Frank Marshall.

482
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
You're going to embrace the briefcase story.

483
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
You're going to embrace the plane.

484
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
We will see.

485
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
We'll see.

486
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
We'll see.

487
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
One thing at a time.

488
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
We'll see if this starts.

489
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,280
We'll be dressed as a plane in a couple of months maybe in an episode.

490
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,280
In a couple of months I'll be saying I loved when Frank Marshall spoke to us.

491
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I loved his inspiring speech that did happen.

492
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
That's great.

493
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:30,280
But, you know, in talking about my evolution in this area, I do have to admit to something and I have to go back to a dark place and a more cynical place.

494
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:36,280
That joke that I made at the beginning, this thing that everybody says at this point of, or I think we're getting over it culturally,

495
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,280
but this thing of can you even name a single character?

496
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Right.

497
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:48,280
So the other night I was out with my friend Brian Rowe, who hosts the podcast film at 50.

498
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Jason and I have both been on.

499
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:57,280
He's a college friend of mine and somebody who I was living with when Avatar came out with the first one.

500
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:04,280
And I was asking him his memories about, like, do you remember when that movie was going on?

501
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
Like, did you dig it?

502
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
And he said, well, I remember you didn't.

503
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
I remember you were like, this sucks shit.

504
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
I don't want to see this.

505
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,280
And so that was pure cynicism back then.

506
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
And then he said something that really fucked me up.

507
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
And here it is.

508
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,280
He said, I remember one time, like early on in the podcast, you guys were like making fun of Avatar.

509
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,280
And you said, can you even name a single character in Avatar?

510
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
I made the joke.

511
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
You made the joke.

512
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,280
I made the joke that is now a hacky, hacky joke.

513
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
But it was early.

514
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
To be fair to you, it was early.

515
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
It was early on.

516
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
And I think a lot of people were.

517
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
I think, well, I can't do that.

518
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
I can't bring other people in.

519
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,280
This is my own journey that I have to cop to and admit to.

520
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
But I was ashamed in this moment.

521
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,280
I can't believe I did the thing that everybody was doing, the thing that I disagree with now.

522
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
I think that's weird.

523
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,280
There's movies with a massive cultural impact where I don't think you could name a character.

524
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
No.

525
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
Like I was thinking about, like, get out.

526
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
What are the names of the characters in Get Out?

527
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,280
You watched it recently.

528
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
I watched it recently.

529
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Oh, I don't know the answer.

530
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
I like it.

531
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
But I like it.

532
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
And it's clearly a phenomenon.

533
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,280
I don't think the measure of it is necessarily, OK, well, then name five characters.

534
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,280
I remember the scenes and the message and the filmmaking.

535
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Well, I remember.

536
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
I had pulled up, like, popular.

537
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Like, I looked up just the phrase movies of 2009, the year it came out.

538
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,280
And there was some good ones, like Fantastic Mr. Fox.

539
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
I like a lot.

540
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
And Glorious Basterds.

541
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
I like a lot.

542
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
And Glorious Basterds.

543
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
I like a lot.

544
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
And then it's just...

545
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Name a bastard.

546
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Name one bastard.

547
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,280
It just goes downhill from there.

548
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:44,280
It's like knowing, push, up in the air.

549
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Oh, Coraline was good.

550
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Couples retreat.

551
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
Madea goes to jail.

552
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
I've seen a lot of those movies.

553
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Her I can name.

554
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
I can name Madea.

555
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
I think we can all name Madea.

556
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Law abiding citizen gamer.

557
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Like, is this is grim stuff.

558
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,280
The human centipede.

559
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Wait, I remember the name.

560
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Wait, maybe I don't.

561
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
The name of the director is like a weird.

562
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
It's like Tom Dex.

563
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Of what?

564
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Of Human Centipede.

565
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,280
It's a weird like Kurt, like Bo Ox.

566
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Yeah.

567
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
What is it?

568
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
I like it.

569
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,280
I can't name a character, but I do remember.

570
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
Well, I don't remember his name.

571
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
No, it's Stefan Johans.

572
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
What?

573
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Yeah.

574
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
Who am I thinking of?

575
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
I don't want to get off that.

576
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Sorry, that might be the human centipede.

577
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Tom Six.

578
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Tom Six is what I'm thinking.

579
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Great name, Tom Six.

580
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,280
But yeah, look, these are movies.

581
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,280
What you're saying, Jason, is these are hit films of 2009.

582
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,280
And we are running these through the fucking quiz device of can you name a character?

583
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,280
I think it's strange.

584
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
I will say real quick, I hate to cut you off.

585
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:02,280
I believe I did a very similar bit and I just looked it up at UCB and I did it 10 years ago in 2012.

586
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Okay.

587
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,280
At another entertainment based debate show live called The Turn of the Nerds that I did for many years.

588
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:16,280
This is primarily my career before the podcast was debating things on stage or on the internet.

589
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,280
Wearing costumes in that case like I'm wearing.

590
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,280
I must be flashing you, but you feel like you're debating a Navi.

591
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
Well, I was representing Jake Sully.

592
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
That's the gist of that show.

593
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
I pick a character.

594
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
But I was doing a similar bit.

595
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
I don't know if I said the line.

596
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,280
I'd have to find my notes.

597
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,280
But the bit was like you can't, you don't know or it was like underlining people don't know this character.

598
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,280
A thing that I did early, this is all in the weeds.

599
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,280
You're literally in the weeds as you record.

600
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:49,280
12 years ago when I did my second show ever at UCB, which is probably 2010, I was representing a show called NBC's The Cape.

601
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Which was a show that was a made up superhero and the whole bit was just reality show.

602
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,280
No, it was a scripted drama show called NBC's The Cape.

603
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:07,280
And the whole bit that worked the whole night was me just listing all the things as if people knew it.

604
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Like Max Malini and his underground carnival of crime.

605
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,280
You have that without people who were just listening.

606
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
He did not look that up.

607
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
I did not look that up.

608
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,280
You remembered Max Malini and his underground carnival.

609
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,280
I have heard Mike say Max Malini and his underground carnival of crime so many times.

610
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,280
By the way, we may as well second gate it now that I've said it.

611
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,280
It doesn't sound like Mike to have some long pop cultural phrase in his head.

612
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
He can just spit out at the drop of a hat.

613
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Ruvie, The Hypnotist I think and Rollo, there's Circus People and Mina Savari was on the show.

614
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:47,280
So I think I established sort of a bit and then I did the same bit with Avatar a year or two later.

615
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Are you forgetting another podcast connection with that bit?

616
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Yes.

617
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,280
You had me dress up as a Navi.

618
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
Oh yeah.

619
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:04,280
I was cleaning out an old prop box and I found a skirt like a bamboo.

620
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,280
I think you dress up as a lot of things in the last 12 years.

621
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:15,280
I found like an old rotting tube of blue paint and like a rotting spandex blue shirt.

622
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Jason dressed up as Ted once and he drank blood.

623
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Actually, I dressed up as Ted a number of times.

624
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Just to go to bed.

625
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
Just to go to jammies.

626
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,280
I just want to admit that I probably also had a similar thing I said 10 years ago.

627
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:40,280
What I'm getting at is I was, you know, because I do think there's just been two, there was one a couple years ago where I was like, we're still making this joke at this point.

628
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
And I don't know if it's just because of doing this podcast.

629
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
I know everyone in Avatar.

630
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:53,280
I know Jake Sully and Natiri and Colonel Miles Corritch and Parker Selfridge and Dr. Grace Augustine, who is not Dr. Jackie Ogden.

631
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,280
It might just be podcast.

632
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,280
But also, I do think this movie has grown pop culturally, not like bigger than like opening weekends.

633
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,280
But I think it I think it has lasted and it's lasted partially because of the theme parks and also, yes, exactly.

634
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,280
Now, why are we not saying I don't think people even care about couples retreat anymore?

635
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Why is this movie or like fucking like how about any of the streaming movies that well that was viewed by five billion people in the first hour?

636
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,280
Oh, OK. So now anyone name a character from Red Notice.

637
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,280
The Grey Man.

638
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
Name the Grey Man.

639
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
The Grey Man.

640
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
He's just calling the Grey Man.

641
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Is he just the Grey Man?

642
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,280
I'll assume Johnny Extraction, the main character from Extraction.

643
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,280
I think look, Nicky Bird Box.

644
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:54,280
I think I think we don't we won't know the impact of these for 10 years, but we could look at something like Lily Hammer, Netflix's first show starring one of my favorite actors of all time, Little Stephen, your favorite actors, Little Stephen, Little Stephen van Zandt from the East Street Band.

645
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,280
And yes, I don't think people remember Lily.

646
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Lily Hammer has not necessarily grown.

647
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
I'm not saying it's a bad show.

648
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
I'm just saying it's not grown culturally.

649
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,280
So but it was a big hit.

650
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:10,280
I think if anything has it is this my appreciation for Avatar has grown.

651
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
I think maybe all of ours has.

652
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
And there's something about it's really it's Mike.

653
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
It's what you do with a thousand things.

654
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,280
You love something or you have a feeling about something and you can't tell.

655
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Do I put this in the Kitsch box or do I like it?

656
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,280
So maybe you put it in the Kitsch box because that's easier to process.

657
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,280
The longer it stays in there, you decide I'm going to put it in that other box.

658
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
And that's me with Avatar.

659
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
It might be a lot of people with Avatar.

660
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Sure.

661
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Look, it's going to be the biggest movie of Christmas time of this year.

662
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
There's no doubt about that.

663
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Of course, 2023, the big movie will be the Netflix crossover senior versus Stutz, which which will be a Robert Downey senior facing off against Jonah Hill's therapist.

664
00:31:51,280 --> 00:32:00,280
The two black and white Netflix documentaries that appear to be being released right around the same time.

665
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,280
And they have big movie stars in them.

666
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
But that doesn't mean these are vanity projects.

667
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,280
Netflix wanted to tell the story of the less famous person.

668
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,280
But look, senior versus Stutz, no matter who wins, we lose.

669
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,280
It's an alien.

670
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,280
It's an alien versus predator.

671
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
It's an alien versus predator.

672
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
It's pretty clear.

673
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,280
We all.

674
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Yeah.

675
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
Senior versus Stutz.

676
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Get ready for that.

677
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Can anyone name a predator?

678
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,280
I can't.

679
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
I can't.

680
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
You can.

681
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
I don't even know that.

682
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
I actually know.

683
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
You know what?

684
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
I can name the toys.

685
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
I can name the different toys of predator that necessarily didn't appear in the go ahead.

686
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Show laser shot predator.

687
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Yeah, I don't think that's what's in the movie.

688
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
It's not.

689
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
But it's cool.

690
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,280
If you look it up, I just saw it in Target.

691
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:52,280
I guess what I'm saying is I can stay ashamed that I made this joke or I can grow.

692
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
I can evolve.

693
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,280
I like Jake, who started as a mere jarhead, who was just following orders, who was just

694
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,280
moving robotically through day to day, not living life.

695
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:11,280
And he went to, he did the biostasis and went to Pandora and he was born anew and rose to

696
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
become a Taruk Makhto.

697
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:20,280
And that's what I'm doing today, who of course is the ultimate Navi warrior who led them

698
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
to redemption against the sky people.

699
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
Of course.

700
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,280
And that's what I'm trying to do currently and in this episode in an embracing avatar.

701
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,280
And I thank all of you for embracing me on this journey.

702
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Well, we welcome you.

703
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
We say, and I have to do this one more time.

704
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Well, Nahti Kame, I see you.

705
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
I see you.

706
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
I see you, Jason.

707
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Jason, I see you.

708
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
Could you say it to him?

709
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
Well, Nahti Kame.

710
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Wow.

711
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Well, Nahti Kame.

712
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,280
And I would like Mike and Jason to say, I see you to each other.

713
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,280
But I think because that plant is there, I think you literally can't see each other.

714
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
I cannot see your face.

715
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Well, Nahti Kame.

716
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,280
Now put it back again like the viper wolves in the distance.

717
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
This is beautiful.

718
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:09,280
This is the most, it's as sincere of an episode as I assume Way of Water will be as a film.

719
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:18,280
So I guess it would just, you know, to not take too long, though we could certainly talk about general avatar world, we should probably start dipping into Navi River Journey.

720
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
Yes.

721
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,280
The other big avatar ride, we sort of talked about Flight of Passage, a live show a couple years ago.

722
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,280
We'll talk about the cereal on a second gate, I think.

723
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Are you declaring that the cereal is its own?

724
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
I think so.

725
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Well, I don't know.

726
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Well, maybe it's its own.

727
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
We'll talk about it.

728
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
We have to discuss it.

729
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
We actually don't know what the other ones are.

730
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
But we know main feed, Navi River Journey, you got to do the big other ride.

731
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
And maybe the cereal is its own.

732
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,280
One episode on the cereal, one episode on the weird babies, the weird doll babies.

733
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Oh yeah, there are weird ones.

734
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
It's not a bad pitch for what they are.

735
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
We'll see.

736
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
One of them may have already come out.

737
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
You might know what it is.

738
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,280
But anyway, Navi River Journey is what we're here for.

739
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,280
And I don't know.

740
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
I mean, how to even get into it?

741
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,280
I mean, this is a ride that is the Avatar vibe fully.

742
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Like the whole journey of it is just swim in the Avatar vibe for seven minutes.

743
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,280
And it's not about story and it's not about conflict.

744
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
It's just like a story through experience.

745
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
Soak this up.

746
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
Yeah.

747
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Just going through the rainforest down the, hold on, I have it.

748
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
I got to.

749
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
I got to.

750
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,280
The Kaspa Van River.

751
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,280
I think maybe V, it might be Kazva Pan.

752
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Kazva Pan, okay.

753
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
Possibly.

754
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
If I copy pasted.

755
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Whose copy and paste was correct?

756
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
Yeah, in the Moara Valley.

757
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Yeah, of course the Moara Valley.

758
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,280
Yeah, this is, I would say this is, obviously the Flight of Passage is the...

759
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
E-ticket.

760
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
E-ticket.

761
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,280
The one everybody knows, the one everybody probably would prefer to go on.

762
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:13,280
But in a lot of ways, this is more the Avatar ride in its tone and its mood.

763
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
Yeah, it's got the bioluminescence.

764
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
It's got the creatures.

765
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Because even though the movie, look, Avatar has to have action in it because it has to appeal to the masses.

766
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,280
But if it was, I think it's just because people like that in movies.

767
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,280
But truly, I think if it was as pure...

768
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,280
I think if James Cameron who had his druthers, it would just be more peaceful.

769
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
It would be more just sort of a hangout movie.

770
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:41,280
You think that James Cameron, the director of Terminator and Terminator and True Lies, did not want to...

771
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
He was forced to put action into...

772
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Well, by the public in a way, yeah.

773
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
And then they're going to want that shit.

774
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,280
Yeah, but it's only, I think if, you know, he's talking about now if two and three, they have four and five ready to go.

775
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,280
But he's like, I don't know, we'll see if it makes money and then that'll happen.

776
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,280
But I feel like if you really can expand the Avatar universe, there's going to be a lot more chilled out movies.

777
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
There's going to be more...

778
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,280
Just kind of a not so worried about plot, just kind of like a...

779
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,280
Because that's what everybody likes.

780
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Richard Linklater type.

781
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
Like Slacker, yeah, I was going to say like Slacker.

782
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Yeah, it'll be like that.

783
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Because everyone, I think, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

784
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
Everybody's favorite part of Flight of Passage is the quiet part.

785
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Is when you kind of park in the cave and you see the bioluminescence and everything lights up.

786
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Don't would you? I mean, maybe I'm incorrect here.

787
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
I have not like watched a ride through of it since doing it.

788
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,280
So I don't remember the scenes so thoroughly.

789
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
Jason, you know what I'm talking about?

790
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

791
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
I watched a...

792
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
You don't remember going into the cave?

793
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,280
Then we look it up and there was no scene like that.

794
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,280
I know there's a scene.

795
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
I know this is right.

796
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,280
I recall, yeah, it does like really, as opposed to Soarin', which is like a serene ride.

797
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,280
It does like step down for a minute.

798
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
It does the thing I talk about.

799
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,280
I guess it's sort of intimate.

800
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,280
But it's like the things I was talking about on a ride like when C-3PO wheels around and he goes,

801
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,280
looks like we've just joined the Rebel Alliance.

802
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
And there's like a beat.

803
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
It's a good like solid beat of like, take it in.

804
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
This is what we're doing.

805
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,280
It's longer than that though on Flight of Passage where you park and there's this whole like kind of lights display.

806
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
You watched that kind of a color transformation in the cave.

807
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Yes.

808
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Okay, okay.

809
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,280
But it's an interesting like nice like pause point in the middle of a more action ride.

810
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Well, I watched a lot of the videos leading the making of Pandora.

811
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
A lot of them are still online.

812
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:46,280
Some of them are still online, but websites and YouTube channels have put their watermark in the corner

813
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,280
despite it being like clearly Disney promotional stuff.

814
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Fuck you.

815
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Jason's called you out motherfuckers.

816
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,280
Get your water.

817
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,280
It's not the way of watermark.

818
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,280
Nice try assholes.

819
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:05,280
But they do talk about in that ride that depending on what level you end up on, the ride is a little different.

820
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Right, like Soren's like that.

821
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Yeah, Soren's like that too.

822
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
You don't want to be.

823
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
You can't plan to go like.

824
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
I guess you can request.

825
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,280
I know you can ask on Soren to go in the road.

826
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
Okay, you can.

827
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Yeah, you can.

828
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
I mean, you can ask on any ride to go front row.

829
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Oh, like they'll be they'll they might go like you might hear a noise.

830
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,280
Yeah, but they will oftentimes if you just go, oh, can I go on front row?

831
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Maybe we haven't talked about this on the show.

832
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,280
That would be insane after five years.

833
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:36,280
But if for most rides at Disneyland, at least you can go and ask the cast member and be polite and just go, would it be possible?

834
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
We'll wait.

835
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,280
But like, could we go in the front row like the first row or we can go like you can make a request and they'll generally kind of pull you to the side.

836
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,280
And you'll just wait a little like an extra couple of minutes.

837
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Yes.

838
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
So yeah, for Soren, at least you can do that.

839
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
And I would assume has pre show rooms.

840
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Yeah, that other you're right.

841
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,280
That might be too complicated.

842
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,280
It's like depending on where you go with the pre show is where you end up level wise.

843
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,280
Right.

844
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Such a big, big I mean, I'm sure a cast member knows, but I don't know if people have.

845
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Yeah.

846
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
Experience.

847
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Well, is there a preferred spot on it?

848
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
I actually don't know.

849
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Center better because the I'm just comparing it to Simpson slash back to the future where if you're in a severe corner, more so than Soren.

850
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,280
Soren kind of everywhere is OK, but you can get kind of bendy if you're in a corner.

851
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
If you get under if you're on the third row.

852
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,280
Yeah.

853
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,280
You really see this curve under of the of the circular screen and then you see the legs.

854
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Yeah.

855
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Yeah.

856
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
I think Simpson's especially bad slash back to the future.

857
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Yeah.

858
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
I actually don't know the prime flight of passage.

859
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:48,280
Compare that to Navi River Journey, which it's like, as you said, you already said intimate, but a number of places when I was reading about that said like, oh, this is a boat ride.

860
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:54,280
It's a Disney boat ride, but it's more intimate than, say, like Pirates of the Caribbean and stuff because the boats are smaller.

861
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
The boats fit like six to eight people.

862
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Sure. Yeah.

863
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
And they're that small, really?

864
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,280
Yeah.

865
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
That's probably why.

866
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,280
And because I also looked at like, what are the average wait times?

867
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,280
And it is often above an hour.

868
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
Oh, yeah.

869
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,280
I've never gotten right on this.

870
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,280
Yeah.

871
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,280
What you I think the land is so popular and it's always popular, even years after it opened.

872
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,280
I guess that makes sense that it would be that long.

873
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,280
It's I mean, look, I guess this is I don't have to say this, but it's too short.

874
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
It is too short.

875
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
That's the only problem with it as far as I'm concerned.

876
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,280
And I feel like that's part of why they can't can't run people through it.

877
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Yeah.

878
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,280
It's like pirates is notoriously people eating.

879
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Yeah.

880
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
In the sense that like it's such a long ride.

881
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
So you can like send people down there and they'll be there for it.

882
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
It feels like you're in.

883
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,280
It feels like you're on pirates for an hour every time you're not.

884
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
But it's such a long ride.

885
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,280
Yeah.

886
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Yeah.

887
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,280
So this is but the Navi River journey is so quick.

888
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,280
Well, let me throw this down as a just to inform the rest of the discussion.

889
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:03,280
I think I alluded to this in a previous episode while I am trying to embrace Avatar and be a Tarrouk Mukto.

890
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,280
My initial reaction to this ride is I did not love this ride.

891
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,280
I have no hate in my heart for this ride.

892
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:19,280
But on the day, this was the this ride was the moment where I was like, I do want to tap out of Avatar vibe.

893
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
I have had enough of it for this morning.

894
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
Really?

895
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
It was.

896
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,280
And I think it is the line that killed it.

897
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,280
I think because it was a long wait and there's not a lot going on in that queue.

898
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:43,280
So I think my general theory is if this word for what you get for what the ride is, I think if that line was 20 minutes, I think that's great.

899
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
You're sailing.

900
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,280
And while that was fun, but the buildup becomes so much after 45 to an hour, we've talked about this before.

901
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,280
We talked about talked about on the Spider-Man, not islands, the California Adventure Ride.

902
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:11,280
If a line has like if you can see the line the whole time, psychologically, it makes it worse in the sense that when a line like Flight of Passage, which is an insanely long line, has so many different scenes and you don't know where you're going.

903
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,280
And you're always like you could probably forget the order of scenes in it.

904
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,280
If yeah, like resistance.

905
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,280
Yeah, every every room is pretty different.

906
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Now it's the outside part.

907
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,280
Now here's kind of the lab is the artillery part.

908
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:36,280
Here's the you would rather wait in a probably like an hour long hour and a half long line like that versus 30 minutes in a line that just kind of feels like they've temporarily set up a line like for a shoe release or something.

909
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
Yes.

910
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:45,280
And then looking at it, it's kind of this like woven ceiling vibe and there is the woven is the term I think for a lot of the aesthetics of this.

911
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,280
It's like kind of a kind of an overhang that's like a canopy.

912
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,280
It's kind of like where the Navib sleep a little bit.

913
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,280
And then there's like woven gifts or like tributes to a wall.

914
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,280
They're God.

915
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Of course, we know we can name this.

916
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
We all know.

917
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,280
But and and then the boats themselves are a woven kind of vibe.

918
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
Yeah.

919
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,280
Read boats, I think is what you call the boats.

920
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
But so which and it's cool.

921
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,280
The environment is cool.

922
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,280
But you get in there and yes, it shows all its cards.

923
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,280
I'm going to be going back and forth in this room for a long time.

924
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,280
And it's that animal kingdom heat and humidity.

925
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,280
Uh huh.

926
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,280
And it yeah, I think I needed it to be like spectacular.

927
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
And when the line in the way.

928
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,280
Right.

929
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,280
And when the line is so compact like that, it's also there's a psychological thing.

930
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,280
I think it happens when you start to you, you incorrectly perceive how quick it is.

931
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,280
Like where you go, OK, it looks like we go like here and we loop around and then we're in.

932
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,280
And then you might loop around and you go, holy shit, I didn't realize that the thing is so compact.

933
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,280
There's like three more lanes I have to go through before it gets there.

934
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,280
Does that happen to you?

935
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,280
Because I have you like time unlock.

936
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,280
Yeah, you realize, oh, no, I did not have you think.

937
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Yeah, there's a little zone.

938
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,280
Right to the zone.

939
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:04,280
Yeah, you miss zones all the time when you're in and when cues like this because your brain goes, oh, it seems like it's 10 minutes because it's like real close.

940
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,280
And you go, oh, my God, no, there's an extra extra like, yeah, it's all like a weird maze.

941
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,280
Well, so the day we did it, it was also the hottest day of the week we were there.

942
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,280
That was the hottest day.

943
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,280
OK, yeah, sure.

944
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,280
Worst part to be in on the hottest day.

945
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,280
And then the next day at Islands of Adventure was the coldest day.

946
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:33,280
So but I have a different scenario that when I was down with my family, we got in line for this just as it started pouring rain.

947
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,280
OK, really hard.

948
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,280
So it was kind of a feeling of thank God we're in this cave for 40 minutes.

949
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,280
Thank thank who?

950
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,280
Thank Awa.

951
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,280
Yes.

952
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
Excuse me.

953
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,280
Yeah.

954
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:54,280
Oh, no, that that actually, you know, that's that's where the day impacts your experience on the right.

955
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,280
So you it's it's shelter to you.

956
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:02,280
It's like, you know, cozy made by the by the locals shelter.

957
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,280
Yeah, it was it's very like comforting inviting.

958
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,280
The other thing.

959
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,280
Well, I think Jane ducked out of the line and came back to use the bathroom.

960
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,280
And they also like they kind of know this line is a little oppressive because they had cards ready.

961
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,280
It's like, oh, OK, here, take this and then give it back to me when you come back and we will let you back in the line.

962
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,280
Well, I like that.

963
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,280
I give you to the cards.

964
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,280
This is a very this is implemented more often usage.

965
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:40,280
But but so like if you are caught in a downpour and you're in Pandora, your options are getting one of the big lines, go in the pretty small store or go in the fairly large restaurant.

966
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,280
But I think everyone is going to the fairly large dress.

967
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,280
There's a lot of covered outdoor seating at the restaurant.

968
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,280
OK, sure. Yeah.

969
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:54,280
OK, so given so well, this is maybe proof that the line experience does impact your feeling on this.

970
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,280
Yes, because this as we said, this is not a plot driven ride.

971
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,280
If you haven't been on it, not at all.

972
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,280
It might be one of the least plot driven rides there there is.

973
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,280
This is a vibes based ride.

974
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,280
Yeah, like Small World, like Small World doesn't have a plot.

975
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,280
Yeah.

976
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,280
Now, yes.

977
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,280
And I figured I figured Small World and maybe other like slow, slow moving boats would come up.

978
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,280
And there's no plot to Small World.

979
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,280
But let me here's why I like Small World more than Navi River Journey.

980
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:31,280
There is, as you were saying with the line progression there, there's every room is a little different.

981
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,280
Here's here's Ireland.

982
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,280
Here's India.

983
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,280
Here's South America.

984
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,280
And here it's the big grand room where everything's like gold.

985
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,280
And it's longer.

986
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,280
And it's longer. Yeah, absolutely.

987
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,280
And you know, it doesn't like I don't know.

988
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,280
It's it's it's scenes and moments.

989
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,280
Oh, and there's the crocodile.

990
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,280
And then here's the one who's like on the tightrope.

991
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:58,280
And this ride kind of feels like it's all the same a little bit.

992
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,280
Like, am I crazy to say that that you not like Pete?

993
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,280
Like there's not seen there's not mood change.

994
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,280
There's not. Yes.

995
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,280
It's not even a mood change like you described in Flight of Passage where I now here's the part where it's kind of dark and still.

996
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:18,280
And that's different than where it's like glowing and sunny and golden, you know, golden yellow out there.

997
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:31,280
Well, it's interesting. I think it kind of builds like it's it's like the first chunk of the ride is the jungle, you know, and you're just sort of getting you see some Navi pretty quickly.

998
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:38,280
The viper wolves, which I keep saying that phrase, the kind of panther like creatures that are in the distance.

999
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,280
Yes, which I believe are screens.

1000
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:53,280
I feel like I heard at some point like this, I think is a great use of like screens in the distance, but a lot of practical sets kind of disguising that their screen practical stuff really like on the board.

1001
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:01,280
You know, it's it's like so everything's like there's natural shapes and canopies kind of like infused into the screen.

1002
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,280
So it doesn't feel like here is a here is a hard rectangle where the screen begins.

1003
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:13,280
Yeah. So you kind of get your bearings like in the jungle and then you start to hear more music in the distance.

1004
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,280
People off stage singing and stuff.

1005
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:25,280
And then as you come up on the big star of the ride, it's one creature singing directly at you.

1006
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,280
Mm hmm. Yes. Yeah. But do you but I don't feel like those environments are radically different.

1007
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,280
Like I don't I don't feel any like there's the jungle.

1008
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,280
But then there's this. Yeah.

1009
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:42,280
It kind of is all the same, which is not that's not the you know, I don't mean to hold it to the fire in that way.

1010
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,280
I ride through one. It's a very cool place.

1011
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,280
I think I think people would like it better overall.

1012
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,280
I think it would have more raves if not even lengthwise.

1013
00:49:51,280 --> 00:50:00,280
I think if it did a little bit of what you're talking about felt like there were more distinct pieces for it because like most rides that people like.

1014
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,280
I've said some sort of version of this theory and I'm going to I don't probably won't be the exact same.

1015
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,280
But like every ride is like five moves.

1016
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,280
There's like a big move that it'll have.

1017
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,280
Like you have to remember like kind of tent poles of it.

1018
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,280
And it's not necessarily about length. It's about like memorability.

1019
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,280
Yes. Yeah. And it does.

1020
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:24,280
So if it's a two and a half minute ride and you remember like five distinct pieces or move, think of it as a sweet.

1021
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,280
Think of it as a piece of music.

1022
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,280
What what nightmare are you going to break?

1023
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,280
Call. What are you going to compare it to?

1024
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,280
Why? Tchaikovsky's second.

1025
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,280
All right. All right.

1026
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,280
All right. I haven't heard the name Armstrong yet.

1027
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,280
I'm happy.

1028
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,280
You were expecting him to go like and when Black Hole Sun starts.

1029
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,280
That's that's more reputable than some of the stuff lately.

1030
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,280
21st century breakdown.

1031
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:53,280
Like so when this Third Eye Blind song that you've never heard begins.

1032
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,280
This not famous Third Eye Blind song.

1033
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,280
I think that's a fair criticism.

1034
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,280
I think maybe I knew going in a lot of what they were trying to do.

1035
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:11,280
I can't remember the I did this first or saw the Imagineering story, which also came out in 2019.

1036
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,280
I think that we were on it before.

1037
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,280
I think that may have cemented in my mind.

1038
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,280
The reason I started liking it more was that.

1039
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,280
Sorry. I'm just grabbing the water.

1040
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,280
It's just not difficult about this reaching through a potted plant.

1041
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:33,280
And you should probably do a little ICU to me because you just took an offer like you took you took from the land.

1042
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,280
Well, not a coming.

1043
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,280
I'd grab the one on top.

1044
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,280
It's really bothering me. I can't see Jason's face.

1045
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,280
No, we don't know.

1046
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,280
We like that. We like that.

1047
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,280
Yeah. Sorry.

1048
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,280
Jordan's Jordan's saying no, I leave this part in Jordan also.

1049
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,280
I'm just think that we want this top water bottle.

1050
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:57,280
Look, have I been spending the entirety of recording looking at it out of the corner of my eye because I'm terrified it's going to clatter to the table and scare me.

1051
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,280
Yeah. Oh, I've had I don't know.

1052
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,280
I don't have a lot of like face paint on very often.

1053
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,280
If you can imagine, I'm not going to I'm not putting on like Raider face paint or whatever.

1054
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:15,280
So having the dark blue right next to me makes me feel like a bug is on my face and it's going to like like chomp my eye any minute.

1055
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,280
So we're all having periphery problems.

1056
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,280
But and Mike, you're fine.

1057
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,280
You're fine.

1058
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,280
Everything's fine.

1059
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,280
You got nothing to worry about here.

1060
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,280
I got a coffee and a plant.

1061
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:34,280
But so the Imagineering story, I think what made me like this ride more because I liked it a lot like when we were riding it.

1062
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,280
And I really enjoyed it.

1063
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,280
I think I had heard Rody Rody's quote on this ride that's been repeated a few times.

1064
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,280
This is intended for it was just plain beauty.

1065
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:51,280
And and Cameron, too, I feel like it's like this is just a beautiful experience and bioluminescence.

1066
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,280
You get see so much of the bioluminescence.

1067
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:05,280
But in the Imagineering story, they say they were trying to do something that they hadn't done before, which is evoke feelings of serenity, which rides don't often do.

1068
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,280
Sure. Right. It's like a spa.

1069
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,280
Today's spa ride.

1070
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,280
Yeah.

1071
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:15,280
It's like a peaceful day spa ride, which makes sense then that you're not going to have like a scene that feels like a little more tumultuous.

1072
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,280
And it sounds good to me.

1073
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,280
Like I think it's like this is length.

1074
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,280
I think it's length.

1075
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:28,280
Well, let me say because I find Soren to be a serene ride to be like that's the equivalent of like driving up to the winery for the day.

1076
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,280
Sure.

1077
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,280
But there's still but it seems there's like an hour here and now we're here.

1078
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:41,280
I think there is a way for this to have the serenity, but also a little more of moves as might to combine both of your interests.

1079
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:48,280
It kind of reminds me of the opening of Animal Kingdom as a whole, where it's like, oh, we're trying to do something different.

1080
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,280
We're trying to show, you know, man's fascination with nature and animals and stuff.

1081
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,280
And people kind of responded to that with like, but what about rides?

1082
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,280
Yeah.

1083
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,280
Are you like these ingrates, these fools?

1084
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:11,280
No, no, I think I think it is a thing that designers and companies need to consider more is like, well, how are normal people going to perceive this?

1085
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,280
Like, how are your neighbors or your distant relatives?

1086
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,280
How are your cousins?

1087
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,280
Yeah.

1088
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,280
How are dads? How are your cousins?

1089
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,280
I mean, they do need to think about cousins.

1090
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,280
I think.

1091
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,280
Yeah.

1092
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,280
And they know we are.

1093
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,280
The theme parks are not polling cousins.

1094
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,280
Yeah.

1095
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,280
That's not like that.

1096
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,280
I don't like the phrase that phrase.

1097
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,280
Polling.

1098
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,280
Who do you think buys the tickets?

1099
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,280
All I know is Bob Iger is going to poll cousins.

1100
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,280
That's one of the things he's going to be doing now that he's back.

1101
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:41,280
So, yeah, I, I do think you need less.

1102
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,280
Yeah.

1103
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:49,280
It's an interesting experiment to see if this ride like what is a 15 minute version of this ride look like with no moves, quote unquote.

1104
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,280
Mm hmm.

1105
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,280
I don't think that's rough.

1106
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,280
But I don't I don't know that it's rough.

1107
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,280
I think maybe though you're calm.

1108
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,280
Like, you know, you go into a day spa.

1109
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,280
It's it lasts 30 minutes, 45 minutes, an hour, depending, maybe longer.

1110
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,280
You go into the sauna.

1111
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,280
You go.

1112
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,280
There's a whole thing.

1113
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,280
It's not.

1114
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,280
Have you, by the way, Mike, have I been to a day spa?

1115
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,280
Yeah.

1116
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,280
Yeah.

1117
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,280
Yeah.

1118
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,280
Not often.

1119
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,280
And have you ever done a massage or whatever in Vegas?

1120
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,280
I have not.

1121
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,280
No.

1122
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,280
Jason.

1123
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,280
I'm like too.

1124
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,280
I'm too uptight to even do it.

1125
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,280
Not in Vegas.

1126
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,280
A couple of times.

1127
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,280
Like in L.A.

1128
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,280
Every time I go to L.A.

1129
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,280
I feel like I've literally had a massage five times in my life, I think.

1130
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,280
Yeah.

1131
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,280
Every time I go in L.A., it's like not I don't know.

1132
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,280
I don't know if it's a way to massage town.

1133
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,280
Planet Hollywood.

1134
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,280
Where's this going?

1135
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,280
That was hard.

1136
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,280
We split.

1137
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,280
We did a fast.

1138
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:40,280
The reason I the reason I say that I get so excited is because this woman gave me a massage

1139
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,280
at Planet Hollywood that no hotel, not the restaurant.

1140
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,280
Yeah.

1141
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,280
The waitress at Planet Hollywood, the server at Planet Hollywood.

1142
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,280
She used the hands from she used the hand from the Adams family thing.

1143
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,280
She pulled thing out.

1144
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,280
Yeah.

1145
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,280
OK.

1146
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,280
Drop the L.A. lasagna and then, you know, take out the thing.

1147
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,280
She's rubbing L.A. lasagna sauce on my back.

1148
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,280
She took the naked Stallone out and put me in that tub and I stripped nude and then I

1149
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,280
got a massage by from thing from the Adams family.

1150
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,280
Honestly, that sounds great.

1151
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,280
That's what massages were.

1152
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,280
The only thing was it was just I was on display for the entire restaurant.

1153
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,280
But that was worth it for free massage.

1154
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,280
Worth the shame.

1155
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,280
But anyway, the one time I had this massage in Vegas, I remember after we're just like

1156
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,280
kind of turning my neck and going, my neck feels cleaner.

1157
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,280
Mm hmm.

1158
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,280
Like I just remember it feeling just like she whatever she did, she really knew what

1159
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,280
she was doing.

1160
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,280
And then afterward, yeah, there's just a whole area where like there's a sauna.

1161
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,280
You can just chill out.

1162
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,280
And there's some people in there depending on how busy it is.

1163
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,280
But but he doesn't let me say this even is in a day spa.

1164
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,280
Aren't there like the different rooms?

1165
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,280
That's like very different vibes.

1166
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:57,280
I'm not against steps to the so I think a day spa experience can still have.

1167
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,280
Here is the stone room.

1168
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,280
Yeah, sure.

1169
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,280
Son of part or whatever.

1170
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,280
Yeah, I'm not against moves because they're peaceful moves.

1171
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,280
It's not like we want to have a fight break out during this ride.

1172
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,280
Yes, I know what.

1173
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,280
Yeah, I don't think I would pitch anything that is beyond.

1174
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,280
Yeah, I understand the vibe.

1175
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,280
But this just it felt to me like it almost felt to me like the the like the ride that

1176
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,280
takes you to another.

1177
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,280
Yeah, yeah.

1178
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,280
Another place.

1179
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,280
So when it's over, it feels a little like that was OK.

1180
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,280
I and I think I would if it was even just here's the part where you go through a

1181
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:38,280
cave and it's pretty dark and there's only a couple sparse glowing creatures or

1182
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:44,280
or you like you are about to hit a waterfall, but then it clears right before.

1183
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:49,280
So, you know, like I think there's ways to keep the vibe but still have moments you

1184
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,280
remember. I mean, I think we're running into I think it was budget.

1185
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,280
I think I remember reading this was cut.

1186
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,280
But it wasn't.

1187
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,280
Yeah. And this may be total conjecture.

1188
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,280
I don't know.

1189
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,280
But I remember at the time reading that this wasn't the I mean, nothing is ever the

1190
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,280
blue sky version.

1191
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,280
Well, you might be butting up against practical reality because both these rides, you

1192
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,280
don't really pay attention to this.

1193
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,280
You can't help from the outside.

1194
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,280
They made a mistake.

1195
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,280
They regret it now, I believe, because the issue with this and I think we talked

1196
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,280
about it before.

1197
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,280
Maybe we didn't is that both flight of passage and River Journey are in the same

1198
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,280
building.

1199
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,280
So the problem with that is if somebody pulls a fire alarm, it shuts down both

1200
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,280
rides.

1201
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,280
Yeah.

1202
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,280
And I think it was a practical like they were like, oh, this makes sense.

1203
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,280
We'll build it on top of it or each other.

1204
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,280
But I think there's issues now with like one.

1205
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,280
Both rides have to go down at the same time if something like that happens.

1206
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,280
Imagine if that was the case in Galaxy's Edge with how often these are like these

1207
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,280
are pretty prickly rides.

1208
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,280
They do things that have never been done.

1209
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,280
So, yeah, I guess I'm pretty far apart.

1210
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,280
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

1211
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,280
Yes, a whole other because Falcon's a huge building.

1212
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,280
Falcon's huge.

1213
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,280
Yeah, I know this because I would bring you up to the top of the parking garage and

1214
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,280
show you that's the building.

1215
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,280
We would.

1216
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,280
Yes, we would look down from that parking garage.

1217
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,280
So, yeah, I think from the message boards I read at the time, I think the vision of

1218
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,280
this was grander.

1219
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:20,280
But then, yeah, the issue is like if you want peaceful stuff, you can't throw in

1220
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,280
mood like I guess I like you can't you can't keep the same vibe going and then

1221
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,280
change things drastically.

1222
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,280
I feel like what is it?

1223
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,280
How long is the ride?

1224
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,280
Do you have the exact time?

1225
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,280
Yes, four minutes or something.

1226
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,280
It feels like they went with, okay, we want this one feeling versus we want to

1227
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,280
continually throw stuff at you because that's what it would have to be then, I think.

1228
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:49,280
I swear it is just like here's the like this room is really pink in this room because

1229
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,280
there are like here's pink plants.

1230
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,280
Yeah.

1231
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,280
Which I have, you know, like I should say the actual names.

1232
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,280
I believe the panopyrus are the very pink plants.

1233
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,280
They're all kind of like round and jelly fishy.

1234
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,280
So it's a little tough to tell them apart.

1235
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,280
But there's a room where there's a lot of panopyrus.

1236
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,280
So if you were if it was even more if you were so flooded that it was like, all right,

1237
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,280
that was the pink part.

1238
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,280
Yeah.

1239
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,280
I'm not asking for much.

1240
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,280
No, I know.

1241
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,280
I mean, there's probably little tweaks.

1242
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,280
I guess you could throw a cave in there.

1243
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,280
Cave would be great.

1244
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,280
A cave because like, okay, you're outside.

1245
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,280
So you're not going to change the like the like makeup of the sky isn't going to

1246
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,280
change immediately.

1247
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,280
It's not going to I mean, I feel like the most memorable part up until the shaman is

1248
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,280
the frogs on the lily or not the frogs.

1249
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,280
Excuse me.

1250
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,280
I forget what the name of these creatures.

1251
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,280
Wait.

1252
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,280
Oh, I think I have it.

1253
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,280
The ones above you.

1254
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,280
Right.

1255
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,280
Yeah.

1256
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,280
You have those on there.

1257
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,280
Could it be the pro lemur is the pro lemur is the pro lemur is that sounds.

1258
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,280
Do you think I mean, this is kind of it's not quite a froggy creature.

1259
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,280
But does that seem correct what I'm showing you right now?

1260
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,280
I think there's there.

1261
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,280
Well, there are shadows.

1262
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,280
They're kind of silhouettes because you're looking maybe you can't tell.

1263
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,280
Yeah.

1264
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,280
Yeah.

1265
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,280
Yeah.

1266
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,280
There is there's a scattering of fan lizards.

1267
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,280
Fan lizards kind of had a little moment in the movie.

1268
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,280
I have some photos here.

1269
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,280
Yeah.

1270
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,280
Let's let's see some of those fan because this is the slightest difference.

1271
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,280
I feel I think I sent you fan.

1272
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,280
They're spinning around.

1273
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,280
Yeah.

1274
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,280
Yeah.

1275
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:22,280
I but my favorite discovery of them was that on the Avatar Wikipedia, according to James

1276
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:29,280
Cameron's Avatar, an activist survival guide, which is a 200 plus page book about the background

1277
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:35,280
of the world of Pandora, the fan lizard is one of Dr. Grace Augustine's favorite animals

1278
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,280
on Pandora.

1279
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,280
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, there they are heard and narrowed down

1280
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:44,280
because she knows them all and catalogs them and appreciates them and sees them.

1281
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,280
And we're looking at a fan lizard here now.

1282
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:52,280
And it's it's it's a spinny airborne creature, which makes it a little tough to tell the

1283
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,280
difference between a fan lizard and a wood sprite.

1284
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,280
Can we now see a wood sprite?

1285
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,280
Because a wood sprite is my favorite.

1286
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:08,280
I'm no doctor, but I love how slight and and delicate and feathery these are like they're

1287
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:15,280
like jellyfish, but with even less structure and biology.

1288
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,280
And I love these in the movie.

1289
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,280
Yeah, very much that like that.

1290
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,280
Then it looks so good in the recent in the release.

1291
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,280
They did see in these in 3D and they look really great in the red.

1292
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,280
This here's the thing I like in the ride a lot is seeing these guys floating around.

1293
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,280
Because how do you even like produce?

1294
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,280
How do you like?

1295
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,280
Of course, the imaginary can make like a big dumb blunt object.

1296
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:42,280
How do you make things so slight that it feels like it might dissolve if one drop of water hits it?

1297
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:48,280
They were selling like Christmas ornament versions of these and they were kind of rubbery,

1298
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,280
plasticky, and I was like, oh, that looks kind of cool.

1299
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,280
And I picked it up and I'm like, this feels like it's pretty broken for thirty dollars.

1300
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:00,280
I don't I don't want to take the risk to transport this back to California.

1301
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,280
Oh, bummer. Yeah, that's not the spirit of these.

1302
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,280
There's these are wispy.

1303
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,280
They're in the wind.

1304
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:14,280
There's a lot of things on this ride that are not easily overlooked and probably like being difficult to create.

1305
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,280
Like it's because it's so subtle.

1306
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,280
It's like the Shaman of Song is just impressive normally.

1307
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,280
But yes, you're right.

1308
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,280
Like how do you make this thing glow and how do you make it?

1309
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,280
Yeah, wait. Yeah. How are you lighting it?

1310
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,280
Is it sort of a lighting implement itself like the plants and Pandora?

1311
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,280
Right.

1312
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:39,280
I mean, I guess there's a fiber optic kind of way, but then it has to fly and not just it doesn't just float like it.

1313
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,280
It really it billows.

1314
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:47,280
It looks like an underwater creature, but in the air and there's no like and there's no, you know,

1315
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,280
multi-part book like the Haunted Mansion on this yet.

1316
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,280
The building of this. No, no.

1317
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,280
There's no picture of Gail Gracie type or Joe Rody.

1318
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,280
Nobody's getting credit for making these wood spray.

1319
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:03,280
This is where I think, you know, if the line is still muddy of like where does my genuine avatar?

1320
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,280
I think it's all here.

1321
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,280
I love the wood sprite so much.

1322
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:15,280
I wish they were in reality and I left the IMAX 3D screening of it a couple months ago feeling like I think I had a little bit of that avatar depression.

1323
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,280
I'm like, I'm going to go outside and there's no wood sprites.

1324
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,280
I don't get to show my son a wood sprite.

1325
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,280
We can't catch a wood sprite on our hands.

1326
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,280
The wood sprites are in that moment.

1327
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,280
I'm talking about in Flight of Passage.

1328
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,280
Okay.

1329
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,280
There is something.

1330
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,280
I think I said this before.

1331
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:40,280
The first time Lindsay and I went on Flight of Passage, we heard people react in the sense of like they were being pulled out of their favorite place.

1332
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:48,280
Like as soon as the ride was over, the people next to us went, oh, like, oh, like, put me back in the womb.

1333
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,280
Like, like, I want to go back.

1334
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,280
Like, let me go back.

1335
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,280
Wow.

1336
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,280
That's how I'm going to feel when I have to wipe this face paint off.

1337
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,280
Oh, no.

1338
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,280
Well, you can always, you know, you can always put it back on tomorrow.

1339
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:05,280
Every day until the movie comes out, which as we record this, it's still got like a month to go.

1340
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,280
Did you see?

1341
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,280
I also keep, I keep catching my hands in the view.

1342
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:11,280
Yeah, your hands are slowly becoming blue.

1343
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,280
Yes.

1344
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,280
Well, no, they became blue first because I had to use them to put the makeup on.

1345
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,280
And I'm very disturbed at how I've washed my hands several times.

1346
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,280
And this is the results.

1347
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,280
They're still rather blue.

1348
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,280
Aaron said I'm going to get into arrested development.

1349
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,280
Yeah.

1350
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:32,280
Territory is going to be like blue touches all over the house for months.

1351
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:41,280
There there's like we've talked about the small world has like kind of a warehouse feel, which I believe I criticized and everybody else said they liked it.

1352
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:47,280
And I think maybe everyone else is right that it's like I think no, I think I like I love the industrial.

1353
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,280
Yes.

1354
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,280
But I acknowledge I think I believe that that's correct.

1355
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:56,280
I think I've changed my mind on it since I've gone because this is five years ago when we talked about this.

1356
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:00,280
Yeah, that's that's something in the five years we all have plenty of time to grow.

1357
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:06,280
Yeah, which I and I know the pressure is on for me to evolve and start to see the briefcase story.

1358
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:11,280
Someone I think an iTunes review once where like you guys change your mind all the time.

1359
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,280
It was like, yes, we're correct because we're human.

1360
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:19,280
Correct were evolved because we take in information and then we proceed differently.

1361
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,280
Maybe that's maybe if that's what our politicians did.

1362
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,280
All right, Cameron.

1363
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,280
All right.

1364
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,280
Slow it down.

1365
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,280
But this right.

1366
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:34,280
I think this all right is also a little bit of a victim of the size of the rooms are small.

1367
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,280
Yeah.

1368
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,280
And you can feel it.

1369
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:47,280
It doesn't feel like pirates when you're at the start where you kind of you know you're in a big building when you're on the bayou.

1370
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:53,280
But you kind of don't you kind of your brain can kind of go get tricked and go like we're like in the night.

1371
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,280
We're in nighttime.

1372
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,280
Yeah.

1373
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,280
Well, OK, this for sure is budget or who knows if this was even in the cards ever.

1374
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,280
But you talk about like evolution.

1375
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:11,280
If this ride just had there's a little drop and it does not even need to be a thrilling drop, but just kind of like to get you from here to here.

1376
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:17,280
There's a little drop that gives you a little bit of speed and then you land in this beautiful grotto or whatever.

1377
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,280
Is that not a moment?

1378
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,280
Is that not that makes you great?

1379
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,280
That makes you feel like you've gone somewhere.

1380
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,280
Yes, like a lot.

1381
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:29,280
Yeah, they're going to call it a journey because this ride loads like pirates in Orlando.

1382
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,280
In the sense that it's a pirate center.

1383
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,280
Orlando just starts.

1384
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,280
You don't have that great mood building build up to the actual ride pre show kind of.

1385
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:43,280
And yeah, it feels like from Q to the launch of the ride, you don't get immersed.

1386
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,280
You're just kind of just thrown in there.

1387
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,280
And it's yeah, you want you want to relax into it.

1388
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:54,280
You know what they do sometimes with a day spa, Scott, is they kind of put you in there.

1389
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,280
They put there's music on peaceful music.

1390
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,280
Maybe they'll like kind of just put a towel on.

1391
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,280
You get ready.

1392
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,280
You lie.

1393
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,280
You have a nice lead up up to like the massage or whatever.

1394
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,280
Like there's a whole I could use this.

1395
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,280
I think you would love it.

1396
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,280
I'm an uptight man, especially if you had a vague student Vegas.

1397
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,280
Yeah, maybe your home away from home.

1398
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,280
But then I go there for I don't relax in Vegas.

1399
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,280
It's like activity.

1400
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,280
You know, like you like music.

1401
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,280
Well, we were both getting this is also like eight or nine years.

1402
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,280
I'm sure I've said this before.

1403
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,280
Like we were late getting to this massage and it was very stressful.

1404
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,280
Oh, I see.

1405
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,280
You had a bunch of.

1406
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,280
But yeah, no, do it once at least there maybe.

1407
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,280
But sure.

1408
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:45,280
But I OK, we could maybe we could talk a little about the or a bunch about like the big ticket item.

1409
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,280
Yeah.

1410
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,280
In the ride, because this is pretty undeniable.

1411
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:54,280
And I have you know, I can't you know, of course I like what it builds.

1412
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,280
What it builds to, which is the Navi Shaman of Song.

1413
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,280
Of course.

1414
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,280
I mean, this is an undeniable aspect of it.

1415
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:06,280
It's a pretty jaw dropping animatronic that is.

1416
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,280
Yes, not huge.

1417
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,280
That is because you don't see Navi wandering around.

1418
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:18,280
There's no physical manifestation of Navi in the land or in the other ride, which is more of a screen based ride.

1419
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:23,280
So this is kind of your this is your chance to see other than the scale of the Navi.

1420
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,280
Oh, right.

1421
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,280
Other than the tank in this.

1422
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,280
Yeah.

1423
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,280
There's a Navi in a water tank, which I read was just put back in.

1424
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,280
It was missing for a while.

1425
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,280
Really?

1426
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:36,280
There was a full size Navi like rotating in a water coffin.

1427
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,280
Basically a clear water coffin.

1428
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,280
Yes.

1429
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,280
And yeah, it was gone for a little while, but I believe it's back.

1430
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,280
But that's yeah, the only other.

1431
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,280
Yeah, actual practical Navi in the land.

1432
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,280
Yeah.

1433
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,280
Yeah.

1434
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:59,280
They talked about how like, well, we can't really have them walking around because they're like very skinny and 12 feet tall, 10 feet taller, however tall they are.

1435
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:04,280
What I found says how also that they have wildly active tails.

1436
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,280
And therefore to truly be a Navi, that tail is it can't be like Mickey.

1437
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,280
We all of course all the characters have tails in the walk around.

1438
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,280
Or are they not?

1439
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,280
Do they just not do Mickey's tail due to like yank possibilities?

1440
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:20,280
Mickey doesn't have a tail, I don't think, because he's got it stuffed in his little red shorts.

1441
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,280
I guess so. Yes.

1442
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,280
OK, so there aren't a lot of tails around.

1443
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,280
Maybe I'm wrong.

1444
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,280
But the Shaman of Song's tail is pretty wild.

1445
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,280
It's wildly active.

1446
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,280
Yes, wildly active.

1447
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,280
I kind of missed watching the video.

1448
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,280
You see, this is one of the things where like they know immediately.

1449
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,280
I'm sure they did tests to try to figure out.

1450
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,280
I think maybe I'm wrong, but they did tests to see if there's a way we could do Navi walking around.

1451
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,280
I'm pretty sure that's the case.

1452
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:47,280
But now, like in the early days of Disneyland, they would just go, ah, looks good enough.

1453
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,280
Let's throw it out there.

1454
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,280
I wish that was the case now.

1455
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:57,280
I wish there were like years of shitty Navi walking around and we could look back in the same way you can look back at those like nightmare mice.

1456
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:01,280
Mickey and Minnie from the early Disneyland with holes in their faces.

1457
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,280
At least they tried.

1458
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,280
Yeah, I wish we like people.

1459
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,280
They know too much.

1460
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:11,280
There's too much of a good like a standard for them to do a bad job.

1461
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,280
I like when there's a weird of course, I'm going to goof on it.

1462
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:20,280
But it's funny when there's like a pre evolution, like some of the the initial way they presented Jack Skellington was really stupid.

1463
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,280
Very unsettling.

1464
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,280
I think it looks pretty good now.

1465
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,280
Yeah, yeah.

1466
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,280
I think that nailed it now.

1467
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:33,280
So there should have been a version where like people were wearing like platform shoes with the makeup you have on.

1468
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,280
Being like, hello.

1469
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:35,280
I'll do it.

1470
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,280
Welcome to Pandora.

1471
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,280
And then like they were like, oh, this looks like shit.

1472
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,280
We got to stop this.

1473
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,280
It didn't happen.

1474
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:48,280
And I guess I don't think it's going to happen, but it could.

1475
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,280
I feel like they could do it.

1476
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,280
I feel like it's just like you got to have a lot of like stunt performers and it's going to be.

1477
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,280
And they have to be really skinny.

1478
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,280
You have to get you have to get the most.

1479
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,280
That's true.

1480
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,280
The slightest.

1481
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,280
I mean, you could be a Navi.

1482
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,280
You're a tall.

1483
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,280
You're part of the way there.

1484
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,280
I am part of the way there.

1485
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,280
I could be a Navi, but I feel like I'm not in the shape of a Navi.

1486
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:14,280
You would have to lose like I'm not saying this is no comment on your just to be a Navi.

1487
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,280
You have to lose like 90 pounds.

1488
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,280
Yeah, did you get some sort of wasting disease?

1489
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:26,280
Now casting tall, tall people with wasting disease for.

1490
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:31,280
If I could look, if they if they if the pay is right and if I know Disney.

1491
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:37,280
It's going to be it's going to be they respect their performance famous famous for their generosity.

1492
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,280
Absolutely.

1493
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,280
Employee compensation.

1494
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:45,280
All those companies they buy to Marvel famous for the culture gets better.

1495
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,280
Yeah, it's actually better.

1496
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:50,280
Actually, Pixar probably is known for that.

1497
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,280
That's good.

1498
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,280
Maybe. Yeah.

1499
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,280
Just any number of psycho of control.

1500
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,280
I got a guy that goes used to be skulking around there.

1501
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,280
High pay, but you got to give out some hugs.

1502
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,280
That's all.

1503
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,280
Now, this is where I like.

1504
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:09,280
I don't know the conditions if you work at Light Storm Entertainment, but I know if you work on a James Cameron production, he's probably screaming at you.

1505
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:14,280
But he doesn't then go do all these interviews where he acts like he's a kind benevolent.

1506
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,280
I think he owns, although I think he's maybe I think we're maybe in a mock to of Cameron.

1507
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,280
I was going to say, I think he might be chilled out.

1508
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:31,280
Funny is today that there is a GQ profile out about Cameron, and I only saw the excerpt where he talks about like, well, my automatic weapons and my security guards.

1509
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:40,280
I, you know, I don't need them in New Zealand, but I, you know, I had them at my estate in Malibu and he's like, they don't really want automatic weapons.

1510
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,280
Does he have like Zealand?

1511
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,280
Does Miles Quaritch guard James Cameron's house?

1512
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,280
Here's what I'll say.

1513
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:55,280
Cameron says he's like an expert level marksman because he got the guy who would go on to train Keanu Reeves how to be John Wick.

1514
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,280
Really?

1515
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,280
To teach him how to shoot.

1516
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,280
Wow.

1517
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:02,280
Does mean most people I would say, yes, that person's a fool.

1518
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:10,280
But Cameron did just like work his way into being like the greatest deep sea diver and navigator.

1519
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,280
Are there guns on his submarine?

1520
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,280
Whoa.

1521
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,280
Because he's in one of those small yellow submarines where he goes to the bottom of the ocean.

1522
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:26,280
I assume every other day when he's not shooting or like I bet you can't see him if you look at it, but I bet he's got a little compartment that they like unfurl.

1523
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,280
Right.

1524
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:32,280
Start to start firing at if a plankton looks at him the wrong way.

1525
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,280
Right.

1526
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,280
Yeah.

1527
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:43,280
Does he have his own, does James Cameron have his own SeaQuest DSV style vehicle that's like a massive like Starship Enterprise under the water?

1528
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,280
Was that the deal?

1529
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,280
It was like a, because it's a set in the show.

1530
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:51,280
So where the show is set is like a gigantic undersea.

1531
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,280
Yeah.

1532
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,280
I don't know the scale.

1533
01:14:53,280 --> 01:15:02,280
I think the Starship Enterprise is all of their incarnations are probably bigger, but it's still like a pretty decent sized crew in living quarters and it's like they're on a long mission.

1534
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,280
Yeah.

1535
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,280
I'm pretty sure.

1536
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,280
I see.

1537
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,280
So I'm just, I'm asking questions as usual.

1538
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,280
Yeah.

1539
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,280
I don't know.

1540
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:19,280
He could probably like, I bet the guy can like, if there's an attacker on the property, he can jump in the air like 20 feet and then like land right on the guy's eyeballs.

1541
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,280
His toes go straight into ice pockets.

1542
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,280
Yeah.

1543
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,280
And that's the end to him.

1544
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,280
Can't shoot if you can't see.

1545
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,280
Yeah.

1546
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,280
Would you go in a submarine?

1547
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,280
I've asked this before about certain people and would you go in a submarine with James Cameron?

1548
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,280
Oh yeah.

1549
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,280
Yeah.

1550
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,280
Yeah.

1551
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,280
Yeah.

1552
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,280
Maybe not in general, but you assume he's yeah.

1553
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,280
I guess I should trust a submarine.

1554
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,280
Someone whose only job is submarine captain more than I trust James Cameron.

1555
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,280
But get in a fighter jet with Tom Cruise.

1556
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,280
Oh, 100%.

1557
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:51,280
That just sounds like, yes, that's why I'm saying.

1558
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,280
I think you're like, you're vomiting all over that thing.

1559
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,280
You were going to get fucked up.

1560
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,280
If you go in the fighter.

1561
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:59,280
Don't give us these eyes.

1562
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,280
We're not saying you're a wimp or anything.

1563
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,280
You're getting fucked up.

1564
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:05,280
I'm not going to do it, but you're going to get fucked up in that fighter jet.

1565
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,280
That's part of the experience.

1566
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,280
Like I don't want to have tasks to do.

1567
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,280
OK.

1568
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,280
I think I would say, Tom, I'll do it with you.

1569
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,280
I want a limited number of tasks because like.

1570
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,280
Tasks is the problem.

1571
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:24,280
One of the other pilots, one of the other actors was like, I would feel like I had gotten the shit beaten out of me.

1572
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,280
Yeah.

1573
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,280
Doing two flights a day and Tom was doing them nonstop.

1574
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,280
Well, the story.

1575
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,280
Did you read this, Miles Teller?

1576
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,280
Have I said this on the show before?

1577
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:38,280
Miles Teller said he felt ill for a couple of days and they figured out that he had jet fuel in his veins because he was in the plane for so long.

1578
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,280
And he told Tom Cruise that I'm sick because I have jet fuel in my veins.

1579
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,280
Yeah.

1580
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:47,280
And Tom Cruise was like, I was I've had whatever was born that way or whatever.

1581
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,280
He said something like that, which I mean, it sounds fake.

1582
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:57,280
The story sounds fake, but I'm sure he does have like it's not like it's not good to be up in a jet a lot.

1583
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,280
I don't know.

1584
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,280
Jason's a hypemize.

1585
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:04,280
You just but you as you're embraced, you're like, I will go up and vomit my brains out.

1586
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,280
You'll have a wasting disease after.

1587
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,280
I was a nervous child.

1588
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,280
Vomit.

1589
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,280
I'm you know, I've done some vomiting in my time.

1590
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,280
Like the James Corden bit Tom Cruise did.

1591
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,280
Would you skydive with Tom Cruise?

1592
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,280
Yeah, absolutely.

1593
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,280
Scott.

1594
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,280
I don't I've never had desire to skydive.

1595
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,280
Neither have I.

1596
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,280
Maybe with Tom.

1597
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,280
Maybe you got to.

1598
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,280
Definitely with James.

1599
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:30,280
You would skydive with James, but not necessarily with Tom.

1600
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,280
OK, that's interesting.

1601
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,280
It would depend.

1602
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,280
Just to see how well he treats the flight crew.

1603
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,280
Bang up job mates.

1604
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,280
You did.

1605
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,280
I respect regular people.

1606
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,280
I do.

1607
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:48,280
If James Corden invite a three of us on, we'll all skydive with him.

1608
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,280
That would really be good.

1609
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,280
The hell did we start with all this?

1610
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,280
Oh, yeah.

1611
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,280
The Shaman of Song.

1612
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,280
The impressive robot.

1613
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,280
Is it the most impressive animatronic?

1614
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,280
100%.

1615
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,280
Yeah.

1616
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,280
Is there a more impressive one still?

1617
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,280
Well, this is already what?

1618
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,280
Six years old?

1619
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,280
Yeah, I mean, I like Hondo.

1620
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,280
I do.

1621
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,280
But Hondo has a lot of layers on.

1622
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,280
I think I like him more.

1623
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,280
Well, that's a different story.

1624
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,280
Yeah.

1625
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,280
Impressive.

1626
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,280
Yeah, he doesn't do as much.

1627
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:19,280
But I mean, what a flex it was when they unveiled the Shaman of Song.

1628
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,280
Yeah, I mean, that's I think that's what they were like.

1629
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,280
OK, maybe the budget was cut.

1630
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,280
But maybe it's not as long as we'd want it to be.

1631
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:30,280
But people are going to be like, holy shit when they see this thing, which is what you say.

1632
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,280
Can we?

1633
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:38,280
Jordan, can we see the clip of it was the YouTube that I sent that I must say Shaman of Song or something.

1634
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,280
And you guys will remember this.

1635
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,280
Excuse me.

1636
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,280
Shaman of Songs, plural.

1637
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,280
Oh, it's oh, really?

1638
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,280
Yeah.

1639
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,280
Shaman of Songs.

1640
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,280
Really?

1641
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,280
All right.

1642
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,280
We'll edit that into the rest of them.

1643
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,280
But here is not this one.

1644
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,280
But that's the close up of the face.

1645
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,280
There we go.

1646
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,280
I mean, this footage, this was jaw dropping when this came out.

1647
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,280
So let's all re-experience this together.

1648
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:05,280
I look forward to seeing you on Pandora.

1649
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,280
Well, not take me.

1650
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,280
Was that OK?

1651
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:17,280
That and I think that I did not understand when that came out that we were looking at the animatronic.

1652
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,280
Right.

1653
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,280
Yeah.

1654
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:24,280
Because the level of like, have they ever willingly gone this close to the face?

1655
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,280
No.

1656
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,280
Of an animatronic.

1657
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,280
And then had it do lines that are not in the ride?

1658
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:35,280
I mean, they got to be feeling confident if they're willing to do such a close up.

1659
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,280
This is crazy.

1660
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:38,280
Which movies had this level of?

1661
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,280
Well, it changes.

1662
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,280
Yeah.

1663
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,280
If you see go, we'll post this.

1664
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:45,280
And if you haven't seen this yet, it's a close up of the shaman's face.

1665
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,280
Neck up.

1666
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:50,280
And it switches between sort of like in character.

1667
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:57,280
And then it flips to like a very natural human performance, essentially, as if this is an actor.

1668
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:03,280
So it sort of has two modes in an interesting choice.

1669
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,280
They kind of take it apart in the Imagineering story.

1670
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:12,280
They're with Joe Brody and another Imagineer and they show like under the skin.

1671
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:20,280
There's just like so many tiny electric motors, like stuff they could not have done even a few years ago.

1672
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:30,280
It's like once they switched over to electronics and not hydraulics, you don't have to worry about the tubes and hydraulic fluid and stuff.

1673
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:35,280
The blood colored fluid that would shoot out.

1674
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:40,280
And so like, I mean, yeah, this was when you watch it again.

1675
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,280
I remember watching it.

1676
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:50,280
Yeah. Like you said, when it first came out and I had to read the description, go, this is the animatronic and that moment of like, was that OK?

1677
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,280
Like that is I love that so much.

1678
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,280
What's so weird? What's extra weird?

1679
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:01,280
And I mean it in a good way, but what's extra weird is that this is the closest to like a human.

1680
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:07,280
Like there's Tokyo Disney Beauty and the Beast animatronics that I've seen that look amazing and like next level.

1681
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:18,280
But since the Navi are closer to humans than like a cartoon woman, that's what's so both unnerving and amazing about this thing still.

1682
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:24,280
Yeah. Is that it like feels like a person wearing makeup like Bella so much like I look right now.

1683
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,280
You have really similar images on the screen.

1684
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:33,280
Bell. Yeah, like Cartoon Bell, even though you go, oh my God, it's amazing animatronic.

1685
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:39,280
It's not your brain isn't kind of getting tricked every other second when it keeps forgetting that you're looking at a robot.

1686
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,280
Yeah. Yeah. Also those movements.

1687
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:49,280
I you know, I get a little bit of the OK, the big things in the small spaces, my fear that I address from time to time.

1688
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:55,280
I'm not I don't have it with this so much, even though it's a Navi is huge.

1689
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:02,280
But I, you know, I like it's it's the fatness of a big boo that would freak me out.

1690
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:13,280
But the you know what freaks me out a little is the other movements because this the Shaman of Songs is very gangly, very long, long arms.

1691
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:17,280
And they like whip from close to her to close to you.

1692
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,280
And it's always movement, justiculation me out a little bit.

1693
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,280
Yeah, like James Cameron upset. He's waving his arms around.

1694
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,280
Oh, point the light here.

1695
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:29,280
Yes, they mocapped it off of his scolding of grip.

1696
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:37,280
Yeah, it's she she at some point is programmed to like take a nail gun and shoot your phone on the wall.

1697
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,280
Like that, that rumor that it's like, oh, the phone goes off on set.

1698
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,280
He'll nail gun it to the exit.

1699
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,280
Oh, God, that's a thing.

1700
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,280
And I never heard that.

1701
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:55,280
I came across this research that if someone's phone would ring or beep, he would take it and nail gun it like above the exit constantly holding a nail gun on.

1702
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,280
I look, it's his own set nail gun.

1703
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,280
And who knows if he actually did this more than once or ever.

1704
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,280
But like it certainly adds to the mythology.

1705
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,280
It's a fun legend.

1706
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,280
I want this to be the policy in the theater.

1707
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:14,280
I want every AMC IMAX is all have to enforce every AMC boy has a nail gun.

1708
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,280
Go find that phone.

1709
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,280
Yeah.

1710
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,280
And I up next to the exit.

1711
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,280
They should do it in the land.

1712
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,280
They should do it.

1713
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:28,280
There was a nightline segment I watched where Rody and the reporter are riding this ride and he's describing stuff and he's pointing things out.

1714
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:32,280
And I'm like, this is the only time I'll condone talking on a ride.

1715
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:35,280
They are alone.

1716
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,280
They are the only people on this running ride.

1717
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,280
This is you.

1718
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,280
This is me.

1719
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,280
This is me.

1720
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,280
This is me.

1721
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:53,280
I think a little ride, but I will allow Joe Rody and the reporter that are clearly very properly lit and even can their footage of Cameron and squirmy weaver riding this.

1722
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,280
And even they are just silently reacting.

1723
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,280
They just take it in.

1724
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,280
Yeah.

1725
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:02,280
Would you Jason, would you light up the terminology?

1726
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,280
Would you light up a jewel on this?

1727
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,280
A jewel.

1728
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,280
We get a poll.

1729
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,280
Get a plume going.

1730
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,280
Plume for the shaman?

1731
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,280
No.

1732
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,280
Yeah.

1733
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,280
Massive plume.

1734
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,280
Blasting plumes.

1735
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,280
Like the strawberry vape?

1736
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,280
It's blue dream.

1737
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,280
You're blue.

1738
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,280
Don't you like this?

1739
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,280
Yeah.

1740
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,280
Somebody's for sure blown blueberry vape.

1741
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:34,280
Because we of course were in a boat on pirates with Strawberry Vape Man who did it when Barbossa was up or Davy Jones in the mist part.

1742
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:40,280
That's how we, yeah, the intrusive thought every now and then think of the phrase a plume for Barbossa.

1743
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:45,280
I used to say it to you or Geo and we just start laughing.

1744
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,280
Yeah.

1745
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,280
So somebody had to, yeah.

1746
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:52,280
If you've, okay, yeah, let us know if you've been on this ride and somebody blew blueberry vape.

1747
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:55,280
Somebody blew some blueberry.

1748
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,280
Yeah.

1749
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,280
Why not?

1750
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,280
I think they got to allow it.

1751
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,280
You're in the spirit.

1752
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:06,280
Something I wrote down about this ride is like when I'm, you know, if it sounds like I'm being hard on it or wanting more out of it, the vibe is excellent.

1753
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,280
I would love to eat dinner in this.

1754
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,280
You know what I mean?

1755
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:16,280
I would weirdly, I would like to hang out still in this ride.

1756
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,280
Unmoving by the way I mean still.

1757
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,280
And like for like two hours.

1758
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,280
That would be fine.

1759
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:27,280
But by virtue of it's a ride and I am moving and I want something to happen.

1760
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,280
I just want a little more to.

1761
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:45,280
But that's what I think is completely is in line with my point of just like length even more than the moves because we get used to a long, get used to when you're in a boat, a boat feels like more of a to do on a ride than a regular car.

1762
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,280
Yeah.

1763
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,280
Or a regular ride vehicle.

1764
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,280
Yeah.

1765
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,280
And I think it's because they've set the precedent that a boat is longer.

1766
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,280
Sure.

1767
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,280
Sure.

1768
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,280
So it makes sense what you're saying.

1769
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,280
You'd rather have a meal.

1770
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,280
You'd rather have one of those bowls, the famous bowls.

1771
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,280
The Satooly bowls.

1772
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,280
The Satooly bowls.

1773
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,280
In here, yes.

1774
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,280
Because it's a great place to be.

1775
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,280
I just want like something.

1776
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,280
And even now look, I'm not hating on the Shaman of Songs.

1777
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,280
But is it, I think it's like of course it's great.

1778
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:22,280
But when we've all been on slow moving boat rides with 100 animatronics that are not as good as the Shaman of Songs.

1779
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:30,280
But that's, would you rather have 100 okay animatronics or one very, very good one?

1780
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,280
And I know the answer for me.

1781
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,280
I don't know.

1782
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:37,280
I mean, I appreciate this one that they seem to have kept it up.

1783
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,280
Sure.

1784
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:43,280
Like I've been there two years later, four years later.

1785
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,280
And so it's still working well.

1786
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,280
It still looks good.

1787
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,280
And they did.

1788
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,280
If they let it go to shit, I feel like I would feel differently.

1789
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:56,280
And they did the smart thing on this one where they built it so they can pull her out or him out.

1790
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,280
Excuse me.

1791
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,280
It's a male character.

1792
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,280
I don't think so.

1793
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,280
Is it a female character?

1794
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:01,280
It's voiced by a female, yeah.

1795
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,280
Yeah.

1796
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,280
Well, maybe it doesn't even matter.

1797
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,280
I guess it doesn't matter.

1798
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,280
But yeah, it can be pulled.

1799
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,280
It's on a platform.

1800
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,280
It can be pulled backstage to work on it.

1801
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,280
So they didn't repeat the mistake of the Yeti.

1802
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,280
Yes.

1803
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,280
And the replacement is a screen.

1804
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,280
That's right.

1805
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:20,280
So if you pass by it in B mode, it is a screen performance of the Shaman of Songs.

1806
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,280
That's your one trip every five years.

1807
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,280
You've got to see this robot.

1808
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,280
Holy shit.

1809
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,280
This is the reason we waited an hour and a half line for this.

1810
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,280
That'd be rough.

1811
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,280
And then you see the screen.

1812
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:34,280
Because at least Rise of the Resistance, when you don't get Kylo, they've pulled Kylo to fix him.

1813
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,280
You get rid of this.

1814
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,280
It was not the main thing on the ride.

1815
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,280
Sure, sure.

1816
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,280
You still get a ride that's much worse than Transformers the Ride.

1817
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,280
Yeah, of course.

1818
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,280
Same thing.

1819
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,280
There's also multiple Kylos.

1820
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,280
It seems like it'd be unlikely that all the Kylos would be down.

1821
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,280
Every Kylo is down.

1822
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,280
Yeah, no, I don't think that happens.

1823
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,280
I think probably the other ones just stay there.

1824
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,280
Maybe they don't move as much.

1825
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:03,280
That's the one that's the most, has the most ability to move around, is the one at the end.

1826
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,280
The final, that gets blown up.

1827
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,280
Yeah, right, right.

1828
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:13,280
What else needs to be said about this or about the Shaman?

1829
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,280
Oh, the song.

1830
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,280
The song.

1831
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:24,280
It's Dr. Paul Fromer, the USC professor and linguist who came up with a lot of the Navi language.

1832
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,280
Okay.

1833
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:33,280
And on his personal WordPress or blog spot says, yeah, I wrote a lot of versions of this.

1834
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:39,280
The one that they ended up using, I wrote in 2015, and it didn't come out until 2017.

1835
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:43,280
And he posted the translation of the lyrics of the song.

1836
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,280
Well, go ahead.

1837
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,280
Okay.

1838
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:50,280
Oh, beautiful forest, there are tears in the forest, wood sprites.

1839
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:53,280
We cry out calling, oh, Awa.

1840
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,280
That's the first verse.

1841
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:57,280
Now, let me just to give you a note.

1842
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,280
Could you say it?

1843
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:02,280
If this ride's about serenity, that was a little arch the way you said it.

1844
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:05,280
In verse two, let's get a little more serene.

1845
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,280
Sure.

1846
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,280
Thank you for the note.

1847
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,280
Connected as one, oh, great mother, wood sprites.

1848
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:15,280
We cry out calling, oh, Awa.

1849
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:19,280
By the people's will, the forest is singing wood sprites.

1850
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,280
Wood sprites again.

1851
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:23,280
We cry out calling, oh, Awa.

1852
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,280
And that's three times on those oh, Awas.

1853
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,280
Mm-hmm.

1854
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,280
Jason, that was a lovely reading.

1855
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,280
Could you just read these lyrics real quick in the same?

1856
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,280
Yeah, no problem.

1857
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,280
Same sort of time.

1858
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,280
Should I leave the room?

1859
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,280
No, no, go.

1860
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,280
It's fine.

1861
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,280
Cellular data is turned off.

1862
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,280
Turn on cellular data.

1863
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,280
No, no, no, no, no.

1864
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,280
Hold on.

1865
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,280
So sorry.

1866
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,280
Do you want me to?

1867
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,280
No, I got it.

1868
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:49,280
I got it.

1869
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,280
Okay, great, great, great.

1870
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,280
Okay, good.

1871
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,280
I'm turning this ring right thing.

1872
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:56,280
No, just take it as peaceful as you can.

1873
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,280
Yeah, sure.

1874
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,280
Serenity, serenity.

1875
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,280
Out with it.

1876
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:03,280
Jason, take all the time you want.

1877
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:08,280
Jason's turning as red as I am blue.

1878
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:10,280
I think you should take all the time,

1879
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,280
because this is such an important piece of-

1880
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,280
You're right.

1881
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,280
We need to let him get into a place.

1882
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,280
Do we all need to leave the room and come back?

1883
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,280
The best parts of podcasting or silence.

1884
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,280
Okay.

1885
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,280
Okay.

1886
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,280
All right.

1887
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,280
This is like a crying scene, or this is a romantic scene,

1888
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:25,280
and you need to be, even if you're James Cameron,

1889
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,280
you can't be screaming.

1890
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,280
We're ready, yeah.

1891
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,280
We're ready whenever you are, Jason.

1892
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,280
All right.

1893
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,280
Okay.

1894
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,280
Okay.

1895
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:37,280
Father of mine, tell me where have you been?

1896
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,280
Come on.

1897
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:43,280
Come on, get out.

1898
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,280
I'm getting Cameron-y.

1899
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,280
You know, I just closed my eyes.

1900
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,280
Come on, we're losing light.

1901
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,280
My whole world disappeared.

1902
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:56,280
Father of mine, take me back to the day, yeah,

1903
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,280
when I was still your golden boy.

1904
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,280
Back before you went away.

1905
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,280
Okay, thank you so much.

1906
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:04,280
Wow.

1907
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:07,280
I feel with A-Wa, and I feel with Everclear.

1908
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:14,280
For the record, I don't think Everclear is the worst thing that you like.

1909
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,280
Now, I don't know if this episode has come out by now.

1910
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:18,280
What is the worst thing I like?

1911
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:21,280
Well, in recent memory, we did a mailbag episode,

1912
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,280
and I don't know if it's come out by now,

1913
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:26,280
but the joke became that we left the room.

1914
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:29,280
We were like, you stay and talk about music,

1915
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,280
and within 10 seconds of that assignment,

1916
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:35,280
you were talking about how you like Lifehouse.

1917
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,280
That's what it was.

1918
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,280
I think I like the song Hanging By A Moment,

1919
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,280
but I'm not a huge fan of the band.

1920
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:44,280
I saw them open for Matchbox 20 and Everclear.

1921
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,280
No, that's what you were telling this story.

1922
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,280
Yeah, yeah.

1923
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,280
But we leave you alone,

1924
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,280
and you start talking about how much you like Hanging By A Moment.

1925
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:52,280
Yeah, I do like Hanging By A Moment, I think.

1926
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,280
I haven't heard it in a few years, I feel like.

1927
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,280
I always like it, yeah.

1928
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,280
Am I alright? Am I cancelled first?

1929
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:00,280
You just don't have the normie.

1930
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,280
You never had a normie phase.

1931
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,280
I think I didn't, no.

1932
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,280
That's just a missing piece.

1933
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,280
Yeah, yeah.

1934
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,280
I like the Beastie Boys a ton,

1935
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,280
but then they branch you and all this weird bullshit.

1936
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,280
You like the stuff that crosses over from cool and normie,

1937
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,280
because Beastie Boys is both cool and normie.

1938
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,280
I think so, yeah, yeah.

1939
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,280
But you were missing the time.

1940
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,280
And my missing out on life.

1941
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,280
Is this like, okay, do I need to take the journey?

1942
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,280
Because everybody's like,

1943
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,280
Lifehouse had no, the song was a big hit,

1944
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,280
but it had no cultural impact.

1945
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,280
Can you even name a member of Lifehouse?

1946
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:31,280
I cannot name a member of Lifehouse.

1947
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,280
No offense to Lifehouse.

1948
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:35,280
But yeah.

1949
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:38,280
But soon enough, I will start the journey,

1950
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:44,280
and I'll easily be able to name Rick Wollstone Hulme Jr.

1951
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,280
Wow, really?

1952
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:50,280
The drummer of Lifehouse, Rick Wollstone Hulme Jr.

1953
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:53,280
He will be my favorite drummer of all time.

1954
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,280
As after Way of Water.

1955
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,280
I think this is a pivotal moment for me.

1956
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,280
If Way of Water sucks, I go firmly into cynicism.

1957
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:03,280
But if it gives me everything I need and I feel,

1958
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,280
and I embrace the Way of Water,

1959
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,280
I'm going to end up liking Lifehouse.

1960
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,280
Wow.

1961
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,280
Yeah, I hope he's not a Ginger Breaker type.

1962
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,280
I hope he's a peaceful guy.

1963
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:14,280
Although I guess James Cameron is sort of the Ginger Baker.

1964
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,280
Was Ginger Baker was a bad man?

1965
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,280
The drummer of Cream, correct?

1966
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:19,280
Yeah, the drummer of Cream.

1967
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:20,280
I'm going a little back.

1968
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,280
Yeah, he was a wild guy.

1969
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,280
No bursts and stuff.

1970
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,280
I see.

1971
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,280
There's a documentary.

1972
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:27,280
Anyway.

1973
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,280
Well, we'll learn the way of Wollstone Hulme

1974
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,280
after we learn the way of Water.

1975
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:33,280
What else?

1976
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,280
What have we not hit?

1977
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,280
They did release, by the way, the song.

1978
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,280
If you want to hear the song on repeat,

1979
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,280
the soundtrack was released in 2019 for the whole land.

1980
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,280
Here's the thing that ultimately,

1981
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,280
the song and the robot, I think,

1982
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,280
ultimately redeem a lot of what you would maybe,

1983
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,280
not problems, but whatever.

1984
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:54,280
It gives you something big to go out on.

1985
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,280
And it gives you something like,

1986
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,280
the first time we ever went on it,

1987
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,280
it's one of those things where Lindsay and I,

1988
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:03,280
we were singing the song all day.

1989
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,280
We obviously did it at our live show a couple years ago.

1990
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:07,280
Still got it in your head?

1991
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,280
Can we all do it?

1992
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,280
Yeah, I can do it.

1993
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,280
It's just the...

1994
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,280
I don't know until the chorus.

1995
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,280
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1996
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,280
All I got is,

1997
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,280
Ma-te-wa, ma-te-wa.

1998
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,280
Wait, wait, it's ma-e-wa.

1999
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:25,280
Ma-e-wa, ma-e-wa.

2000
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,280
Ma-e-wa.

2001
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,280
Wow.

2002
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,280
We were all in key here, I think.

2003
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,280
It's in our hearts.

2004
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,280
So it's like in the same Sinbad in Tokyo Disney Sea.

2005
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,280
It's one of those where you're like,

2006
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,280
I remember that the rest of the day.

2007
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:42,280
That's a memory now I have for the rest of my life to cherish

2008
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,280
is singing this song.

2009
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:47,280
So in that way, it's like, yeah, it's a big success, I guess,

2010
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,280
in that way, because there's stuff you go on,

2011
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,280
and you go, oh, that's fine, and then you don't...

2012
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:53,280
It didn't turn into a bit.

2013
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,280
It didn't turn into a fun bit to do the rest of the day.

2014
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,280
If there's anything memorable to hang off,

2015
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,280
which is the triumph of other,

2016
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,280
which is the triumph of the video in the line

2017
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,280
and move around a little bit.

2018
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,280
That is all instantly iconic.

2019
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,280
Yeah, that's true.

2020
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:13,280
So it ultimately succeeds because of that, I think.

2021
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,280
Yeah.

2022
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,280
But I just wish there was more of it.

2023
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:18,280
I wish it was a bigger in scope,

2024
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:22,280
and I understand they did the best with what they could money-wise.

2025
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:25,280
But there's so much stuff on here that I,

2026
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:28,280
even watching the video to refresh myself,

2027
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,280
I can't notice the details,

2028
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,280
because again, it's not so well-documented,

2029
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,280
every piece of it that you take for granted

2030
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:37,280
probably how hard it is to do and make this ride.

2031
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,280
Yeah, yeah.

2032
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,280
And the animatronic, too.

2033
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:46,280
I think in terms of what is more impressive with this versus Hondo,

2034
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:50,280
Hondo, very humanoid, he just kind of seems like a tall guy.

2035
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:55,280
He's just kind of got a clipboard or a tablet or something.

2036
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,280
It's very reductive, but yes, that's true.

2037
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:58,280
And it's just kind of moving.

2038
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:03,280
And he's wearing a duster and slacks.

2039
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,280
I love all of them, but then he's a funny character.

2040
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:07,280
He's good, he's good.

2041
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,280
But he is good.

2042
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:09,280
I do like him.

2043
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:12,280
But in terms of technical impressiveness,

2044
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,280
all of the arms and the tail are all moving.

2045
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,280
They're not symmetrical.

2046
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,280
They're all kind of doing their own thing.

2047
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,280
And they're so much more fluid, even than Hondo.

2048
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,280
They are.

2049
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,280
Hondo is still a little bit more robot.

2050
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:25,280
This is like the least robot-ish robots,

2051
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,280
just because of how fluid it moves.

2052
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,280
It feels like it could do that.

2053
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,280
What's the dance move where you put your arm out like this,

2054
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,280
and you make it wave?

2055
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,280
What is that called?

2056
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,280
I don't know what it's called,

2057
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,280
but it feels like the robot could dance.

2058
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,280
It feels like this is one of the only robots

2059
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,280
that could do a bunch of different types of dances.

2060
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,280
Yes, and that's the way they should keep it current.

2061
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,280
Classic, yeah.

2062
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,280
Program it with new TikTok dances every month.

2063
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:50,280
New TikTok dances, old, the twists, Charlie Brown.

2064
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,280
Of course they could do the twists.

2065
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:55,280
They should do at least one fun night in Pandora

2066
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,280
where the Shaman of Songs does all the different dances

2067
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,280
through the decades.

2068
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,280
She's doing the mashed potato.

2069
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:01,280
The history of dance.

2070
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,280
Do the history of dance.

2071
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,280
You park the boat in front.

2072
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,280
It's an exclusive event.

2073
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,280
You pay $250.

2074
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,280
Yeah, to watch it do, when I dip, you dip, we dip.

2075
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,280
I put my hand up on your hips.

2076
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,280
She can't do the Casper slide,

2077
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,280
because I don't think the legs are that good,

2078
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,280
but it would all arm-based dances.

2079
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,280
Yeah, you're fine with Macarena.

2080
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,280
The swim.

2081
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,280
As long as you're fine not doing the hops

2082
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,280
to the different corners.

2083
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,280
Yeah.

2084
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,280
But the hands, she's made for that.

2085
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,280
She could do stances to Soul Bossa Nova,

2086
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:30,280
the Austin Powers song.

2087
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:33,280
Oh, if she could do like Fingers Out,

2088
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,280
like her sort of Betusi.

2089
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,280
Oh, Betusi.

2090
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,280
Yeah.

2091
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,280
Yeah, oh my gosh.

2092
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,280
She could do everything, I bet.

2093
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,280
This is, I do wish that they, this is the only like,

2094
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:46,280
I, you know, I like that Avatar is a humorless franchise.

2095
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,280
Yeah.

2096
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,280
It's maybe something that was off-putting to me at first,

2097
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,280
but now it's just, it's what it is.

2098
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:54,280
It's a deeply, really sincere movie,

2099
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,280
so you just go along for that ride.

2100
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,280
Right.

2101
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:59,280
But I do wish that, as with all things,

2102
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,280
that like Star Wars Holiday Special style,

2103
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:03,280
I also said, yeah, screw it, doesn't matter.

2104
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,280
It's not canon, we're not messing it up,

2105
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,280
we're not ruining your childhood

2106
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,280
by doing something stupid with the property.

2107
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,280
That video was fun, because it breaks character.

2108
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,280
Yeah.

2109
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,280
So there's, they, he allowed that to happen,

2110
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,280
so let's have some dances, James.

2111
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:17,280
Mm-hmm.

2112
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,280
Let the, they all want it, the Imagineers, we know,

2113
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,280
because we just created the idea of it,

2114
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,280
and we know the Imagineers want to do it.

2115
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,280
I think you just gotta look at the TikTok charts

2116
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,280
and see what's trending.

2117
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:27,280
Mm-hmm.

2118
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,280
Like, and that's how you keep it current,

2119
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,280
and it's how you keep 12-year-olds going on this ride.

2120
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,280
Yes.

2121
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,280
They're doing this month's dance.

2122
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,280
Yes.

2123
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,280
Yeah.

2124
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,280
That would be, yes.

2125
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:37,280
That's a plus up, I think we all can get behind.

2126
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,280
Yeah.

2127
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,280
At least for a themed overlay for the ride.

2128
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,280
Yeah.

2129
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,280
Sure.

2130
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,280
Let's see really what this thing can do.

2131
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,280
Mm-hmm.

2132
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,280
I remembered something I didn't want to forget.

2133
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:49,280
One reason, I like this ride a lot,

2134
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,280
and I think it's because, one part of it,

2135
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:54,280
not the main reason, but like,

2136
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,280
I really like the bioluminescence,

2137
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:58,280
I like the nighttime setting,

2138
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,280
and one of my big theme park holes

2139
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,280
is that I have never seen Pandora at night.

2140
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:03,280
Yeah, I mean, no.

2141
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:06,280
So I was there.

2142
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:08,280
I forget why.

2143
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,280
We only, yeah, it was so hot the day we were there,

2144
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:13,280
we all tapped out by like lunchtime,

2145
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,280
and then the other day I was there,

2146
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:17,280
we might have had a dinner reservation at night,

2147
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,280
but also just pouring rain all day.

2148
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,280
So it's like, I'm not gonna come back here.

2149
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,280
Well, you guys had to go to Chicken Guy a bunch of times.

2150
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:23,280
Yeah.

2151
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,280
I think it's a priority over seeing a guitar

2152
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,280
if you can spend it at night.

2153
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,280
That's true.

2154
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:29,280
I think we zipped around the seven seas of Lagoon

2155
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,280
this day.

2156
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:32,280
We had to go see the Shaman of Sauce.

2157
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:33,280
Yeah.

2158
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,280
Guy Fieri.

2159
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,280
The Shaman of Sauce.

2160
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:39,280
Ma-eh-wah, that's a spicy sauce.

2161
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:42,280
Father of mine.

2162
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:45,280
Yeah, the Shaman of Sauce sings Father of Mine.

2163
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,280
Put that on it.

2164
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,280
That's our plus up.

2165
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,280
Yeah, well, I would love to see that too,

2166
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:54,280
but I think, all right, look, if we're talking about

2167
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:58,280
kind of like, you know, like while injecting music

2168
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:00,280
and seeing what else musically is going on

2169
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,280
in the Avatar world, I've had this idea

2170
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,280
to tie these things together,

2171
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:08,280
because we've certainly covered Avatar here

2172
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,280
in this December episode,

2173
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:12,280
but don't forget it's Feliz Navidad,

2174
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,280
the way of winter.

2175
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:17,280
I want this to be kind of our holiday celebration as well.

2176
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,280
So to tie all of these things together,

2177
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,280
my pitch, and now I throw it to you guys

2178
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,280
if you want to do it on the other ones

2179
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,280
on the Civico gates,

2180
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,280
the door is open, but for now I've asserted

2181
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,280
and prepared a carol.

2182
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:33,280
I call it an Amoti-kaya carol.

2183
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,280
Perfect.

2184
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,280
That is the tribe that Sully enters.

2185
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,280
We all know him.

2186
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:43,280
And yes, and this is a tribute not just to an iconic character

2187
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:46,280
whose name we certainly know at this point,

2188
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:50,280
but also to an iconic scene in at least

2189
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:53,280
some versions of the movie.

2190
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,280
And Jordan, I ask if you could bring up,

2191
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:57,280
this is it, yes.

2192
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:01,280
And all right, I will now in a very solemn fashion

2193
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:05,280
perform this episode's Amoti-kaya carol.

2194
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:23,280
Oh, Sully night, the tree of voices shining.

2195
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:29,280
You're in the avatar of your brother Tom.

2196
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:40,280
Long was the trip through space in biostasis.

2197
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:47,280
Now it's the night of a jarhead's rebirth.

2198
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:58,280
The thrill of thrills when you connect your dreadlocks

2199
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:01,280
she chose her mate.

2200
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:06,280
Ned Teary wants to bone.

2201
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:14,280
Fall on your knees

2202
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:22,280
and fuck this big blue lady.

2203
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:30,280
Oh, why was this cut?

2204
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:39,280
The sex is only in the Blu-ray cut.

2205
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:51,280
Oh, night, oh, mighty night.

2206
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:59,280
Jake Sully night.

2207
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,280
Beautiful.

2208
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:03,280
Thank you so much for that.

2209
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:04,280
Thank you.

2210
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,280
Thanks.

2211
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,280
Do we all feel some serenity after?

2212
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:11,280
I feel a little horny, but I do feel serenity as well.

2213
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,280
Yeah, me too.

2214
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:15,280
You know, that's, again, the sex scene is not in the,

2215
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:18,280
it wasn't in the IMAX cut, and I had to look it up

2216
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:20,280
so you can see it.

2217
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:23,280
This is one of the only places to see it in this episode.

2218
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,280
Wait, really?

2219
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,280
I swear it was in the Disney Plus version.

2220
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,280
That I don't know.

2221
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,280
I don't know what's up in the Disney Plus,

2222
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,280
but if you saw it in the theater, it cuts away.

2223
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,280
It's a long, yeah, it's longer.

2224
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,280
Yes.

2225
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:35,280
It's implied.

2226
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,280
Some sex, but not the dreadlock connection

2227
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,280
and not the, you know, what we just watched

2228
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,280
where like he picks her up and it starts getting a little wild.

2229
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:47,280
So if you really want to see Navi's fuck, then you got to go.

2230
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,280
You got to go.

2231
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,280
You got to watch the video version of this.

2232
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:54,280
Of the Navi Flight of Passage episode.

2233
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:58,280
But with that, you survived night one.

2234
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,280
I don't know if that's true.

2235
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,280
I don't know when they're coming out.

2236
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:05,280
You survived a night of Feliz Navidad, the way of winter.

2237
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:08,280
And up to, you know, hey, bring them to the table

2238
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:10,280
if you have Amatikaya carols.

2239
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,280
I've got an idea.

2240
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,280
Okay, all right.

2241
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:14,280
I'm very glad to hear it.

2242
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:20,280
So, yeah, head to the Sivakho Gate to hear what else we're doing here.

2243
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:23,280
One more bonus episode on our new tier Club 3.

2244
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,280
And we're waiting to hear, currently we're waiting on the assignment

2245
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:30,280
of if that's holiday-oriented or if it's avatar-oriented.

2246
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:34,280
I know which way I'd like it to go because there's only one Christmas season

2247
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:39,280
until Seed Bearer comes out where we get to celebrate all of these things at once.

2248
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:42,280
And that's all at Patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2249
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:45,280
Thank you to these important cats for producing this episode.

2250
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,280
Thanks, BJ, for helping us out.

2251
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,280
And that's all the plugs.

2252
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,280
But it's not about us.

2253
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:52,280
It's about A-wah.

2254
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:54,280
Hold on real quick before we leave.

2255
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:57,280
Mm-hmm.

2256
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,280
It's not the way of water anymore.

2257
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:00,280
The way of the water is falling.

2258
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,280
All right.

2259
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,280
Well, I was going to do that, but that's fine.

2260
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:04,280
You've still got a couple.

2261
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:06,280
We'll set them out here.

2262
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:07,280
This is Theatre of the Mind.

2263
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:10,280
The Fiji waters that we built in front of Jason are falling down.

2264
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:15,280
I like the thing they play before IMAX movies, where it's to show you how crisp the audio is.

2265
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,280
That's right.

2266
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,280
Now you can hear it.

2267
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,280
Yeah, you just heard it.

2268
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:19,280
You just heard it.

2269
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,280
What was that?

2270
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:25,280
I know that I heard eight Fijis falling, but what did it look like?

2271
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,280
Right.

2272
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:29,280
And was there an avatar or a guy in a plant doing it?

2273
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:30,280
Only one way to find out.

2274
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:33,280
Check out the video and head to the Sevico Gate.

2275
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,280
Praise to A-wah.

2276
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:37,280
Forever.

2277
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,280
Dog.

2278
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:40,280
This has been a Forever Dog Production.

2279
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:49,280
Executive produced by Mike Carlson, Jason Sheridan, Scott Gardner, Brett Boehme, Joe Sileo, and Alex Ramsey.
