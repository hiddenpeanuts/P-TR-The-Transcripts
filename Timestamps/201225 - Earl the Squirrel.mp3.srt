1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:25,920
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate and Merry Christmas to all you listeners.

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm Jason Sheridan here with Mike Carlson.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm here, yes. Merry Christmas, happy holidays.

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,840
And Scott Gardner also here.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,080
Didn't expect to hear from us, huh?

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,360
You might not be seeing your real family, but at least you get to hear your fake

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,640
family, us, in your ears.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,240
Yes. Now, full disclosure, my hosts don't know what I have convinced them I wanted

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,400
to talk about today.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,880
But the Halloween mini episode was such a smash hit and I had something I

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,000
wanted to talk about that I've bumped from two different episodes for time

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,560
concerns. So I figured, well, I've already got all these pictures captured and

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,200
about 10 sentences. And I think that's damn enough for an episode.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,040
That is damn enough. You're right.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,840
Damn, damn enough.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
Damn, damn enough.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
For a little bit, but manage your expectations listeners.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,760
This is more like the fun socks you get in your Christmas stocking.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,200
The McGruff EP was like the PS5 you got.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,080
So, it's a good way to put it.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,160
Fellas, you all know what time it is.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,560
I want to talk about Earl the squirrel.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,400
Now, as I said, what?

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
What now?

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,680
I had to push this.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,720
I had this set aside for two different like newsy episodes and our holiday episode.

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,760
But both we had events to do.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,000
I think one, Scott, you had to get in the car and drive to Six Flags for the other.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,520
Yeah.

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,840
Oh, I was like literally leaving.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,120
Yeah, I think that's right.

33
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,760
Yes.

34
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,200
And boy, was it worth it.

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,080
See some scary stilt guys in front of closed burrito restaurants.

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,880
Hell yeah. But it took time away from Earl the squirrel.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,040
Earl the squirrel.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
Earl the squirrel. So, listeners, some background if you have not been paying attention.

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,360
So here's what Earl the squirrel is.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:26,160
Earl the squirrel is a small animatronic that pops out of the Universal Studios, Florida, Christmas tree.

41
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:36,240
Now, he's gotten a lot of shine this year, a lot of press in the theme park journalism world.

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,920
And when you say a lot, that's like as much as you can get without me having ever come across this before.

43
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,120
That's right. I believe I texted you an article about it and your response was OK.

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,400
I see.

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,520
But a couple of things. I mean, this year, Earl has a little mask on and I mean.

46
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,240
OK, hold on, hold on. Let me start.

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,440
You can't be mad at that.

48
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,680
I just want to make sure because I don't remember this either.

49
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,000
You probably texted it and I probably didn't even respond.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,520
So is this I'm looking at a picture of Earl right now.

51
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,840
He is an animatronic. He emerges like a cuckoo clock.

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
Is that what you're saying?

53
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,360
Yes, he pops out of the tree every now and then.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,360
And he kind of like was built up as like, you know, there's a lot of apocryphal explanations

55
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,080
about like how he came to be at Universal.

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,560
One was that they were setting up the tree one year and a squirrel jumped out at the Universal team members and startled them.

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,320
Another attacked them. Yeah, attacked them.

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,120
Another was that there was a power outage one year.

59
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,400
The trees just went out.

60
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,000
The lights went out on the tree.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Everyone shocked it up to Earl the squirrel.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,600
And then at some point he got turned into an ornament.

63
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,920
And as you can see, he was he's holding little lights.

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,360
But this year, Earl also became the mascot of the Universal Florida

65
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,720
Christmas Tribute Store,

66
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:14,040
which was formerly the Halloween Horror Nights Tribute Store that kind of in a few days, they flipped to Christmas stuff.

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,960
And now it's a little cartoon, which I think is also pretty cute.

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,440
I remember that picture now.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,880
That's coming back to me.

70
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,440
That seems like familiar.

71
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,560
And this this feels like this this version of Earl seems like a Gravity Falls design type of an Earl.

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,760
It's not a way to put it.

73
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,840
Practical.

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,400
Or it's not a realistic Earl.

75
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,200
It's a fun cartoon Earl.

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:45,960
Yes, I have that in my notes, in fact, that they likely owe the creators of Gravity Falls some some fees, some licensing fees, because he's very

77
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:54,200
you could say it's too like this is a big Christmas tree, like a big Christmas store themed as if it was a tree lot.

78
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,520
And they put Earl on the hot cocoa cups.

79
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,400
They put him on a shirt.

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,080
They put him on a tree farm, which you would come back from Florida with to a lot of blank stares.

81
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,880
That's right. How long has Earl been around?

82
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,880
Well, I think the ornament, like the animatronic ornament in the tree has been around for a little while now.

83
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,600
And I think it's a thing that like, you know, oh, keep an eye out.

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,040
Like, you got to go look for that, you know.

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,280
So it's like a little man of Disneyland.

86
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,960
Yeah.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
Type of a little hidden special.

88
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,320
It's something special for the true fans to notice and point out.

89
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,480
But now they're market, they're mass marketing Earl.

90
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,840
And quite frankly, it sounds like they're diluting sort of that mystery.

91
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,560
You were talking about this different legends of how he he became to be.

92
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,040
But now it looks like he's just out front and they're just deciding to go full, full hog, a whole hog with Earl.

93
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,920
I, you know, I think an argument could be made there because he's, you know, kind of on all of the Christmas brochures.

94
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,200
And everything, you know, there's fake posters for him.

95
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,080
He's promoting like the, oh, look, Scott, I saved this for you.

96
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
He's selling these big gummy lights.

97
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Doesn't that look delicious?

98
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,240
See, oh, they're gummies.

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:21,880
Would you get you'd get so tired of eating that you're looking, you're showing a giant yellow bulb as big as somebody's hand.

100
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,320
And you'd like maybe three bites long you're into this.

101
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,560
And then I think you bail gummies are gummies are tough for me.

102
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,560
I'll eat a gummy, but I'm not a big gummy guy.

103
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,040
Yeah, general, I do think that gummy just plain gummy worms.

104
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,680
I have one or two, but it's not I can't binge on them like some other candies.

105
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,680
I want to point out that the new version of Earl looks a little bit like and maybe I'm wrong.

106
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,960
He looks he's giving me also like a cousin Eddie from the vacation movies vibe.

107
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,200
He's giving me like kind of a Randy Quaid vibe.

108
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,160
He looks a little bit like some alarming tweets all year as well.

109
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,680
Yeah, he's in Canada tweeting, stop the steal and stuff.

110
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,960
He's a big Sidney Powell fan as well.

111
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,560
So stop the steal of nuts.

112
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,480
That is I want him.

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,520
Yeah.

114
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,760
So I'll say this.

115
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,240
I I like Earl the squirrel and I think both versions are cute.

116
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
I like him.

117
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,880
I like him plenty.

118
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm just confused.

119
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Like there is something about this, this sudden presentation

120
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,560
that to where I feel like I'm supposed to have heard of this.

121
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,080
And maybe if I didn't respond to you the first time, Jason, it was because I had no idea what this was.

122
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,840
But you did. Have you been aware of Earl for a long time?

123
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,720
I think I had heard about like the, you know, the thing that pops out of the tree.

124
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,360
But I think this year they kind of like went all in.

125
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,040
Do you have video of him popping out of the tree?

126
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,680
I'd love to see the mechanism.

127
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,320
I don't have video.

128
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,000
No, I'm sure if I can find it.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,400
Yes, see if you can find it.

130
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,200
I don't know. I thought it was just interesting because how often

131
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,160
do the Universal Parks create a totally original character besides like Evac?

132
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Are there any others like that you can think of off the top of your head?

133
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,000
All I can think of are Earl and Evac.

134
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,760
In a way, Botanicus and the E.T. friends, like they are from that book,

135
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:33,600
but that's not they'd never really popped until the ride when you still might

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,920
say they did not pop necessarily because it took us lots of podcast obsession

137
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,240
to know the name Orbidon.

138
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,880
But if you've got Orbidon.

139
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,960
The flop gloppel.

140
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,040
The flop gloppel.

141
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,560
But still not technically original.

142
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,800
That's a good question.

143
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,080
What about like Kimberly Duncan, the host of T2 3D?

144
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,760
That's a good one. Yeah, that's pretty good.

145
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,040
That's original IP.

146
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,640
Still, you couldn't like get a shirt out of it, I wouldn't think.

147
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,720
Well, like the T1 million, I guess, is technically.

148
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,560
But these are also characters created in a different universe as well.

149
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,960
So they're not pure universal.

150
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,760
Or all the scroll seems to be pure universal, not tied to another property.

151
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,960
Yeah. And it reminds me more of a Disney thing

152
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,000
where like fans latch on to something like people charge.

153
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,680
We can see they're latching on to Earl.

154
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,040
They're latching on.

155
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,760
I mean, they're trying to make it happen.

156
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,280
Clearly, there's a lot of Earl merchandise.

157
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,640
Oh, this is also like a new food thing, a new like Instagrammy food thing.

158
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,320
These these big like sugar balls or chocolate balls you drop into hot cocoa.

159
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,920
And then as it melts, it unveils either like more chocolate chips inside

160
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,200
or like marshmallows inside.

161
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,480
Well, how big is the ball? How big is the ball?

162
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,720
It's like slightly larger than like a Christmas tree ball.

163
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,320
Oh, so like there's secrets in the ball.

164
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Yes. Now, this now this has got me very interested.

165
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,680
You can put technology.

166
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,320
That's that's fun as hell. Yeah.

167
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,400
Damn fun. It's damn fun.

168
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,840
It's damn fun. Yeah.

169
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,760
I'm watching World of Micah, World of Micah.

170
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,280
We've mentioned, I think, when we were well, no, we're going to mention

171
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,040
World of Micah, excuse me.

172
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,480
I'm forgetting.

173
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,360
Don't worry, a lot of talk of the YouTube channel, World of Micah coming.

174
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,320
But yeah, we we mentioned him.

175
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,280
He's he's talking about Earl the Squirrel.

176
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,800
And you really can't get a good picture.

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,480
Earl seems like he's kind of high up on the universal tree.

178
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,560
So it was really like a little sneaky, little secret, little fun secret.

179
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,840
If you knew what you were looking for.

180
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,920
Yeah. Now that's ruined.

181
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,480
Now that's over. Now it's market.

182
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Yeah, we're ruining it. We're calling it out.

183
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,920
Yeah. Making it a. Yeah. Right.

184
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,640
So I like I like this.

185
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,120
I think more needs to be done.

186
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,920
We've said this before, Universal, in addition to just embracing its roots,

187
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,800
embracing the classic universal because people like that nostalgia.

188
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,520
I like this trend.

189
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,440
I hope they hide more characters around the park and then gravity falsify them.

190
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,080
Yes.

191
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,800
That's a specific order of events you want to happen more.

192
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,600
Put them in the Gravity Falls machine and then pop them out

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,680
with a cute face that makes them look a little unhinged.

194
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,920
Yeah, I guess this is sort of in pursuit of having Christmas

195
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,520
IP as well.

196
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,800
But, you know, we we've covered Grinchmas before and kind of the odd

197
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,520
weight that they give to Jim Carrey Grinch, although Jim Carrey Grinch,

198
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I think, was on the the SNL that was on last night, I believe.

199
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,880
So Jim Carrey Grinch does loom large.

200
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,680
I mean, it wasn't him doing it confusingly, even though he has been on Seriant Live.

201
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,600
I think it was Pete Davidson. I didn't see the sketch. But OK.

202
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,560
There is a lot of I guess

203
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,680
the Jim Carrey Grinch maybe looms larger than I thought.

204
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
And the God knows the baby looms larger in our mentions

205
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,200
than I ever would have wished.

206
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,640
The baby is everywhere.

207
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,840
The baby is never going to go as long as we do this podcast.

208
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,080
We're going to be bombarded by the baby.

209
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,920
I watched my interview two years ago with the Grinch,

210
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,200
and I I definitely promised a follow up.

211
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720
And then I then I guess last year I was just not invited to any sort

212
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,400
of interview situation with the Grinch.

213
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,920
Which I think is, you know, bullshit.

214
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,680
But we were going to come back maybe with Scott to talk to the Grinch,

215
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,040
because the Grinch, of course, I showed him a photo of baby Grinch.

216
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,680
And I said, were you cute as a baby?

217
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,520
And he said, of course I was cute.

218
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,400
He was very emphatic about it.

219
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,360
And he insulted, I think, Scott, too, because I said, Sky,

220
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
I said your full name to him to try to start a feud.

221
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,520
You say my full name.

222
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,000
I mean, I know all this, but I don't remember.

223
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,840
Yeah, well, I honestly I forgot most of it, too.

224
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,760
And I showed him the iPad and he said, well, who said I wasn't cute?

225
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,360
And I said, well, my co-host, Scott Garner, has been saying

226
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,080
your baby photo wasn't cute.

227
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,160
Keep my keep my name out your lips.

228
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Grinch, much more divisive baby Grinch.

229
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,520
I think everyone can agree that at least one version of Earl is cute.

230
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't I don't think you'll get a lot of pushback.

231
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,080
I like I like these roles.

232
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,160
I just I guess I want to know more.

233
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,640
I like like maybe they have to keep going with this to fully justify it.

234
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,200
Yeah. But it does have kind of an early Duffy

235
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,840
thing about it, where, you know, Mike's obsession with Duffy seemed to come from

236
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,200
suddenly Duffy's in California Adventure and everybody's like, what's Duffy?

237
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,800
And that's sort of similar to this, like Earl, huh?

238
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,560
And merchandise of Earl.

239
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,920
But what's Earl?

240
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,560
Gabbo, Gabbo, Gabbo, Gabbo.

241
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, it's yeah.

242
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,560
I wonder, like, I mean, there's not really a great organic way, I guess,

243
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,960
unless you would have built an Earl ride or something,

244
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,680
because it's not like they have an Earl cartoon or anything.

245
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,200
I don't think at least maybe maybe that's in the works.

246
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,080
But yeah, I also wanted to question the naming of calling something a tribute

247
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,360
store, because I had never really heard that phrase.

248
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,440
And when I Googled it, the main instance of tribute store online

249
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,800
was a business that was like it's a it says tribute store, like for bereavement.

250
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,360
So like send flowers or a nice like gift to those in mourning.

251
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,680
I see what you're saying. I see. I see. Yeah.

252
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,200
But is it is it a store

253
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,560
tributing Earl? No, I think it comes.

254
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,920
It comes from the Halloween Horror Nights tribute store, which they're coming up on,

255
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,280
like approaching 30 years of Halloween Horror Nights.

256
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,720
So I think it's like tributes to characters and houses from that.

257
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,080
I see. And then, you know, the pandemic being making,

258
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,240
you know, necessity, the mother of invention.

259
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,560
They're like, well, let's do a Christmas.

260
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,360
Let's deck it out for Christmas now and let's get this guy in there.

261
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,120
Apparently, it was supposed to be somewhere else.

262
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,040
It was supposed to be at another location, the Christmas store.

263
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,240
And then they real quick moved it into

264
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,640
the Halloween Horror Nights tribute store space, which is like over by the mummy

265
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,520
ride in Universal Florida.

266
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,040
Can we think real quick off the top of our heads, are there other places

267
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,640
you could organically put an animal in Universal Studios, give it a name

268
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,160
and then try to mass market it like?

269
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,080
Maybe a pigeon on top of the New York Street.

270
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,640
You know, and he pops out, it's a kind of a cheap looking effect,

271
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,760
but it's fun. And you point out that there's like

272
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,280
Peter Pigeon or something.

273
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,560
Oh, was Peter Pigeon up? Did you know about Peter Pigeon?

274
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,160
Do you know?

275
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,200
And then all of a sudden, Peter Pigeon is on all the clothes.

276
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,240
And he's a thing.

277
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,680
And eventually, you know what? You keep building this.

278
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,120
You get some walk around characters out of this.

279
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,960
Well, I think you do.

280
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,920
You want to expand like a Duffy and Friends universe of

281
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,560
animals that are just hanging out in Universal.

282
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,960
And then you could do your own. Yeah.

283
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,760
Duffy and Friends. Yeah.

284
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,040
And then they show up and then there's then they have to build a whole

285
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Cape Cod section of Universal where

286
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,120
where Earls, Peter Pigeon and Earl and Earl and Earl and Friends.

287
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Yeah.

288
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,320
Let's see what else?

289
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,080
There's that fear factor area.

290
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,520
Do they still? What's the status of fear factor these days?

291
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,320
It's a good question.

292
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,560
Yeah, it seems like on and off.

293
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,280
I know they don't even know if they do it.

294
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,840
But is there a there were a lot of eating of animals on fear factor

295
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,480
being around animals?

296
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,160
Is there a good is there one most associated with fear factor?

297
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,920
Is it like being covered in snakes or eating worms or I don't know what?

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,800
I feel like there were

299
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I feel like worms.

300
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
I feel like worms.

301
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,840
I feel like people ate a lot of worms there.

302
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,120
OK, if that's the knee jerk that it's that it's worms,

303
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,720
then, you know, I don't want to just go Wally Warnover.

304
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,440
Get some Wally's.

305
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,600
Is there a W.O. name?

306
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Oh, Wendell Wendell.

307
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,680
Oh, that's nice. Wendell Worm. OK.

308
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:37,440
Yeah. Wendell Worm, the friendly the veteran of every fear factor worm dump.

309
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,080
Yeah. And he just pokes his worm head out of like the side of the building.

310
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,920
And it's very tiny.

311
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,240
And you go, oh, check, check that out.

312
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,400
Like, here we go.

313
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,560
And it's just like a little they basically just rethemed a pencil

314
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,920
and they like colored it like a worm and he pokes his little head out

315
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,680
and then he comes back in the hardest spot.

316
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,880
Yeah. It'd be a real eagle eye.

317
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,560
When that's how you think you could eat eagle eyes on.

318
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,520
Remember the eagle eye challenge?

319
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,040
Joe Rogan forest hundreds of people to eat eagles eyes.

320
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,280
He himself gouged a bunch of bald eagle eyes out, made people eat them.

321
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,760
He took some DMT and then he took some eyes out of eagle's heads.

322
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah. So that's that's I like this.

323
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,440
What would we call like, I guess it could be called

324
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
Earl's universe, but like I like the Earl's World.

325
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,440
Earl's. That's good.

326
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,840
That's actually a better name than that is good. Yeah.

327
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,680
I was going for something like

328
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,520
everyday friends, the everyday animal, like something more like

329
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,160
can feature syndicate.

330
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,000
Earl's World featuring the everyday friends.

331
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,040
That's good. Yeah, that's the everyday friends.

332
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,560
All right. These are ideas.

333
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,480
Luckily, this is on the Patreon.

334
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,880
Yeah, these are great ideas.

335
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,760
You know, yeah. Not giving it away for free.

336
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,960
Yeah, they would at least have to pay for five dollars to hear this one episode.

337
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,320
If they want it, if they heard there was something to steal.

338
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,400
Yeah. Did the Blues Brothers have an animal?

339
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,680
Well, they did. They have a dog in Blues Brothers 2000

340
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,960
where they had a little kid.

341
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,560
I definitely had a kid.

342
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,760
Yeah, they had a kid.

343
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,160
And I have no doubt that if they were to do Blues Brothers

344
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,200
2021, that it would be the most CGI strewn film ever made

345
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,840
and that there might be many many blues critters.

346
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,400
Oh, my God. I would love to make Blues Brothers 2021.

347
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,320
Well, you know, they're insisting.

348
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

349
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,840
I was just going to say, actually, let's wait 10 years.

350
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,600
Oh, yes. Yeah.

351
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,720
Blues Brothers 2021 coming in 2029.

352
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,120
Let's hope everyone's alive and 80 years old.

353
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,720
The Blues Brothers Tour America performing at every like big venue

354
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,840
in town to help them recover from the pandemic.

355
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,480
Oh, my God. Great. Oh, yeah.

356
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,920
They're bailing out all their little like, you know,

357
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,560
you have a little like porch side, all the little juke joints.

358
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,880
They're saving America's blues in 2020.

359
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,240
We got the blues in 2021.

360
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,360
We're going to save the blues and sing about what we all experienced.

361
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,320
Oh, I got that covid.

362
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,520
We're going to make me so sad.

363
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,480
Belushi, Goodman, Acroid.

364
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,280
And then there's got to be like Kevin James.

365
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,600
Let's throw in. Oh, Kevin James.

366
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,480
I think Quaid, I think Quaid gets redeemed.

367
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,680
Oh, but throw Dennis in too.

368
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,160
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

369
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

370
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,080
Well, I mean, if they're going to like pop around the country,

371
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,920
then they can go meet a lot of regional great entertainers

372
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,400
like Dennis Quaid.

373
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,920
Blues Brothers, Blues Brothers, Inc.

374
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,080
There's multiple blues brothers around this country.

375
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,320
I mean, they kind of did that, I think, already, but let's really expand it.

376
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,400
Like they're like the men in black at this point.

377
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Yeah, yeah.

378
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,440
And at this point, you know, there's been so many great blues musicians

379
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,160
since they made the last movie, you know, like John Mayer.

380
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,760
So we got to get all the end.

381
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,760
Is Kenny Wayne Shepard, is that a name of someone who was popular

382
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,120
18 years ago? If so, they're going in the new Blues Brothers movie.

383
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,360
It's going in the movie. Uh huh.

384
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,920
Blues and Blues and Friends.

385
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,000
That's good. Josh Stone is in the movie.

386
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,200
I know that seems like somebody.

387
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,480
Yeah, right.

388
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,440
Were they were they on the Grammys in 2003?

389
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,800
Then for sure.

390
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,720
They're on Acro. They just got on Acro.

391
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,080
It's great. Our greatest.

392
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,800
This is the great of all the movies we've ever made up

393
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,800
thinking about making this one to me is the most exciting.

394
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,200
It's pretty good.

395
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,280
And you know that they would want to do mocap bodies, right?

396
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,920
Like undoubtedly, they would want to peewee it.

397
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,880
Yeah, or the Irishmen.

398
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,800
Yes. Yeah.

399
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,520
Oh, so they look young, but they still they still dance

400
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,600
like current acro and Jim Belushi.

401
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,280
Oh, I want this movie to happen so bad.

402
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,800
Yes, they're there.

403
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,840
And then, John, you can get John in the movie as well.

404
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,240
You get. Oh, John Belushi is back.

405
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,400
Yeah.

406
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,000
My grandma, Tarquin, Peter Cushing.

407
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,040
Yeah, Leia at the end of Rogue One, John Belushi in the movie

408
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,120
the whole time, she could come back to Leia can come back to.

409
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,280
Well, she's from the.

410
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,640
That's right. They got the model.

411
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Throw Carrie Fisher in there. Absolutely.

412
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,080
She's in the first one, Mike.

413
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,320
She's trying to kill them.

414
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,840
Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. Yes. You're right. Yeah.

415
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,560
Mark Hamill's in. Mark Hamill shows up.

416
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,160
Oh, yeah.

417
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,320
Oh, I. Yeah.

418
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,880
If there's a model of them, then they're in.

419
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,600
And yeah, that feels exactly like Eckerd would have no problem

420
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
throwing a CGI.

421
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,560
No, Lucia and maybe a Farley to.

422
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,240
Oh, please.

423
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,960
They entirely construct a new Blues brother played by Chris Farley.

424
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,400
And most people, like 90% of people are like, what a great tribute.

425
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Like only people on the on the fringes are like,

426
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,400
that's weird as shit that they would do that.

427
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,880
All the all the James Browns in the movie again, like James Brown's back.

428
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,280
And he's in the movie.

429
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,120
60s James Brown, 80s James Brown.

430
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,920
All of the era.

431
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,160
This is a four hour movie

432
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,240
that spans the era.

433
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,040
What was this episode about already?

434
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,320
Earl is just a jumping off.

435
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,520
But see, a little spark of imagination,

436
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,800
and then you end up creating a universe.

437
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,040
Hopped out to give us some ideas.

438
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,360
God damn it.

439
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,760
I would go right into this.

440
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,320
I've been exhausted all day just from living.

441
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,320
Now I have nothing wrong.

442
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,040
It's just it's just there's a lot going on in the world and everything.

443
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,880
I've been so tired.

444
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,240
And this is the first time I felt any energy today is the idea of this.

445
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,280
This is great.

446
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,680
And you know what? We title back together before.

447
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,280
There's a little cartoon short, like in the old days of the movies.

448
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And it's Earl and his friends, the everyday friends.

449
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,000
Does Earl play like harmonica or anything?

450
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,560
Blues harmonica, maybe maybe in the logo,

451
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,800
maybe the Universal Globe logo, it turns around and he's standing on top of it.

452
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,280
And he's dressed like a blues brother.

453
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,760
And he's playing the harmonica a little after the short.

454
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,160
That's fine. But it's got to be short because we got to get to this movie.

455
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,440
We got to get to it.

456
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah, we got to get like two and a half minutes tops

457
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,640
because we have four hours we got.

458
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,720
This is also going to save movie theaters

459
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,160
and bring movies back as they bring the concert industry back.

460
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,040
We finally have a plan.

461
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,120
It would really be perfect.

462
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,160
Like you could be shooting in a month.

463
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,200
And it's like the first movie to come out after everybody has a vaccine.

464
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,720
And it's the biggest movie of all time.

465
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,800
Yes. If you're distributing the vaccine, you know,

466
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,360
they're suited agents like the military.

467
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,400
I know that's not how it's ending up playing out,

468
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,880
but this is what Trump wanted to do.

469
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,640
The military is just handing people more.

470
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,120
So they like there's like like they meet a CGI James Brown,

471
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,080
who's, you know, also tired from living.

472
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,680
And he's just like on a couch like I don't dance no more.

473
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,240
And then they stick him with the vaccine and he gets up. Hey!

474
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,920
We're on a mission from God to vaccinate the United States of America

475
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,360
with with with Pfizer's vaccine and a healthy dose of blues.

476
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,520
It's chased with blues.

477
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,160
Oh, my God.

478
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,760
So they're driving. So the blues mobile has it's like cold.

479
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,520
It like there's a bunch of dry ice.

480
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,200
Yeah, they're driving around a big wagon full of dry ice.

481
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,880
It's got to be kept very cold.

482
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Subway zero.

483
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,000
Yeah, very extremely cool, just like the blues.

484
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,800
So so there's a lot of different satellite blues, brother cars,

485
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,000
blues mobiles with the different blues brother configurations.

486
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,400
So I guess it's like Chris Farley.

487
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,800
I guess you could put Spade in.

488
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,840
Mm hmm. Oh, Spade's good. Yeah.

489
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,080
They're all mocapped, though, like he's almost like he looks like himself in 95.

490
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,240
But very plastic. Yeah. Yeah.

491
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,760
And they're all doing they're all doing this across the world.

492
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,080
And then they all come together for a giant like Live Aid concert at the end.

493
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,360
But they take it.

494
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,680
But then don't forget that at some point they take the wrong ramp

495
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,560
and the ramp keeps sending the car up to space and then they get they get

496
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,240
get subjected by a spaceship and then they get out.

497
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,240
Build our conehead.

498
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,480
Yes, that's right.

499
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,760
We are big fans of the blues.

500
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,960
I mean, let's put let's throw every asteroid.

501
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,040
Mr. Mainway from Mainway Toys from this from Saturday Night Live.

502
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,200
Let's get it. Yeah, that's me.

503
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,840
Toy guy.

504
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,480
I'm selling a vaccine, too.

505
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,120
It's a toy vaccine for kids.

506
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,240
Seems like we can get some of the budget covered if we have a good scene

507
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,000
where like the conehead shake hands with the Space Force Guardians.

508
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,120
You know, that's a good.

509
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,880
Oh, ours, one of the guardians.

510
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,280
Oh, there's one of the guardians.

511
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,520
Oh, shit.

512
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,160
Oh, I love it is in this, too.

513
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,560
It says a big part in this.

514
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,360
I don't know what it is.

515
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,120
I guess he could be a blues brother, too.

516
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,760
Yeah, yeah.

517
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,960
Love it can be the head of Dippin Dots.

518
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,160
Here's another brand we can get in there because Dippin Dots

519
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,200
sell those extra cool coolers that they might have to use for the vaccine.

520
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,400
Dippin Dots is involved in the vaccination effort.

521
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,840
What a miracle that is like a movie, like a rag tag.

522
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,800
That's that's like hiring Randy Quaid to fly the fighter jet in Independence Day.

523
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,160
What do we got?

524
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,960
We got a Dippin Dots truck.

525
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,360
You're in.

526
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,520
Eleven year old me is vindicated by the quality of Dippin Dots.

527
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,080
Was the ice cream of the future the ice cream that saved the future?

528
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,680
Wow. The future.

529
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,120
Well, God, this would be the greatest film of all time.

530
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,000
This is great.

531
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,680
It shows the power of universal IP, which is where we began.

532
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,280
So sorry, you're all.

533
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,720
Thank you, Earl, but sorry, Earl.

534
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,320
It all started with a squirrel.

535
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,720
Never forget.

536
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,960
Never forget the finest film.

537
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,720
And we're still even though it's so it's the movie is going to be all about

538
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,200
the events of twenty twenty one, but it's not going to come out until twenty

539
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,560
twenty nine. Yeah, it's going to take a long time because the because like

540
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,760
Irishmen took forever because of all that CGI.

541
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,520
Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,920
Get them into Pacino and De Niro.

543
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,840
And yeah, yeah, they're they're their own Blues Brothers.

544
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,200
They're their own Blues Brothers.

545
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,720
And for the post-production houses,

546
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,480
the crunch on this is going to be gnarly just to heads up.

547
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,360
Honestly, though, be funny if it's like you got two weeks.

548
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,360
Do your best.

549
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,120
We're exporting at midnight on

550
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,920
two Fridays from now, no matter what.

551
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,960
Whatever you got, we're putting out in the theater.

552
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,760
It doesn't matter.

553
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,120
Good luck and see what happens.

554
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
See what comes out.

555
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,440
They're booked.

556
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,720
Everyone's gotten their tickets, even though we haven't.

557
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,160
Why aren't more movies made as like bit as a bit?

558
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,880
You know, I mean, Soderbergh's done a few like that,

559
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,120
and they've been mixed results, but sure, fun.

560
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,720
But this seems like this is slam dunk.

561
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,800
Yeah, this is why I do wish movies were like this.

562
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,080
And they will be when we do Blues Brothers twenty twenty one.

563
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,080
Well, is that it?

564
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,440
That's it. Is that our Christmas treat?

565
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,560
That's our Christmas treat.

566
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,760
Hey, listeners, have a great Christmas.

567
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,400
Yeah, you survived.

568
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,560
Now you've survived our twenty twenty content.

569
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,560
Took longer than you thought.

570
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,080
A little bit like a half hour longer.

571
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,520
You thought you were done. Just a little little cherry on top.

572
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,640
Just listen to a little Christmas blues and enjoy the night.

573
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,320
They got to have a Christmas album, right?

574
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,480
Is there a Blues Brothers Christmas album?

575
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,880
Well, if not, we're going to start working on one.

576
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,400
It's for you to make. That's for a blues brothers Christmas.
