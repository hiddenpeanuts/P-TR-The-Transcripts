1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil rears its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried donut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, With secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Boys, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, he will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of the mall.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We have 18 daily, very necessary episodes and much to do so.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic or boring.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Downtown Disney ordeal, level four, stage one.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always Scott Gerdner.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hi.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And Jason Sheridan.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We got stuff to address, but something just happened.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, something just happened here that's I rushed to hit record on the Jason sign.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We were wondering, we're waiting to record and Jason sort of over by the trash.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We usually walk to the kitchen.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Two things actually happened.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
When you have this new hand soap in your kitchen, it smells amazing.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And I was trying to like make a note of what it was.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We've been recording all day and you're taking soap smell on time.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The madness he's setting in.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But the most important thing that just happened is that you said I was getting a glass for my sucker.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, I got a little lolly.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Getting a sucker cup.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So he has a glass from the cupboard and he's just, he's rested his sucker, which is covered in caramel.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And it's a green, it's a green apple.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's a green apple caramel one.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A good sucker.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a good sucker, but it takes a while to get through.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And I didn't want to be here like, like on the show, like a whole thing.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I did it now.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, no, no.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Obviously I made that noise.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All right.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So there is just to set the stage for you.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Jason's taking like a especially long time.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's happening?

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm getting my sucker cup.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's almost as good as if he was just like, I'm baking six donuts.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Like what?

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was wondering what the oven would be on.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That would be inefficient.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You want to make them in large batches.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And obviously I'm eating three of those.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So I don't want you guys to just have one each.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Like that's fair.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But that, that immediately had to be said, but the big headline is we're back.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We're back.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We made it out of the underworld.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We're back in the main feed.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We made it back onto, we're on solid free ground again.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you have not, if you didn't accompany us, if you weren't selfless enough to accompany us on our journey to the underworld and to help us through it, then you haven't heard from us in three days.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All I can say is it's been a hell of a three days.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We defeated a comedy icon of a boss.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't even really want to say to reveal cause you should go back and you should subscribe to our Patreon to find out who we're talking about.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But he's a businessman.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He's an entrepreneur, sunglass icon, sunglass icon.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's just, yeah, that's it.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's, it was, it was something.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's all we'll say.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And, and we met, and we, hey, we met a lot of friends down there.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You know, you can poke around, you can look, Hey, you can find out what we did and maybe even check out what we did.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you go to patreon.com slash podcast, the ride.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And the good thing about the Patreon is we also have a ton of episodes, not about this mall.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Going backwards.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You'll hear if, yeah, if you're tired of hearing us talking about another place that sells stocks.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If you subscribe to find out what happens, cause you're a completist, you can also go listen to the episodes about rides or robots or people in suit, anthropomorphic animal suits.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Which the main feed will have again, someday.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We promise.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll make sure of it.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We promise.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
After this.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So what we have now made it out is how many are we now?

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's we, what we were initially thinking was going to be 15 episodes that is now 18.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So we're not as far through as we thought.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We got six more to go.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Six to go.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There were three extras.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That was a surprise.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We thought there were three sprung up like funguses.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes. So we have failed at our attempt to be much shorter than city walk to go easier on ourselves.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And now we are adding up to just one less merciful one.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Sure.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Merciful for you, the listener, cruel for us, the podcasters.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But on our journey back, back to the above place, we are, thank God, joined by our spirit guide, the sector keeper.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Boys, boys, you give me strength.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're back.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thanks.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We made it.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You were there too.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, we're all back.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We're back where we should be free.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It is a tough.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And I don't know that free is accurate either.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Accurate?

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What do you mean?

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What do you mean?

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, we're in this mob where we've got to finish the mob before we can be truly free.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, I see what you're saying.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No, no one is free and especially not your cousin to recap what is happening.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The level keeper is still missing and the level.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Wouldn't you know it?

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The level keeper also not in the underworld.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes, we just keep missing the level keeper.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Just keep missing.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But you're close.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I promise you.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I bet we're not one level close.

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Probably two.

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Maybe more.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No more.

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
More?

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you going to spring on us that we have to do the harbor businesses?

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
God, don't give him an idea.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll be honest.

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't give him an idea you want to have.

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I want to do it.

131
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The harbor hoedown.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The harbor hoedown.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I would like to combine it with the downtown Disney ordeal right now.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Harbor hoedown is separate.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This is a future year when you found a third coast who is more amenable to this kind of

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
thing.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All right.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Get that guy Anthony Geo and he'll be down for this.

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
When you take a six month leave of absence to do SNL Bahrain to do the digital shorts.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Sounds good.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh my God.

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I wish I could only dream of jobs of that nature.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Fingers crossed.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But no, here we are back in.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We didn't even cross to the bridge yet.

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Like to the like, you know, if you're going west in downtown Disney, we aren't even like

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
to the part that goes over the street.

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We're still pretty far back.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Right.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Like we paused pretty like mid mid mall.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Where are we?

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Where are we going now today?

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're going to level four stage one.

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Boys, would you like to know where you're visiting?

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You must discuss and review to ideally free the level keeper.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We know we got it.

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah, we know.

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay.

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It doesn't end today.

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't think.

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No, I don't think so either.

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't think it will.

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Blacktap window service spot, Splitsville luxury lanes, Tortilla Joe's and other fountains.

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Boys, no.

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Sorry.

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We have to.

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We have to.

171
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's part of the mission you gave us.

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So sorry.

173
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We already did.

174
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Be careful and keep your mouths closed.

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We will.

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No staff for us.

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We already did.

178
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Whatever the fuck is it called?

179
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Crazy shake.

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Blacktap.

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What's the sit down?

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Blacktap.

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It was so long ago now.

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Craft burgers and shakes.

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Right.

187
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But this is a different.

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is the window behind it.

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You just get shakes to go.

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Either standard shakes or crazy shakes.

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This fell into a different.

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes.

193
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Level.

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is a totally.

195
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Look, it's a, you know, it's in a different spot.

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So that's why there's a different zoning because all this is basically sort of zoning.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I think Edwin is smelling my sucker in the air.

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
My loli.

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You need a sucker cup to protect as a moat from hungry dogs.

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Jason is so worried about the dog.

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm worried Jason might just like shove him over to get him away from his sucker.

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They start growling at each other.

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Every episode you and me become very similar.

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We're both childlike in our wonder.

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes.

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, that's true.

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Uh, so yeah, that's a different.

208
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So yeah, we're going to discuss the service window versus the actual sit down restaurant.

209
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Just the service window.

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now it's interesting.

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They have figured out a way to do the crate.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They give you a plastic cup with like a shelf on top.

213
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you're getting a crazy shake to go, but I think it's a limited selection of crazy shakes.

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't think it's the full ones.

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Right.

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And it's also, it's a dollar more or so for the shake at the window because you got to

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
account for the margins on those extra special cups.

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Right.

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Cause you get to keep those cups.

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So yeah, if you forced by of a souvenir cup park with you.

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes.

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Because, because if you think about it, obviously you're going to walk around with your crazy

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
shake when you're inside, it's just a glass, you know, that they take back and they wash.

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah.

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And obviously like, you're not going to have to bring back a glass to the service window.

226
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Like that would be absurd.

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a plastic.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a whole other skid.

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
They need to order these custom glasses.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Right.

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, but this you could take, and it's like a plastic glass.

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes.

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So you could take a crazy shake into the park with you, which I did not do.

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I should have now that I'm thinking about it.

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Uh, and try to take it on a ride perhaps.

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

237
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I mean, those shakes are like, the crazy ones are like 14 bucks.

238
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There's still a few places in Disney world or Disneyland where you can get a meal for

239
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
the, the price of one milkshake.

240
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Sure.

241
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Earl of sandwich.

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You could get two sandwiches.

243
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Easy.

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You can get desserts and science.

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Can't wait.

246
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's crazy.

247
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah.

248
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The standard shakes.

249
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What's the problem?

250
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What was that one?

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The Earl of Suttered.

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Robert Earl.

253
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh no.

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Uh oh.

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We don't, I don't think we even know what's ahead of us.

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The level keepers warned me of him.

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay.

258
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh boy.

259
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The standard shakes are $9.

260
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,560
And I always laugh thinking about pulp fiction and, uh, Vincent Vega being so blown away

261
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,000
of like $5 milkshake.

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's better be a good milk.

263
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's pretty good milkshake.

264
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,600
And doesn't that seem quaint now when we're charging $9?

265
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Quentin should do a, Quentin Tarantino should do a special edition where he changes the

266
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,440
amount so it matches today's times for inflation.

267
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,120
Maybe he says like $9.

268
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
What are we at the black tab?

269
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,240
Black tab, black tab, black tab.

270
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,160
When he put, when he dies, like whoever buys his film rights, that is something that will

271
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
probably happen.

272
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Oh God.

273
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,520
He'll start to put advertisements in classic movies.

274
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
That's the way we're headed.

275
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
I think.

276
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,880
Well, I think we're, I think we're headed to one of the shittiest movies ever filmed.

277
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
Pulp fiction too.

278
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Oh my God.

279
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
You're right.

280
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Whatever nightmare.

281
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Isn't there another Travolta?

282
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,680
Like there was like a singer guy named like Joey Travolta or something.

283
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,600
The Joey Travolta will be in it.

284
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Yeah.

285
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Oh man.

286
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I didn't even think about that.

287
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Samuel M Jackson.

288
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
His brother.

289
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:47,120
The, the, the first I in fiction will be a room numeral two.

290
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,800
Quentin Tarantino and his, Quentin Tarantino's dad and Al Pacino's dad, Sal Pacino teamed

291
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
up for a movie.

292
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,320
So on the directed, I forget what the name of it is, the directed DVD case, it says Tarantino

293
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
and Pacino.

294
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,360
Come on.

295
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
So there's already stuff like that going on.

296
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,440
I just saw the trailer for the Jesus movie.

297
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,760
The John Turturro directed Big Lebowski spin-off directed by John Turturro.

298
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
What?

299
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
What?

300
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,280
John Turturro has taken it upon himself to make a spin-off of the Big Lebowski.

301
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,160
We're not talking to, Tara Reid already did this with those laugh Meisters at Funny or

302
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Die.

303
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Big Lebowski too.

304
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
That's not what we're talking about.

305
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
That's not what we're talking about.

306
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,600
I'm sure all listeners remember.

307
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,040
Of course all the listeners remember.

308
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,280
So I honestly, you're right about Pulp Fiction too, as soon as Quentin Tarantino dies.

309
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,040
Oh God, they're all getting cranked through.

310
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,520
I wonder if he can put something in, like I wonder if there's like a click, he can like

311
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,360
maybe 50 years after he dies, he can keep it protected or something.

312
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
We'll see.

313
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Maybe not.

314
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Everything's going to erode.

315
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,320
They'll make it when he's alive, maybe.

316
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,200
Harvey Weinstein, who owns it?

317
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Hmm, Weinstein company?

318
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I don't know.

319
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Bill Cosby.

320
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Does Disney own it?

321
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,160
They bought the Miramax library, is that right?

322
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
I don't know.

323
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
If it's in life.

324
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Who is the production?

325
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
If Disney owns it, we're getting it for sure.

326
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,800
Oh man, if Disney owns it.

327
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
What Disney rules?

328
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Disney's small family company.

329
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,720
I don't even think that was true when you were live.

330
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,240
Pulp Fiction too, a stitch in time.

331
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,760
Get it before it goes into the Disney plus vault forever.

332
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
And stitches in it.

333
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Sure.

334
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,160
You know what, honestly, that's fun.

335
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Yeah, sure.

336
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
I don't hate that.

337
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,120
He free, yeah, he's like scram runner.

339
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,680
He like bites the gimp in the butt.

340
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,480
Yeah, that's cute.

341
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,280
He gets the, it gets Tim Roth to reach in the bag.

342
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,200
His wallet is the one that says, right?

343
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,360
That's how Stitch talks.

344
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,280
That is how he talks too.

345
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,920
Jason Hannibal sounds.

346
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Yeah.

347
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,000
It's been a runner.

348
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,640
So Black Tap, does this cover us?

349
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,600
We talked about these shakes already.

350
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Yes.

351
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,040
So yeah, basically the gist is there's a service window and you just go up there, you pay an

352
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,760
extra dollar and you get a glass to take home essentially.

353
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,440
And it's the same shake as you get inside for the most part.

354
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,840
They're a limited menu.

355
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Yeah.

356
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Yeah.

357
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,680
It's, that's the gist of it.

358
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,360
No, really what else?

359
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,840
Just shakes, shakes to go.

360
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Moving on?

361
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
We call, I guess we could move on.

362
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Moving on.

363
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
Oh my God.

364
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Wow.

365
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,920
What we get to move on to, you know what, I really quick, I'd like to say that this

366
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,200
is, you know, these like weird classifications of areas that they don't use anymore that

367
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,640
I've been bringing up.

368
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,560
This area, I bet y'all didn't even know.

369
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,080
I'll keep my tea hidden from the dog who got interested in it immediately as I pull out

370
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,720
my old trusty Disney magazine from spring 2001.

371
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
What's on back of magazine?

372
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,440
Oh yeah.

373
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,880
You noticed this when I pulled it out before center keeper.

374
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,880
It's a little distracting that the side that you're looking at from your chair has a full

375
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:18,280
page back of magazine ad that is for the 2001 Toyota Sienna.

376
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,720
And it has the, I mean, you're distracted by it because it is a black and white photo

377
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:32,280
of a naked baby sleeping on the arm of a kind of a buff man.

378
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,880
And this is an ad for the Toyota Sienna.

379
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,720
I know I'm just ghost of child, but this is weird.

380
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,920
It's definitely weird.

381
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,660
It's a little and get ease ish.

382
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,320
We talked a little and get ease down in the underworld.

383
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,800
So a good head of the Patriot for that.

384
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
It's very strange.

385
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,560
It's not a good way to hold a baby remotely just with this.

386
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,280
It's head down and it's in your Palm.

387
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,760
Yeah.

388
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,640
It's it's a, it's a creepy baby too.

389
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
I don't know.

390
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,480
Like why the back of a family magazine?

391
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Yes.

392
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Yeah.

393
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Yeah.

394
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,200
And obviously baby nudity, you judge differently because babies are nude more often, but it

395
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,760
is still, it can be very creepy, especially when it's this very hazy, glossy,

396
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,080
black and white photo.

397
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,920
And then the bizarre tagline, give them love, compassion, sheet metal and steel.

398
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,480
We'll tweet a picture.

399
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,440
We'll tweet a picture of that.

400
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,560
That's a strange, get it out there.

401
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,520
That's the 2001 Toyota Sienna.

402
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,560
Give it to your baby.

403
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,160
The babies, the naked babies who grew up in Toyota Sienna's are now adults.

404
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,160
They do still make the Toyota Sienna.

405
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,480
This baby we're looking at can vote today.

406
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,440
So vote in the most important election of your lifetime, baby is coming up.

407
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,160
So yeah.

408
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,080
Vote or die, baby.

409
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
That's coming back.

410
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,200
Give the world love, compassion and sheet metal and steel.

411
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Curl surfer die.

412
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Or what was it?

413
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,200
No, it was no, it was a snooker die.

414
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Snooker die.

415
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
I'm getting confused already.

416
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,480
I'm sorry, we've been doing this too long.

417
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,600
It's yeah, we should, we should say by the way, I've never, have we recorded more than

418
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,640
two podcasts the rides in a row.

419
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,520
We've been recording all day because we're trying to get these done faster and it's hitting

420
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
me.

421
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,240
I want to do it every recording now.

422
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,880
I mean, yeah, there's a loopiness that's setting in, but it's truly making me wonder after

423
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,200
I finish every sentence, did the previous sentence make sense?

424
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,480
I hope just tell me if it didn't.

425
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
I think we would jump all over you if it didn't.

426
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Probably.

427
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
I think you're doing fine.

428
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,080
Sometimes I find myself staring off and then brought back suddenly.

429
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,640
You're just like the listener.

430
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Nonsense.

431
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Everyone's fascinated by every word of this, every description of a naked baby advertising

432
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,400
a Toyota Sienna.

433
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,800
What I was heading for is that this area is, we don't even know the name of it anymore.

434
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,240
It's called Paradise Plaza.

435
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,380
It's the heart of downtown's high energy live music area.

436
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
It is.

437
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,880
I guess when we passed by it the other night, there was like a Andrew Sisters kind of group.

438
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Yeah.

439
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,760
But the concerts have happened elsewhere for a long time.

440
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,800
They also strangely say the colorful fountain in the center is shaped like a California

441
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,080
poppy, the state's official flower, but that's not where the poppy fountain is.

442
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
No.

443
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,560
This is a good time to talk about one of our topics, other fountains.

444
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Yeah.

445
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
It can't go out of order.

446
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
No, no.

447
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
It's just the fountain.

448
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Oh, because you, okay, okay.

449
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,280
But you have to for my, for my cousin, the level keeper.

450
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,240
Yeah, you're drifting too.

451
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,840
There is a fountain in here.

452
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
It's just like, it's like a shark fin.

453
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,680
It's like a triangle.

454
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,480
It's a fine fountain.

455
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,120
And this is also where the deconstructed Donald sculpture is right now.

456
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,600
They have all these deconstructed sculptures that when you look at them at the correct

457
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:07,560
angle, they form, you can see the character, but from the side, it just looks like pieces.

458
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,840
It's like horrifying, disembodied pieces on posts.

459
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,240
I think they're cool.

460
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,520
The sector keeper didn't really like them.

461
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,800
I couldn't figure it out.

462
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,280
It was like a magic eye.

463
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,640
Like a magic eye.

464
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,000
I didn't have the angle.

465
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,040
I'm too little.

466
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,760
You weren't tall enough.

467
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,600
We needed to lift you up.

468
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,800
You're still very short.

469
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,920
I acknowledge that when you look at those, uh oh, I dropped something.

470
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,640
I acknowledge when you look at those from the wrong angle, it's kind of horrifying.

471
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,560
There's a, there's a Grant Morrison writer.

472
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:48,080
He's a comic book writer, an issue of Multiversity where who's, who's the original Dr. Manhattan,

473
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
not the analog.

474
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,600
Oh, um, Captain Adam.

475
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Captain Adam.

476
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,360
He takes, he's trying to understand humanity and what life is.

477
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,520
And he like takes a dog apart and understands like he, cause he's trying to figure out what

478
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,920
makes it and why is it, uh, why is it a thing?

479
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,200
Yeah, so it's all the component pieces.

480
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,800
It's all the component pieces of it.

481
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,480
And so he's all like, does he put it back together?

482
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,080
He does put it back together because he's all powerful.

483
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,320
But like, it's as if someone was like, why is Donald fun?

484
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,000
I must rip this duck apart and look at its pieces to understand it completely.

485
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,120
And then you're looking at the pieces of Donald and you're like, ah, cause that's what happens

486
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,480
to people when they see this character rip a dog apart.

487
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,640
There is a hatch, there is a beak.

488
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,880
I do not understand why it is funny.

489
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,880
It's his bottom.

490
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,880
Yeah, right.

491
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
For sure.

492
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,160
Well, the seat, his thick seat.

493
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
We switched our terminology.

494
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Yeah.

495
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,040
We call it a seat now to make it more friendly.

496
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Yeah.

497
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,880
That's our word for, uh, well, I can't, I don't even want to say the words anymore.

498
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,880
For your rear.

499
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,240
So we wanted to keep it, cause I, I said a dirty word referring to it.

500
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
What did you say?

501
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Uh, A-S-S.

502
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
So.

503
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Thanks for deconstructing the word.

504
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
Yeah.

505
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
I wanted to break it.

506
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,720
It feels good to be bad.

507
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Feel free.

508
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Do you want to say a swear right now?

509
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Yeah.

510
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
Do you want to go for it?

511
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
You can say it out more than we are.

512
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Yeah.

513
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
Go for it.

514
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Okay.

515
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,720
I'm going to say shit.

516
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Wow.

517
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
That's good.

518
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,840
Oh, he's dragging his jewel.

519
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,320
Oh, big hit.

520
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
What flavor is that?

521
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Oh yeah.

522
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
That's the stuff.

523
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Okay.

524
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
He's not even listening to you.

525
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,320
He's so cool.

526
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,320
He's just ignoring you.

527
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Fall asleep.

528
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Okay.

529
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
That flavor was pumpkin spice.

530
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
It's just the season.

531
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,320
Well, like a little past it, honestly.

532
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Is it?

533
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Now it's November.

534
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
It's.

535
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
All right.

536
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
You're right.

537
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Pumpkin spice mint.

538
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Right.

539
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
That's how everything has mint in it.

540
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Thanksgiving and Christmas.

541
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Yeah.

542
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
So, uh, we now, so paradise Plaza, the hall of fame.

543
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,320
We're finally at the heart as we deconstructed into parts.

544
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
That's right.

545
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
I understand.

546
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
We're trying to, we're doing that without that.

547
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,320
We're trying to understand it by pulling it apart and seeing all the different pieces

548
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
of it.

549
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,320
There's it's, there's it's wine district and there's it's a paradise Plaza.

550
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Okay.

551
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
But also we're learning.

552
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,320
It doesn't make sense when you take them pieces away.

553
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,320
We are learning the same thing that, uh, what captain Adam learned.

554
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Yeah.

555
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,320
The weight of years pulling this park down parts of the nineties, parts of the two thousand

556
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,320
right.

557
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
It doesn't add up.

558
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
We're learning the great lesson of life.

559
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Is it fun there?

560
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
We still don't know.

561
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
We still don't know.

562
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
And maybe we'll never know.

563
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,320
Maybe the heart will help though, because we, I think did one of the best things that

564
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,320
we have done in either the saga or the ordeal.

565
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
We went to splitsville.

566
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Splitsville.

567
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,320
And this was a big milestone for us.

568
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,320
It was the very first time we got something free.

569
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Got something free on Disney property.

570
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Yeah.

571
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Yeah.

572
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Well, it was, yes.

573
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,320
So press opportunity.

574
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
We said, you know, we're a podcast and we'd love to come in and review.

575
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
We'd love to check everything out.

576
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
I don't know if I said review, but check everything out.

577
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
You know, we're journal, we're theme park journalists.

578
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
And they said, sure.

579
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Yeah.

580
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
So great.

581
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Yeah.

582
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Right.

583
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,320
And then being sort of a separate organization, I guess, like Disney, you have their own.

584
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Disney is so cold to us in general.

585
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,320
And of course they're wrong to be because we are, they need us in a lot of ways.

586
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
They don't realize it yet.

587
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:27,320
But as we establish cold also to Jenny Nicholson, to our friend, the new way of a alt theme

588
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,320
park media, they are pretending doesn't exist.

589
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Yeah.

590
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Yeah.

591
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,320
And I mean like you're, there's other places like we're, am I jealous of fresh baked Disney?

592
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
The YouTube channel that gets into the stuff.

593
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Of course I am.

594
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Very jealous of his ass.

595
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Yeah.

596
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,320
But does he have ghost child saying shit in his content?

597
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,800
I will say that for sure all the other theme park media, there is yet to be a ghost child

598
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
on any of this stuff.

599
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Jim and Len have not had a ghost child, a dusty sage, mice chat, no ghost child hasn't

600
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
happened.

601
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
So we are innovating.

602
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Disney doesn't understand it.

603
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Bumper car boys.

604
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Bumper car boys.

605
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Fuck the bumper guys.

606
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Excuse me.

607
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Screw the bumper car boys.

608
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I said the F word.

609
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I'm so sorry.

610
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Sometimes it feels good.

611
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Sometimes I mean, sometimes it feels good to be bad.

612
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
So he's right.

613
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
I saw a tweet though.

614
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,520
I think they are prepping a series that involves a zombie child.

615
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Those fuckers.

616
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Those bumper car boys.

617
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,880
Ripping us off, lifting us, they're covering.

618
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,280
Disney doing freaking zombies?

619
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
I think, I don't know.

620
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
The bumper car boys are doing.

621
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
No, no, no.

622
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Bumper car boys are.

623
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,760
Cause they're doing, they're doing a 25 part series about everything in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

624
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,440
Oh, wow.

625
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,240
They better not get to the harbor hoot nanny before us.

626
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,640
Yeah, if we don't get to it within, you know, within the next two weeks, bumper car boys

627
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,280
are going to steal it.

628
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Those fucking bumper.

629
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Excuse me.

630
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,160
Those freaking bumper car boys.

631
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
I like to knock them on their seat.

632
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Yeah.

633
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Kick them right in the seat.

634
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,680
I say so splitsville, the bowling splitsville.

635
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,880
But I'm happy to say, despite the free stuff, we had a great time.

636
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,480
We are not lying.

637
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,520
No, we haven't been bought.

638
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,920
I already would have said nice things about splitsville because I had not done the bowling

639
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
component of it.

640
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,480
I had not done like the, you know, the main thing you go there for, but I'd done it just

641
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,520
as a, as a restaurant because there's an outdoor patio and a nice bar and it just being one

642
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,320
of the newer restaurants on property.

643
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:28,000
And it's immediately such a big boon to the downtown district, Disney district.

644
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,880
And I think my wife would agree like with suddenly it's like, oh my God, you can actually

645
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:39,480
get their meals outside of our beloved trio of flatbreads at the, at the bar.

646
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,080
I think food was a little more slim pickings and with black tap and ballast point, like

647
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,160
it's all been improving.

648
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,360
So if you don't even do the bowling part, just like you can get good beer, good drinks,

649
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,280
good food at this place bowling alley, like a cool mid-century art directed.

650
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Yes.

651
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,200
So it's just this first appearance of aesthetics.

652
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Yes.

653
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,200
It might be the first aesthetics I like anywhere in downtown Disney.

654
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,200
It's got this mod 60s vibe.

655
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Oh yeah, sure.

656
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Yeah.

657
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Yeah.

658
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
But I think it's open before.

659
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,480
So it was like, it was so rare to see like you could take a picture of something and

660
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,400
in downtown Disney and you like the way the picture looks.

661
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,920
I first went there just solo actually and sat in the outside area where they have little

662
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,560
concerts and stuff, keeping the promise of paradise Plaza alive.

663
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Yes.

664
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,080
They'll have like an acoustic guitar out there.

665
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,200
Uh, the guy who's fine.

666
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,320
Um, and the, the wall that the musicians perform in front of is this like super Jetson Z like

667
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,800
the little like 60s slivers.

668
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,880
It actually reminds me of like, uh, like the way old like churches from the sixties look.

669
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,120
It's like cool church architecture.

670
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,200
Oh yeah, I see that.

671
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
I get it.

672
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,480
And you pass by that or you see the monorail going by.

673
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,600
It's like, it feels like a little, it feels like a little slice of sixties tomorrow land.

674
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,520
We were sitting by that giant window inside and the monorail would go right by it and

675
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,960
it was great.

676
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
So neat.

677
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Yeah.

678
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
You got to see them on.

679
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
Yeah, it is.

680
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,560
It does feel like, is it the most stylish exterior in downtown Disney?

681
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,120
Like it might be.

682
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Probably.

683
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
Yeah.

684
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
And recently redone because it was the house of blues RIP.

685
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,840
You can hear our thoughts in the underworld.

686
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,440
So it was a moved into this massive facility house of blues, which I will say I was never

687
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,640
a fan of the aesthetics of it.

688
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,600
I mean, location that's a bit of a mess.

689
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,920
Uh, but this place looks so cool.

690
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,880
Like they, they took it over and pretty quickly, uh, gave it this cool mod vibe.

691
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,720
It's a good retro, but that feels current too.

692
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,520
Uh, good stuff before you even walk in the door.

693
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Yes.

694
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,280
We walked in the door and we're fitted for bowling shoes and taken to a lane, uh, which

695
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,160
the sixties vibe continues.

696
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,560
I really love that big, uh, uh, is there, is there a big orange or am I thinking of

697
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,840
just a big bowling ball?

698
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,160
It's an orange that has bowling ball holes in it for your fingers.

699
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,480
That is sort of a hidden Mickey a little bit too.

700
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
Oh yeah.

701
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
Yeah.

702
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,360
Mickey, I think a bit of a Mickey, uh, oh, that's even in the description.

703
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,960
I just pulled it from the website dynamic hand painted murals stretching along entire

704
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,280
walls contain subtle hidden Mickey's.

705
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,840
Um, this place also, by the way, while I'm looking at their stats, 600 seats, two craft

706
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,840
cocktail bars, two open kitchens, 25 flat screen TVs and live music, 365 days a year.

707
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Wow.

708
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,680
Uh, your fan is your family, uh, parted ways with you for Christmas.

709
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,080
They said never again.

710
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,000
Don't even try coming here.

711
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,160
Not a splitsville and see a concert.

712
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,280
Once my mom heard me say the F word twice in this episode, she might say that to me.

713
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
You are not welcome.

714
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,080
I do have a brief bit of bad news that I think is easily fixed.

715
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,600
When I tried to pull up the menu on the Disneyland website, it appears that stitch has eaten

716
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
it.

717
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,320
Oh, go Disney dot coms faults.

718
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Maybe it is.

719
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,000
That's often what happens is you can't find things, but now what would that have sounded

720
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
like?

721
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Okay.

722
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Good to know.

723
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,580
Just for, just for study purposes.

724
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,480
If you listen or reach for his sucker in the cup, that's what you'll hear.

725
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,680
If you're a dog who reaches for his sticker, there's a very small crack in this cup too.

726
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,760
And the, uh, sticker stick, the sucker stick rests perfectly in it.

727
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,040
So if that's why you needed the time, perfect.

728
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,120
Should we sell a ringtone of Jason doing that?

729
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,760
Fighting me from my pocket.

730
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Yeah.

731
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,640
And then it'll be a picture of perfect stitch.

732
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,600
When I was doing it the other time, it doesn't sound like that at all.

733
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
No, yeah.

734
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
It doesn't sound like him at all.

735
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,240
But he kind of talks, does he?

736
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Yeah.

737
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Family.

738
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Someone hire me for voice acting, please.

739
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Family.

740
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Family.

741
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:04,320
Do I have to pay like 300 bucks to take a voice acting class where they're like, oh,

742
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,000
the characters you would best try out for is like dumb piece of shit.

743
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Right?

744
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That's what those classes are.

745
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That is what happens.

746
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
They'll be like, oh, you would be the nag.

747
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Like they'll say that to you.

748
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh, you would be fat idiot.

749
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,120
I don't know if they say that, but maybe some.

750
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,600
Fat sounding voice.

751
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Yeah.

752
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Oh.

753
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,040
And then Jason will go there and like, uh, Stitch, you would be good for Stitch.

754
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Hey.

755
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
Cool.

756
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,880
I would say, I remember when they, Stitch, as we covered Bay, a non-Downtown Disney related

757
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,000
topic in the Patreon a little bit ago, uh, the castle cake, and we also talked about

758
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,520
when Stitch, uh, teepee'd.

759
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Right.

760
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,840
Cinderella castle and it's, and the teepee said, do you remember?

761
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,040
Oh, it's Stitch's King.

762
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Oh, Stitch's King.

763
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,040
It gets worse and worse.

764
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Stitch's King.

765
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:59,720
Um, wait, you know what you sound like is the Rob Schneider and the water bowl.

766
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
You can do it.

767
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Stitch's King.

768
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
You can do it.

769
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Sorry.

770
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
I'll treat it you that way.

771
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:24,480
So, yes, we were given a lane, uh, and they, yeah, that retro vibes.

772
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,680
I think we were on, uh, we were in like six, seven, eight and there's little like this

773
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,680
little spark.

774
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,400
And what it looks like actually is like the opening sequence of the big Lebowski.

775
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Oh yeah.

776
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,200
The film predating John Turturro's.

777
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Jesus.

778
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Yes.

779
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Um, yeah.

780
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,680
Cool, cool little, uh, light and fixtures.

781
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Monorail's going by as we said, um, big narrow tables and, uh, we'd, we went hog wild appetizers,

782
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,560
main dinners, drinks and dessert.

783
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:02,800
And then the appetizer portion is where we found and I don't even want, I, I, it's not

784
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,920
even my place to announce it.

785
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,400
Jason, I will let you, I call the, you're talking about the fig and pig flatbread.

786
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,320
I am talking about the fig and pig flatbread, which I very quickly went, this might be the

787
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,400
best thing on property.

788
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,320
Like this might be the best tasting thing.

789
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,960
It was so good.

790
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Yes.

791
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
You're nodding your head.

792
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
Yeah.

793
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
It, it, boys, boys.

794
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,080
It was delicious.

795
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,080
It was a plus.

796
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
It was crazy.

797
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:35,920
The prosciutto fig spread, goat cheese, fresh mozzarella, uh, maraschino onions, dried figs

798
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,920
topped with dressed arugula.

799
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Delicious.

800
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
The bread was delicious.

801
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,200
The meat, the cheese, the fake, all of it was so good.

802
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,040
I think it's a recent addition too.

803
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,720
I think it hasn't been on the menu for that long.

804
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,000
So keep it going.

805
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,280
And I usually don't like that fancy pizza.

806
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,480
Oh yeah.

807
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,440
I'm more of a traditional, like classic guy.

808
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,320
And cheese, just like Kevin McAllister.

809
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,080
Just like Kevin, but this really hit the spot.

810
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
It was really good.

811
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,960
They also have a full pizza menu too.

812
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,480
Um, which I regret it not getting one of the, cause this flatbread, the crust was so good

813
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
on this.

814
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,440
I should mention, or we should mention, I came with.

815
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Yeah.

816
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
We not said that officially.

817
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
Yes.

818
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,160
We needed a fourth of the bowling.

819
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Yes.

820
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,760
And thank you for bringing me.

821
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,800
Thank you for taking me.

822
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
We were there alone.

823
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,840
Especially when everyone was staring.

824
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
Oh yeah.

825
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
Sorry.

826
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,920
Oh, you mean whenever, when you, when there was a ghost around and everybody was, is that

827
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,400
what you're referring to?

828
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Yeah.

829
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,120
But what that's, I had said, what a testament to the service at Splitsville.

830
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Right.

831
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
They handle it.

832
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
They discriminate.

833
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Yeah, nicely.

834
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Everyone, it was a big problem.

835
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,800
You were trying to pick up the ball and your hand was just going right through it.

836
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,920
And that was a whole kind of embarrassing thing.

837
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Yeah.

838
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,360
We'd stick your hand above the little fan and just get shot up into the ceiling.

839
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Yeah.

840
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
And we'd lose you for like half an hour.

841
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Yeah.

842
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
So then.

843
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
Or when I had sangria.

844
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,840
Oh, we didn't really want to talk about that.

845
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
We weren't talking again.

846
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,800
We were invited back at this point that we, we came in here, they were nice enough to

847
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
treat us.

848
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,720
And then we gave alcohol to a minor.

849
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,200
A ghost minor.

850
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,040
Um, sorry, Splitsville.

851
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,720
The real issue though, is that you drank it and it went right through you and it was on

852
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
the seat.

853
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
Right onto the seat.

854
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,480
I didn't really drink it.

855
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,880
So did you get any vibes from it anyway, even though it was mostly passing right through

856
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
you?

857
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Yeah.

858
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,160
It tastes like juice.

859
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,440
Which is kind of what you're at.

860
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
We're talking about it.

861
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,880
You love Capri Sun and stuff.

862
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,560
And I've already had the flavor sangria before.

863
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Okay.

864
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Geez.

865
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
You have so many.

866
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,840
I don't think one is repeated.

867
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,720
I think you've had three different jewels in every episode.

868
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Look at my belt.

869
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
Whoa.

870
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
It's like Rambo.

871
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,720
It's like a Rambo belt.

872
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Jewel cartridges.

873
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
You have a whole, you have like a.

874
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
One across my chest.

875
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,720
Yeah, across your chest.

876
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Oh yeah.

877
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
You opened your hoodie.

878
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Oh man.

879
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Wow.

880
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,720
Geez.

881
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
You're, you're stacked.

882
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
I mean, you look really cool.

883
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Whoa.

884
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
Lined up all the way up your legs.

885
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
Attached like a holster attached to your Scottie Pippen socks.

886
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
Yeah.

887
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Geez.

888
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
So you're, this is heavy.

889
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Yeah.

890
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,720
I mean, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

891
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:20,680
you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

892
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:29,040
you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

893
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,280
you're, you're, you're, you're, you're.

894
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,680
So it's your addiction from going to hell.

895
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,200
That's what you're still ago.

896
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,040
It's just we kept you out of the I was always in trouble

897
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,240
clarifying what kind of bling in and out of the temporal

898
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,920
worlds.

899
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,080
What you walk between.

900
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,360
We're yes very much.

901
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,440
You were very gung ho about the job when we left.

902
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:47,960
Yeah.

903
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,480
The city walks.

904
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,800
But then you kind of regress.

905
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,040
Yeah.

906
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,640
It's kind of like the genie at the end of Aladdin when he

907
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,280
frees him.

908
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
But then he sort of just the genie the rest of the time.

909
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,160
Returned to far.

910
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,400
He comes back like still got all his powers and stuff like he

911
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
should free the genie and he should have just become a dude.

912
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:03,920
Yeah.

913
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
That would have made sense.

914
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,280
So you kind of became a dude.

915
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,360
But now you're back to being ghost.

916
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,080
So really it's a lot like Aladdin.

917
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,800
Spoiler alert.

918
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,520
That is what happened in the live action one.

919
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,640
You have just forgotten.

920
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,360
I do know.

921
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,960
Oh, I was thinking about the cartoon.

922
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,200
I would bet a little money that in the sequel to Aladdin,

923
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,240
he'll be a genie again.

924
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,320
Oh, yeah.

925
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,440
Live action.

926
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:25,960
Oh, yeah.

927
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,640
We were talking about all these reboots.

928
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,320
We were talking about reboots.

929
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,200
They did Aladdin.

930
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,160
The Lion King is back.

931
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,120
Aladdin is back.

932
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,040
Beauty and the Beast, all your favorite movies as a kid,

933
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,920
are back.

934
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,000
But films with human actors.

935
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,560
Why?

936
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,480
Yeah, I mean, you were asking a question

937
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,040
about bringing things back.

938
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,720
Oh, you said money.

939
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,680
I think, yeah, probably money is a conservative move, really,

940
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,600
if you think about it.

941
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,680
I mean, it's good.

942
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,360
You'd like it because they just do all of the same things

943
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,040
that the previous movie did, except for one token

944
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,160
nod to feminism.

945
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,840
But otherwise, it's just exactly the same.

946
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,960
So it's the movie you remember watching.

947
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,400
Oh, I'll go see it.

948
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,000
You don't have to do any new work

949
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,040
and learn to see anything new in a new movie.

950
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,080
Keeps my brain from working hard.

951
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,840
Yeah.

952
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,120
Also, technically, if you were a child in the 90s,

953
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,240
you would be well of age by now.

954
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,560
So Splitsville, don't worry.

955
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,760
We didn't actually serve you didn't serve a minor.

956
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,240
Don't worry.

957
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,200
You're in the clear.

958
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,760
Oh, yeah.

959
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,800
And also, he's a ghost.

960
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,440
He didn't get it.

961
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,320
And he's a ghost.

962
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,840
Oh, yeah.

963
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,720
Yeah, yeah.

964
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,040
But it was fun.

965
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,840
Yeah, it was fun.

966
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,520
It was very fun to bowl with it.

967
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,200
Maybe the only complaint that you

968
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,640
might have about this place is that, and it's hardly

969
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,720
a complaint because you were eating, as we said,

970
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,440
very delicious food.

971
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,960
But then you were also bowling.

972
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,360
But this leaves you in a germ quandary.

973
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,840
Yes.

974
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,400
One of the germiest things you can do is bowl.

975
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,520
Yeah, I went to the bathroom, I think, five to seven times

976
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,480
during the meeting.

977
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,840
It was close to us, luckily.

978
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,800
Very close, yes.

979
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,680
I think there needs, I was trying to figure out

980
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,520
a solution to this problem.

981
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,160
Maybe all food that you have to eat with a fork.

982
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,840
Because then that's OK.

983
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,240
But if it's like, and I had to get rid of our flatbread.

984
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,680
But OK, maybe it's like smaller pieces of flatbread

985
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,760
that you could poke with a fork.

986
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,160
It was a little like toothpicks.

987
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,280
Yeah, because I had a chicken sandwich, which was good.

988
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,320
But I was like, OK, maybe one hand.

989
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
I think it was affecting my bowling, honestly,

990
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,880
is thinking about my hands.

991
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,960
I picked up one ball and it was greasy.

992
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,640
I was trying to keep a different hand.

993
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,680
So I don't know who greased up that ball.

994
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,640
How heavy were you going?

995
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,560
The green one, 13 pounds.

996
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
I don't think I did 13.

997
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,280
I think 12 is as heavy as I went.

998
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,720
Oh, I went nine.

999
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,880
Yeah, I go lighter.

1000
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,640
Yeah, I'm strong.

1001
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,120
Yeah, clearly.

1002
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,040
We should reveal scores, though.

1003
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,440
I mean, I don't have them all written down.

1004
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,240
But you did not you were you did not defeat us then

1005
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,280
with your strength.

1006
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,800
No, no, you gave me strength.

1007
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,440
We gave you strength by playing so well.

1008
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,160
Right.

1009
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,400
In the only round that we completed in full, the winner was Mike.

1010
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,520
Yes.

1011
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,760
The unattainable earth shattering score of 105.

1012
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,680
You beat us handily with 105.

1013
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,560
Very embarrassing for all of us.

1014
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,760
We are not the Jesus.

1015
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,720
No, I forget.

1016
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,520
I think I got my strike that round.

1017
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,160
I think I got one strike.

1018
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,840
And then we didn't finish another game.

1019
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,560
Yeah, we didn't quite get there.

1020
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,160
We ran out of time.

1021
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,400
So it does feel like it would be nice maybe to eat.

1022
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,640
It makes sense if you're going like appetizers and drinks.

1023
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,920
That's almost perfect.

1024
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,640
Yeah, that's good.

1025
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,800
Meal, I think, is what slowed you down.

1026
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,000
Maybe bowl around and then eat or vice versa.

1027
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,560
Yes, you go into the front part.

1028
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,520
I mean, that's the only thing is like if you're if you're

1029
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,240
having your precious bowling time and you're getting a big meal.

1030
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,640
And I want I feel like I want to enjoy the meal a little more

1031
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,520
even too, because then I felt like, well, we got to get

1032
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,720
another round and we did not get another round.

1033
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,320
We didn't we didn't quite get there.

1034
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,240
But I mean, part of that being that, yeah, when you were

1035
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,920
torn between food and the bowling game that needs to proceed,

1036
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,320
which I think was especially a problem for Jason.

1037
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Well, I fucked up.

1038
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,640
Spoiler alert, this is what I this is where I

1039
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,160
eat it too much and got a tummy ache.

1040
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,320
And it wasn't lack of quality.

1041
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,440
Everything very good, very high quality.

1042
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,120
Yeah. But when it's on the house, it's a little hard to stop.

1043
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,120
And I don't really often eat in this fashion of like appetizer

1044
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,440
and entree and dessert and a beer.

1045
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,320
Yeah. Like I do like two of those like I'll have an entree and a drink

1046
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,120
or an appetizer and this like this was a lot of even split.

1047
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,560
We share the appetizers.

1048
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,400
And just for completion sake, the other appetizer, we had the grilled avocado

1049
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,480
with ahi tuna, a very interesting like a full avocado topped with tuna

1050
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,560
and sticky rice on the bottom, wonton chips.

1051
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,680
I had a bacon cheeseburger.

1052
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,600
Mikey with the blackjack chicken sandwich.

1053
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,080
I did, yes.

1054
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,520
Um, Scott, you had a sushi roll.

1055
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,160
A sushi roll was great. Fantasy roll.

1056
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,640
So a place that has like all kinds of stuff and sushi,

1057
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,520
that sushi might not be so good, but it was it was so good.

1058
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,280
Sector keeper, what did you have?

1059
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,400
I had the...

1060
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,440
Did you have the Power Bowl?

1061
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,880
Power Bowl, chicken Power Bowl.

1062
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,120
You insisted on getting you were feeling a little logy from extra

1063
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,320
jeweling that day.

1064
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,520
Yeah, yeah. My head was killing me.

1065
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,240
But Power Bowl was good.

1066
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,440
Yeah, Power Bowl was really good. Yeah. Yeah.

1067
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Yeah. Did it give you strength?

1068
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,480
I guess you could say it gave me strength.

1069
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,720
Yeah. It gave you power?

1070
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,680
I guess you could say it gave me power.

1071
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,000
I think a good choice because you eat it with a fork.

1072
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,440
Yeah, you very good choice.

1073
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,880
You guys got that.

1074
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,840
And then we split the super sundae and the jeer deli brownie.

1075
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,040
Yes. Very good.

1076
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,520
I have a picture of you alone at the table,

1077
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,600
spoon in hand, looking like you want to die,

1078
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,200
going in for the dessert, which I think you felt compelled to at that point.

1079
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,240
It was really good.

1080
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,280
It was good. I just think you would stuff yourself.

1081
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,760
I love a brownie with ice cream and this bread, it was warm, it was soft.

1082
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,720
Sometimes it's very easy to get a stale brownie at like a restaurant

1083
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,480
when they dump a stale brownie or they just reheated an old one.

1084
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,120
But this one was really good.

1085
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,360
It was a real good to do this dessert order.

1086
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,120
There was a real war room vibe.

1087
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,920
And I think you were maybe off to bowl or starting to bowl or something

1088
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,760
when the server said, do you guys want to pick your desserts?

1089
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,240
And like Jason desserts. OK, let's and I like roll up the sleeves.

1090
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,360
Yeah, let's get the rest.

1091
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,120
You kept bringing up the cake, whatever cake was around.

1092
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,280
It says a generous portion of the chef's featured cake.

1093
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,120
You were like, I got a giant cake.

1094
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,480
I want to know what you got to find out with the chef's cake.

1095
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,960
We learned it was carrot cake.

1096
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,840
You're heart broke.

1097
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,240
I always did like that bowler who was like, I did that mad bowler.

1098
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,920
Oh, yeah. Who do you think you are?

1099
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,840
I am. Yeah.

1100
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,440
But but not in celebration.

1101
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,000
It was more like, well, the game has gotten the game is a the game

1102
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,360
is gotten complicated. What do we do now?

1103
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,960
I was hoping they were to say like a Boston cream.

1104
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,040
I'm fine with carrot cake.

1105
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,880
I'm sure it was a delicious carrot cake and probably a little less intense.

1106
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,720
Like what we got.

1107
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,840
A giant, really a giant sun.

1108
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,080
You want to do both of them.

1109
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,640
You're trying and you're trying to bowl.

1110
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,160
We're trying to do physical activity.

1111
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,880
Yeah. Yeah.

1112
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,120
Jump into these things.

1113
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,520
The bacon cheeseburger was good.

1114
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,600
I'd say that the top bacon cheeseburgers at the resort,

1115
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,520
the top cheeseburgers period at the resort now.

1116
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,240
Black craft, pretty solid.

1117
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,800
Statehouse black tap craft, black tap craft, burgers and beers.

1118
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,960
Excuse me. OK. Black tap solid.

1119
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,440
This also very solid clubhouse 55.

1120
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,560
Very good as well.

1121
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,840
So those are the tops.

1122
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,840
They're a little pricier, but you're paying for quality.

1123
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,760
Jason's Cheeberg.

1124
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,920
That's my cheeseburger.

1125
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,000
If you want a cheeseburger at the Disney Resort, I mean,

1126
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,360
it's not my number one place to get a cheeseburger by any means.

1127
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,160
What is your number one?

1128
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,840
Probably just go to In-N-Out Burger.

1129
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,680
I'm an In-N-Out Burger man. Huh?

1130
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,280
Hmm. That's an interesting question.

1131
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,120
I do like that steakhouse 55 one, though.

1132
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,520
Yeah, I yes, I made a joke when we were bowling

1133
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,080
that you were going to start just when your turn came up,

1134
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,440
because when we got the food that you just start rolling gutter balls

1135
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,000
to get back to the food really quickly.

1136
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,920
Yeah. But the opposite happened.

1137
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,200
You started bowling really well when the food came.

1138
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,960
Like you started like I got two strikes in a row,

1139
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,800
strikes in a row as soon as the food came.

1140
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,560
So your body, your brain was like the fastest way back to the food

1141
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,760
is rolling strikes because then I don't have to wait for the second frame.

1142
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,400
So you bowl better in that moment when the food first came.

1143
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,720
Then you did the whole game and could not replicate.

1144
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,280
I said with with bowling and pool.

1145
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,400
I'm like an idiot or a savant.

1146
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,640
And there's no in between.

1147
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,760
I mean, they're very good or just atrocious.

1148
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,440
I have a similar feeling about some of those games as well.

1149
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,760
But I I was like you did the opposite with the same result.

1150
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,880
The same results. Yeah.

1151
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,680
Like it was amazing, honestly.

1152
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,880
I did roll some gutter balls, though.

1153
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,960
Yeah, but that was later when you were low.

1154
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,800
Then you were low.

1155
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,440
When the food came, you were hitting the flow.

1156
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,880
Yeah, you would have been.

1157
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,600
Yeah, you could.

1158
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,120
I think any sport in the moment when food was about to come,

1159
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,200
you would have been perfect at it for those five to 10 minutes.

1160
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,720
I I fucked up, though.

1161
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,760
I should have gotten another.

1162
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,840
I should have gotten like a pizza and had a slice or two,

1163
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,720
and I would have been right level of full

1164
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,400
and then had a hearty lunch for the next day.

1165
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,560
I was off my game because I was distracted by an actual game.

1166
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,560
You could have done off my bullshit.

1167
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,400
But I think you were at the height of your any of any power.

1168
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,880
I think I think you're right about what you're saying.

1169
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,760
But I think that you would you were

1170
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,560
the reason you bolt so well is because you didn't do that,

1171
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,760
is what I'm trying to say.

1172
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,760
Maybe potentially.

1173
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,520
I think you could have beaten Sammy Duvall

1174
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,240
at a water skiing contest in that moment.

1175
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,320
Oh, yeah, maybe.

1176
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,760
To get back to a Sunday.

1177
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,160
Yes, if there was a Sunday sitting on the beach at the Polynesian.

1178
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,480
All right, folks, I don't got all day.

1179
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,880
Let's do this.

1180
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,160
Lapping Sammy in the water,

1181
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,760
punching a gator like not today, not today, friend.

1182
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,760
You're not getting me flips over lands on the beach Sunday.

1183
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,200
Oh, and our drinks item mango, a Golden Road mango cart.

1184
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,760
Delicious. Oh, yeah.

1185
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,560
Whatever was the rotating draft and I don't know what it was.

1186
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,320
But I think I've gotten the rotating draft more than once there.

1187
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,640
And it's been good every time.

1188
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,760
Oh, I had a bit of some sort of berry drink.

1189
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,200
I can't remember the name of it.

1190
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,960
You would have it was lavender.

1191
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,240
Was it lavender?

1192
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,560
You had the berry lavender.

1193
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,080
Berry mint. Berry.

1194
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,160
No, not mint.

1195
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,600
That's your thing, not mine.

1196
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,880
You got a berry mint on there.

1197
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,840
I think I had a berry lavender thing of some kind.

1198
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,960
It was just juice. It was just good juice.

1199
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,120
Yeah, my sangria was really good.

1200
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,560
Yeah, it was just juice, which is now a bad connotation

1201
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,640
was we know from the Jamba episode.

1202
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,080
Also, juice is what they call vape, vape juice.

1203
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,600
So you got like a bandolier, is it bandolieros?

1204
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,520
Mm hmm. Oh, juice. Yeah.

1205
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,560
The woman next to us asked me if I was having sangria.

1206
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,880
Oh, yeah, she wanted to know and she wanted to know if it was good.

1207
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,280
And then you were like, yeah, it is good.

1208
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,280
And then I think you were like quietly like, I don't know if it's good or not.

1209
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,520
She wanted she seemed like she had her mind made up.

1210
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,120
I couldn't tell if she trusted me.

1211
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,160
Yeah, she I wonder if she noticed that you were a ghost.

1212
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,040
She was very polite, though, so she didn't.

1213
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,080
Yes, I got to ask to everyone at S.

1214
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,200
Was there the nobody said a ghost?

1215
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,640
Yeah, I'm in the arms of whoever they were with.

1216
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,080
The the guy bowling next to us was jacked.

1217
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,600
Yeah. And when I got a strike, he was very he made me feel real good.

1218
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,440
He was like, yeah.

1219
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,400
And then he gave me that big high five.

1220
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,920
And I was like, what a story, we're all in this together.

1221
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,800
Just saying, you made me feel like they're having a good time at Splitsville.

1222
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,720
Yeah, it is. It was good. Yeah.

1223
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,640
Fives are good.

1224
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,320
I think there's yeah, there seem to be some some bigger parties going on.

1225
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,440
Mars was just a party of four. Right.

1226
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,320
But it was a rager. It was they.

1227
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,200
Yeah, it's a huge menu.

1228
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,160
It seems like everything is done well.

1229
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,000
So you have like picky eaters or like people can't agree on stuff. Yeah.

1230
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,800
Yeah, don't be biased that it is a bowling alley because it's fun.

1231
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,320
Mm hmm. Yeah.

1232
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,480
And you only have to half commit to the bowling and not super good.

1233
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,560
So it's for lay or just eat there.

1234
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,240
Yeah. Yeah.

1235
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,840
Yeah. As I've done several times, it's a great patio.

1236
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,720
I don't know this this thing that this was all taken up by a club

1237
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,520
that I probably never want to go to.

1238
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,800
And now it is just a relaxing open air bar.

1239
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,800
Good stuff. This is one of those improvements of downtown Disney.

1240
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,800
I think the downtown Disney ordeal three years ago

1241
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,840
would have been a much more sordid affair.

1242
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,120
But we have a lot more like nice things to say about pretty decent restaurants

1243
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,880
thanks to what they've done lately. That's true. Yeah, I agree.

1244
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,440
Does that make it more fun? I don't know.

1245
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,600
I don't know. It's better if it's worse.

1246
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,440
It's no city walk.

1247
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,960
It's no city city walk.

1248
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,760
Bigger ups and downs.

1249
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,320
Actually, no, just bigger downs. Yeah.

1250
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,480
I don't think I think we can say nothing at either of these two things

1251
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,080
has been as fun as Splitsville.

1252
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,040
Hasn't it been the highlight of our daily series?

1253
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,040
That's a good question.

1254
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,520
Specifically city walk or.

1255
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,920
I mean, indoor skydiving was interesting.

1256
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,000
That was a trip. But it's not as fun.

1257
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,680
No, it for sure wasn't.

1258
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,800
No, I would go back to Splitsville tonight.

1259
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,720
Yeah, I would do indoor skydiving again, but I wouldn't expect.

1260
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,200
I'll say this.

1261
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,960
I would I guess I did.

1262
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,520
I would spend my own money happily at Splitsville.

1263
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,680
At indoor skydiving, I spent it begrudgingly.

1264
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,720
Uh huh. I hear that.

1265
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,120
No, that's you're probably right.

1266
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,400
I'm just trying to think.

1267
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,680
I'm trying to think of even the promise.

1268
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:25,200
Maybe wizards at City Walk is the only other thing I would rather maybe do.

1269
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,720
We didn't get to do only that was in nostalgia for place we never were.

1270
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,000
Yeah, right. Rock Park.

1271
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,400
No, I know. Yeah.

1272
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,640
But so it's even Menchie's.

1273
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,600
Menchie's you can sort of do whenever.

1274
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,760
That's one by like.

1275
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,600
Was it Menchie?

1276
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,120
My haircut.

1277
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,640
Who was your enemy? Sparky?

1278
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,200
Sparky. Not Menchie.

1279
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,000
Menchie was a good.

1280
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,400
He took my place in heaven.

1281
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,320
That's right. I'm so sorry.

1282
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,720
It's OK. OK.

1283
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,200
Do you have any feelings off hand about Tortilla Joe?

1284
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,680
Do you?

1285
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,640
I do. I'm just curious.

1286
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,240
You know, that is a character.

1287
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,800
I don't know if he's real or.

1288
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,240
Tortilla Joe.

1289
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,160
Yes, Tortilla.

1290
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,840
Tortilla Joe is a friend of my cousins.

1291
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,880
Oh, OK.

1292
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,640
Hmm. So would it be a problem

1293
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,400
if I said that I didn't particularly care for Tortilla Joe?

1294
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,800
Oh, nothing against him.

1295
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,440
I don't even know what he looks like.

1296
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,440
Well, it doesn't help that it is part of the patina restaurant group

1297
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,040
who have given us so much.

1298
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,040
So many headaches.

1299
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,440
Oh, it's another patina.

1300
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,880
There you go. Patina.

1301
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,720
I did not have my beloved little pepperoni cups that Naples does.

1302
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,760
Naples? Naples.

1303
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,960
The pizza restaurant.

1304
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,280
They have a little pepperoni. They're from a while.

1305
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1306
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,800
Um, no, I look.

1307
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,480
I'm probably giving the short end of the stick to Tortilla Joe.

1308
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,880
Am I the only one who's been in full disclosure?

1309
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,080
Yes, I have not eaten a meal there.

1310
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,720
I know people who really like it, though.

1311
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Yeah. I think I've talked to other people.

1312
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,720
Tortilla Joe stands.

1313
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,600
Um, I went, I think pre ordeal,

1314
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,360
I think Aaron and I went and it was fine going down.

1315
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,560
But we were like a tad pricey, maybe.

1316
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,560
And then we felt terrible all day.

1317
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,000
Oh, really? It was a stomach issue.

1318
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Yep. Yep.

1319
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Oh.

1320
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,400
Which doesn't befall me as much as both of you.

1321
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,760
I was just saying, I feel like there's like 20 episodes

1322
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,600
where you guys have had stomach issues.

1323
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,600
Well, again.

1324
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,280
Jason's number one stomach issue for sure on the podcast.

1325
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,760
Splitsville's the only way I overindulged.

1326
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,760
I had no stomach.

1327
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,760
I was recovering from a stomach thing last week,

1328
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,760
but I wasn't on death's door like Jason was after that meal.

1329
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,280
Well, it's kind of like bowling or pool.

1330
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,480
I either have an iron stomach or it's a fucking mess.

1331
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,480
So.

1332
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,360
If you have three beers,

1333
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,240
it just ruins the next three days of your life.

1334
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,240
Yeah, I don't drink a lot. Yeah.

1335
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,480
I checked down to three not long ago.

1336
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,480
That's my cap now.

1337
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,480
A beer?

1338
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,480
Back when we started this thing, I could have downed four.

1339
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,480
Beer.

1340
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,480
That was 2017.

1341
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,480
Beer is too heavy.

1342
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,480
I get filled.

1343
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,480
I can drink hard liquor.

1344
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,480
What do you have to look forward to growing up, sector keeper?

1345
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,480
Yeah.

1346
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,080
I can't wait to drink and feel bad for days.

1347
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:24,200
So Splitsville and Tortilla Joe's both fall in that very narrow category

1348
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,440
of they'll validate your parking for five hours.

1349
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,440
Right.

1350
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,920
That's not many do now.

1351
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,200
Well, not so again, the divide is you can,

1352
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:42,680
if you spend $20 at any establishment in downtown Disney,

1353
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,360
you get that.

1354
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,360
Sorry, this is Disneyland.co.com.

1355
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,480
That's not right.

1356
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,480
Yeah, it is.

1357
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,480
Disney.

1358
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,480
They have a dot co.

1359
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,480
Dot go.

1360
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,480
They said go.

1361
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,480
Oh, no, no, Disney.

1362
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:01,840
We should talk about that at some point when Disney bought go dot com and still has the

1363
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,080
back boat of all their internet audit.

1364
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,080
That's right.

1365
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,920
Yeah, that's why it's all go and they're still hanging on.

1366
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,160
So I think I said this on an earlier episode, you get three hours of parking.

1367
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:19,680
If you spend a $20 minimum purchase at any quick service restaurant or merchandise locations

1368
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:26,020
or kiosk, they will validate to get five hours each table service.

1369
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:31,160
But Black Tap and Ballast Point are not considered table service.

1370
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,040
Splitsville and Tortilla Joe's are considered table service.

1371
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:40,180
You can go to Naples and if you order at the bar and I did this once, they validated with

1372
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,260
just drinks.

1373
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:47,100
So if you get the right bartender, you can get maybe not having to spend on a full meal.

1374
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,100
That's a good tip.

1375
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,960
If you buy two pizzas, you can get those three hours.

1376
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,440
Of course, we learned that a long time.

1377
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,160
I figured the two pizzas story.

1378
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,160
Two pizzas.

1379
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,160
That happened.

1380
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,160
Two pizzas.

1381
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,720
Well, they're little.

1382
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,040
He saved one for later.

1383
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,040
Yes.

1384
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,200
Yeah, I saved one for later.

1385
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,440
In order to get free parking, he got two pizzas, one to go.

1386
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:14,520
I tell you what, every episode, you and I, man, you live in the dream.

1387
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,520
Oh, what do you have?

1388
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,920
Oh, he's blowing rings.

1389
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,160
It's Boston cream.

1390
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,960
It was the cake I was hoping Splitsville had.

1391
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,960
With mint?

1392
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,800
Yeah, it's got to have mint.

1393
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,280
It's got to have mint to pass the law now.

1394
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,560
I'm losing the sector keeper.

1395
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,720
Uncle Jason's becoming his favorite.

1396
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,320
I got to do something good for you.

1397
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,340
No, we might be blood brother.

1398
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,520
We might be brother.

1399
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,520
Two brothers.

1400
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,520
Two different brothers.

1401
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,520
Brothers.

1402
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:45,800
Even though you're already the brother of Bugsy, we determined, who no longer exists

1403
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,800
because he's...

1404
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,800
Are you also Hugsy's brother?

1405
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,600
Hey man, there's family you're born with and family you find, you know?

1406
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,600
Well, Hannah means family as Stitch learned.

1407
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,240
What did Stitch say when he learned that?

1408
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,240
Family.

1409
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,240
Closer.

1410
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,240
I guess it's closer.

1411
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,240
That was a little better.

1412
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,000
You got to break in.

1413
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,040
I need to tell Jason about a pizza deal in the neighborhood, California Pizza Kitchen,

1414
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,160
go in there, eat an entree.

1415
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,880
They'll let you take any pizza home for $5 and it's cookable, like cookable pizza.

1416
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,640
Sector keeper, this is out of bounds, clearly.

1417
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,640
Objection.

1418
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,840
Wait, when you say co...

1419
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,840
You mean like par baked?

1420
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,840
Like partially baked?

1421
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,840
Boys, boys, boys.

1422
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,840
Okay, sorry.

1423
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,840
All right, sorry, sorry.

1424
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,840
It's like you have card business all over again.

1425
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,840
The metal detectors are one boundary.

1426
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,840
I'm so sorry.

1427
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,120
The Honda Odyssey with the Star Wars Galaxy Edge logo is the other.

1428
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,640
There's no CPK at downtown Disney.

1429
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,640
I know, I'm sorry.

1430
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,320
The CPK is over at the Garden Walk.

1431
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,840
I got to say, I prefer that Odyssey to the Sienna.

1432
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,840
I'll tell you what.

1433
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,840
That picture is smut.

1434
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,840
Smut.

1435
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,640
I can't believe they still sell a Sienna.

1436
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,640
I looked it up.

1437
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,360
I thought be gone, banished by the picture.

1438
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,960
Siennas were canceled.

1439
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,440
Yes, Siennas were canceled.

1440
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,480
And before canceling was a thing in 2002.

1441
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,200
Apparently before taste was a thing.

1442
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,760
Cheapers, creepers.

1443
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,760
If anyone has some...

1444
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,240
We'll look at them later.

1445
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,760
If anyone has fond Tordia Jo's thoughts, I don't mean to...

1446
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:14,520
I feel bad that I'm the sole voice here and that I had a bad experience, but I did and

1447
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,040
I have to speak my truth.

1448
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,040
Yeah, that's okay.

1449
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,040
I mean, that's understandable.

1450
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,040
Yeah.

1451
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,040
So shitty.

1452
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,040
We have never regretted it.

1453
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,800
I don't think at Disney Meal as much as our whatever we...

1454
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,160
And we had separate things too.

1455
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:30,880
So there's something in the stock with something in the beans and the rice.

1456
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,320
There's so much wonderful Mexican food for so cheap in Southern California.

1457
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,480
And that's kind of my thing.

1458
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,800
And I find a lot of sit down places I go to.

1459
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,120
A lot of it's bad.

1460
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:46,680
A lot of it's bad and places where it's platters, they fill the plate with rice and beans.

1461
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,880
Some places, that's great.

1462
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:52,160
If they're really making their own rice and beans, like homemade, it can be wonderful,

1463
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,160
but not everywhere.

1464
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:59,440
When we do Downtown Disney ordeal revisited, which is yet another one of our news.

1465
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,360
Like an after show.

1466
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,360
Yeah.

1467
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,360
No, no, not an after show.

1468
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,360
When we do this whole thing again.

1469
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,720
Oh, like an after show six months later.

1470
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,720
Yeah.

1471
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,560
An after show is the exact same topics and maybe more like there's more of the show.

1472
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,760
Oh, so like a live action remake.

1473
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,400
It's like a Disney live action remake and we'll add in just a couple extra characters

1474
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,800
and maybe one new song that was half written when we did the original.

1475
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,640
Kind of about Hillary or something.

1476
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,720
And it's kind of about, yeah, a topic, something topical.

1477
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,360
The main thing, all these movies, all the villains are now like Trump.

1478
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,840
That's the only thing that's changed.

1479
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,160
I'd like to say this, this has never happened in the history of recording podcasts.

1480
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,160
Right.

1481
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,840
We've been recording so long today.

1482
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,600
My ears are ringing from wearing the headphones.

1483
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,360
Oh my God.

1484
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,360
You're getting ear cancer.

1485
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,840
It's not a crazy ring, but like that, like, you know, you fear that one.

1486
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,440
Like maybe even in a loud space too long.

1487
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,440
I know that ring.

1488
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,440
That's the ring of purgatory.

1489
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,440
Oh no.

1490
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,440
Jesus.

1491
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,440
Are you transition?

1492
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,440
Are you dying right now?

1493
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,440
I'm seeing like a, is that Joe Biden?

1494
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,200
Oh God, maybe I am.

1495
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
No, no, don't talk to him.

1496
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,200
All right.

1497
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,200
I don't want to put his arm around you.

1498
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,200
He's clasping my, oh, he's smelling my hair.

1499
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,200
Oh no.

1500
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Come towards the fog.

1501
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,200
Come towards the vape fog.

1502
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,200
I'm back, I'm back.

1503
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,200
Well, can we end this?

1504
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,200
Aren't we there?

1505
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
We could.

1506
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,200
I think so.

1507
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,200
Anything else about Tortilla Joe's?

1508
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,200
I don't know.

1509
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:31,200
Made me sick and Mike's dying and I know what Darren's making me for dinner at home.

1510
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,200
And as soon as I leave, I get to have it.

1511
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,480
Is it reheated Tortilla Joe's?

1512
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,560
Why it's enchiladas and I swear enchiladas with the green sauce are better than, better

1513
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,560
than what we had at Tortilla Joe's.

1514
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,560
I didn't say that much.

1515
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,560
Enchilada Erin is her nickname.

1516
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,560
Enchilada Erin.

1517
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,560
Man, you gotta make those in bulk.

1518
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,560
What do you guys got, Ruth?

1519
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,560
We're feeding you now.

1520
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,560
I brought you iced tea already.

1521
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,560
You did bring me iced tea.

1522
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,560
Thank you.

1523
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,560
Jason makes all of his friends his surrogate family.

1524
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,560
Because I'm a surrogate.

1525
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,560
I'm a surrogate.

1526
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,560
I'm a surrogate.

1527
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,560
I'm a surrogate.

1528
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,560
I'm a surrogate.

1529
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,560
I'm a surrogate.

1530
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,560
I'm a surrogate.

1531
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,560
I'm a surrogate.

1532
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,560
I'm a surrogate family because why?

1533
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,560
I say it, say it.

1534
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:17,480
I don't know if this isn't heading towards the end of the episode.

1535
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,960
I don't know what is.

1536
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:25,160
I would like to say that we survived this level on stage, but barely we get anything.

1537
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,560
Boys, boys, you give me strength.

1538
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,800
You also give the level keeper strength, he's my cousin.

1539
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,800
He texted you.

1540
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:38,440
Yes, he or she texted me from their cricket wireless prepaid phone.

1541
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:43,200
They said that they're doing well and that they want to add something to your inventory

1542
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,160
to help you along in your journey.

1543
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,160
Great.

1544
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,160
We're gonna need it.

1545
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,840
From Splitsville, it's a pitcher of sangria.

1546
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,840
Oh, wow.

1547
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,840
Oh, refreshing.

1548
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,840
Yes.

1549
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,840
That's great.

1550
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,840
There's a little orange there and a strawberry.

1551
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,840
Ah, and we can.

1552
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:03,440
But while you drink it, or you can only drink it while you bowl a full game.

1553
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,440
Oh, man.

1554
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,440
Wait, what?

1555
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,200
So it can only be used in tandem?

1556
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,200
Yes.

1557
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,200
Can we throw it at someone's head?

1558
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,480
Like, say Robert Earl's head?

1559
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,480
I don't know.

1560
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,480
I shouldn't assume anyone's the boss.

1561
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,480
Yeah, okay.

1562
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,840
Well, I don't know.

1563
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,760
We'll figure out a way to make that work.

1564
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,520
We'll have to MacGyver that into something.

1565
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,800
But there's potentially useful items within that.

1566
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,800
Sure.

1567
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:34,240
Like, we could take an orange slice and make somebody slip with it or break the pitcher.

1568
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,800
And when all's said and done, if we just get rid of the sangria, keep the pitcher, future

1569
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,400
place for Jason's suckers to sit.

1570
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,320
Oh my gosh, Jason, how many suckers could you store in that pitcher?

1571
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,320
Oh, gosh.

1572
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,080
Probably a whole bag, a whole dumb dumb bag.

1573
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,640
I like you when you're talking to wave a sucker around like...

1574
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,640
Let go, Jack.

1575
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,640
Like Sloppy Telly?

1576
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,640
Yeah, like Sloppy Telly himself.

1577
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,600
Ohana means family, baby.

1578
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,000
Ohana means family, baby.

1579
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
That was a little cleaner.

1580
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
You're better at Code Jack.

1581
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,840
Tell your voiceover, Coach.

1582
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:14,520
Okay, so we have some sangria now, which we can take into tomorrow's sector, level four

1583
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,520
to two.

1584
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,520
That sector.

1585
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,240
That's what I have when you've been recording all day.

1586

1591
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,560
This has become an exit interview for me every episode.

1592
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,720
What's the children's song that keeps growing every time?

1593
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,000
The song that doesn't end?

1594
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Yeah, maybe.

1595
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
No, that doesn't grow.

1596
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
That's the same.

1597
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,280
Every house gets longer and then it's like, and that's the way it goes.

1598
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,400
Well, the 12 days of Christmas does that.

1599
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,120
Yeah, it's sort of like that.

1600
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,120
Yeah, yeah.

1601
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:07,520
Or it's like the Andy Kaufman sang a song about like the cow goes moo and the pig goes

1602
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,520
oinkin'.

1603
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,520
Right.

1604
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:17,240
