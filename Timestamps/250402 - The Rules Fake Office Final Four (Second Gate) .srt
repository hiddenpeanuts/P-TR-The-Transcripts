1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,440
Welcome to Podcast The Ride The Second Gate, a fun, frivolous time full of jokes and frivolity.

2
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
No!

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,800
This is about rules, hard, fast rules.

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,840
This will be entirely organizational, joyless, functional, formal, what needs to happen.

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
This is basically a Senate meeting.

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
This is notes.

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,440
The committee meeting, yeah.

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
Yes.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,360
No, this is figuring out parliamentary procedure.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,560
I'm Scott Gardner, prepared to be all business and not funny business.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,400
I don't want to hear any from you, Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,600
Nope, no jokes from me.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,760
All serious chat and serious discussion.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
Only serious chat.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
Only.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,440
And don't call it shitter chatter, because that's too fun.

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Too fun.

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
Serious chat.

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,280
Serious chat with Jason Sheridan as well.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,400
I like a correct, proper offices run.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,600
This is serious business.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,120
Chitter chatter for the break room, and break rooms are different than offices.

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
No, this isn't.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,480
We are not discussing the best break rooms, the best fake break rooms in theme park history.

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,880
We're discussing fake offices, and we're kind of trying something here.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,960
This is basically us trying to expand our big sports programming of the fake office

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,000
Final Four with some pre-show material, some pre-game material.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,600
We here are doing something that we would usually reserve for off the air.

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,840
This might happen via text messages or just while we're cleaning up equipment, but we

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,440
thought you, the listener, deserve transparency.

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,720
You deserve to learn how we landed at how we're going to make the fake office Final

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,840
Four work, what is within the confines, what is out of the confines, how we determine what

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
actually constitutes a fake office.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Right.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
It's very exciting.

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,760
This just felt like when we started discussing it, it was just too exciting to not record.

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,120
You know what I mean?

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,320
It felt like, well, this is kind of part of it, isn't it?

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,120
What even an office could be defined as, I suppose.

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,240
What things are, what things aren't.

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,520
We don't even know necessarily where we fall on these topics.

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Not necessarily.

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,800
We're going to find out today in real time on mic what we believe is an office.

45
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,760
In a way, the most real and vulnerable episode of Podcast The Ride, you're going to see into

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
our process.

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,040
You're going to see something that Jason is often desiring to do, which is how the sausage

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
is made.

49
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Right.

50
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Exactly.

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,480
I feel like that usually manifests at just, you just want to say what day of the week

52
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,360
we're recording the show, but we're close.

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,840
I think it's kind of that.

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
It's close.

55
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,080
A little peek behind the scenes and then also, you know me, I'm always thinking about sausage.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,080
The magic of the warehouse.

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Your true wish is to see how actual sausage is made.

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,840
Behind the scenes stuff is number two, sausage number one in terms of things I like.

59
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,960
Well, I guess that's not to get off track here, but have you ever seen how literal sausage

60
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
is made?

61
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,640
I mean, oh, in like one of those Food Network or how did this get made or unwrapped kind

62
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
of shows.

63
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Sure.

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Yeah.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,160
I mean, it's basically just the filling and the casing.

66
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,920
But you've never been to like a factory.

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't think I've ever been to a meat processing factory.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,680
I've seen how chips and pretzels are made.

69
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,200
I've certainly seen how Hershey chocolate is made.

70
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
In person.

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Yeah.

72
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
You've seen pretzels being made in person.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,920
I went to a pretzel factory.

74
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,040
I literally went to, not as Simpson's reference, I went to a pretzel factory once.

75
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,520
What are you talking about, the cracker, the reference to the cracker factory?

76
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
Yeah, that wasn't a pretzel factory.

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
That was a cracker factory.

78
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Yeah.

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,720
You're thinking of the pretzels on that baseball episode.

80
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,120
The pretzels and the cracker factory.

81
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm sure there were crackers also made in this, but I don't know that we've done a long

82
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,920
discussion about the snack belt of southeastern Pennsylvania.

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,800
It's almost surprising that we haven't, and that seems like a very viable birthday shot

84
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
for you.

85
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I believe it's called the snack belt.

86
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Oh my god, birthday, happy birthday.

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Yeah.

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,960
But yeah, there's a lot of snack bakeries and factories and stuff around there.

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Okay.

90
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
We've got to make it to the snack belt.

91
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,280
I'm excited about the snack belt.

92
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,240
I'm trying to find a viable sausage factory tour for you to go to.

93
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,800
I found one in, this looks like Milwaukee, Oosingers, you ever had any Oosingers?

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,360
I don't think I've had Oosingers.

95
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Haven't had the pleasure.

96
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,080
Well, unfortunately it says, unfortunately you won't be able to tour the factory due

97
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
to food sanitation requirements.

98
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,120
This might get in the way.

99
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,840
My fear is that this is one of the things we lost to COVID, the ability to tour a thriving

100
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,280
sausage factory.

101
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Perhaps.

102
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:26,840
I know in the Glendale-Burbank border here in Los Angeles, there is a German deli, which

103
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,160
did you go, is that where you inquired about sausages when we made?

104
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,760
There was a different German, more in the La Cagnata area where I got my base sausage

105
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,640
for the Ronto Wrap challenge.

106
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,040
Where'd you get yours, Mike?

107
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,360
Probably like Albertsons or something.

108
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,200
I think I went, oh, I don't even remember.

109
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,920
I do think I got some elevated, some was slightly elevated.

110
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,920
It wasn't as bad as maybe Ralph's, but maybe.

111
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,480
No, I went to Ralph's.

112
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,200
I was trying to make it at like a Kroger.

113
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,000
I was trying to see if I could assemble it with the ingredients you would just buy at

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,360
a basic grocery store.

115
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
And the answer was no.

116
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,680
It was a thought exercise, not that you just wanted to go to the regular grocery store.

117
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
And spend less money.

118
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,320
Well, I did know where everything was, but we all took different approaches.

119
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
We sure did.

120
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
We did.

121
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,040
If people could make it at home.

122
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,760
Anyway, there's a German deli and like sausage store that I believe supplies some.

123
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Oh, wait.

124
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,960
Like German beer halls and stuff.

125
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,720
I got one, the Vienna, you could, we could all go to the Vienna beef factory tour in

126
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Chicago.

127
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,200
Oh, that's your stomping ground.

128
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
All right.

129
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,680
Well, we'll go do, we'll go to Chicago and that'll be our first stop.

130
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,920
That'll be our live show topic in a Vienna beef factory.

131
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,480
We'll do it at the factory.

132
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Yeah.

133
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,200
Shouting over industrial machines.

134
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:58,480
So anyway, okay, well, we will, we will all together see how the sausage is made, literal

135
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
sausage.

136
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,240
But in this case, you're seeing, you're hearing it metaphorically.

137
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,960
So let's, there's some stuff to figure out here.

138
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:12,000
And I think, you know, I'm not trying to take a leadership position in this discussion,

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,040
but I thought that there's maybe a few things worth laying down.

140
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,880
One is I think that we don't need to end this episode having the full final list.

141
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,440
I think we could have most and maybe should have most.

142
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,680
And I think we'll, we'll just naturally end up with what we think are the best fake offices

143
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,760
out there.

144
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,240
But you know, if, you know, you, you want a little bit of extra time to, you know, massage

145
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,440
the details and we need to sleep on it because this is going to be keeping us up at night.

146
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,920
And you want a little suspense maybe in what becomes the final 16, the final more.

147
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,560
That's something to discuss within this episode, I think.

148
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,640
One big thing that I, I believe and that I've believed that I think makes for a successful

149
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,280
one of these final four episodes is a little bit of suspense.

150
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,760
And I think that as we do this, well, not sacrificing entertainment value, we need this,

151
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,400
you know, this shouldn't be too dry, but also as we think of some of these offices and discuss

152
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,720
some of these offices, I think it's also on us to keep it in our pants a little bit.

153
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,800
I don't think if we get too excited about one of these fake offices, it's going to be

154
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,440
too clear that that's the one that's going to go all the way.

155
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,840
I think one that was a little bit flawed, although the episode might've been fine.

156
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,100
But when we started the fake smell final four, there was no question that that was going

157
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,920
to be the ET four smell.

158
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I feel.

159
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Sure.

160
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Yeah.

161
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,480
And I think that in landing on any of the, and now I don't know, I don't think we have

162
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,200
one of, I don't think there is a clear winner here at the outset, so I think it's okay in

163
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
that regard.

164
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,000
But I got my eyes on both of you little Spidey boys.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm a little worried.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I've got a couple of favorites.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
We're going to tip the scales a little bit too much.

168
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,240
Well, how about we get rid of it?

169
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
That's in.

170
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Spider-Man is in.

171
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Oh, no, no, no.

172
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
I know it's in.

173
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
I'm just saying.

174
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
We don't even have to talk about it.

175
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Sure.

176
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,760
The fake Daily Bugle building and the amazing adventures of Spider-Man Q is it.

177
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Oh, yes.

178
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Of course.

179
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
No, we know that.

180
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Yes.

181
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,400
The other big one, I'll say, is in the Men in Black headquarters, the Men in Black alien

182
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
attack.

183
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Yes.

184
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,040
I think some of these, I mean, some of these we spelled out kind of as soon as we were

185
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,400
discussing the mission of the episode.

186
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,840
This came up because of Tiana's office in the line for the new Tiana's Bayou adventure,

187
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,560
which I think that, you know, it needs to be in.

188
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
It's very fair.

189
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,800
It inspired the whole tournament.

190
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Right.

191
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,080
But, and I think, and we can keep doing this, we can keep naming specific ones, but I also

192
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,960
think that there's some bigger philosophical debates that need to happen here a little

193
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
bit.

194
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,640
When we say office, what does that mean exactly?

195
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,440
And here's what I, and then probably there's some granular definition of office, but here's

196
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,320
something that I don't want to happen.

197
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,520
I don't want that an office that's a perfectly good and viable office, but that's like one,

198
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,120
it's one little one, ends up paying the price because there's another one that's a big multi-room

199
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,760
giant office, you know?

200
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Doesn't that seem unfair?

201
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Do you have an example specifically?

202
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,720
Well, like, think about, like, one that probably should be in is Indiana Jones' office.

203
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
I would agree.

204
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,840
Yeah, I agree with that.

205
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,280
But I, now, you know, we'll think about that.

206
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,880
Wait, you mean the makeshift one after the Sala movie in the queue?

207
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
Yes, that is what I mean.

208
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Okay, yes.

209
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,200
Okay, Jane and I were talking about this last night because there's a number of kind of

210
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,680
makeshift offices.

211
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,000
Jungle Cruise kind of has some stuff.

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yep.

213
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
That's in.

214
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
That's in.

215
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Expedition Everest.

216
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Yes.

217
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Oh, yeah.

218
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
I think this is a big area.

219
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
It definitely is the makeshift.

220
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Yes.

221
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,560
The, like, done on the site, the site of the archaeological dig or the expedition or whatever.

222
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
Yes.

223
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
The little pop-up office.

224
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,720
These are some of the strongest contenders, I think.

225
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,640
I think those are very fair and outside of the box in terms of, like, the full Daily

226
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,720
Bugle office, you know?

227
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:11,600
But I think breaking it down what we hit upon is, like, if there is a desk and there's paper,

228
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,080
you could conceivably call that an office.

229
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
I think so.

230
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
I think these are important aspects.

231
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Yeah.

232
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,720
And, yeah, the other things, yeah, they don't need to be shelves.

233
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,200
That's in the eye of the beholder, you know, whatever, like, specific other things.

234
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,440
But the desk does seem pretty crucial, I think.

235
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,960
I think the exciting thing, especially in the actual March Madness tournament, is, like,

236
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:42,720
when a 40 seed knocks out a two seed, like, the 40-rank team, I think University of Connecticut

237
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,400
looked like they were going to knock out number two as of today when we're recording this.

238
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:56,240
And so I think unconventional offices, wild cards are always so fun, wild card teams in

239
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
playoffs.

240
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
Certainly, yes.

241
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,200
Now, we have never done things by the, this has been, every one of these has been so ignorant

242
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,960
to the way these things actually go.

243
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,200
Calling it Final Four is not necessarily correct.

244
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Right.

245
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,280
I'd say it's not at all, but it's just, F sounds good.

246
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,520
The alliteration, I think, is the reason to do this.

247
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
Here's a rule.

248
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,960
What if, here's one I think we should just set now.

249
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,040
Any commenter who points out that we don't know anything about college basketball is

250
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,560
banned from the show forever.

251
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Is that correct?

252
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Okay.

253
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,920
What if they're new and they didn't know everyone's already said that?

254
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Doesn't count.

255
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Oh, okay.

256
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
There's gotta be, we gotta be firm about this.

257
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Okay, I guess, yeah.

258
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,920
You're out the door.

259
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,000
No, but I, you know, yeah, the notion of the seeds, we definitely haven't done that.

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,360
But to me, that's also, as soon as you start, because if you've, if you got seeds, right,

261
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,800
and you've got, like, what you consider the best one, wasn't that too much of a preview?

262
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,000
Is that not take away the suspense of, because then you'll go like, well, number one probably

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,320
is still gonna make it all the way through, right?

264
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Seems unlikely that these aren't games that are being played.

265
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Yeah.

266
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,080
If there's one that we clearly think is the best office, it's not gonna not become the

267
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,080
best office by the book as we talked about it, right?

268
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Right.

269
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,240
Unless, unless somebody has a riveting argument, perhaps.

270
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
This does happen.

271
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,040
I feel like I've done, I feel like we've had it.

272
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
I feel like it's happened.

273
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
There's been surprises.

274
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Yeah.

275
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Certainly.

276
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,760
There's stuff that comes out of my mouth.

277
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
I don't know.

278
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
I discover in real time.

279
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:36,320
I think one thing we could try that is closer to the actual tournament is, like, the collector's

280
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,560
office is probably a one or two seat.

281
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,200
They literally call it an office.

282
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,040
But here's the thing, though.

283
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,880
Does that pair with the weirdo?

284
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,340
No desk.

285
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,340
Is it an office?

286
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,340
There is a desk.

287
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
There is a desk?

288
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
There's a desk in there?

289
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,340
Where's the desk?

290
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:58,060
The desk has the excess tech memo on it, doesn't it?

291
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,980
Oh, you're talking about in the like the pre-showroom with Rocket?

292
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
Yeah.

293
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
And that's, is that his?

294
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,980
That is the collector's office.

295
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Right.

296
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,980
Isn't it?

297
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,980
Oh, wait a minute.

298
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
Yeah.

299
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
Oh, there is a desk.

300
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,980
Oh, geez.

301
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Well, what do you know?

302
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,980
Ah, okay.

303
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:19,180
But because they refer to that as his office, that might be in the early contender for best.

304
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,960
But then a makeshift office should probably be paired with that.

305
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,400
It shouldn't just be collector's office versus Daily Bugle.

306
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,360
That's, those are offices.

307
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,760
See, we're already doing exactly what I didn't want.

308
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
We're already saying what we think of the best offices.

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,120
I think this is what I don't like.

310
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
No, no.

311
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,280
I'm pointing at ones that are specifically referred to as office.

312
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Oh, that is what they are.

313
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
You're saying the most obvious offices.

314
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Yeah.

315
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Because office is in the, yeah.

316
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Office is in the title.

317
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:57,700
Well, it's, it's tricky because you could do it how they do it, but that, but the reason

318
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,180
things are structured in a tournament is so exciting stuff happens later.

319
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,780
That's that's the way I feel like, but you know, we don't do things conventionally.

320
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
So I don't know.

321
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,840
When we look at this list, we're going to say, well, what does it mean?

322
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,100
Maybe we have 16 whatever heavy hitters and they're all just going to be big matchups.

323
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Yeah, possibly.

324
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,100
I think that's okay.

325
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
I don't think we're going to know.

326
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
They're all tied for number one seed.

327
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
I don't, that's possible.

328
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,640
I mean, this is a thing I think we've had in the past is where we love all of them.

329
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
We love all of them equally.

330
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
What do we do?

331
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
We have to kill babies, you know?

332
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
So, right.

333
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,080
So who knows when we see this list, maybe they're all just sort of on equal footing

334
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,160
in concept and in theory.

335
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,840
So I don't think we can decide this until we look at the list.

336
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,040
Can I throw out an oddball that I want to see people's thoughts on?

337
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,380
Is Madame Leota's room technically her office?

338
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:59,420
With the floating stuff and there is a table and chairs, you know, floating like trumpet

339
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,420
and stuff.

340
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,020
Floating trumpets, tarot card kind of thing.

341
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,820
So like that is kind of where she does her business.

342
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,340
And again, if you were paying Madame Leota, if you were going to get a reading, you would

343
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,600
consider that, huh?

344
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,640
But is there an office also on the Haunted Mansion, is there more of a traditional office

345
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,040
in the Haunted Mansion as well?

346
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,320
I was thinking about this and I'm not so sure.

347
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,480
In the, I guess not the attic, but where are their books?

348
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:34,240
Well, there's a library, well, because that's what I was thinking, are libraries considered

349
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,160
offices because the pre-show in Terror of Terror is like a library.

350
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,880
Desk, desk is the line.

351
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
There is a desk.

352
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,960
Paris, by the way, I didn't realize there was a desk in that.

353
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,320
Maybe it's just, if it's crowded, if I was looking at photos where I didn't see a desk,

354
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,440
I feel humbled and ashamed.

355
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,920
And if you make fun of me for not noticing there was a desk, you're out.

356
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,040
It could be a credenza.

357
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
It could be.

358
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
It's a very narrow desk.

359
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,960
This is, it's kind of an interesting, desks are sort of odd.

360
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,880
I think the reason you don't see it more is that like, you know, a good mature desk is

361
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,320
pretty, pretty huge potentially.

362
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Yeah.

363
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
I don't want to send people into a room.

364
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,520
I think that's why they're often like sealed off or that there's like a little like little

365
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,280
net around it.

366
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:24,000
Old school, kind of like typist desks were often very small.

367
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,360
Let me bring this up though.

368
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,440
A doctor's office is not necessarily a traditional desk in a, I mean, there's some like, there's

369
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,920
a flat surface generally, you put things on, but it's not like, and there's a computer

370
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:43,840
often times, doctor's office, chiropractor office, you know, so it's office doesn't

371
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,400
necessarily have to have a desk.

372
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,280
It is where they could do their job.

373
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,640
Now, Madame Leota has got a little table to do a tarot reading or something.

374
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,240
That is technically the office that is if, if that's where most of the work is done,

375
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,040
then you are correct.

376
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,200
She does do her work from within the table is her desk and she does her work from on

377
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,560
the desk because she is a head, depending on the version we're talking about.

378
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:18,600
So I don't know if there's any language in like official Haunted Mansion lore that says

379
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:26,480
before when Madame Leota was alive, what that room was, but I suspect it was similar to

380
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,160
what she's doing now.

381
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,680
Can I say something that I think, because this is some of what I wanted to discuss is

382
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,320
the definition of what's in office.

383
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,000
And Jason, you've really thrown me for a loop here because I, I'm pretty stuck on this

384
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
one.

385
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It could be.

386
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It could be.

387
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But like, here's an example.

388
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,200
Here I think is this is the extreme of you keep heading that direction.

389
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:51,240
I don't think Rise of the Resistance is an office because the stormtroopers work there.

390
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,080
No, that's a military fort.

391
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,880
You mean as far as when you enter the ride the first time off the ship?

392
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,040
That is a big ship.

393
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,920
That's not, no, that's not the same thing.

394
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,200
No, I don't think so.

395
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,120
That just seems, I just wanted to present that as the extreme of the, or keep going,

396
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,760
you know, Oga's Cantina isn't an office because Oga works there.

397
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,320
But you wouldn't say, but if it's a dedicated, an office is just, generally you call it an

398
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,360
office as somebody has like a dedicated workspace.

399
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Stormtroopers do all sorts of things.

400
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,000
They have all sorts of duties.

401
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,400
There might be an office of a stormtrooper in there somewhere, but we don't see that.

402
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
Maybe they sleep also.

403
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Where does a stormtrooper sleep?

404
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,760
Have we never seen that in a movie?

405
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,680
We started getting a little, the force awakens, we saw them take off his helmet and do a little

406
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
bit of business.

407
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,840
Yeah, you get a sense of where they are before a Star Wars starts.

408
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Yeah.

409
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
They're in some bad little...

410
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,240
There might be something in Clone Wars where they're sleeping somewhere that I can't remember.

411
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,040
What's a stormtrooper's bed like?

412
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,520
Yeah, it's probably like a cot.

413
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Is it not like just a cot sort of thing?

414
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
No, it's probably kind of no frills.

415
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,960
But we're not doing sleeping areas.

416
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
We're doing offices.

417
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Unfortunately.

418
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,760
What about the room where the Rey projection is in the pre-show?

419
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Whose office is that?

420
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Yeah, whose office is that?

421
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,760
That's, I guess, the Resistance, the communications room.

422
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
That's a shared room.

423
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
That's like a WeWork.

424
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Yeah.

425
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,200
The closest you could say is that room with the plans on the wall where they made a makeshift

426
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,960
office out of, but they would probably say that's more of like a ready room.

427
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
Command center?

428
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Command center.

429
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Something like a conference room.

430
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
A conference room could be part of an office.

431
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Yeah.

432
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
This is...

433
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
And we can jump all around.

434
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:41,680
I don't think we've hashed this out, but another point I was heading for earlier was the thing...

435
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,520
I don't want Indy's office to be punished because it's one mere office as opposed to

436
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,280
Men in Black, which is a multi-room.

437
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,800
You know what I'm saying?

438
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,880
What's the difference between office and office building?

439
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
And we have to...

440
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Yeah.

441
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,760
We can't start veering to some just because they're bigger and have more parts, right?

442
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,080
Don't you have to judge them based on what they are and how they succeed?

443
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,920
If it's only attempting to be a recreation of a little makeshift office, you can't say

444
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,600
it's not as good as this office because that was meant to be a big office.

445
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,320
I mean, unfortunately, I think we're going to each have to take that decision into our

446
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,960
own hands when we do the actual deciding.

447
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
I suppose so.

448
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,560
I think that's just going to be up to us.

449
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,000
It's hard to ignore big.

450
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,080
It's a lot of what's great about Men in Black is it's big.

451
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Right.

452
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,080
It's going to seem like, oh my gosh, how is anything going to beat Men in Black?

453
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,960
But I think we're going to have to work that out.

454
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,360
That's a decision between us and our God, essentially.

455
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,200
Well, then I can't enforce that as a rule.

456
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,720
That's my own thing I'm putting on myself.

457
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Yeah.

458
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,440
We're getting a little philosophy on you right now.

459
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,720
You're revealing a little too much.

460
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
I just don't want to be unfair.

461
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,240
I don't want to be unfair to a nice little office.

462
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:58,000
Virtuous thought, but I think what is fair in this world, in this deciding world?

463
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,560
Now, a couple of things.

464
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:11,800
One, there are, like every year, new attractions opening all over the world, and like I feel

465
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:18,000
like with the fake rock Final Four, a bunch of new fake rocks came out right after that.

466
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,920
So I don't want to talk about hypothetical offices not yet open to the public offices.

467
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,760
I think that's off the table.

468
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,760
Well, we did put the Galaxy's Edge fake rocks in the fake rock Final Four despite them not

469
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
being open.

470
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,560
It kind of sank because it's hard to pick something that's not open.

471
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,200
But I think if you reevaluate it while I think those are fine rocks, I don't think it was

472
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,480
ever going to go all the way.

473
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,760
Now, is there an upcoming office that you're excited about or that you feel like has to

474
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
be off limits?

475
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Is there an Epic Universe office?

476
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Are there any offices?

477
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Are there fake offices in Epic Universe?

478
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,160
That's a good question.

479
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,320
I bet there's a fake office in the Ministry of Magic somewhere.

480
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Yeah.

481
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,440
Now, that's definitely an office building.

482
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,320
I guess.

483
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,200
And they've teased, I mean, Dr. Victoria Frankenstein's manor.

484
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,320
Yeah, I bet Victoria Frankenstein has an office, technically.

485
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,600
Vincent Various has opened up his workshops to us.

486
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,040
So there's a workshop, an office.

487
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,480
Workshop might be an office.

488
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
That's close.

489
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
You've got to look at it.

490
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
We haven't seen this.

491
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,680
Is that a place you can go in Epic Universe is Vincent Various' workshop?

492
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,360
I believe he's most of the shops and restaurants.

493
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,560
I don't know anything about this other than I know that like, yeah, it's like his, Celestial

494
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,680
Park is his zone for exploring and learning.

495
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,880
But it's also a place to eat pizza.

496
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,680
It's also a place that he's selling pizza as well.

497
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,840
Well, if it's been converted into a pizza place, then it's not an office.

498
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,960
But we don't know, we're talking, we don't know.

499
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,200
This is speculation, just whatever teases and stuff they put out in press releases.

500
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:06,360
More modern, quote unquote, office is to give credit to the other Spider-Man ride, the web

501
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,160
headquarters in web slingers.

502
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,840
Sure.

503
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,120
That seems to be an office.

504
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,160
It's headquarters.

505
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,440
Yeah.

506
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,360
And now I think for me, what's going against that and that of the web quarters would be

507
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,880
that it sucks and the ride sucks and I hate it.

508
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,440
Okay.

509
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,840
But that's your decision.

510
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,960
That's a personal choice for you to look down upon the office because the ride happens to

511
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,640
be bad.

512
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,040
It's true.

513
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,160
You can assess the quality of it, but come on, we're going to web quarters.

514
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,920
Right now, imagine that, all right, conjure that in your head.

515
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,840
Is that getting in?

516
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't hate it.

517
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,800
I think I might like that office and the vibe.

518
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,560
Which one are we talking about?

519
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,880
Well, what do you want as far as office?

520
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,480
Do you think it's the pre-showroom?

521
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,280
That's not as much practical stuff in there.

522
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Well, but then this gets to like, is a workshop an office?

523
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,360
So you're saying it could possibly be the whole thing because it's a whole creative

524
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,040
campus.

525
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,440
Now I like those lockers, I like the little inside things in the lockers, but would you

526
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,000
consider all of that the office?

527
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,640
I think.

528
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,440
No.

529
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,400
No.

530
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,160
You at least have to, if we're narrowing, and I am a proponent, by the way, of narrowing

531
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,360
to 16.

532
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,080
I don't think there's any reason to go past 16.

533
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,280
All right, all right.

534
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,360
I think I'd be surprised.

535
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,880
So if we're tightening up like that, then I think you can't start having something where

536
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,360
you don't get to look into an actual office.

537
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,440
They got lockers?

538
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:34,920
Yeah.

539
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,120
I don't think so.

540
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,880
Yeah.

541
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,600
I think you have to veer with those 16 to the ones that are the most office-y.

542
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,960
I think this year, too, we're also putting this out so people can offer up suggestions

543
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,800
for stuff we may have not considered or gotten.

544
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,600
Yeah, maybe, but by the time this comes out, they might have already, it might be too late.

545
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,000
But I did ask people online.

546
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh, sorry.

547
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yes.

548
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
That is true.

549
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay, there we did that.

550
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I will say some people, we did it in advance.

551
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah, okay.

552
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'll read some of those.

553
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That probably would be a good idea.

554
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I just don't know when we're going to record it, so I don't want to start promising that.

555
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Sure.

556
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yes.

557
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,720
I will vote.

558
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,760
If there was one great central-looking office in Spider-Man, the California Adventure one,

559
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
I would say yes.

560
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,240
But I guess I'll say no because it's too vague.

561
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,800
Did you mean the Tom Holland room?

562
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
The Tom Holland room, yeah.

563
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
That's a lot of screens.

564
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
There's fun.

565
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,280
I like the pre-show fine.

566
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
I do, too.

567
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
You know what?

568
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Yeah.

569
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
But I like the lock.

570
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
I like all that stuff leading up.

571
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
I like the lockers.

572
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,920
But I guess it's not ... There's not a central, oh, there's that room.

573
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
There's fake doors.

574
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Yeah.

575
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Right?

576
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Fake office doors.

577
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
But to other fake ... I mean, you can make your argument.

578
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
I don't think that counts.

579
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Yeah.

580
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
I guess it's out.

581
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,640
I think it's hard to compete as just a door, and we're going to find that here and there.

582
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
There are some ...

583
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,880
Well, it's got to be a special door to include it.

584
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,600
Something that people have said is the doors that lead to the flubber lab.

585
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,640
Right, right.

586
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,160
That's in the New Journey into Imagination or ...

587
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Yeah.

588
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Yeah.

589
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,160
But I think ... I don't know.

590
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I'm not sure about door with the fly ...

591
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,840
It's going to be tough to just get it to be a door unless, again, it's a very special

592
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
door.

593
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Yeah.

594
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:33,640
I kind of need to hold ... Over web slingers, I would go with the monsters.

595
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,480
Why Consolidated the Rescue, because don't you go through the ...

596
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
This is a big question.

597
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Company?

598
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
This is a big question.

599
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Yes.

600
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,720
I mean, you're definitely in the workplace of Monsters Inc., right?

601
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Yeah.

602
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,840
And there's that, and there's also, as Paul Durso suggested, there's Ride and Seek in

603
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Tokyo.

604
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Right.

605
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
What he sent was like a reception desk.

606
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Reception?

607
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
What is a desk?

608
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
I don't know.

609
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,480
Yeah, but that's ... Yeah, I think no on reception desk.

610
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
Yeah.

611
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Huh.

612
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
I think no.

613
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
What, is that upsetting?

614
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Well, I don't know.

615
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,640
I hadn't really considered that, but yeah.

616
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,280
I think they're going to have trouble going all the way, because I think what we're going

617
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:23,120
to start liking is level of detail, level of lived-in-ness about these spaces, and there's

618
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,280
a minimal nature to a reception desk, or there should be, if it's not this.

619
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,880
But Roz would probably call her desk her office.

620
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,080
I don't know, though.

621
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,720
I don't think if you're a receptionist at a doctor's office, you would call your desk

622
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
your office.

623
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
That would be weird.

624
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,040
It's more of a lobby.

625
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
It's part of an office.

626
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
It's part of an office.

627
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Hence my discussion.

628
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
Hence me proposing.

629
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
Right.

630
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:48,080
Are we viewing office as a one-room office, or are we viewing it as a big campus?

631
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Yeah, doctor's office, but then the single rooms, like office number, I guess you wouldn't

632
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,760
say office number eight?

633
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
You're right.

634
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
It's a room that you're in.

635
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,320
And then there is the doctor's office.

636
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,600
When you say you've got to go to the doctor's office, does that mean when you get the meeting

637
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
with the doctor in the room where his desk is?

638
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,240
Or when you're getting checked out, is that the doctor's office?

639
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,880
I don't know if it is.

640
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Is this even a problem?

641
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,520
Are there any doctor's offices and rides anywhere?

642
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,080
Oh, that's a good question.

643
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Yeah.

644
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
Is there any fun doctors?

645
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,080
I mean, Doc Brown?

646
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,160
Yeah, Institute of Future Technologies.

647
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,800
I don't know if you go through an office there is some of the problem.

648
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,560
We are back, Kids from the Future, there's sort of an office.

649
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Oh, I would love to.

650
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,200
If there is one, then We Are Back, Kids from the Future is in, for sure.

651
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,600
See, you said only 16, because I'm occasionally having trouble thinking of 16.

652
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,080
Oh, you can't get to that number.

653
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,800
So we're back, Kids from the Future.

654
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
We are back.

655
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
We are back.

656
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,840
We are back, Kids from the Future.

657
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Excuse me.

658
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
Yeah.

659
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,520
People didn't know what you were talking about.

660
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:03,120
The new House of Horrors, that's the H.H. Holmes, is his office present in that walk-through.

661
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,080
I don't know, we've got to look that up.

662
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,080
I've got to see if there's walk-throughs.

663
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,320
Well, here's what, by my count, there's seven that are in, for sure.

664
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Indiana Jones, Men in Black, Tiana's office in the line, Spider-Man, Daily Bugle, Expedition

665
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,120
Everest, Jungle Cruise, and Guardians, Collector's Office.

666
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,240
Okay, so let's turn to the listener suggestions here.

667
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,520
Maybe Josh Smiley is a good place to start, because it's something that we've talked about.

668
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,720
Indiana Jones, Jungle Cruise, Treehouse, the Adventureland office has always piqued me.

669
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,400
Okay, so there's a Treehouse one.

670
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
That could be worth considering.

671
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,320
I've got to look at it.

672
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,600
Let's not make any guarantees here, but Treehouse's office would probably be good.

673
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,240
I am in favor of that.

674
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,160
I just can't place it offhand, but we should all look at it.

675
00:30:53,160 --> 00:31:00,000
Is there a specific one, like in the Tarzan version, or in the Swiss Family version, or

676
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
the new version?

677
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That I'm not sure.

678
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, well, that I, yeah.

679
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,280
Well, this will be a waste of time to figure it out, but we'll put eyes on the Treehouse

680
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
office.

681
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
Hopefully a Treehouse office.

682
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Do deal with it.

683
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
I mean, yes.

684
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
I like that I've done it.

685
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,360
Have you guys, you have not walked the new Treehouse yet?

686
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
I have not, no.

687
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Neither of you have.

688
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
No.

689
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
I've done it a couple of times.

690
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
I'm a big fan of it.

691
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Really?

692
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Great.

693
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Better than what was there?

694
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Better than original?

695
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,920
I think it's, well, I don't know about original, but I like a lot what they've done with it.

696
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Sure.

697
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
And I think it's fun.

698
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,240
And I do think it feels, it feels fresher than Tarzan felt.

699
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
You don't say.

700
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
In the year 2020, whatever.

701
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Pan flute instrumental.

702
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Yes.

703
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

704
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,600
There's a lot of nice touches.

705
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,120
Again, I'm glad it's still there.

706
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,720
They figured out a way to save it from the nudge.

707
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Yeah, really.

708
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,240
I'm surprised the way is just adventure land treehouse.

709
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
It's weird.

710
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,400
Inspired, again, we'll talk about that on its own episode, but like inspired by Swiss

711
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Family Robinson.

712
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
I don't know why.

713
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
There you go.

714
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
That's what it says.

715
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Anyway.

716
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,400
That's a real like, and this movie is not about Buzz Lightyear the toy, it's Buzz Lightyear

717
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
the man.

718
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Yeah, yeah.

719
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:11,280
If there are any great offices in that movie, I guess those won't make it to the park, unfortunately.

720
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Candy TV.

721
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,480
Badger's office in Toad Hall.

722
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,160
Yeah, that's, yeah.

723
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,640
That's like right when the ride starts, right?

724
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,480
That's like one of the first rooms that you go in.

725
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Yeah.

726
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
I mean, should we?

727
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
Is that a library?

728
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
Well.

729
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
I don't think so.

730
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Yeah.

731
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Okay.

732
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
Yeah, yeah.

733
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,360
I think if you got a desk and somebody's working at the desk, oh wait, full quote, Badger's

734
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,680
office in Toad Hall is solid, just needs to fix that suit of armor, that's what Candy

735
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,680
said.

736
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Because it keeps falling over.

737
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Always.

738
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,720
I mean, again, I don't want to, you know, we can assess some of these, we're going to

739
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
have to bounce some at the end.

740
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
I mean, if you want me, there's, I have immediate reactions to it.

741
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
It feels like you don't want that.

742
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,720
No, I do want it.

743
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Oh, that's you wanting it?

744
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Oh, I want it.

745
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Yeah, I think I might too.

746
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Yeah, yeah, me too.

747
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
What?

748
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,200
I don't know why I read that as like, I don't know, I don't know.

749
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,040
I was being, I was trying to be like, oh, should we, should we reveal it later?

750
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
But I guess, no, I'm in.

751
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
I don't know.

752
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
We've got to be efficient here.

753
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,520
You were going through your mind palace to try and find a room.

754
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,560
I was, yeah, walking through it, strolling.

755
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Ben Donan, Jimmy Fallon is set in 30 Rock and most of the theming is office core.

756
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
Yes, but.

757
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Yeah.

758
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
I think you don't have an actual room.

759
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
It's not that I recall, right?

760
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
Oh, that's a question.

761
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Is the, oh God, what are the names of the?

762
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
The B-sharps.

763
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
No, it's not.

764
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
No?

765
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
No.

766
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
Oh, fuck.

767
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Nor is it the Depperdans.

768
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
No, because I didn't have it in my head either.

769
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
It's the ragtime gals.

770
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
The ragtime gals, thank you.

771
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,600
Now, is that room where, is that the ragtime gals office?

772
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
No.

773
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Because that's where they do their ragtime, their acapella work.

774
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
No.

775
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
No.

776
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
Just checking.

777
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
I don't even remember a card table.

778
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,600
I don't believe that either.

779
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Animation Academy comes courtesy of Ethan Bradlow.

780
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Now, here's the whole thing.

781
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,600
There's a lot of real offices in various and especially behind the scenes kind of a tray,

782
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,600
animator desks in the magic of Disney animation, but real offices are not fake offices.

783
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,640
However, the Animation Academy in California Adventure, where you do a little live show

784
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,640
presentation, that is an animator's desk.

785
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
There's a bunch of books.

786
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
Yeah.

787
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,640
There's a big, there's a very like 2001 computer screen.

788
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,640
Real HP is what I'm looking at.

789
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
I mean, I don't know.

790
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,640
I think that's an office.

791
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,640
I know some of it is where we, the audience, sit, but at least this wall is an office.

792
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
Yeah.

793
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
I think that's a great suggestion.

794
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,640
Okay.

795
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
But let's say that's in for now.

796
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,640
I think we're just building a list of possibilities.

797
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,680
Yeah, sure.

798
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,680
Maybe we end up bumping something here together or that happens between now and the main feed.

799
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
Right.

800
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
The main event on Friday.

801
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
Okay.

802
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
Let's see.

803
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,680
Well, maybe now we get into, oh, here.

804
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,680
Well, how about this?

805
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:53,680
Journey to the Center of the Earth from Jason Muir also has a kind of a, that's more in

806
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,680
the realm of like makeshift.

807
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,680
It's a little one knitted off in the queue.

808
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
Yeah.

809
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,680
I'd have to look at it to be sure.

810
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
I looked, I did a little glance at it.

811
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
Okay.

812
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
You think it's in?

813
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
I think it's in.

814
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
I think it's nice.

815
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,720
It's a nice one.

816
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,920
So now we get into, this is something that we talked about, I think maybe when we first

817
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,720
had the idea, one that's near and dear to my heart, Tony Ricotta, Tony Got Awesome,

818
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,640
Mickey Mouse's den where he goes if he needs to make a call.

819
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
Of course.

820
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Hmm.

821
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Is a den an office?

822
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,640
It is a home office.

823
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,400
Look, I looked up the definition and it certainly can share a lot of the functions of an office,

824
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,160
a den can.

825
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,560
So I think you could make an argument that he does a lot of the same type of business

826
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,240
that Mickey might do in an office.

827
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
Yeah.

828
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,240
Look, if he needs to make a call.

829
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
He uses a den.

830
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
He uses the den.

831
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,160
But it has the desk, it has his stuff that he works with there.

832
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,080
I say yes.

833
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,760
I think it's at least on the, what do we call the preliminary list?

834
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
I think it's on the preliminary list.

835
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,960
At the least it's on that, but yeah.

836
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,680
Just Mickey calling AT&T, my bill went up for no, I don't quite know why.

837
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,920
I thought it was locked in price wise.

838
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,240
This is a question I have in general because I have two other suggestions here.

839
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,000
Because of space limitations, just because somebody doesn't have a big house or a big

840
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,280
living area, they're going to need a little section of rooms to do work.

841
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,040
So are they allowed to say this is my office even if it doesn't have four walls, even if

842
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,480
it has things in there that might also be in a part of another room if you had a bigger

843
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
house?

844
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:40,200
Well, you know, wouldn't it be the post COVID Zoom era in order to say yes, that we've all

845
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,360
had to make makeshift offices in odd spaces?

846
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,440
What are you specifically thinking of here?

847
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:53,320
Well, Minnie's house, Minnie has a room that has like her dressing kind of table and like

848
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:58,640
kind of a chaise lounge and it has a desk with computer.

849
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,960
That is a room where Minnie is doing her work.

850
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,240
Her computer is right there, but it is also her like dressing or her bedroom to some,

851
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,960
I don't know if it's her bedroom, but I'm saying she's doing office work in there.

852
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Why would the computer be in there?

853
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
It's a whole office.

854
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,200
It's something of a home office.

855
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,320
I mean, if you're going to count Mickey's, then maybe you got to count that.

856
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,560
I was ready to say that it feels like more of like a parlor.

857
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
That computer though.

858
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,760
But the computer does shift.

859
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,960
That's where she's doing her work.

860
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,720
But she doesn't have the luxury of space for some reason.

861
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,640
Hopefully Mickey should have taken care of her and given her a bigger house.

862
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
But he didn't.

863
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
I don't know why.

864
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,320
But he still, I mean, it is very generous.

865
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,000
Well, first of all, you're making an assumption that he bought her the house.

866
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I guess that's true.

867
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,840
But they lived there before in the lore of Toontown, I suppose, now that I'm thinking

868
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
about it.

869
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,920
They just happened to live in Anaheim and then they finally opened the gates.

870
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,440
I've got my own money, Mickey.

871
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,160
I don't need your blood money.

872
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Her hands are clean.

873
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,760
It's the ultimate gift than any.

874
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,160
If they are married, and this is unclear, but if they are married, the best gift you

875
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,640
can give to your wife, a separate house next door.

876
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
A separate house next to yours.

877
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
I guess that's true.

878
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,840
But maybe they're not married in the in-park Toontown canon.

879
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
I don't think they are.

880
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,320
Or they started dating and they had the separate houses and they thought, well, let's essentially

881
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,320
move in together.

882
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,920
But why would you have less space?

883
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,360
If you own, if you both own, keep your house.

884
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,080
If you both own and if your houses kind of look like you physically, maybe keep the house.

885
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Yes.

886
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:38,840
Now, this same sort of line of thought, let me take it a little farther, is Walt's apartment

887
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,800
on Main Street in office.

888
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
He would do work.

889
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,280
There's pictures of him on the phone in there, obviously also pictures of him entertaining.

890
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,520
He would sleep there.

891
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,080
He and Lillian would sleep on separate parts of the couch.

892
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,480
That was a multi-purpose studio apartment, essentially.

893
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,000
So there was a little area with a desk.

894
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,520
You can see in this, at least this picture, where he's on the phone, where he would do

895
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
his work.

896
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,240
But that's a real.

897
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
That's real.

898
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,240
Yep.

899
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
Jason's got it.

900
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
It's real.

901
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
I guess you're right.

902
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
It's not fake.

903
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Damn it.

904
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
I guess you're right.

905
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Office, yes.

906
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
Fake, no.

907
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,240
He would actually do real work.

908
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
Uh-huh.

909
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,240
Yeah.

910
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
You're right.

911
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,200
Is there a fantasy version of Walt when you go in there?

912
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Is it a fake office now that he's not doing real work in it?

913
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,040
The lamp is fake because they made it up two years ago.

914
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Well, that's right.

915
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,880
But I'm just saying, now we are celebrating the fake Walt Disney up there.

916
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
It's too heady.

917
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,880
It's too heady.

918
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
I don't know.

919
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
I'm going to think about it.

920
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,840
Here's a coming soon office.

921
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,280
The Walt animatronic appears to be in the recreation of-

922
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,880
Oh, from his office.

923
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,360
That is a very good point.

924
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:53,200
That is a simulation of Walt's actual office that is hermetically sealed.

925
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
That is true.

926
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Interesting.

927
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Good point.

928
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Walt Disney animatronic.

929
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
That is an office show.

930
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,600
But that doesn't, we can't see it.

931
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
It's not real yet.

932
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
So maybe-

933
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Right.

934
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,840
And what if for budget purposes they cut the set and he is not in his office anymore?

935
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,120
We got to get this chalkboard out of here where we're spending too much money.

936
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,080
What if he's just sitting in Lincoln's chair and he stands up and it's the same backdrop?

937
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,880
To save money.

938
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,000
He's sitting on Lincoln's lap.

939
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
He's sitting on Lincoln's lap.

940
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
We cannot move this.

941
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
He would like to spoon hydraulic fluid.

942
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Well, they could have got budget cuts.

943
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
He's just passed out.

944
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
He's sedate.

945
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,480
There's a little trail of drool coming out of his mouth.

946
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Yeah.

947
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
That would be fun too.

948
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,840
Now you raise a very good point here.

949
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,080
I feel like, I consider this more of a backdrop than an office.

950
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,440
He's leaning against it.

951
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,320
It's kind of a one wall of the set and maybe not even the full wall.

952
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,800
I might bounce it, A, that it's concept, that it hasn't opened yet, so we haven't been able

953
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,280
to really breathe it in yet, but also I just think it's not going to have what it takes

954
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,040
to go all the way because it's ultimately, it's just too one wall.

955
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
I just don't know how that's going to survive.

956
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
Yeah.

957
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
It's a nice office though.

958
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,120
I would have to see it in person.

959
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,120
That's the only thing.

960
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
Yeah.

961
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,200
I would have to see the final thing.

962
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,960
Honestly, there might be a lot of curtains implying a room.

963
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
Perhaps.

964
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,720
It might be him leaning on a credenza.

965
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Perhaps, yes.

966
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,080
And one blueprint as opposed to that kind of more elaborate stage picture.

967
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,080
Yeah.

968
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,080
I don't know.

969
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,080
I don't know.

970
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:38,120
Well, it's something to consider, but that feels like it's teetering on the edge, I think.

971
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Let's see.

972
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,440
Let me go to, I think there's another one in the same screenshot.

973
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Oh no, that's the den.

974
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,600
I think this is probably the time to open up this discussion because Randy Renstrom

975
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,800
asks out loud something that we're going to have to talk about at some point, and it's

976
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
this.

977
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Do labs count as offices?

978
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,680
If so, avatar flight of passage.

979
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,680
I believe.

980
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,680
Are labs offices?

981
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Yes.

982
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Okay.

983
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
I think so.

984
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,920
Well, I think that one, there are desks with papers shattered.

985
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,480
There's so many desks in that one.

986
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
Yeah.

987
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,000
But you get into, is a lab an office?

988
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,480
Is a workshop an office?

989
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,320
Yeah, that desk is a big, might be the deciding factor.

990
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,080
I think we're going to have to look more closely at that queue.

991
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
We're going to have to decide.

992
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
Well, I think that's right.

993
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,120
And I think, I mean, if it's a lab and it seems like people just kind of float in and

994
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,840
out, there's certain labs, I assume, where it's like, there's not a great sitting area.

995
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,120
You go in there to do just the work of lab work.

996
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,000
But then there's also, yes, the avatar one, it seems like it's lab hybrid office.

997
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,240
It seems like it's half and half.

998
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,480
You do your work in there, but also you could maybe run an experiment or two.

999
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,640
There's so much desk stuff, so much stuff on the desks.

1000
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,680
It seems kind of a hybrid of lab office to me, that specific one.

1001
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,040
And I bet a lot of labs fall under that category.

1002
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
Okay.

1003
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
Okay.

1004
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Fake labs.

1005
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,240
Because it feels to me like either they're in or they're out.

1006
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:12,120
If we have a 16 that we like that doesn't include labs, then maybe there's no labs.

1007
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,840
But maybe the labs deserve to be in there more than some so-called offices.

1008
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,840
Yeah.

1009
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:29,760
It might be like if a walled animatronic fake office were representative of the soon-to-open

1010
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:37,920
And there was one like avatar lab is representative of labs.

1011
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
Yeah.

1012
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,960
You're saying only one lab.

1013
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,920
The best lab represents the sector of labs.

1014
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,880
That has a lot of-

1015
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,880
What about like it's Dr. Seeker?

1016
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,280
Have we seen any Dr. Seeker lab and dinosaur?

1017
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
Do we?

1018
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
I don't think so.

1019
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
I don't know if I'm saying it out loud.

1020
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,280
Well, here's another question, and I know my personal answer to this.

1021
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,000
Do these all have to be physical spaces?

1022
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,040
Or if there's an office that's really good that's like in a movie or a video that you

1023
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,160
watch, does that count?

1024
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,720
You have an example in your head, I think.

1025
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,400
Oh, do I?

1026
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,400
That's what I assumed.

1027
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,000
I don't know that you do.

1028
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,360
Well, how about when you fly into the office building in Transformers, you whip through

1029
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,120
that floor in and out?

1030
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,680
Oh, I never even thought of it.

1031
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,000
I was looking for a good Transformers one, but that is an interesting office.

1032
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,920
That's a real office or only like skyscraper-y type office.

1033
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,480
But I think it's out because I want physical spaces.

1034
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
I don't want it.

1035
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
I think just like now we're in a different area.

1036
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,520
Now we're in like set design, production design of a movie.

1037
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,520
Yes.

1038
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,520
It's fun to have more tactile.

1039
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,840
I would love to put it in the maybe pile right now though.

1040
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,840
I'll put it in the maybe pile.

1041
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,520
To not completely take it out of the equation.

1042
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,240
Doc Brown would go also in the...

1043
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,640
Because you don't really go into his office, but you see him trapped in his own office.

1044
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,240
So that does that...

1045
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,240
I don't know.

1046
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,240
It just feels like a different genre.

1047
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:14,240
Footage feels off, but is there an office room in the Transformers queue or is that

1048
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,840
Military Fortress?

1049
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,880
I think Military Fort is out by and large.

1050
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,880
But I am...

1051
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,440
Because we're no fans of war.

1052
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,080
That's right.

1053
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:32,440
I am sitting here racking my brain about like there must be some sort of whimsical office

1054
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,560
in Islands of Adventure.

1055
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,480
My beloved Islands of Adventure that I am forgetting.

1056
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,960
Like Popeye's office?

1057
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,960
I was trying to think if there was a cartoony office.

1058
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,840
Now there used to be an internet cafe of course, but that was real.

1059
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,680
Is there something in Port of Entry or Poseidon's Fury?

1060
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,840
Probably out of makeshift Adventureland-y kind of office.

1061
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,840
Poseidon's office.

1062
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:06,720
No, no, like Taylor, Taylor and the doctor.

1063
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,720
But is that an excavation site?

1064
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,600
I have to admit, I like that attraction.

1065
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,440
I did not have Taylor at the ready.

1066
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,000
I knew about it.

1067
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,880
Taylor is the team member who guides you through and it's always stuck with me because it's

1068
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,880
gender neutral.

1069
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,400
So it can be a guy or a girl.

1070
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,400
Oh, sure.

1071
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Whoever's playing that part.

1072
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
Yeah.

1073
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
So I don't know.

1074
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,360
I got to think on this.

1075
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:40,680
According to John the Mon, Bluto's office from Popeye and Bluto's build rat barges.

1076
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,000
He's even got a cannon shot through the wall that goes through multiple walls and ends

1077
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
up in a pole.

1078
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Oh, well then that's in.

1079
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Okay.

1080
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah, Bluto's office.

1081
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I knew there was something there.

1082
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Bluto's office.

1083
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,480
Yeah, and look, I don't want to tip it, but Jason just, we found our winner here.

1084
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,720
Guys, I said keep it in your pants, boys.

1085
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,840
Okay.

1086
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,400
Another does this count as an office in the lab territory comes from Amanda Hasaka and

1087
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,760
that is the lab of the cool seventies spaceship earth woman.

1088
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,760
Yeah.

1089
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,760
She has a computer in there.

1090
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,760
I forget.

1091
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,240
Well, it's a bunch of old school computers like the, you know, the big old light up machines.

1092
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,440
This looks like a dedicated workspace for her.

1093
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,000
I got to say there's a phone, there's a light, there's a ledger.

1094
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's in.

1095
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yeah.

1096
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
All right.

1097
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Yeah, that one's.

1098
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Yeah.

1099
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Great.

1100
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I feel like a fan favorite.

1101
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Fan favorite.

1102
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
But wait.

1103
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
But I didn't say necessarily.

1104
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Cool girl office.

1105
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,720
Okay.

1106
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,720
Another one.

1107
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,240
This is a, this is kind of a mini one in a queue.

1108
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:49,960
This is from a Jacko B graphic who's related to wall to see graphic is a little avatar picture

1109
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,000
and they're so fittingly Muppet vision security office.

1110
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,700
What we see here is a different genre kind of, right?

1111
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,860
It's a security office.

1112
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,840
It says back in five minutes.

1113
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,120
I can't read whatever the sign gag is.

1114
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:09,800
There's stuffed Muppet babies between the bars and we're losing this baby soon.

1115
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,000
So it might be a nice way to honor.

1116
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It's pretty small.

1117
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,280
You got some, what I like is that I think we're going to be looking at like how lived

1118
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,280
in are these.

1119
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,840
And here you got like a coffee.

1120
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,840
You got a banana.

1121
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,840
Oh my God.

1122
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,840
Wait.

1123
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,520
And if security offices, then there's a one that I love, which is officer Zizek's.

1124
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,520
Oh, right.

1125
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,600
Reads you at the end when you arrive from your start to his flight in Japan.

1126
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Right.

1127
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:43,760
And then I also go is Tony Solaroni's big mechanical is that that is his workstation.

1128
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,560
Do you consider that an office?

1129
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,560
I don't know.

1130
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,560
What is it?

1131
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,160
It's just this weird machine floating, helping make the weird machine.

1132
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
Yes.

1133
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,160
Pizza.

1134
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,160
It's a big pizza sorting machine, but it is his desk and it is where he works.

1135
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
Yeah.

1136
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,720
Is it a whimsical?

1137
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,960
Because if you were working in a factory, you wouldn't necessarily say you were working

1138
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,960
in an office.

1139
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,960
Yeah.

1140
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,960
It's more factory-esque.

1141
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,960
I guess.

1142
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,960
Yeah.

1143
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,960
Sadly.

1144
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,960
Maybe so.

1145
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,520
It's a workstation, but to workstations, especially if it's shared, you know.

1146
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
Let me.

1147
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,080
Although my sense is that Tony Solaroni does it all himself and that he has to pull 24

1148
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,080
hour shifts.

1149
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,080
Probably.

1150
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,440
And his wife calls and yells at him for never coming home.

1151
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
That's probably right.

1152
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,220
Let me ask this question.

1153
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:39,220
When you're on Space Mountain and you see a human being as your ship is going toward

1154
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:42,740
the lift hill and when you're going to take that right and you see a human being in that

1155
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:51,180
little office above, I believe that is a practical place, but I also kind of imagine it is also

1156
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,900
thematically made to think that you are seeing somebody that's going to send you to space.

1157
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:02,580
It's both practical and it is also suggesting to you, well, this person is sending you into

1158
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,580
space.

1159
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:08,060
So in some way, it's not a real office because it's mechanical.

1160
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:15,780
It's for the ride, but thematically, it could be potentially a workstation for an astronaut.

1161
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,780
I don't know.

1162
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,180
I think it's too much actual function of the ride.

1163
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,180
Too practical operations.

1164
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,180
I'll say you don't see in there.

1165
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,820
How's that going to survive?

1166
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,500
We don't know what's going on in that room.

1167
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,500
We don't.

1168
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,500
So we have to imagine.

1169
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
So I'm just asking questions.

1170
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
No, no, no.

1171
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
It's worth bringing up.

1172
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,500
Certainly.

1173
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,540
That's what we're here to do is to debate.

1174
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,380
Do we think Muppet Security Office in or out?

1175
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,380
I think that's in.

1176
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,380
Yeah, that's in.

1177
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,020
I think that's in.

1178
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,020
I think I need to look.

1179
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,500
I might still put it on a maybe.

1180
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,660
I'm going to vote in the maybe category because I think there's better ones.

1181
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:52,540
But I think maybe too for Officer Zizek's.

1182
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,020
Yeah.

1183
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,140
I got to remind myself what that looks like.

1184
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,740
Now, this one's going to be tough, I think, for anyone to make the call because it's kind

1185
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:06,660
of where I'm going off of one weird old photo and seeing it on my laptop is not going to

1186
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,140
give you guys the sense of it.

1187
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,020
But this is from Traveling Salesman at Open Mother's Mail.

1188
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,020
H.G.

1189
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,500
Wells' office in Knott's old Kingdom of the Dinosaur's ride.

1190
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,340
What other fake offices have time machines in them?

1191
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:26,100
And I will show you this very cartoony mannequin.

1192
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,380
There's a bunch of tubes.

1193
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,140
Oh, hell, you know what?

1194
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,820
The longer I look at it, it's in.

1195
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,820
That's good.

1196
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,820
It's in.

1197
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,820
It is good.

1198
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,820
Shelves, desk, it has everything you want.

1199
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:42,140
It's not made by one of the primaries and it's maybe not a ride that we know incredibly

1200
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,060
well, but aren't you rooting for underdogs in this thing?

1201
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,060
Sure, of course.

1202
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:51,740
Here's a real 16 seed, but I think it might have the gumption it needs to take it all

1203
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,740
the way.

1204
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,740
Maybe it does, yes.

1205
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,740
I'm voting for H.G.

1206
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,740
Wells' office.

1207
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,740
I think so.

1208
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:04,220
What about a couple of ones here, thinking about dinosaurs.

1209
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,100
Dinosaur, the Institute?

1210
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,100
I don't know.

1211
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,100
Is that more museum?

1212
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,400
I mean, it's certainly a museum, but is there something in that?

1213
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,380
That's what I was actually hadn't thought about until just now.

1214
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,420
We see footage, but yeah.

1215
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,220
I don't know that you got like a real workspace in there.

1216
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,220
I could be wrong.

1217
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,500
I don't have it memorized by any means.

1218
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,740
The Google image is not providing anything too satisfying.

1219
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,220
I'll zip through the YouTube to see.

1220
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,220
Okay, okay.

1221
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,220
Yes.

1222
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,220
Okay.

1223
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:40,500
Other dinosaur office, Jurassic Park River Adventure or Jurassic World Ride.

1224
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,980
Is there anything in those?

1225
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,420
I don't know.

1226
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,780
Now I'm trying to think.

1227
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:51,460
Do we get more into the command center that is thematic, but also practical like Mike brought

1228
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,460
up?

1229
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,460
I think we're in the security zone.

1230
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,460
Yeah.

1231
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,660
I mean, security is kind of a weird area.

1232
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,780
It really depends on if you can see in there.

1233
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,740
I think that's what's really going to ... I just don't ... You know what?

1234
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:07,900
I don't want to waste the time of these competitors if I feel like they don't have what it takes

1235
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:13,460
to ... I think you just need to be able to see stuff for it to be able to compete against

1236
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,180
hyper-detailed offices.

1237
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:25,220
I think labs and home offices and libraries I'm sold on, I think labs and security offices

1238
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,220
I need to see.

1239
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,220
It depends.

1240
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,220
It's like a gut feeling.

1241
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,220
Yes.

1242
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,220
Yes.

1243
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,220
Uh-huh.

1244
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,220
We'll only see.

1245
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,100
Dr. Seeker is in a lab slash office in the pre-show video, but I don't think there's

1246
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:40,100
a great practical part of the line.

1247
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,100
But that's footage.

1248
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:49,060
It's a cool-looking office in the footage, so you could make ... I would put it in maybe

1249
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:54,460
perhaps, but it's not ... What do I call it?

1250
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,460
Dinosaur?

1251
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,460
Dinosaur lab office.

1252
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,460
Okay.

1253
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,460
Okay.

1254
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,180
I mean, he's got a workstation.

1255
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:04,100
It's a big room, though, too, so I don't know of many multiple people.

1256
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,180
It's more of a we work ... I don't know.

1257
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,180
It's tough.

1258
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,100
I'd say maybe, and we'll revisit it.

1259
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,100
It's possible.

1260
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:17,380
Let me show you Officer Zizek's ... I mean, it's kind of a more robust room than you might

1261
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,380
expect.

1262
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,380
Yeah.

1263
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,580
It is a spacey future desk.

1264
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:25,260
However, if you put this in, does this not set the precedent that you would put in the

1265
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:29,220
Patrick Warburton droid from the Star Tours line, and that doesn't feel right to me?

1266
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,220
I would say no.

1267
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,220
That's not right.

1268
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,220
No.

1269
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,220
That's glorified TSA.

1270
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,220
Yeah.

1271
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,220
Yeah.

1272
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,140
But does this feel more ... The fact that he's got snacks and stuff.

1273
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,100
That feels more like a Space Age cubicle.

1274
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,100
Yeah.

1275
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,100
That's true.

1276
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,100
It does.

1277
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,100
I could see that going in.

1278
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,060
I'm more likely to say Zizek's than Tony Solaroni.

1279
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,060
Yeah.

1280
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,060
Yes.

1281
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,060
Uh-huh.

1282
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,060
Right.

1283
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,060
Getting some Japan only is good, I think.

1284
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,060
So we're saying maybe Officer Zizek's?

1285
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,060
It could be ...

1286
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,060
Maybe Officer Zizek's.

1287
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,060
Yeah.

1288
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,060
I'm going to put that in the maybe.

1289
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,060
I'll put that high in the maybes.

1290
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,060
Yeah.

1291
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,060
Okay.

1292
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:03,060
Okay.

1293
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,060
Here's maybe an oddball.

1294
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:10,140
It is the Batcave Batman's office.

1295
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,660
Well, you're talking about the Batcave, you're not talking about Bruce Wayne's real office.

1296
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,660
No.

1297
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,660
No.

1298
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,660
Those are two separate things.

1299
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,660
Right.

1300
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:25,780
Now, there's Batman rides all over the world, some more detailed than others.

1301
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,820
That's true.

1302
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:32,620
There are representations of Wayne Manor, and I feel like there's representations of

1303
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,620
the Batcave.

1304
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,180
Uh-huh.

1305
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,780
It's got to be the right ... Now, look, I think something going against it right away

1306
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,380
is that none of us can conjure one of these in our head.

1307
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,380
Yeah.

1308
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,380
It was really great.

1309
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,380
What is even the best Batcave in the world?

1310
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,380
Is the one in Dubai?

1311
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,380
That's a very good question.

1312
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,460
It might be, but then who really knows ...

1313
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,460
Yeah.

1314
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,460
Yeah.

1315
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,460
I don't know.

1316
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,460
Okay.

1317
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,460
Hall of Justice.

1318
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,500
Is the Hall of Justice the Justice League's office?

1319
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Justice League.

1320
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,500
I don't think so.

1321
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,500
Buildings.

1322
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,340
They're that cyborg animatronic.

1323
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,620
That's not an office, though.

1324
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,020
That's more of a receiving room.

1325
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,020
It's a big room.

1326
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,020
It's a big room.

1327
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:15,620
Unless there's ... Unless there's something I don't know about that's Aquaman's desk.

1328
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,060
I want to see Aquaman's coasters.

1329
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,060
Yeah.

1330
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,420
Scott, we would know if there was an Aquaman somewhere.

1331
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,420
Come on, now.

1332
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,420
Yeah.

1333
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,420
I would hope.

1334
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,700
You've dreamed your whole life of seeing Aquaman's desk.

1335
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,180
Aquaman's wet desk.

1336
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,820
You can't be too picky with that wood.

1337
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,820
That's going to work.

1338
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,260
Oh, that wood is getting worked in a week.

1339
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,260
Yeah.

1340
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,260
Let me see.

1341
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,020
Oh, I feel like I had a few ... Oh, oh.

1342
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,940
Now, you know what might be an office?

1343
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,820
You don't really think of this as a ... But there's a desk, and there's a lot of books,

1344
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,140
and I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

1345
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,220
I really got to stare at this ride through again.

1346
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:55,220
I think Bowser has an office in that fortress.

1347
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,220
Oh, interesting.

1348
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,220
Yeah.

1349
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:03,460
The particular video I was watching was so zoomed in and focused on details that I got

1350
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,740
a little bit disoriented.

1351
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:15,980
Again, I try to miss that queue as hardcore as I can if I'm getting on that ride, but

1352
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:21,700
I think everybody agrees that while that ride has a lot of issues, that the queue is pretty

1353
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,340
spectacular, and the parts of the queue are spectacular.

1354
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:30,420
Would that not be an interesting way to honor ... Should we leave this at, we'll discuss

1355
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:37,420
after, but if Bowser's office feels worthy, if we all decree after the fact?

1356
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,860
Yeah, the queue's really good.

1357
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:46,100
I think that one is a good representation of what I was searching for with the Batman

1358
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:51,980
and Justice League, which is I don't think we can eliminate whimsical offices.

1359
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,580
No, they might be ...

1360
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:59,020
Be it officers' ex or Madame Leota.

1361
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,620
We have not really landed, I would say, on a call on Madame Leota.

1362
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,260
Maybe we'll have to hear the whole list, and we should maybe be heading for the door so

1363
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,500
we can actually yay or nay these things.

1364
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:12,180
Maybe some will remain a debate, and then there's the suspense for Fray and I was going

1365
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,860
to strike midnight on Friday, and people will be wondering, God, where did they land on

1366
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,860
H.G. Wells?

1367
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,460
Yeah, of course.

1368
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,260
I hope anybody's able to get some sleep.

1369
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,260
Restless nights.

1370
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,740
Let me add some others.

1371
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,740
I did the YouTube screenshots.

1372
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:33,300
There are definitely offices in Zootopia, in the new Zootopia, or H.G. Pursuit.

1373
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:38,060
Now it's a desk, but it's cartoony desk.

1374
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,380
I'm not sure whose desk we're looking at here.

1375
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,420
It might be the Fox's desk.

1376
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,420
I don't know.

1377
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,420
It is a desk.

1378
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,420
Yeah.

1379
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,420
I don't know if anyone's excited about it.

1380
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,020
I think cubicle counts as desk.

1381
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,020
Certainly desk.

1382
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,980
Certainly, I'll say office and put it on the maybe for sure.

1383
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:58,980
Yeah.

1384
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,980
It might just get bumped due to unfamiliarity.

1385
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:01,980
I don't know.

1386
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,980
Yeah.

1387
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:08,140
I mean, Zootopia is so much of like a mundane life, so there's so much-

1388
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,140
True.

1389
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,060
It could just be disadvantaged in that regard.

1390
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,060
Right.

1391
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,780
Less whimsy in some ways, even though it's animals.

1392
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,500
Is there an office in Mystic Manor?

1393
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,500
Oh.

1394
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,500
Ooh.

1395
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,500
I think there is.

1396
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,500
I think there is.

1397
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,500
I believe so.

1398
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,540
Well, then I'm going to have to put that in the file of need more information, because

1399
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,620
I'm sure whatever it is is very cool.

1400
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:35,460
I just don't want to make you the listener sit here while we flip through ride videos.

1401
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,380
That's a very good thing to consider.

1402
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,420
This is also a little bit tough to ... I'm just showing you a YouTube thumbnail.

1403
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,660
Ghost Town Alive, Knott's Berry Farm.

1404
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:51,380
That's a whole other genre of office is the old west office, the office showing you what

1405
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,540
offices used to be like in the past.

1406
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,540
Right.

1407
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,540
Hmm.

1408
00:59:55,540 --> 01:00:00,500
I'd have to really get a good look at it, but I think you want diversity here, right?

1409
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,980
You don't want all modern offices.

1410
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:02,980
You want a mix.

1411
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,980
You want comic book offices going up against old west offices.

1412
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:06,980
Yeah.

1413
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,980
Wouldn't that be fun?

1414
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:16,340
Whimsical animal office versus simulation of office of the long ago past.

1415
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,340
Right.

1416
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:23,900
I feel like ... Are there any offices in ... I was trying to think if there are office representations

1417
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,340
in any restaurants out there.

1418
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:30,100
Are there anything where this room is meant to be an office?

1419
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,180
For example, is there an office somewhere in Skipper Canteen?

1420
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:36,500
A lot of rooms in Magic Kingdom.

1421
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,340
Is the secret room, is that a secret office?

1422
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,340
That's a good question.

1423
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,820
It's a lot more in the den study kind of area.

1424
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:44,820
Right.

1425
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:45,820
I'm not really sure.

1426
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,620
I don't know the rooms well enough.

1427
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,620
Yeah.

1428
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,340
Well, like see stuff, like see society exploring adventures.

1429
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,340
Yeah.

1430
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:57,100
I was also looking around Tokyo, see stuff, and I didn't really see anything.

1431
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,100
Are there any offices in Pirates of the Caribbean?

1432
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:05,060
Like are any of those places where the skeletons are kind of offices?

1433
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,060
I don't think so.

1434
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,620
I just thought I'd ask the question.

1435
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:16,540
Again, I would have to look, but Confisco Grill at Islands of Adventure at the end of

1436
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:23,100
Port of Entry, it shares a lot of whimsical qualities with Port of Entry, and there's

1437
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:27,940
representations and artifacts from many of the islands.

1438
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:32,660
Is Confisco's office in there?

1439
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:35,740
I know you want it bad, but you really ... We can't.

1440
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:38,100
We have to be honest here.

1441
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,100
I know.

1442
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,100
We'll have to look into it.

1443
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:44,460
So we're going to have to make a separate list that's like the to look into, to look

1444
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:45,460
into it very strongly.

1445
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,460
Right, right.

1446
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,500
Because yeah, some of these are just ... There's so many things and some things you haven't

1447
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,180
even considered before we start recording.

1448
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:51,180
Yes.

1449
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,180
Yeah.

1450
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,180
If you go, oh shoot.

1451
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,180
Does Dr. Doom have an office on his Fearfall?

1452
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,180
You are ...

1453
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,180
He might.

1454
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,180
He might.

1455
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,740
You are in a Latvarian embassy.

1456
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:02,740
Right, but he should have an office in there, right?

1457
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:04,740
So there should be offices.

1458
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:05,740
Yeah.

1459
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:12,140
Because there's some fun stuff in that queue, short, but perhaps we had to look into that.

1460
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,140
Yeah.

1461
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,860
I might be getting to the end of my questions.

1462
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:21,260
I think I'm getting close to ... Let me make sure I'm not missing ... Oh, oh.

1463
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:24,140
Maybe one big question here.

1464
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:32,460
Would we ever consider including a fake recreation of the Oval Office?

1465
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:37,900
These exist in presidential libraries across this country, and I've been to a number of

1466
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:38,900
them.

1467
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:43,540
I've been to the George W. Bush Presidential Library, and I liked that you're in that Oval

1468
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:50,400
Office, and it has a view of a nearby Twin Peaks, the sexy restaurant.

1469
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,500
You can see that from the window of Bush's Oval Office.

1470
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,740
There's also a Reagan Oval Office in the Reagan Presidential Library.

1471
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,780
Sorry, where is the George W. Bush?

1472
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,740
It's in Dallas, Texas.

1473
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:09,780
But the Twin Peaks ... When you look out the window, you can see a sign for Twin Peaks,

1474
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,140
the sexy restaurant.

1475
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

1476
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:19,820
I was thinking about the Double R Diner of the city of Twin Peaks, the town of Twin Peaks.

1477
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:20,820
Oh, no, no, no.

1478
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,420
I mean ... No, you're talking dirty restaurant chicken.

1479
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,420
Yes, that's right.

1480
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,420
They call them restaurants.

1481
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,420
Restaurants.

1482
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,420
That's a good term.

1483
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,420
I forgot that term.

1484
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:29,420
Yes, indeed.

1485
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,420
Yes, that's what they call them.

1486
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,060
Yeah, I'm trying to remember.

1487
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:41,620
I think there may be a fake Oval Office in ... Maybe there's an LBJ Presidential Library.

1488
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:45,060
Would we ever have one ... I think we could pick one of the bat.

1489
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,380
Off mic, we'll figure out the best fake Oval Office.

1490
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,380
The best fake Oval Office.

1491
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,380
Oh, okay.

1492
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,380
It looks like ... That could go in there.

1493
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,380
It looks like Nixon.

1494
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,380
It looks like LBJ.

1495
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,380
Reagan.

1496
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,380
Carter.

1497
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:55,380
Reagan.

1498
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,380
Yeah.

1499
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:57,380
Truman.

1500
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:59,340
A lot of them have.

1501
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,340
George H.W. Bush.

1502
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,340
George W. Bush.

1503
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,340
Clinton.

1504
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:07,100
There's so many, but how do you begin to determine which one's the best?

1505
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:13,060
I might say the best one would be how many restaurants can you see from the window, but

1506
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,660
there's a lot of criteria.

1507
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:18,060
Conservative pollster Frank Luntz has an Oval Office in his house.

1508
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,060
What?

1509
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,060
Yep.

1510
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,060
Look it up.

1511
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,060
Yep.

1512
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,060
It's big, too.

1513
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,060
That's so dumb.

1514
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,060
Yeah.

1515
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,740
Sometimes.

1516
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:30,300
Well, I kind of want to go with that one.

1517
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:34,300
Maybe that's ... Frank Luntz's Oval Office in his house.

1518
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:38,340
Frank Luntz's ... Frank Luntz, here he is with his Oval Office in his house.

1519
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,340
The picture.

1520
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,340
Here, he's recreated the Oval Office.

1521
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,340
Oh, it's that.

1522
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,340
It's definitely that.

1523
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:44,340
Okay.

1524
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:48,700
It's Frank Conservative pollster Frank Luntz's Oval Office.

1525
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,700
Wow.

1526
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,700
Yeah.

1527
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:51,700
And it's okay.

1528
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,980
He's modeled after Kennedy, but the phones are from the LBJ administration.

1529
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,980
This is probably the best of all.

1530
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:02,620
Sometimes I worry I say too many things out of left field, but Mike, you might be running

1531
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:09,660
in the ... in the lead for the most absurd thing said in 2025 on the show.

1532
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,660
I'm surprised.

1533
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:17,060
Frank Luntz has a recreation of the Oval Office, conservative pundit pollster.

1534
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:21,260
I don't know anything about Frank Luntz, and therefore, please, listener, consider it.

1535
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:26,980
I'm not ... I could not be giving praise to Frank Luntz because I don't know anything

1536
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:27,980
about him.

1537
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:31,420
If he's a conservative pollster, I probably don't like this guy or agree with this guy.

1538
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:35,180
However, as I flip through this article, he's got a lot going on in his house.

1539
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:41,060
Frank's newsstand is ... he has a full fake newsstand with like old Sports Illustrated

1540
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:42,340
TV guides.

1541
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:50,860
He has a big 70s TV network style TV schedule, but that just lists his favorite shows.

1542
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:51,860
You know what I mean?

1543
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:55,220
If you're watching The Late Shift or something, and you see executives putting the show ... like

1544
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:58,340
what's going to be on at 8 p.m. and what's going to be on ... so he just has this thing

1545
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,420
that's just all his favorite shows.

1546
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,420
Happy days.

1547
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,420
Jason would have that.

1548
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,420
American Idol.

1549
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:07,620
Marlowe's Place made the cut.

1550
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:15,180
Barbra Streisand's fake basement mall gets all the press, but Frank Luntz's recreation

1551
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,780
of Americana offices are ...

1552
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,220
Well, and you know it's real too.

1553
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:24,100
There's still a lot of debate about the Streisand mall, but this we know is a real ... here

1554
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,100
I'm looking at it.

1555
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:30,060
I'm looking at the real baseball mitt used by Robert Redford in The Natural.

1556
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,060
Did you not find the weird ...

1557
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,060
Wait a minute.

1558
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:33,060
Oh my God.

1559
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,060
The next one I clicked on ...

1560
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,060
The weirdest thing he has there?

1561
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,560
Well, this isn't the weirdest, but it's the most exciting for me.

1562
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,060
It's the equalizer that recorded pet sounds.

1563
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,020
Oh, I didn't know you had that.

1564
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,020
Oh my God.

1565
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:43,980
You always know what they ran pet sounds through.

1566
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:44,980
That's nuts.

1567
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:49,260
That's a Portlandia sketch of all these items and environments in the studio.

1568
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,860
They use this on pet sounds.

1569
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,260
They use this guitar stand on pet sounds.

1570
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,700
What's the weirdest thing, Mike?

1571
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,100
I got to know.

1572
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:00,860
Hanging in the bathroom next to the Oval Office is a version of the infamous blue dress worn

1573
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:01,860
by Monica Lewinsky.

1574
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:02,860
Oh, what the fuck?

1575
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,860
Out of his fucking mind, this guy is.

1576
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:05,860
What?

1577
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:06,860
Yeah, I don't know.

1578
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:10,980
A recreate, just the exact type of the dress?

1579
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:11,980
I guess.

1580
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,420
What the fuck?

1581
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:20,100
And he owns a pinata that is supposed to be Hillary Clinton.

1582
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,100
And he owns ...

1583
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,100
Oh, and a Trump.

1584
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,100
And a Trump.

1585
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,100
And a Trump.

1586
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,100
Both sides.

1587
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:31,100
And he owns the dress, but he won't tell us if it's black and blue or white and gold.

1588
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,940
He's got a diner too.

1589
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:34,940
Frank's diner.

1590
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:38,140
There's so much ... What the fuck is this house?

1591
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,140
I don't know.

1592
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,140
We got a lot more to ...

1593
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,140
I guess it's its own ...

1594
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,140
He has a Lincoln bedroom in there?

1595
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,220
It's its own episode now that we're really digging in.

1596
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,220
Frank Luntz's house.

1597
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,220
Yeah.

1598
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,220
I'm going to go ahead and ...

1599
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,220
Well, I'm locking in Frank Luntz's house.

1600
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,220
That's his picture.

1601
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:57,260
I'm going to go ahead and say this all is maybe a little weirder than avocado toaster

1602
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,260
dyeing your hair blue.

1603
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,260
No, what are you talking about?

1604
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,260
That thing clouded on lefties and young people.

1605
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,860
This normal conservative man who wants to be looking at Monica Lewinsky's dress every

1606
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:08,100
day he wakes up.

1607
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,700
Nothing wrong with that at all.

1608
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,700
Nothing strange at all.

1609
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:15,940
I am going to start making a list here.

1610
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:21,180
We can say yay or nay, but it's something ... I believe that we now have ... I'm going

1611
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,820
to say here's what I believe are the locks.

1612
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:30,220
There's ones that I think we're going to say are locks, but I want to check and be sure

1613
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:32,180
because there were seven that I addressed earlier.

1614
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,740
You want to just go through them quick here?

1615
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:34,740
Yeah.

1616
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,740
All right.

1617
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:36,740
Indiana Jones.

1618
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,740
Yes.

1619
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:38,740
Or just tell me if you disagree with any of these.

1620
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,340
Indiana Jones, men in black, Tiana Spider-Man.

1621
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,340
All in.

1622
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:43,340
All in, yeah.

1623
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:46,500
Expedition Everest, Jungle Cruise, Guardian Collector's Office.

1624
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,740
All in, yeah.

1625
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:53,060
Maybe this we need to look at actually, Treehouse Office.

1626
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:55,060
I think it's in.

1627
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,860
I just don't know the office.

1628
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:57,860
You can look it up.

1629
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,140
I'm just saying I believe it's in.

1630
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:01,220
I want to settle on which one.

1631
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,220
I agree.

1632
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,220
Yes.

1633
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,220
Yeah.

1634
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,220
Okay.

1635
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,220
I will say requires discussion.

1636
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:07,220
Off air.

1637
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,700
Sorry listeners, you don't get to hear everything.

1638
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:15,820
Sometimes we need privacy, like when we go to our little Lincoln bedrooms to have private

1639
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,140
time with our Lewinsky dresses.

1640
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,140
Right.

1641
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:22,140
Badger's Office from Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

1642
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,140
I'll say yes.

1643
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:25,140
Yeah.

1644
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,140
We're at 10?

1645
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,220
No, not yet.

1646
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:32,460
If I'm moving that up, that takes us to eight.

1647
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,460
Animation Academy.

1648
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,860
Doesn't feel like we're sure.

1649
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,860
Yeah, I'm not sure.

1650
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,060
Journey to the Center of the Earth.

1651
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,060
Yes.

1652
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,060
Okay.

1653
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,060
I don't know.

1654
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,060
Jason?

1655
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,060
I got to say it.

1656
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,060
You got to say it?

1657
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,060
It seems like you guys are both on board.

1658
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,500
Well, requires discussion I think.

1659
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,140
Look, as I said, we don't have to solve this all.

1660
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,700
Mickey Mouse's Den.

1661
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,140
Yes.

1662
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,140
Minnie Mouse's Office.

1663
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,140
Of course.

1664
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,140
Yes.

1665
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,140
Okay.

1666
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,140
They're both in.

1667
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,140
They're both in.

1668
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,140
Have to be.

1669
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,140
All right.

1670
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:04,140
I don't know that.

1671
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,140
I want to put them head to head though.

1672
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,140
Well, that's a whole other thing too.

1673
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,140
That's a whole other thing.

1674
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,140
Yeah.

1675
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:15,460
The lunch also has Colonel Clink's uniform from Hogan's Heroes.

1676
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,700
Bluto's Office from the Popeye.

1677
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,700
Yes.

1678
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,700
Okay.

1679
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,700
The heartiest yes from Jason.

1680
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:22,700
Yes.

1681
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,980
At some point though, we can say yes all day, but we may have to bump.

1682
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,980
Well, we'll see.

1683
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,980
Spaceship Earth Cool Girl Office.

1684
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:32,980
Okay.

1685
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:33,980
Yeah.

1686
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:34,980
Let's see.

1687
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,980
H.G.

1688
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:36,980
Wells Office.

1689
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:37,980
Yes.

1690
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:39,820
Yes.

1691
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:40,820
That was very whimsical.

1692
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:41,820
All right.

1693
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:42,820
That's it.

1694
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:43,820
Okay.

1695
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:44,820
And finally, Frank Luntz's Oval Office.

1696
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:45,820
Of course.

1697
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:46,820
Might be number one.

1698
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,820
Oh, shit.

1699
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:48,820
We've got a winner.

1700
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:49,820
Oh, no.

1701
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:50,820
No.

1702
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:51,820
I was against.

1703
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:55,620
I was saying keep it in your pants until now.

1704
01:10:55,620 --> 01:11:01,100
Now I am allowing being really excited about Frank Luntz's house.

1705
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,340
Okay.

1706
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,380
So now I'm going to move to here.

1707
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,660
See, it's going to get a little dicey here.

1708
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:12,980
Now we have to really decide is Flight of Passage in office or not.

1709
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:16,340
Because we still have those Requires Discussions.

1710
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:19,980
Do we by default have to move these to the Requires Discussion category?

1711
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:22,980
Flight of Passage.

1712
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,980
Yes.

1713
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:25,980
But are we saying in?

1714
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,620
Because at some point, they can't all be in.

1715
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:30,900
Well, we'll have to do that off.

1716
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,980
It can be in in the mass list, the big list.

1717
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,980
Okay.

1718
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:36,580
That's going to Requires Discussion.

1719
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,580
Sorry, guys.

1720
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:38,580
I've got to keep going.

1721
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:39,580
I've got to wrap it up soon.

1722
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:40,580
Okay.

1723
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:41,580
Okay.

1724
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,580
Yeah.

1725
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:43,580
Sorry.

1726
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,580
Okay.

1727
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:45,580
Okay.

1728
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:46,580
Bowser.

1729
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:47,580
Yes.

1730
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:48,580
Okay.

1731
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:49,580
Zootopia.

1732
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,580
I say no.

1733
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,580
I say out.

1734
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:52,580
Mystic Manor.

1735
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,580
Got to look into it.

1736
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,580
Got to look into it.

1737
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,580
Yeah.

1738
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,580
Look into it.

1739
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,580
Okay.

1740
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,580
Officer Zizek's Felt on the Fence.

1741
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,580
Discussion.

1742
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,580
I would say yes.

1743
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,580
Okay.

1744
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:03,580
Let's see.

1745
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,580
First Town Alive.

1746
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:05,580
Sheriff's Office.

1747
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,820
I think that's in.

1748
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:08,820
I think it's in.

1749
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,820
Okay.

1750
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:10,820
Zootopia out.

1751
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:11,820
Walt's Office.

1752
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:12,820
I think that's out.

1753
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:13,820
I think that's out.

1754
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:14,820
Out, yeah.

1755
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:15,820
Transformers Office.

1756
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:16,820
You fly through.

1757
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:17,820
I think out.

1758
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:18,820
Out.

1759
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,820
I think it's too competitive for Muppet Security Office.

1760
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:22,820
Yeah.

1761
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:23,820
I'm comfortable with that.

1762
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:24,820
It's just not big enough.

1763
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:25,820
It's not big enough.

1764
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:29,300
Or we have to settle on Muppet Zizek's.

1765
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,380
Is there another security?

1766
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,380
Sheriff's Office, maybe.

1767
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,380
I think it's too competitive.

1768
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,180
I don't think we can consider these.

1769
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,180
It's just one security office.

1770
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,180
Yeah.

1771
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,180
I think we have to be hard-lined at some point.

1772
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,180
Yeah.

1773
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,180
Right.

1774
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,180
Dinosaur Lab.

1775
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:43,180
Yeah.

1776
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:44,180
Yeah.

1777
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:46,380
And finally, maybe a good place to end.

1778
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:51,420
Is Madame Leota's chamber an office?

1779
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:55,500
I think maybe it worked better as a discussion point to get the ball rolling.

1780
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
Okay.

1781
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,940
Well, that's very gentlemanly of you to withdraw.

1782
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,940
Thank you.

1783
01:12:58,940 --> 01:12:59,940
Yeah.

1784
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:00,940
Yeah.

1785
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,860
I think it's too competitive once we sat down and looked at options.

1786
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:04,860
Okay.

1787
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,180
Well, then we've got a number of locks.

1788
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:12,140
I think there are 12 official locks, and then we might have to play with the final few.

1789
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:13,140
Yeah.

1790
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,940
But I think we're at a good point.

1791
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:18,180
I guess the big thing then is, I don't know how to pair them up.

1792
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,180
No.

1793
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:22,540
That's a little bit of a tough thing, because we have paired them thematically before.

1794
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:23,540
Yeah.

1795
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:27,620
But is it randomized?

1796
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:32,860
Do you go through the entire conference that is Little Makeshift Offices and Adventure

1797
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:33,860
Rides?

1798
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:34,860
Or do you?

1799
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:35,860
I'm not sure.

1800
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:36,860
I don't know.

1801
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,860
Might have to offline?

1802
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:38,860
I think we have to offline it.

1803
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:39,860
Might have to sleep on it.

1804
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:40,860
Okay.

1805
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:41,860
Well, yes.

1806
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:45,980
Look, we still, I think, have the right to stare at this thing to consider it carefully.

1807
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:46,980
Yeah.

1808
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:49,180
But I hope that you enjoyed a little bit of this peek into our process.

1809
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:50,180
Sure.

1810
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,380
Kind of like hanging out in our office, right?

1811
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:53,380
Hey, yeah.

1812
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,380
How do you do it?

1813
01:13:54,380 --> 01:14:00,580
I'm excited to see, off, Mike, which of us will be the first to text on the group chat,

1814
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,060
the group text.

1815
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:06,580
I had a thought, or I think this is out, or I think this should be it.

1816
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:07,580
All right.

1817
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,580
Okay.

1818
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:09,580
And should we be transparent and release all of these notes?

1819
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:14,580
Or just make them available for public record, like you would in a presidential library.

1820
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:15,580
To be able to board the public.

1821
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:16,580
Yeah.

1822
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:17,580
Sure.

1823
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:18,580
We'll see.

1824
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,580
We'll see.

1825
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,580
I don't know.

1826
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,580
I'm not really a Frank Luntz type.

1827
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,580
In the fairytale, too.

1828
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,580
In the oval.

1829
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:24,580
His fake oval office.

1830
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:26,280
That's not interesting to me though.

1831
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,120
What I want is a wax figure of Jimmy Karn.

1832
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,680
Oh my God, that would be even better.

1833
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:34,140
That he had specially made and that he dresses up in Monica Lewinsky's dress.

1834
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,340
Yeah.

1835
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:40,320
Like that painting in one of the Epstein properties of Clinton in the dress.

1836
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,320
Did that really?

1837
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,320
Yeah, that's a whole thing.

1838
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,320
Oh, yeah, that whole thing.

1839
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,320
We don't have time.

1840
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,320
It's at the ranch.

1841
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,320
We don't have time.

1842
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,320
Yeah, yeah, no.

1843
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,180
We'll do the- we'll review the island later.

1844
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:51,180

Hey, join us on Friday for the big show.

1851
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:07,220
Buckle up, grab a beer or two, unless we're against that.

1852
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,540
It seems like the kind of thing we might be

1853
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,900
against people drinking while they listen.

1854
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,420
That seems like the kind of period and shit

1855
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,580
one of us would have a problem with.

1856
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,380
Not my business.

1857
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,420
All right, nevermind, all right.

1858
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,820
My business, though.

1859
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:17,660
Actually, I agree.

1860
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:18,480
No, no drinking.

1861
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,320
Listen sober.
