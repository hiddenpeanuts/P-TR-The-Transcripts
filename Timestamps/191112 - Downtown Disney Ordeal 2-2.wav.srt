1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil is its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried donut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, What secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Police, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, you will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of them all.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We have 15 daily very necessary episodes and what's to do so.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic or boring.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, The Downtown Disney ordeal level 2, stage 2, day 5, is that correct?

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, it has to be correct.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, you've been with, we're back in another one of those grooves, you and I, the audience and us, I mean.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You've been hearing us for a lot of days in a row.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I hope you've enjoyed the inbox overloading and we're going to keep on blasting.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My name is Scott Garen here joined by Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's, I don't know, let's get to it.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I guess we can, yes, no fun banter up top.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's just get to the thing, let's just get through, let's help.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's not waste time with a bunch of stuff that isn't really anything.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, and it won't happen during the episode.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's just be all business.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All business today, that's what we've decided for today's episode.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And not me, Andrew.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In the service of that, let's summon the Sector Keeper for one quick sec and then he'll go back to whatever no good shit he's doing.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sector Keeper, where are we heading today?

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Boys, boys, today's stage contains the Disney Dress Shop, Marzaline's Confectionary, and Catall Restaurant.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Good luck, boys.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay, thus we have landed at the Disney Dress Shop.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Gentlemen, let's talk dresses.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And you, I think you said, because look, I looked around.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You made a point.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You made a point to go and you'll tell us what happened with that.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But other than that, like this is a fun place where you can buy a dress, a Disney inspired dress.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Some not inspired necessarily.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Some aren't inspired.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Some are not as inspired as others is all I'm going to say.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It is an official Disney store that feels like they're trying to make a buck on Disney bounding, which is dressing like in the style of Disney characters, but not wearing a costume, which you cannot do.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And also trying to make a little bit of a buck off the, you know, the mod cloth style of vintage inspired.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A little, yeah, pin up the burlesque isn't the right word, but it's like, it's all there's a retro.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I looked at the mod cloth website and read about the company a little.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm like, they started selling actual vintage stuff and then they switched to quote vintage inspired stuff.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You can even shop by debt like 50s, 60s, 70s through now.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I see.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Right.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So all retro flair.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's all big skirts and collars.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I mean, you know, we're not going to, we're not wearing these.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And I don't think that I think, you know, we probably have a lot of listeners who would wear stuff from this, from this place.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't think this would be, I don't think this is Lindsay style.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't think this is Aaron's style.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hmm.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, probably not.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I think that, yeah, I don't think the bounding specifically, I think you have to be a specific type of fan to be more into it.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think maybe the style of dress you would wear.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't want to speak for her, but I assume the style of dress, but maybe not the Bo Peep jumpsuit and convertible skirt.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't think Aaron would wear a dress with every Toy Story character on it.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And it's not knocking if you want.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm just saying, yes, I think you're right in regards to that type of thing.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think the orange bird dress is kind of cute.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I wrote down orange.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think that one is oddly more like the sort of like the what is that nature of orange bird?

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The fact that it's like a little bit of a deeper reference and it could just be some odd pattern.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, it could be kitsch.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's very it's funny to me because orange bird is a Magic Kingdom specific character specific to one kind of specific to one quick service dessert place.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That also acted as a promotional item for like the Florida orange growers and stuff, but it has taken on a life of his own.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And like I have bought an orange bird button on Main Street in Disneyland.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So it does show up in the or they have orange bird like kitchen stuff or pillows.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I feel like shows up in orange bird merchant stuff.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And that's that's that's all cool.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Embrace of orange bird is cool.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Like the haunted they have this haunted mansion.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't know if this is all the same stuff they have in there, but they have this haunted mansion dress.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I feel like that's kind of cool.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Just maybe a bit limited in where you're going to wear it.

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is it the wallpaper?

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, I feel like that's it's truly where it's like buying clothes to wear in the parks.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, I guess it is really sort of for that life.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So in the park, obviously it fits.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But like, yeah, this is a hot more of a Halloween time thing in general.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So you can wear it to like Halloween parties.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't know if somebody's probably mad at me and say, you can wear this year round.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We wear like Epcot or country bear shirts.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes. And this is also the maybe hypocritical nature of what I'm saying even is because like I'm wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt right now.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And it's like, well, just because I'm not willing to wear his little red shorts, you think you're so much better like that.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So I agree that, oh, please don't start wearing Mickey shorts.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mickey's little.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
In three months, you've justified.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I like them.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I like the Mickey shorts.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Counterpoint, please start wearing Mickey's little red shorts.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You once played Mickey in a comedy show and you did not wear his little red shorts.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And I said, why are you not wearing his little red shorts?

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And you like, I didn't even think about it.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, no.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Do you said little every one of these times?

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No, it's a comedy podcast.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Supposedly.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's really more about rantings and ravings.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But lately, yeah, well, this whole thing.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, boy.

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What we're doing here is a whole different story.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We're going to be ranting and raving on the street by the end of this.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So if you do have the Bo Peep jumpsuit, that's fine.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I have 20 Mickey shirts.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I have so many Mickey shirts.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Bo Peep jumpsuit, that does feel like smart tie in.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Because he's wearing a jumpsuit in the movie kind of thing.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It looks exactly like your costume.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And jumpsuits are in fashion now.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I like, I didn't see this in the store.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I see it on the website, though.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Did they have this hat box ghost satchel?

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Ooh.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Because I think this is cool as shit.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I like that a lot.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, that's all we should say.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I guess there's other stuff.

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
There's purses and backpacks and some very expensive items.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It almost feels like it's easier to get away with kind of more novelty accessory

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
than having the main item be.

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, I don't know if that's just my sort of insecurity or not.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, but I know what you're saying.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I've actually never been the one to cosplay at.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I've gone to many a convention in my life, but I've never really wanted to cosplay.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But it does feel like I would carry a hat box ghost bag with me.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Sure, yeah.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's fun.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Maybe it's like, maybe I'm describing an unwillingness to dive into the water.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Maybe just pins and accessories as opposed to just going full tilt.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What clothes relate to the obsession and you own it and you work it?

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, I guess maybe the clothes, if I were to wear the clothes,

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
it would be reminding me of like I'm trying to pretend I'm still normal,

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
a normal person with white clothes, like shorts that don't have Mickey's face on it.

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't own any shorts that have Mickey.

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't have any shorts with big white buttons.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Not yet.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And on my socks, undergarments, no Disney, any of that.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's all.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm wearing Spider-Man socks as we record.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He's a Disney prince.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh my gosh.

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes, he is again.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah, well, and also I think I would feel, you know,

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I love the Epcot aesthetic to an extent that's been described as fetishy.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If I was dating someone who wore on their own volition

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
or insisted on wearing a dress with the spaceship Earth pattern,

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I think that might be a little beyond the pale.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I was going to say you'd be very excited, honestly.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't know. I think that's a bit much.

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think it would depend on what it looked like, honestly.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I think that dress does exist. That's why I'm saying it.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right, so you're saying that specific one.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That actually feels like pretty kind of given to me because it is a pattern.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's like a geodesic pattern.

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And I feel like I've seen it like even in non Disney stuff.

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But you can't deny that that would be the point where people knowing that I dig Epcot

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and then like I show up with some arm candy wearing the spaceship Earth pattern.

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's the point where somebody goes, oh, all right.

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I guess I guess if people knew, oh, I see it.

176
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You see, it's interesting because I wonder if people would even know that dress is spaceship Earth.

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Unless like if unless they were a nerd, they might show up.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I think it's interesting. This is what you're talking about, right?

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, I think so.

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, I don't know. It's subtle enough.

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I guess if you frame it in that way that it was like, you know, Scott's spaceship Earth thing has gone a little too far.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Does he want to have sex with the ball?

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, I guess that that framing of it would make sense.

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But honestly, if you were just an average Disney fan who wasn't obsessed with the ball

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and you had and you were with a lady who had that dress on,

186
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
then perhaps it would be fine, honestly.

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Now, if I made somebody wear the full a full like cloth ball, if you were no face, Jimmy Stewart and Vertigo sitting in with Kim Novak in front of like the hairdresser

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and you were like, oh, make her the ball. You got to make her look like the ball.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
More silver and like you were losing your mind.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We go to a hair salon and then it becomes that hair isn't even in the picture.

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes. Cover the hair, the hair up.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's why I make it a geodesic sphere.

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That foil you put on when you were dying her hair. Put the foil back.

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You just go all the way around.

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Scott, you just love the ball. You don't love me.

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Shut up. Cover her mouth.

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, that would be.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I wish you were full of scenes about the history of communication and later storytelling.

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, that's a that's an issue.

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
All right, so I'll try to avoid this.

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't I don't think I will. Now, that being said, look, if we were all being brave, we all should have put on a Disney dress.

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's clearly what we should have done.

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't think anyone did it. I would have tried. Sure.

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Could have been done. Probably would have made for a fun photograph.

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, I feel like I'm so hard to shop for menswear in general with my proportions, let alone women's wear.

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No. So so look, we didn't cover that base.

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I did go into the Disney dress shop with my wife, Erin.

208
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Are there things in this store that she could wear and pull off?

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Absolutely. Sure.

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They even, you know, a dress with Mrs. Potts' face on it is a lot of fun.

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't think I could see her wearing it on the town.

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I just go to go to a movie, go to the art house. But we wanted to pick something that is the thing that she would the least wear.

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Right. And I we definitely found it after some consideration.

214
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It is very much the case that Erin would never go out in public dressed fully as Red the Pirate.

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, interesting. There's no world in which.

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It feels complicated. I thought it was going to be Sally from Nightmare Before Christmas rag dress.

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That feels like a lot. Also not up there in Sally.

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That that makes the Epcot dress look more subtle.

219
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Like, if you consider that, your other option is pirate dress or rag dress.

220
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Does the pirate dress come with the hat? I don't know if it comes with the hat, but there is a hat.

221
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Right. It might be a separate. I'm sure it's a separate buy, but there's a hat.

222
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And Erin put on the hat. And I think the hat is the point of no return because I have a picture now.

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The clothing is certainly something that Erin would not wear.

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But there is no universe in which Erin goes out in a three corner hat with a feather on.

225
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And one of her taxation is theft rams.

226
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Now, she does, of course, you know, she'll she'll refer to us all in a hearty way as boys whenever we're together.

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But otherwise does not embody the spirit of red.

228
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Come on, boys, to the wine bar.

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm going to show you a photograph of Erin in red clothing.

230
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't think I've ever seen her so humiliated in my life.

231
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The biggest pout that's a tiny hat. Honestly, very small.

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's the problem is the hat is too small. That's the problem.

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's the only problem. Well, wait, I don't know.

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I think if you ditch the hat, it just kind of looks like a dress you would wear to a casual wedding.

235
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Like a summer wedding. It is like a corset with a but with a big tie.

236
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's like a shoelace. I can't really see. I'm looking at it.

237
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I didn't see the corset. It's this thing. Yes, that's correct.

238
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
With the kind of like multiple skirts. I think I think also I.

239
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Is there a pose where she tried to be like, see, like she was summoning everybody

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
like when Red says they want the rum, the men want the rum.

241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't think she had it in her. She didn't want to do.

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I think wearing it crushed her spirits. I think the hat 80 did 80 percent of the crushing hat should be.

243
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Here's the red walk around performer. The hat needs to be at least this big.

244
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're right. She has a big hat because the tiny hat looks funnier.

245
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Honestly. Yeah, no one should wear a tiny hat.

246
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The tiny hat with it. I totally agree. Looks really funny.

247
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
If she had the big hat, I don't think I think it would have been worlds better

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
because the tiny hat makes it look like you're a little doll or something.

249
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The tiny hat. I don't know. It just it looks makes it more precious.

250
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It looks too far to me. You've been you've been trapped by some some like demented

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
toy maker who's turning people into toys. The Indian in the cupboard or something.

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Like it's a doll. You're a little doll. And then you've been frozen.

253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So I can't make a lot of fashion statements in a sweeping way, but tiny tricorder hats out with tiny figures.

254
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, for sure. Nature of fashion.

255
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I do feel like, you know, that kind of string tie bodice like does come back into style every now.

256
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Thinking about like red carpet photos or like going out trends of like the early 2000s, late 90s and stuff.

257
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I feel like that does pop up every now and then.

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Does it have skulls? Does it have skulls on the bottom? Is that right?

259
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I mean, the skulls. Yeah, that kind of pushes it.

260
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Some skulls and some like black and white drawings of red.

261
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's also with this one specifically, this does feel like you're going to be maybe it's more appropriate at a Ren Fair.

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Certainly, yes. That's what it seems to Ren Fair people.

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The line between inspired and costume is very thin, like inspired by that.

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I drew my inspiration for my outfit from this and very first this.

265
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I am wearing a costume of this can be very thin.

266
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And I think the Disney dress shop, though it is in that Disney bound area and they aren't costed, they do still feel costumey to me.

267
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And my recommendation to anybody interested in Disney bounding is try doing it on your own because it's going to be cheaper.

268
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's going to be more creative. You know, do a thrift store run and try to like it because if you can like represent the character with stuff you found

269
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and not just fork over a bunch of money into the Disney dress shop, I think that's more fun and you'll get a more individualistic wardrobe.

270
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That is my yeah, because I do think the Disney bounding thing was a fan created thing and a fan driven thing.

271
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And this is very much feels like the company trying to make money off the fan driven thing compared to like when Mike and I were down there once.

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And there was like the dapper days convention.

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's all just like fan or fan affiliated companies selling to other fans like that feels better to me.

274
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That feels like people taking ownership of something. Yeah.

275
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The positive. You don't like the corporate involvement with Disney bounding now that they're sort of making their money on it.

276
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't know. I think I think it's kind of yeah, it gets a little dicey because yeah, they're they're jacking up the prices.

277
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Sure, of course. I don't know. I do think it's more fun when yeah, when you piece it together from thrift shop or people sewing their own stuff.

278
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm always impressed by that. I have no skill in like clothing creation.

279
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you think I'm trying to think of like a Disney bounding thing I would do because I'm looking through it now.

280
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
John Stamos wife, who her name is escaping me at the moment is a pretty notable Instagram Disney bounder.

281
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
He has Disney bounded as Prince Eric. Have you seen these photos? No, no.

282
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
He's just wearing sort of an open white dress shirt and blue pants and a red belt. Yeah.

283
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So is that all right? It looks all right. You wouldn't know exactly what he's doing, but obviously in the context of Disney that they're having fun.

284
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And he's yeah, the shirt is a little, of course, too open for what I would be wearing, but I could see wearing an outfit similar to this and not and being OK.

285
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't know that I'm going to do it, but I'm just saying you brought up your chest issue, Jason. I think that's my issue.

286
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't think I have the chest to pull off Eric. Yeah, I say I'm not I am not, you know, I'm no I'm no Gaston.

287
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't think I could be a Jack. Caitlin is John's wife's name. Caitlin McHugh Stamos.

288
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I think one of the things when I said the corporate kind of co-opting of it is like we've been to Comic Con for we've gone to Comic Con a lot.

289
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Mike and I Mike even more than I have. But like probably in 10 years, the shift of like, hey, fans, check out fan of central.

290
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Like it's like, man, we're just a home for fans. This is where the fans come. This is for real fans. It's all the branding.

291
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And we see Universal Comcast, Shine Heart, Wake Company, you know, we're owned.

292
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We are owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. So like, do not do your fandom in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

293
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But like this is where we get our money from, as opposed to like clubs and like Comic Con was like in the very early days, very DIY and then fan or reader driven.

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes. And now all these corporations have figured out how to exploit the fan to its fullest by creating the fan community and cultivating it and monetizing it.

295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And emailing every other day. It's like, hey, it's Legion of Fans and we got the new we got that hot tip on the Jade, Sila, Bob, Reboot, Funko, Pop.

296
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Like when I started high school, it was like I was never that insecure about liking comics or whatever.

297
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But like geek was an insult. And then like after a while, corporations were like geeked.

298
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We've talked, I think we talked about geeked them before. We're going to talk about it. I can't remember.

299
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We were talking about geeked them essentially. And it's like it's a word now that's been branded and it's taken what used to be a slam and now made it into like this thing that they can brand.

300
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And then they can like try to control your fandom. So now it's weird. It's weird how this thing is flipped around.

301
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah. Now we're being sold our own. Yes. So like being way into something was not a thing to be years ago.

302
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It was not cool because corporations couldn't make money on it. And there's a real like they weren't monetizing it.

303
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I feel like there's a very super fit. There's a clip Tom Sharpling always plays on the best show of Chris Hardwick's stand up, which I've definitely summoned an evil god with that phrase.

304
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But like Chris Hardwick sucks. But there's a clip of him going like, I love I'm a nerd. I love comic books. I love sci fi. And like the example he gives, it's like I like Star Wars.

305
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I like the Lord of the Rings movies like, yeah, I like this one billion dollar thing and this other billion dollar thing. And it's like so gross.

306
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Is it where doesn't say where my nerds at where my nerds at least? I think that's the phrase. I mean, it was already already bad.

307
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:21,000
11 before it was clear he was a creep. But like, Jesus, how dare you speak ill of clip cup cast member Chris Hardwick.

308
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Hey, he was nice then. You had a fun time with him then. Hey, different time. We didn't answer.

309
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You know, I don't think I've thought about this like who would what's what's like a subtle Disney bound we could pull out.

310
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Maybe we have to pose it to the audience. Hey, audience, dress us up. Yeah, what can we do? And I don't even mean like Jokey.

311
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What could we like casually pull off? Yeah, that's because obviously we could all put on Donald Duck sailor suits all day.

312
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, my gosh. Yeah. And do. Yeah. I mean, because like the big the big five goofy.

313
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I mean, I could wear a vest and like a pants pants with a patch on it. But I got a little red shorts.

314
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I have minutes ago. I considered little red shorts. Yeah. Good. So that's on the table.

315
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm just trying like what fits with your weights. Well, I don't know who we both wear like floral shirts and I like floral shirt polos.

316
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What about Pete from Goof Troop? Does he does I feel like he wears fun stuff. Let me see yours fun stuff. I could be wrong. Let me see.

317
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't want to be Pete. Oh, Pete's the dad. He's just a goofy. He wears like polos.

318
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh, no, he wears the he wears like a dress shirt with a tie. I mean, that's an easy honestly.

319
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That's not what I was thinking of. I'm thinking of a different character. Max is easy. Max is like 90s.

320
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:51,000
This is like Pete. If I was Pete bounding, I would wear like a that's another look I could pull off. I don't exactly look like Pete and I mean, his size.

321
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We should all pull off different Pete's. You. Yeah. Your your steamboat willy Pete. Yeah. Right.

322
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The different looks of Pete over the years. That should be all collection. The Pete collection. Yeah.

323
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Like the John collection we were talking about earlier. Yeah. Yeah. Could I pull off like a casual cosplay of Dr. Nigel Channing?

324
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh, that's an interesting audience. Anything with a suit like I feel like could be cobbled together.

325
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I feel like even Dreamfinder, if you if you get these colors. Yeah. There's a bright like shirts tie suit.

326
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Like I feel like you could color block that. You know what you would do?

327
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Well, the Drake Mallard Darkwing Ducks alter ego cosplay, the sweater vest and the dress shirt. Oh, yeah.

328
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You could pull that off. And I think that would no one would bat an eye.

329
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I see this is the kind of thing I like because I don't know that you're going to walk into Disney and even some of your more hardcore fans are going to go Drake Mallard Darkwing Ducks alter ego.

330
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But if you're wearing this, it's like that's my type of costume. I'm I'm I like an obscure thing.

331
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Gadget jumpsuits and style. Gadget from Rescue Rangers. That's a real easy one. That's very easy.

332
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But you'll that's right on the nose. Yeah. Like people will all gadget because you have the goggles. Chip and Dale.

333
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Rescue Rangers. Leather jackets, Hawaiian shirts. Yeah. Dale. Dale would be cool. No pants.

334
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Walking into Disneyland. Hawaiian shirt and no pants.

335
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Well, if you have any ideas for us, let us know. But I you know, I did try on a little I did try on a little something.

336
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I threw on a pink pink sparkly Mickey ears and a pink sparkly Mickey ear.

337
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Probably many year backpack and with a bow. I think I'm working it here. What do you all think? Oh, yeah, sure.

338
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I mean, that's pulling it off. What's the backpack? I can't see that far. Oh, it's you know, it's it's pink and sparkly as a bow on it.

339
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh, those back. I like that. They're really I sure is pink, too. What company is that?

340
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Is it Dunion Bork or is it the other one? There's one. It's a it's handwriting.

341
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What does he has a Carly? Weisel had been posting a bunch of they've they've like a line of these tiny backpacks now of like a bunch of different stuff.

342
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, I didn't buy them. Let me know if you think I see their present Dunion Bork stuff. Those person are really pricey. Yeah. Yes.

343
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Well, this is one of the stores where Heidi Klum is selling six hundred dollar Minnie Mouse ears.

344
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Oh, you know, with one hundred and fifty sparkling Swarovski crystals. Yes.

345
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Those are it's probably sold out by the time this is coming out.

346
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But as we speak, I believe actually yesterday as we recorded this, she was like at downtown at the Disney dress shop signing these taking photos.

347
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, I did see that. I'm with another seems like a lot. Yeah, it's more than I wonder if they really had.

348
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
How many people went down for that for the Heidi Klum six hundred dollar years?

349
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
All the seal stands out there. That's correct. They're not married anymore, though.

350
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Oh, then they went down to yell at her. Yeah, I don't think they're on good terms. I think they have kids. They do have kids.

351
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I seem to know a lot. That's what I got about the Disney dress shop. Great.

352
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Marceline's Confectionary. Confectionary. You know, I'm a fan. You know, I stan.

353
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Yeah, Marceline's Confectionary. It's kind of like the candy restaurants you'd find on Buena Vista Street or Main Street.

354
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Almost exactly the same inventory. Same offerings, same picture windows where you can watch them make stuff.

355
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's very much more of a minimalist design named after Marceline Mazura, where Walt lived as a young child.

356
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
That's what they say there. Yeah. They say Mazura. I like it.

357
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm a big fan of the chocolate covered peanut butter graham cracker. They used to call it a peanut butter sandwich.

358
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I don't know what they still sell that as. I've had that. That is very delicious.

359
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I like to get the goofy sour balls as a gift or a big hit.

360
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I haven't had the goofy sour balls in years, but I do love a goofy sour ball. Delicious.

361
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I think I've talked before my favorite candy. And if anyone remembers this, they used to sell plastic containers with the characters' faces on it full of tartan tinies,

362
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
which were some of my favorite candies. And they would have sour balls in those containers. They'd have tartan tinies.

363
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Both fantastic candies, but they don't carry tartan tinies anymore. Another company is making them. That's a whole nother podcast.

364
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You did find tartan tinies. Yes, very excited. And had a conversation with a candy store proprietor.

365
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yes, he's worked at that candy store, owned that for like 25 years. And he's like, oh yeah, and he's like, why yes, we have tartan tinies, of course, as high as the eye can see.

366
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
He sang a song too about it. He was very happy. My tartan tiny kingdom.

367
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I was like grabbing hands with him and circling the candy shop. Very small. It's very narrow. So you're knocking a lot of shit over.

368
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You're the chosen one, Michael. It was always you.

369
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I went to the tartan tiny factory after that. And OK, so.

370
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Marcelines. Yeah, great. You know what I like? When we were there the other day, they have take a number like a deli counter right at the entrance.

371
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Like, yes, it is very efficient. I don't think it's really in the theme style of the either Main Street or Buena Vista Street.

372
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But you can. It doesn't matter at downtown Disney. They want to get people in and out and on their way.

373
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah, I had I had a thought and then I realized I was wrong to think it.

374
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And I have a similar thought about the world of Disney. At first, I was like, it's kind of a bummer to me that all this stuff is available outside of the park.

375
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Because in some ways you're like, oh, the special treats are for in the park.

376
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And there's feeling of like you're on the main street and you're watching the candy apples.

377
00:29:47,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But then I realized the park is so goddamn expensive that if you want to go and have some Disney magic and your Disney magic is buying a nine dollar candy apple with that looks like winning the poo, then that's nice that you can get it down to Disney.

378
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So I made a reversal. At first, I was going to say like, it's kind of it's I wish the treats were specific to inside, but I was wrong thinking that.

379
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And I'm glad that this exists here. Sure. And plus, if you're staying at the hotels and you change your mind, it's like, I think I want to go back for that.

380
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Like, it's a lot easier to just go downstairs or down the street to downtown Disney and grab something.

381
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But yeah, it's exactly the same, almost exactly the same treats you can get.

382
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,000
There's a shortbread cookie drizzled with a rainbow whatever it is. Fun frosting. Great. I've had it twice.

383
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:42,000
There's a type in the park. I ate a tiger tail and turn it. It was a Cheshire cat's tail and I ate it. There's marshmallow inside and I ate it. Yeah.

384
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
That's good. Yeah, they have that at Marceline's or version of it. That sounds good. Yeah, that's pretty good.

385
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's like a cookie ish on the outside and the marshmallow inside. Very love that. And then this is a great place. I buy a lot of, you know, holiday.

386
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I buy coffee for the family or you buy. I've done that. Yeah. You buy. There's a tea set and everyone likes that and it's pretty good.

387
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And yeah, Marceline's good. That's what I'll say. Good. Catal? Catal. I think you have the most experience with Catal of all of us.

388
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Well, I've been there twice. Yeah, I think that's about right. I've had some drinks around there.

389
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I've been to Uva a lot more than Catal. They're related, but it's confusing because what is this maybe where I think this is the official beginning of in.

390
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I've been talking about these unused district names. Yes. And this is the beginning of apparently the wine bar district.

391
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So now we're talking. But I go to Uva a lot more than Catal. We have, of course, separated them into different levels.

392
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:54,000
They're making things as complicated as possible, but they are pretty separate organisms, even though you go to the outdoor Uva bar and it all comes from the indoor kitchen at Catal.

393
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I've only been to Catal twice. I think my general feeling is you're going to get the vibe. You're going to get the it's all seems good.

394
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's good food. But if you want, you know, drinks and Mediterranean tinged food, but you need to put a little speed on it.

395
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Who was your place? Catal is probably a great place to sit down. I've enjoyed the meals I've had there, but I don't think I'm ever if you're in the mood for a sit down nice dinner at Disney, probably you're going to do Napa Rose or or obviously Carthay.

396
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:39,000
If you can get a steak, I think I think it's maybe trouble because it falls into the nether region of is it it's like pretty good food, but you can get better food very close. Right.

397
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It does have some very specific food. Like I am like if I wasn't so tired last night, I was like, I wish I kind of want to go to Catal because they have a paella menu.

398
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Okay, they have maple leaf duck, which I love duck. Wow. And then they have suckling pig and I'm like, and they even have paella with suckling pig.

399
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And I'm like, I gotta eat at Catal. I gotta go to Catal. Paella with suckling pig doesn't make it down there before the end of the saga and update us. Yeah. I think you need to get some suckling pig before this is all said and done.

400
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:24,000
We can do addendums. Sector Keepers not here. Rules are off. All bets are off. So we'll come back to it. We're still pretty early in the saga. So I would like to take a minute to get some logistical. Sorry, the ordeal.

401
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And it's levels and stages. Yeah, it's early, but it's getting to me. Hashtag Sector Keeper cricket wireless severance. So just some logistical advice for the listener.

402
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Catal is one of the restaurants that you can validate five hours of downtown Disney Parking. Thank God.

403
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Bray a bakery cafe, Naples, restaurante bar, Ralph Brennan's jazz kitchen, splitsville luxury lades and tortilla.

404
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Joe's. Why go to a website when we could read the website to read it?

405
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Catal also one of the restaurants that if you're staying at one of the Disney hotels, you have access to preferred dining reservations, which not just dining includes preferred reservations at the Bibbidi Boppidi boutique.

406
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Blue Bayou Carthay Circle restaurant, Catal Goofy's kitchen, L'Oreal bakery, close in the alphabet, get to the Z's, Naples, restaurante, E bar, Plaza, every place, Ralph Brennan's jazz kitchen, tortilla.

407
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:34,000
They set aside some reservations if you are a hotel guest so that you, you know, it's a little make me wait like a second class citizen.

408
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Look this. Yeah, there's a class system. It's classes. You get a case of the it's a perk. It's a perk.

409
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You got to say get a case of the hungries. Get a case of the hungries.

410
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I heard what you were going for. In case of the yummies. Case of the yummies. Very helpful if I have stayed at a hotel and unknowingly the next day there was a run Disney event and everything is a madhouse.

411
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Did you accidentally get swept up in a run Disney mob? A group of people running? No thankfully because that's all at like four, four to six a.m. and the more it's crazy.

412
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Which of us would be the, none of us wanted to run Disney. No, no. I could do a 5k.

413
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Whoa really? It's only a few miles. Said confidently. I don't think I'd finish fast. We've got to volunteer. I think I'd do some speed walking for that.

414
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
We need someone to review a run Disney. We haven't done that on the podcast yet so I think you just sign yourself up. And there's run Universal too.

415
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You can run all the parks. The Minion, it's a Minion run. Run Dollywood. I'm not much of a run. I'm more of like a walker.

416
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Well wait a minute. You got to run a little bit. That's the whole thing. I'll run a little bit but you got to pace yourself. So you're going to walk Disney?

417
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Why not? I don't think they put a cap on you. They don't. They're not going to come by and tell you. In fact there's all these photo stops anyway so I don't think you're really.

418
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It sounds like you're going to walk the race track and then take photos. I'm going to briskly walk. The distance is. Alright you can still, we'll still send you.

419
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You stepped way down from the initial confidence from a confident run to a briskly walk. I think I could get up to speed in a month to like. To walk?

420
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:21,000
No to get a little pep in my step to jog. To briskly walk. You have to prepare. For 5k. 5k or what? Right? There's different length tracks.

421
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm sure there is. It just sounds like you don't need like a ton of physical fitness to do what you're describing. I don't think you do because it's like photo stops every few.

422
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Probably accurate. Yeah. I think it's customizable. If you want to do a full marathon or half marathon. If you want to go for speed. But I think if they're like if you just want to come and like speed walk a little and then take a picture with the Cinderella, the mice.

423
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Alright. You are welcome to. That's good. Alright well we'll send you. That's my cosplay. I'm Jacques. Jacques the mouse. Oh yeah.

424
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I haven't worn a lot of cloth. Like kind of floppy hats in my day. Now's the time to start. Yeah. So take that anyway long and short. Know that parking advice. Know that preferred reservation advice. If you're going to visit downtown Disney.

425
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And hey if you're really getting that five hours pop in the parks for a little bit. They can't find you. If you have an annual pass. What a bad boy.

426
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Now I don't have a lot to say. I'm sure you would go to this place and have a nice restaurant and I think there's some seats where you can see the fireworks and I'm just more more of a fan of uva than Katal and especially let me look we had some rough stuff with the patina restaurant group a little while ago.

427
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah. So yeah. Another patina. It's yeah with what we've lived through. I don't know how much I want to push a business into them. But the Gambino family.

428
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I mean, I'm not going to say the patina restaurant group. Our first boss. I was so rattled. But so but there is an event. I was like there's this thing like a lot to talk about is just because all seems nice and good probably and there's nothing. Is it an opening day restaurant? I think it is. Yeah.

429
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The font would suggest that. Sure. That's a good point. I was saying that's like the like we when surveying everything like do we talk about this already that the Katal and uva bar font is one of the it's one of the most the biggest signs of 2001 of like sloppy shitty 2001.

430
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Because there now are some cool aesthetics throughout Dandead. Different fonts on the vertical side than the horizontal side. A very 2001 move. The new Naples layout and stuff like that's like it doesn't fit next to this and some of the other new signs for sure.

431
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It should all be that craftsman stage should all fit in with the with the Grand California hotel which is what Jason was saying. Yes. Or if you have to do something take the world of Disney telescope and the nephews and put them on top of the Katal restaurant.

432
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:11,000
At least do that. If you're going to make it gaudy like this at least have a giant gaudy telescope with the duck nephews go all the way. That's neither here nor there. He's so crazy. They built this whole district. Beautiful craftsman building behind it made a quarter of it.

433
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Look in that style. Just extend the craftsman the whole way. Yeah. I think we'd probably be coming in a lot more like that's nice. That's nice. If everything was craftsman style because it's never really gone out of style. The way that they blew up Disney Springs and just gave it all the same style which is a cool actually thought through new style.

434
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah. Disney downtown Disney is a mishmash and I do no matter how good a restaurant Katal is the bits that that font is what you see. Yes. Face in the public gross. Are they doing a piecemeal though in downtown Disney because they can issue like they have a lot more structural control in Disney Springs where like well we can blow it all up at once.

435
00:39:48,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Downtown Disney had to deal with the city of Anaheim. Perhaps that but also I wonder if the patina group is I wonder if they're figuring out if they're going to keep it this restaurant because stuff still closing stuff has been closing at a pretty decent clip. We're going to be at the 20 year mark.

436
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:25,000
We're going to be at the 20 year mark so I wonder if they're still I'm just wondering if they're figuring out like we'll put a new concept in or will we just re update everything that's going on here. It feels like with the redo of Naples though patina is at least leaving one foot in downtown Disney. Right.

437
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Well I don't think they would redo a whole restaurant and go like anyway we're out of here. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. But I wonder like there's no other Katal restaurant right. This is the only Katal restaurant. No no no there's a ton of patina restaurants but they all seem different.

438
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So maybe yeah patina has a new concept they want to try out. Could still be. So there's a possibility. There's a the imagination imagination of Joaquin Splashall knows no bounds. Yes I mean we all wait for Joaquin Splashall for his next concept and there will be a smoke signal from his apartment window and then we will know.

439
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And then maybe Joaquin has an idea. Maybe Joaquin will just say you know make the font Papyrus. He'll just say that it will be Katal still but now it'll be Papyrus font not whatever this is. Only one way to make it worse if there was some font that merged Papyrus and Comic Sans into a new. Maybe he's trying to invent a new font.

440
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Oh we don't get that. He's a font for the Avatar sequels. And the way that everyone was like oh you know once upon a time in Hollywood Tarantino clearly poking fun at his reputation for the foot stuff there's so much of it.

441
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:57,000
If James Cameron dug down of like oh you made fun of my Papyrus. Well what if I. Ha ha. James can't visionary filmmaker James Cameron is working with visionary chef Joaquin Splashall to craft an all new font that will define the 21st century and designer free agent Johnny I.

442
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So but then all right so none of this is that fascinating with Katal and we're being mean about the font. But I'm going to go out on a positive note with something I don't I feel like it would come up by now if you guys had found it and I'm delighted to break it to you.

443
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Okay. You know that every year at a Katal restaurant there is an event called Breakfast with Santa. No. Everyone's dream to have breakfast with Santa Claus. I definitely sure you sit on his lap. Like you would have milk and cookies with them but breakfast one day a year.

444
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It is one I don't know it could be a recurring over a month and you sign up for times of it. I'm looking at some website now. Let me say go on sale in July. Whoa. Wow. I for all you know what they said is that there's a Christmas in July discount.

445
00:42:46,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So you have a foresight to book right. We did not this year. So we're gonna have to wait with the masses to get have our cherished breakfast with Santa. Let me tell you what happens at breakfast with Santa. Adults are welcome to sip on bottomless mimosas.

446
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm in while little ones are treated to a cookies little ones or grown podcasters are treated to a cookies and milk station and steaming cups of hot chocolate from the cocoa carts hot cocoa cart it says you got it hot cocoa.

447
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So living polar express after they share their Christmas wishes with Santa he will gift every child with a stuffed animal and a personalized stocking Wow guest been make reservation today to enjoy this beloved Yuletide tradition that is sure to put a smile on every child's face and make memories of a last a lifetime.

448
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I want to come out with the big papaya pan like that's what I want him to come as did someone order papaya with suckling pig. I think I know I think there's a little older boy.

449
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I have something for you. I hear you've been very good this year I any many good podcast episodes is there what would you like perhaps something suckling yes that's right.

450
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:24,000
What a big new with some spice rice with saffron I don't know if you've been that good. Where's the little boy who enjoys duck. Which one of you is here blitz and get out here.

451
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Stab your antlers into that tray and bring this boy some suckling big forthwith.

452
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:45,000
We've got to go to see Santa then we have to it looks like it's like the 7th of December through the 23rd 24th. Oh it's all month long. Yeah so it's at least three weeks.

453
00:44:45,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Wow I didn't know I knew I it's interesting because you find different stuff like I didn't know up until a couple years that they did Thanksgiving every year at the Disneyland Hotel which we did which we really enjoyed so they do have these little weird holiday celebrations in different spots.

454
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And we did we did Easter at storytellers which I was hoping was going to be this fun thing where everyone was dressed up adequately in Easter clothes like all the characters that is and they were just wearing their safari gear like it was a normal buffet.

455
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:31,000
But no bonnets I wanted bonnets I wanted like Easter suits your Easter finery Easter finery yes but it was Thanksgiving we were Thanksgiving and the characters were dressed up in some different mini header apron because she's making the food we were all eating. Yeah it was fantastic.

456
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And he cooked for you she cooked yes the country bears of course they were in the regular yes that's the cousins from the old from the holler you know they're just coming they're bringing some shine and yeah they're they're music they're beautiful music they dressed up in their fancy clothes then they wouldn't be being themselves right.

457
00:45:48,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I guess Henry has a dickie and tie a top hat he is the master of ceremonies. Yeah that's true also a good cosplay potentially or not a cosplay but a Disney bound a country bear Disney bound is maybe your best bet. Yeah that's a vest a lot of vests.

458
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But not a tiny teddy bear that no that would be a big one yeah full bonnet yes. Sun bonnet like the sun bonnet trio I guess the answer is that we all need some bonnet trio bonnets. Yeah not currently available at the Disney dress shop and those country bears are going away a lot in a lot of places and I'm worried they're going away in Florida so this is going to be there we're not going to see any of this in the Disney dress shop we're not going to see I feel maybe in Japan because they're very popular there still.

459
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Yeah so we'll get our bonnet to Japan. Well did we make it. I think we got it. I think oh my god I think we survived level two stage two and oh my god it's materializing there's there's the sector keepers item that he's given us to put in the inventory oh my god it's a pink sparkly backpack filled with suckling pig.
