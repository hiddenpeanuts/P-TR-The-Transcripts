1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your porch has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's all go to City Walk

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tonight, tonight

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's all go to City Walk

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's all go to City Walk

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm in the City Walk saga, what an honor to start this way.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You may know him from Jimmy Kimmel Live, from his podcast Struggle Session,

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
or for giving no fucks on Twitter, it's Jack Allison.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, thanks for having me guys.

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And you know, there's just something kind of freeing, you know,

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
piggyback on what Mike was saying about this episode going on Listen To

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and people's podcast app.

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There's something just freeing about being on a lost episode

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and knowing that as it's being recorded, it's a lost episode.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We can really say anything here.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No one can be mad at you.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No one can be mad at me for the stuff I say on this podcast.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I finally feel free to say my opinions.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Unlike the pressure of a regular podcast,

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
which is guaranteed to be listened to by millions upon millions of people.

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You guys have gone to the effort here of winnowing away all the listeners

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and we can finally say the things we really want to say about City Walk.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Uh-huh, yes, as long as that's the case.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're a politically active person and your podcast is very political.

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm trying to think how this overlays onto City Walk.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's not a proper, you know, governed body necessarily.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And maybe the question is, is it better that way?

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, yeah, that's the, yeah, should it be more regulated?

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Should there be regular elections?

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
City Walk is obviously a classic example of a corpocracy.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You know what I mean?

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is what happens when the fat cats at the top make all the decisions

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and the little people, the activists, the voters,

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you got to get out there and vote November.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You have to vote.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You must vote.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Get out there and vote.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Get out there and vote.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Raise your voice and get out there and vote.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Without a voice, you know, City Walk has just ran roughshod over, you know,

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I mean, you have to get a permit to do like a dance number there.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You know what I mean?

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And to like to twirl around with some chains and necklaces,

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
you know, the kind of street performance you see there.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So I think we're seeing an unfettered corpocracy.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And I think Section 13 actually is a good example of some of the gentrification

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
we see happening at City Walk, for the worse.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I do.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There is a story that I'll bring up where City Walk and the movie theater

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
actually do intersect with legitimate L.A. politics.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We can get into that.

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There's been some, I don't know if you guys know all this,

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
like acts of violence have taken place at that theater.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There's a lot there.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But before we get into that, we should find out what it is we're talking about at all.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And so we turn to the Sector Keeper.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Boys, boys, and Jack, today's sector is Sector 13.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Things from another world.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Universal Cinema, Five Towers Outdoor Stage, and the former simulator ride.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Good luck, boys.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So we're talking things from currently things from another world, the Universal Cinema.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And before that, but I think in I think in the around the things from another world space,

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the simulator ride that was up there probably until the mid 2000s.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I couldn't tell you exactly.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Should we start with that one?

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Should we start with the past and a GameStop?

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Right. And we gave a GameStop.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh, I missed that entirely.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
OK, we got a couple. Yeah.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You know your history, kid.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And Jack, just get you at speed.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Our listeners have heard this every day for many days.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The Sector Keeper is the simultaneously a child who died of a staph infection in the Tansy Fountain.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He's the ghost of that child, but he's also an endless being.

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
For sure. Yeah.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A timeless being who represents the spirit of City Walk.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm well aware of the Sector Keeper and I have been aware.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've gone to City Walk for my entire life.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So I've heard the lore of the Sector Keeper.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Actually, I think for the first time from a grizzled waiter at the Gladstones when I was a boy.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So I'm well aware of the Sector Keeper and the lore surrounding.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's good of him to start getting the word out and even tell such a tragic tale to a child.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But you know, you're never too young to find out.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I never stepped into those fountains again because of the tragic tale of the Sector Keeper.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's smart. Good thing he got to you.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Every time I go up there to City Walk now, I start yelling at all the kids like,

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
get out of there, get out of there. You don't know what might happen.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But it hasn't gone. It's been fine. No one's.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They still play, but whatever.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
People are happy that you're yelling at their kids.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's always just for safety.

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They think I'm a street performer.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Sure. You got a permit to do it. Yeah, that's right.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So you're a Valley native. So you've gone to City Walk forever.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Sure.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Before we get specific, any particular cherished City Walk memories?

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, you know, when I was in middle school, I lived in Sherman Oaks there.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And so, you know, we had the rapid bus that would basically just, you know, five stops or so,

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
like directly from, you know, right where I lived at, like Ventura and Woodman, you know,

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
you could for just a few dollars get on the rapid bus and it would let out right at the bottom of City Walk.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It would let out right there and you could take the tram up.

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And so what I would do during that time is like for a while, one of us had a season pass

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and it was like before the way the season passes are now.

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So we would like try to like sneak that one in and out and whatever.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Or you could trade it. You could like have somebody like sneak it out in a pocket or something like that.

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, great. Okay.

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But then the scam I really started to run was that you could like just put highlighter on your hand

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and smear it really bad and then say you went in the water fountain and like get yourself wet.

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh, yeah.

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You'd be like, it got smeared and they would just like let you in.

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Because that was this theme park trope for years is that you would get your hand stamped when you were leaving.

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Sure. And that was the only thing.

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And that was the only thing.

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Now they check the ticket again. They check everything again.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You still get your hand stamped, but it's perfunctory.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know why you still get your hand stamped to be honest with you.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There's no reason because you have to show the ticket again.

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But yeah, so the thing back then was to just do a highlighter on the hand, smear it up.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Or if you could get one person in, like I would say that I lost my hat on the Jurassic Park ride

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and then they would walk you into lost and found and then like stop paying attention to you.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So then you could just go walk out through the line, get your hand stamped.

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And if you really quick like put the hand stamp on someone else's hand, then they would also have the stamp.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And so you could just keep running that over and over.

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh, you press back of hands together.

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah. So if it's fresh, you just go bam. And then you both walk in.

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So on the podcast, we all are very like good boys, especially when we were children.

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What was like the age when you started like feeling comfortable lying to strangers?

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know that there's a time in my life I didn't feel comfortable lying to strangers. I don't know.

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Another one, this one is not that nice. And you know, I don't say that anybody should do this or whatever.

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But like you could ostensibly get a front of the line pass if you just they rented wheelchairs for like $14 at Universal.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And so if you just rented a wheelchair, you would get to go to the front of the line for every single ride, like your whole party.

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is before the Fastpass and everything like that.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And the extra cool part about that was that you don't have to go down the escalators.

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They have like a secret like monorail thing.

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It takes you down like you take an elevator and then you take a little private monorail to the bottom.

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And, you know, so we did that as well.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And, you know, I don't think we took away any opportunities from people with actual disabilities from getting to the front of the line.

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There was a much more grander, garish version of that where people would, you know, run tour groups with like handicapped or mentally disabled people.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Essentially, like rich people would rent them for the day.

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
How nice.

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And then go through. Yeah. So.

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah. Oh, that's right. Yeah.

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
In Florida, it was a big scandal.

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I think it was as easy as for us.

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We were just like, he like sprained his ankle.

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And like, I don't know.

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Save your money. You don't have to rent a disabled person to get to the front of the line.

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Now we're taking work away from.

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That is true.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Also, this whole impersonating disabled people for and pretending you're in a wheelchair.

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This is all something Sasha Baron Cohen would do.

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah. Yeah.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And I think that that's a little bit unpalatable, to be honest with you.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Like, I think in this era, it's not really the time to be doing comedy like that.

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So, you know, I think that, you know, we should stand to be upset and to not allow.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We should stand strong against Sasha Baron Cohen here and say that what he did was mean and I don't condone any kind of meanness in comedy.

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But again, but luckily his new series and probably a little old by the time people hear this is is on showtime, which like these episodes, it makes all his entire show a lost show.

169
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So if you're worried about being offended by it, you won't see it.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I thought that the announcement said on BitTorrent when they were going to be.

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You see announced. Yes.

172
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The secret text.

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We're going to be launching on showtime and bit blockchain streaming services.

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
All right. Well, let's let's get into the as I said, let's let's let's go into the past here of this sector.

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So there when did this open? I want to say early 90s.

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We were saying right before we started recording, it was very difficult to even find the name of the simulator attraction that used to be up there.

177
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Where the comic book store is now.

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I looked a little but like I yeah, I didn't know that.

179
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And I didn't really know how to start searching for it, and it seemed like you you already had so much on the simulator, Scott.

180
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Or like it seemed like you already knew.

181
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It sounds like you quit when Scott said he had a lot of stuff.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I wasn't sure how much it was going to be.

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So I spent more time writing about other stuff.

184
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's not necessarily a ton, but I found a little more than I thought.

185
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The the the name of this thing evidently was show scan presents Cinemania.

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
One of these catchy theme park names.

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We all know show scan famously around today.

188
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, there I also show scan as far as I knew was a process and not necessarily a company, but I guess it was a company like TiVo.

189
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You know, it became so synonymous with the technology.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Being moving chairs and viewed right.

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So this yeah, this company started in the early 80s.

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And if you ever went on a simulator ride that was not in a in a Disney or Universal park, it was probably show scan.

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I remember doing these freestanding rides in like the Luxor or the Excalibur in Vegas.

194
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
They were they were all over the place.

195
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But here's the here's what blew my mind today that this technology was developed, by the way, by Doug Trumbull, eventual director of the Back to the Future ride.

196
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And the whole thing with show scan is it's 60 frames a second, which lets you do more realistic and less filmy movement.

197
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's bigger at 70 millimeter bigger than other movies are.

198
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And they were looking for a place to start exhibiting this technology.

199
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And I found a big article from 1984 that claims that show scan if a couple early tests get off the ground, that it will start being displayed in show biz pizza palaces.

200
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh, wow. Wow. Our nation.

201
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And it didn't really work out.

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think they tried it in Dallas and they tried it in Fairfax, Virginia, where there still is a Chuck E. Cheese.

203
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It having at some point been switched from show biz pizza palace.

204
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I read about the movie that they showed there, which now I think it's I think it was called New Magic.

205
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I didn't write the title down because it's hard to remember what was the judge in register with.

206
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That was the thing they showed in the Chuck E. Cheese.

207
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This was a movie shown exclusively at not Chuck E. Cheese, but show biz show his pizza.

208
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Right. And the story of this movie of New Magic is that you're watching very simple.

209
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You're you're in the back of a show biz pizza watching a 70 millimeter film about fireworks and then the projector breaks and the projectionist comes onto the screen and apologizes and says, really, sorry.

210
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What else can I do while I have it here?

211
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's going to take forever to fix the film.

212
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, I could show you this new technology that my boss, a sorcerer, is working on.

213
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And the sorcerer is played by Christopher Lee. Wow.

214
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Christopher Lee is in a thing that only played at a show biz pizza in Fairfax, Virginia.

215
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And I didn't read the plot of it too carefully. But like this guy ends up the projectionist.

216
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's similar to Mickey and the sorcerer's apprentice.

217
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The sorcerer is furious that he would dare try out this magic without explicit permission.

218
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I mean, that's in the public domain. Angry sorcerer. It's a big TV tropes area if you go to that site.

219
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Among the things that happens is that the sorcerer makes the projectionist go into a guillotine and the guillotine doesn't cut his head off, but it does put his head on the body of a spider, which is there's a still of this on a website I found.

220
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's very disturbing. And then the sorcerer in the final indignity turns him into Billy Bob, the mascot of show biz pizza.

221
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
From the rocket fire explosion. Yes. Wow.

222
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And then he's and then it ends with the sorcerer saying, go get out there and entertain the kids.

223
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So then when you leave the movie, if you see Billy Bob walking around, you know that he is a punished projectionist.

224
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Wow. All new info to me this morning.

225
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You know, there's one thing children love. It's body horror.

226
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Cronenberg.

227
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Mommy rescue him.

228
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He's a slave.

229
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Let me ask you guys, because I remember these existing, but I never did them.

230
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Did your Dave and Buster is growing up where there is simulator theaters in your Dave and Buster's because there was in the Philadelphia one growing up when you say growing up.

231
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was not privileged. I did not have a Dave and Buster.

232
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Really?

233
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Nor did we. They are new arrivals in Los Angeles.

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, I was at one the other night at Hollywood and Highland and those have not.

235
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah, that's that's the last couple of years.

236
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We had a place called Gameworks. I got one was I was 16, which is very similar to it, but no Dave and Buster's until many years later.

237
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What about fun scape?

238
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Because that leaves those larger my mind.

239
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What is fun scape? Fun scape was like a fun scape was like a family kind of version of Dave and Buster's.

240
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It is a it was a massive facility in Wilmington, Delaware.

241
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It was like three stories tall mini golf, a 18th screen movie theater, laser tag, virtual reality, a simulator, a Star Tours kind of simulator thing.

242
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We were in a car as opposed to a theater where you're in a car.

243
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I only ever remember. I think we did the mini golf once.

244
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The movie theater was like the first regal movie theater in the Philadelphia area and was notable for like being the first movie theater where my family was like, oh, wow, this is full back seats.

245
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Like a thing that is now ubiquitous now.

246
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Really?

247
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It used to be like really.

248
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How did they have seats before?

249
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It just like kind of like halfway.

250
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Stools?

251
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It was mostly like kind of like dumpier AMC's where we were.

252
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And this was like the third first theater with like stadium kind of seat tiered seating.

253
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Maybe I just don't remember that seats used to be like that.

254
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah, I guess I remember when we had like AMC in Schomburg went to like stadium seating.

255
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Right.

256
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It was like it was a summer of stadium seating.

257
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I thought that had more to do with the height of the, you know, the rows not being, you know, on one level. That's what I thought stadium seating had more to do with.

258
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Rather than the back of the chair.

259
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You know, stadiums don't have back chairs.

260
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You're right. You're right. You're right.

261
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It had more to do with it. It's not all just a flat space.

262
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Like the Vista is just a big flat, you know, not stadium style seating.

263
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And in fact, that theater is trash because it's not stadium style.

264
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Stadium before your stadium or nothing.

265
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I hated it when it first started because I did not have a growth spurt yet.

266
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I mean, I had one growth spurt and kind of tapped out there.

267
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But it was hard for me to see over these high back chairs until a certain point.

268
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, that's why you got to have the stadium seating.

269
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I remember being actually very happy about stadium seating as a similarly short man because it did.

270
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It did help a lot.

271
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It used to be a problem, like with people like being too tall in front of me in movies.

272
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Like, yeah. So Funscape went under.

273
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It lasted a few years, but the movie theater is still open and going strong, but it was on the third floor.

274
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So for a few years, you used to have to walk through an abandoned arcade, like an abandoned mini golf and a haunted house.

275
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You had to walk through the creepiest thing and then they reopened some of the arcade and then they just massively just redid it

276
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
so that the lobby was on the other side of the building and then they turned a lot of it into office space.

277
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And you still had to go up a bunch of escalators to get to the screening, you know, to get to the theaters.

278
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But it was like, yeah, it was a big thing.

279
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It was like the era of laser tag was everywhere.

280
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
There was like a wonderful time down the street.

281
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That laser tag also, too, I remember was just people sat in chairs.

282
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It was split in half and there were chairs and you were like sitting in chairs, zapping at targets and each other.

283
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Seated laser tag. It's the only time I'd ever seen it.

284
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The lazy man's laser tag.

285
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We're really committed to the no running.

286
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I did the VR once and they're like right as they put the helmet on, they're like, oh, you got to take your glasses off.

287
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And I'm like, oh, no. And so I was just in blurry.

288
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Like Star Fox, original Star Fox quality graphics laser.

289
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Or not a VR VR.

290
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So we'll do the fun scape episode. We'll do the Schoenberg Mall episode.

291
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We have to start saving our if we start talking about other other malls and arcades.

292
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, we'll never get through 19 parts of this one.

293
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You guys do a whole month on that mall, the Schoenberg Mall.

294
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's where it's at.

295
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I think we're building it up into an event. I'm excited.

296
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's like the McDonald's for no boys.

297
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We're going to wear tuxedos when we do the Schoenberg Mall. We're going to podcast in tuxedos. No one will see it.

298
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But OK, so this so the simulator ride. You did this at some point.

299
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah, I did. I did the simulator ride a couple of times.

300
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I remember that it was a Devil's Mine ride.

301
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And I also remember that it was sort of one of these things that is such a city walk classic,

302
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
something that is fun to do, but not that fun.

303
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That is just obscenely overpriced and will make your parents mad that you want to do.

304
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Like these rides were like at most like I want to say like 10 minutes long, like they were not.

305
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
These are not long rides. And I think they cost like $15 or something like that.

306
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So this is like it's like 2018 movie prices for like a you know, I think it's over in seven minutes.

307
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And I read five minutes.

308
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah, you got to be generous to.

309
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't want to slow us down here, but I did. I found the Devil's Mine ride on YouTube.

310
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Would you guys like to pause very briefly, go on the Devil's Mine together and then pick it back up?

311
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah, absolutely. This used to cost $15. You can do this for free now.

312
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We're doing it in our apartment during a podcast lost episode.

313
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
We'll take a quick break and be right back with our thoughts on Devil's Mine ride.

314
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And we're back. We've just survived the Devil's Mine ride.

315
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And actually, if you want to pause it here and go on it yourself,

316
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
just go to YouTube and search Devil's Mine ride 1991 and you can know what we're talking about.

317
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But in case you don't feel like stopping, we want to describe what we just experienced.

318
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It was an experience. That is the best way to...

319
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So a grizzled old prospector says you're in a mine cart.

320
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And you get to the point where you would start the tour and he says they fixed it up real nice for you.

321
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You're here to tour the mine. We fixed it up real nice for you. It's going to be real smooth and fun.

322
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
The old prospector I'm looking at is IMDB right now.

323
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
His name is Paul Harper and he apparently plays a lot of old prospector types.

324
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Is he still with us?

325
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This doesn't say, but he's been in things like Ghost Rock, which is a cowboy thing.

326
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Sure.

327
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Wild Side, which is a cowboy thing.

328
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The Blue and the Grey, which appears to be a Civil War thing.

329
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
He's a guy, he's a type is what I'm trying to say.

330
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Character actor. Like Royal Dano, who often played Lincoln as well as in the Theme Park world.

331
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The Wild Bunch.

332
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Oh wow, hey, that's legit.

333
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
1969, how about that?

334
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Good for him.

335
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So Paul Harper, the old prospector, is about to usher you into a nice mine ride.

336
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Seems like it's going to be a very calm and sort of normal mine ride at this point.

337
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Sure of a historic mine and you can see the facilities and how the mining is done.

338
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
He has no name.

339
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
He has no name. He's not introduced.

340
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's unclear how you got the tickets for this from him, I don't think.

341
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And what you're doing, like if you're some kind of mine inspector, why are you just sitting in a mine cart already when you're just arriving?

342
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Before introducing yourself or meeting anybody at the actual mining facility, you just took the liberty to jump right into a mine cart and start rolling on down the rail there.

343
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah, which it kind of serves you right to end up going on a Madcap adventure because this isn't your mine.

344
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You have no right to...

345
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Typically, you want to have them choose... I mean, I don't want to spoil what comes next, but typically you would have the mine operator, I would say, choose the path you want to go before you decide to step on into the mine cart there.

346
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
But that's not what happens here.

347
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah. Yeah.

348
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You might have made a presumption that there was only one mine cart path when in fact there is a second and it is, quote, my kind of mine, which is to say poorly built and with giant gaps

349
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and probably more bats than the other. How much nicer was that other mine going to be?

350
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Well, I don't even want to say that it's poorly built necessarily. It's just built to be an exciting rollercoaster.

351
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's a Madcap adventure, really.

352
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Well, it's really, I mean, to put it in our terms, it's Jason's kind of mine, not Scott's kind of mine.

353
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Right.

354
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Me liking very mild thrills.

355
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Exactly.

356
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So Jason's probably, you're not alarmed getting in this mine.

357
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It just seems like the normal type of thrilling mine ride I usually take on vacations.

358
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The other mine might have been like a dark mine ride where you just see like animatronic miners mining at the walls.

359
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
This was more a CG. You know what it reminded me of?

360
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It reminded me of like the graphics in, if you know the Twitter account, The Share Zone.

361
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Sure. Yeah. It's like The Share Zone.

362
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Which is a lot of CGI skeletons.

363
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah.

364
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The graphics of, so yeah, so when you go in the mine, from my, just the naked eye, I think that's all CGI.

365
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I don't think there's any practical effects being displayed.

366
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It reminds me of Superman 64 with all the fog that's going on because they didn't want to have to render backgrounds.

367
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So it's like a very foggy.

368
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Well, it's because of the draw distance. You can't get that much draw distance back there.

369
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's a real foggy mine is what I'm trying to say.

370
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Which actually sort of heightens the danger of it.

371
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I mean, you're careening around on this roller coaster that's built, been built inside of a mine.

372
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You can't even see a few feet ahead of you because of, you know, technological limitations, but also because of art direction.

373
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:37,000
There's not even music to remind you of the upstairs world, the world outside of this mine.

374
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Well, that would break from the reality of it.

375
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's really just, it's nothing but mezzanine.

376
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Once you get into the actual mine.

377
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
They made this with very specific filmmaking rules and it wouldn't be Prospector Paul's kind of mine if it had music.

378
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
An odd thing also is that I found another video of a Devil's Mine ride and it's the same intro and outro,

379
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
which is live action with the old Prospector, but the middle is a different mine ride with updated CGI,

380
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,000
which I found worse. I thought the 2000 CGI was kind of showier and stupider than 1991.

381
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
As we, in keeping with the general feeling of we've made great advancements, but then a 2000 movie is unwatchable,

382
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
whereas Jurassic Park still really holds up.

383
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Kind of like Fantasia 2000, you know.

384
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh, yeah.

385
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The original Devil's Mine ride is just timeless and Devil's Mine ride 2000, you know, it went a little too far with the technology.

386
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Is any...

387
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I can't remember offhand who introduces all the segments in Fantasia 2000, but why do I want to say one of them has been me-tude?

388
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
That might be a false accusation I'm leveling.

389
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We have to check that.

390
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I think just statistically that's a good bet.

391
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
In any film with multiple celebrities.

392
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Is it John Lasseter, perhaps?

393
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't think he does an introduction, but maybe I'm thinking that because...

394
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I could see Matt Lauer doing an introduction to Fantasia 2000.

395
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Is it Morgan Freeman?

396
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
He could be in there. I don't know.

397
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
James Toback.

398
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Charlie Rose.

399
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
James Toback.

400
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Disney legend, James Toback.

401
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
A very young T.J. Miller.

402
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Etoc Pearlman. I...

403
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I think he's fine.

404
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah, he's fine. This is a pretty...

405
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Steve Martin, James Levine, Beth Midler, James Earl Jones, Etoc Pearlman, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones, Teller,

406
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Penn and Teller.

407
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
James Levine isn't one of the conductors who's run afoul of the laws.

408
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
He's not one of the bad conductors.

409
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
No.

410
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
The new conductors bad boy club.

411
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Is he okay?

412
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't know. He seems okay.

413
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I shouldn't be besmirching James Levine without proof.

414
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I don't want to start getting that out there.

415
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
This is turning into a witch hunt.

416
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You're just trying to find phantoms where they aren't there in Fantasia 2000's IMDB.

417
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, nope. On December 2nd, 2017, the New York Times published a front page story containing detailed accounts of four men in their 40s to 60s alleging long term sexual abuse of them by Levine.

418
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Levine!

419
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I thought so!

420
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
God cared her for the win.

421
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Alright, I did it.

422
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Right when you called it a witch hunt and I was starting to get red in the face.

423
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

424
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I should know better than, you know...

425
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Let me show that picture I showed you again and how would this man ever be accused of anything?

426
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
He looks like the old prospector.

427
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
He does.

428
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This man is one of the scariest looking men I've ever seen.

429
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Conductors.

430
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
You know what's happening to conductors.

431
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
By looking at him.

432
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So, anyway...

433
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What is going on with conductors?

434
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That took as many twists and turns as the Devil's Mine, right?

435
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yeah, the Devil's Mine.

436
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You didn't go on any other of the show, Scan Presents.

437
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I do remember going on another one and I don't remember what it was.

438
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I did want to say, you know, I mentioned very astutely during the...

439
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
when we were watching Devil's Mine Ride and I think it was a smart thing that I want to mention now on the podcast proper.

440
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That, you know, the Devil's Mine Ride kind of has in it a lot of the DNA that you now see in a lot of these other rides where you're watching a movie and sitting in a chair.

441
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Oh yeah, the Universal Screen Rides.

442
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Despicable Me, Simpsons.

443
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yeah, absolutely. You have the track ending and the car, you know, falling and landing on another track later.

444
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Which you see in The Simpsons and also in Minion Mayhem.

445
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Minion.

446
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Even when you just did Kung Fu Panda and there's all the same stupid tricks they've been doing since 1991.

447
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah, so I mean in a lot of ways, like yeah, like the Devil's Mine Ride was, you know, an innovator.

448
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
The velvet underground of riding roller coasters.

449
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's like a nation of roller coasters.

450
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Perfect.

451
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Everyone, the Devil's Mine Ride was not a big hit, but everyone who rode it, they started a ride.

452
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I don't remember what other ride I went on there, but it was some...

453
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I went on some ride, I feel like it was like Tron-ish or something.

454
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And afterwards, me and my friend got interviewed by like a film crew because they were trying to like get like, you know, testimonials about how it was good.

455
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And I remember like just stupidly being like, I didn't think it was very good.

456
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And they like shut, like got rid of me right away.

457
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And my friend who was like a kid actor, like was like very emotive.

458
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Like, whoa, it was cool. Swoosh, swoosh.

459
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And all this stuff.

460
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
See, Jack?

461
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
They didn't even have me sign a release.

462
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
They did not even go through the perfunctory.

463
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
They had him sign and all this shit.

464
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Even back then, you were provocateur.

465
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I was.

466
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And then your buddy knew how to play the game.

467
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I know, I know.

468
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
What a fool.

469
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You couldn't bring yourself to do it.

470
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That friend is Colin Trevorrow.

471
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Did you ever think about a way, did you ever get to ride it for free by like sneaking on or lying to the...

472
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I never, you know, it was locked down.

473
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The scene sense, what was it called again?

474
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The cinema sense?

475
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
No, no, that's a different...

476
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Syntacular?

477
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Cine family?

478
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Cine family is the company, right?

479
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Cine mania.

480
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Cine mania.

481
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I think it was pretty locked down there.

482
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I mean, that's like, I mean, I was able to sneak into the movie theater, which we'll talk about shortly.

483
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You know, that's a pretty easy one to get into.

484
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But never, never, never, never the movie.

485
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It is wild to me that they built a simulator ride next to a theme park.

486
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I know this isn't the first time I've heard of that happening.

487
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah.

488
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I mean, I guess Star Wars, The Void is built next to a theme park, but that is a very different experience.

489
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And, you know.

490
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But at the time, no, when it opened, no simulators in Universal Studios.

491
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I guess that's true.

492
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Universal...

493
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That's all it is.

494
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's a pilot program.

495
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And really, like, it takes kind of the same place as I would say that the skydiving thing.

496
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:14,000
The I-Fly thing now takes, which is like stupid, really expensive shit that like kids are going to like beg to do and then the parents have to do it.

497
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You know what I mean?

498
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Like, it's actually even in Sector 13, just as the I-Fly is now.

499
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So maybe there's something psychologically about that area that, you know, puts it in a good spot for that kind of thing.

500
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's on the way out the door.

501
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You might be heading to the parking garage and it's like one last thing to suck your money up on the way out.

502
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Just like Margaritaville, the final stop or the Raiders store.

503
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The Raiders store is really the final stop.

504
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
That's really the money.

505
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I never got a souvenir.

506
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
All right.

507
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Looks like you're getting a Raiders t-shirt.

508
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Well, you want to move into the movie theater or up to you.

509
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You guys freestyle it.

510
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The Sector Keeper isn't here.

511
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You know, he doesn't have us by the balls right now so we can go whichever way we want.

512
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Movie theater, comic store, what's there?

513
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
This is a path like the old Prospector presents.

514
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Let's talk about things from another world.

515
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Sure.

516
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I have some background on things from another world.

517
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
This is a comic store chain out of Portland, Oregon, much like Voodoo Donuts came out of Portland.

518
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Founded by Mike Richardson, who would go on to found Dark Horse Comics.

519
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

520
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:34,000
The long time before Marvel, the long time home of the Star Wars comics and the Aliens and Predators comics and a bunch of original work.

521
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Things from another world, currently the third largest comic chain in the country.

522
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I think Mile High Comics is number one and I would guess Midtown Comics might be number two.

523
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's also, by the way, not that hard to be on the top five comic retailer list in America.

524
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I mean, if you're still hanging on to the 90s.

525
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I think number three and four only have one shop.

526
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So this used to be down by where the studio store is now.

527
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The studio store expanded into the original things from another world space.

528
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But like the spaceship bursting out.

529
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah, with the spaceship bursting out.

530
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah.

531
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But I think it was a cordial agreement.

532
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
They're like, well, we want to expand the studio store.

533
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
We can move you down to a bigger space sort of thing.

534
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So they moved down a couple of years ago.

535
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Rarely achieved city walk move by Tony Romus.

536
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
By things from another world, is there another one?

537
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Have we found?

538
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
In Florida, the Hard Rock, the original Hard Rock moved.

539
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Oh, that's right.

540
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It was kind of in the park by the psycho house.

541
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And now it's the that glorious Coliseum.

542
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You would walk through the kid zone to get to either the Hard Rock F.A. or the psycho house in Orlando.

543
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
That's right.

544
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Well, it's so good on you.

545
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Things from another world.

546
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You did.

547
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Things from another world.

548
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The original one, I honestly think, had more actual comics than the current one.

549
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It is true.

550
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It had a much bigger like stock of comics.

551
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The current one is kind of suffers from what I'll call Barnes and Noble syndrome, where it's like a bookstore.

552
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
But we have a lot of statues and Funko pops.

553
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's a toy store.

554
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's a toy store.

555
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And a few walls of comics, a few racks of comics.

556
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Does does the current things from another world even have like weekly comics?

557
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Are they releasing?

558
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
They're in the back.

559
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's like on the back wall.

560
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah, but like it hits.

561
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's like a whole list there or I like the old things from another world.

562
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'd be honest with you.

563
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And I think that that little corner of Universal was actually kind of Universal Citywalk, you know,

564
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:56,000
not to be like a city walk hater, but that kind of corner over there like was one of the spots that had some kind of like unique flair to it.

565
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It felt like to me like but like between Ruben's Red Hots and Ruben's Red Hots was right next to what things from the world Rubens.

566
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I think it's still there.

567
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Right. The little hot dog place.

568
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Jody Maroney.

569
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm sorry.

570
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
No, no, I'm sorry.

571
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Then it was Jody Maroney the entire time.

572
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Now it's Ludo.

573
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Is it Ludo now?

574
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
OK, so like I remember Jody Maroney's and and and things from the world kind of being the spot.

575
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Like that was the thing to do is you'd go over to Universal Citywalk.

576
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
The rest. That's just corporate trash.

577
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That's all for the tourists.

578
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The real city walk heads know that you go into the crowded, the very small corridor things from another world.

579
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm not. It was horrendous in there.

580
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Like it was like bad.

581
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It was like too crowded in there.

582
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
They had to like squeeze too much stuff in there.

583
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But like that was like how a comic shop is.

584
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It was like comic shops are like it was actually kind of weird that there was a like kind semi, you know, like I'm not going to say like fully as good as other.

585
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Comic shops, but like a 70 80 percent comic shop was like in Universal Citywalk.

586
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah, because that's the recurring thing is how few of these stores have anything you would actually need.

587
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Sure. Day to day.

588
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It is not a shopping center with functional items.

589
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And I believe I think the upstart crow used to be a better bookstore, a more legitimate bookstore.

590
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Oh, yeah. So it's like slowly peeled away from having any.

591
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah, it's got to do with the gentrification of the city walk.

592
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
We're losing the local flair there.

593
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You would find like I feel like to now now the new things from other world just has like it's all Iron Man.

594
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's all right.

595
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Game of Thrones is all this like you have to be able to find in Han Solo.

596
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's a lot of Han Solo.

597
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
The big forehead on solo.

598
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I have a really good feeling that we're going to find a lot of my toys in six months.

599
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:57,000
This is a store that's going to be like in like Vegas, like how they have the E.T.

600
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
like graveyard for the video game.

601
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:07,000
There's going to be they're going to bury like a million Alden Han Solo action figures in Vegas.

602
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I mean, I just think the Funko pop invasion of Citywalk, you know, how some some stores in L.A.

603
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,000
now you see a little sign that says like we take Bitcoin soon you will be able to pay with Funko.

604
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I think Funko pops are the only Alden Han Solo toy that's getting the forehead correct.

605
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You know, we know where would be the perfect place to bury all the Alden toys in the old mine.

606
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You can just add it digitally to a new special edition.

607
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
A big pile of Alden says you're training through this.

608
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Once the mine went under, we turned it into a public storage rental.

609
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You used to be like in the old store, though, you used to be able to they would have like what I like about old comic stores.

610
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You would have like the 1991 Star Trek, the next generation toys just sitting on the shelf because they've been there since that time.

611
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
They've been there that long. It's like Troy's mother toy.

612
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, no one bought it at the time.

613
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But I like I like the dedication of comic shops that are like this is never going down until somebody buys it.

614
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:19,000
This Wado toy from 1999, we will not sacrifice shelf space until somebody takes that away.

615
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Honestly, at this point, somebody would buy the Wado toy.

616
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That bastard McFarland.

617
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I have the other things from another world in Portland are more traditional, you know, comic stores with pull lists and subscription.

618
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It's like it felt like things from other world felt like it was a real comic shop.

619
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And now it feels kind of similarly to how other stuff in City Walk feels like where it's like the Dubai version of it.

620
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Everything is at City Walk because like they just have to have the name of it up there or whatever.

621
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Like it feels like it's things from another world in the sense that like they bought a sign that says things from another world.

622
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm repeating material here, but I went up with a friend of mine who's a law professor and an intellectual.

623
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And he posed the theory that like Sephora, I bet this Sephora does not do the business that a typical one does.

624
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But it's about people pass by the word Sephora on the way to Universal Studios.

625
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
People are visiting Los Angeles and they're maybe from out of the country and they're like, oh, this is like it's Epcot is actually what it is.

626
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
City Walk is Epcot. It's like meant to represent like what America is to like visiting foreigners.

627
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And you might you're on vacation. You might be a little more willing to part with like a little treat for yourself.

628
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Yeah, absolutely. There's expensive sunglasses there and stuff.

629
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's like, oh, I want to go like I'll get like the John Varvado sunglasses while I'm in America.

630
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Like, you know, I want a little bit of fun for me. I'm like a real celebrity.

631
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But the difference though is with Epcot though in those stores, it's not been just rooted out.

632
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,000
All like the like it's not just in the Japanese pavilion like it's just not Funko pops of like Japanese Disney characters.

633
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Epcot is a less accurate representation of America.

634
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I mean, Epcot is like this planned economy kind of like Disney thing.

635
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Like it's like they're trying to keep like the purity of Epcot as being a representative of America.

636
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But that's not that's not really what America is.

637
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Like Universal represents it better where it's like what like, you know, what what America is is like capital taking over.

638
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And so like that's universal.

639
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Like who has the most money like has representation in Universal CityWalk.

640
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And, you know, it's not like you go to Epcot.

641
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I never been to Epcot, but I assume it's like, you know, farmers milking cows and shit.

642
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I don't know. What is Epcot like?

643
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It's a world recreation.

644
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
There's some America and you get an American.

645
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
There's this thing like a guy like doing steel or some shit or something.

646
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And that in the robot show, you see like steel workers.

647
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
What America is is a service economy.

648
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You're getting a better sense walking through Universal CityWalk of what the whole of America is like.

649
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It's like people working at Sephora's.

650
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I mean, we I think we have talked before about how it's you can see in CityWalk taste changing from like,

651
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
oh, the candy store went away and now it's cupcakes and that's where it's yogurt.

652
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And now it's fancy doughnuts and grapes will always be there.

653
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Crepes will never ever create.

654
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Crepes will never subside.

655
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yeah, we all know the place that crepes hold in America at large.

656
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's never going away.

657
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I think that's probably just because of like the high number of European tourists that are walking through there.

658
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And like that's the option.

659
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Like how when you're in Japan, there's a McDonald's or something like that.

660
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Like that's the option of like, oh, let's not go crazy like and go to Hard Rock Cafe.

661
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Let's just get a crepe right now or whatever.

662
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Crepes and Belgian fries.

663
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That's the other thing in the crepe place is fries with a lot of dipping sauce.

664
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Yeah, with the mayonnaise and shit.

665
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah. Oh, and styrofoam plates.

666
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I know I talked about that on that sector.

667
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You are served a crepe, not traditionally easy to cut.

668
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I mean, you can cut it, but it's very thin and kind of spongy.

669
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And then if you cut too hard, you are cutting directly into styrofoam.

670
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Yeah, nice.

671
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It's literally the table.

672
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah.

673
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Is there more on the comic book story?

674
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Because I could die of a decent feel free.

675
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I just think when I was first coming to L.A. for like internships and stuff in school,

676
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I remember looking up because I lived down the road at the Oakwoods

677
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
and I was looking up what comic stores are close by.

678
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You were a child actor, right?

679
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I was a child actor.

680
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I was in the space show.

681
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
No, I can't even remember.

682
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Space cases?

683
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Space cases.

684
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Oh, that's right.

685
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Driving that little robot trashcan suit around to fit the suit.

686
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And I remember going like, wow, there's a comic store, right?

687
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
There's two like right down the road and one of which was House of Secrets,

688
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
which I ended up going to and still go to a lot.

689
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Which is probably like the sixth biggest comic store in the world.

690
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Just because.

691
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It's always busy.

692
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It exists.

693
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But I remember going, oh, there's one in another direction too.

694
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And then I like zoomed in on the map and I'm like, it's in the middle of City Walk.

695
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Like, because I had only known the Orlando City Walk.

696
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And sure enough, I was like, oh, yeah, this is a place.

697
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But I am wondering, I'm wondering, is there anyone who goes every Wednesday like that?

698
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Is or was like, well, that's my shop.

699
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I go every Wednesday.

700
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I guess if you work at Universal.

701
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I would say I theorize people that work on the lot.

702
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I theorize that perhaps now, not maybe now, maybe now that it's a new one.

703
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
But if there was anyone going every Wednesday, I bet it's like people that are working on the lot every day.

704
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And walk over there.

705
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So Universal president Ron Meyer looking for new comic properties to adopt strolls up the hill each week.

706
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
When they made the Night Thrasher.

707
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Do you guys know about this?

708
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I feel like I found out about this at an old job.

709
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
There was a Night Thrasher pilot with Terrence Howard.

710
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Wow.

711
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
A long time ago.

712
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I don't know if it ever got made, but there was like news stories about it in the trades.

713
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Jesus Christ.

714
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Yeah.

715
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Weird.

716
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
That's too bad. It didn't happen.

717
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I know.

718
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Well, fingers crossed.

719
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It probably will happen though.

720
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Well, if you make it to the end of the great procedure of trying to get things made in Hollywood,

721
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:30,000
then the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow potentially is having your work displayed at the Universal Cinemas Theater.

722
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Sure.

723
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And this is a place that has been home to many, many premieres over the years.

724
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And there's a ton to talk about with this theater, but that seemed like a very unique aspect to me.

725
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And here's what I did with my limited time on the earth.

726
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I went on Getty editorial images and I found photos of all the premieres that ever took place at the Universal Studios Cineplex Odeon.

727
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Now, the Cineplex Odeon predates City Walk.

728
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It was there before City Walk was built.

729
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I think we talked about many days ago.

730
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Back when it was all just orange groves.

731
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
There was no...

732
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You had to make it through a forest.

733
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Back in the day, you used either by Tropicana, Florida's Best, or Universal brand orange juice made in Hollywood.

734
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And avoid a lot of bees on the way into the theater.

735
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But if you made it, a great film was your reward.

736
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So I found photo this going through photo after photo.

737
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm going to have to post like an Imgur. Is that the name?

738
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I will post a gallery of all of the stolen watermarked Getty editorial images I found because...

739
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You should pay the license. Come on.

740
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

741
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Support artists. Support Getty images.

742
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Even though he didn't want to get his grandson back, we need to support the Getty's.

743
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Oh, is that Getty? Is Getty images?

744
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
That's a family.

745
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I never thought about that.

746
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
All these great, great old newspaper, the Getty's, the Hearsts, they're good friends.

747
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
A lot of fun.

748
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I love that they're all still around. It's just fun that we still get them around all the time.

749
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
They're still affecting our day to day.

750
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
American royalty. People say the Kennedy's. I think it's the weird old newspaper.

751
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The Getty's, the DuPonts, the Hearsts.

752
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Whose descendants all have a very specific breed. There are Habsburgs.

753
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Well, okay. So when I buy the licenses in perpetuity to all these photographs, which at about $500 each,

754
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
you'll see a gallery that's about eight grand total out of Scott Gardner's pocket.

755
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Get a Lexus Nexus log in.

756
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You know what I think? You guys should do an Indiegogo to raise the money for buying the pictures.

757
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So if everybody out there just pitches in a little bit, you guys can raise the eight grand to finally post these pictures.

758
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You're right. Okay. So go to Indiegogo.com slash OdeonMemories so we can do this all on the up and up.

759
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So check, look on Twitter and we'll have posted this once the goal's been reached.

760
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
But like, okay, let me just list some of the movie premieres that happened up there.

761
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Some of the finest films of the 90s and 2000s. We're talking The Quest, The Frighteners, Dudley Do-Wright,

762
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Brendan Fraser, Ed, Primary Colors, Live Action Flipper, The Battle of Shaker Heights, Project Greenlight season two, Cop and a Half.

763
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,000
We're talking, we're back, a Dinosaur's Story. We're talking Moe Better Blues.

764
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Was Peter Frampton at the premiere of Moe Better Blues? You better believe it.

765
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Ninja Turtles 3, well 2 and 3, but 3 had the added attraction of George Wendt in a t-shirt and gym shorts.

766
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Just dressed like he's sitting on the couch. So that'll be in the gallery.

767
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The premiere of The Lost World was up there. Was Billy Idol at the premiere in an Arizona Diamondbacks XXL t-shirt and sweatpants?

768
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
There's no way.

769
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Hate to tell you guys, you're all struck out.

770
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
What?

771
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Like the Diamondbacks never would.

772
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
It's gonna be no.

773
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And finally, the premiere of, I know this is an important film to all of us, Cole the Conqueror with Kevin Sorbo.

774
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Oh, sure.

775
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Of course.

776
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Foundational.

777
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Yeah, one of the big properties of our time. Of course you'll be happy to know Gene Simmons was at the premiere.

778
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And yes, of course, Kevin Sorbo rode into the premiere on a horse through City Walk.

779
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So if you want to see some of these photos, as well as some of the craziest fashions you've ever seen,

780
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:08,000
the entire band dishwalla at the premiere of American Pie wearing like mesh t-shirts, nipple-exposing mesh t-shirts.

781
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It's a hell of a gallery. So please donate today.

782
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But you know, this is, but the Cineplex is a place of the people. It's not just for big old movie stars and DuPonts.

783
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
They even give you the money back, you know, for the parking there.

784
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,000
The most generous vendor in all of City Walk, they give you, they hand you like a bill, right?

785
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
They give you like five bucks.

786
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
They give you cash.

787
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It's still going. This system is still going.

788
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:42,000
They changed it. They're trying to change it because they're like, oh, did you buy, when we went up last time to go see a movie,

789
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
they were like, did you buy the tickets on like movie, whatever, tickets.com?

790
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Or I was like, no, I bought them on Fandango. And they go, oh, nevermind, you're just going to have to get the $5.

791
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
They're trying to do it where like it refunds you in app.

792
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
But for what, but Fandango still has the old system of just throwing you a five.

793
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I like just getting the crisp $5 bill every single time.

794
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I feel like for once the movie industry is giving back to you.

795
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
What are some of your guys favorite memories of going to this theater?

796
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I'll say this. This is the theater in Los Angeles I've seen the most movies at.

797
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I go. We have seen. I wrote. We've seen like the last five Marvel movies there.

798
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Every movie that's like a big movie. It's almost a tenth of them.

799
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
But I've seen with Jack, we've seen DC movies there too. I've seen the Dark Knight there.

800
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I saw it. I saw my first screening of Batman versus Superman there.

801
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
That was big. That was huge. I got the best movie going experience of my life was there.

802
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Opening a night. And we mentioned him earlier. Opening night. Borat.

803
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:52,000
House. The audience. Loving it. So into it. It was so much fun.

804
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I'll tell you, similarly, this is not Borat, which I saw at Comic Con and had a similar experience.

805
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That was one of the most fun. Also the the Jackass movies.

806
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
All are just so much fun. Never skip a Jackass in the theaters.

807
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
But what I saw at Universal, which was a really fun experience, actually, was I saw Soul Plane on opening night.

808
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I still think Soul Plane is funny because of how much fun that theater experience was.

809
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Wow. I actually ran into Kevin Hart at the grocery store.

810
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
This was before he was very famous as Kevin Hart, like shortly after Soul Plane.

811
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And I was like, I like you in Soul Plane. And he looked at me like, really? And was like, thanks.

812
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,000
That's before, you know, the Kevin Hart, the luminary, you know, that towers above us today.

813
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You might have given him the gumption to keep going. I might have given up.

814
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You might have been down that day. Yeah, yeah.

815
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I'm trying to think. I did Mission Impossible 4. Oh, yeah.

816
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Max, which was 4 and 5 and 6. I did two up there.

817
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I want to say maybe my 14th birthday was MI2 at City Walk.

818
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Very, very pleasant. I saw South Park bigger, longer on cut at City Walk.

819
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I remember that, actually. I saw it was great with an audience.

820
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And also my mom was one of the moms that like brought other people's kids to see South Park.

821
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Without permission. So that was fun, too.

822
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
No, my mom took us to South Park because I watched it once with her and she was like, OK, this is good, actually.

823
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And then she was like, OK, I'll just tell them. I'll bring all your friends in.

824
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I used to go a lot. I'm sure they do something like this now.

825
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
But for a while they would do like the first show on Sundays with six dollars.

826
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Oh, so I saw like Coraline and Tropic Thunder.

827
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Sure. Casino Royale.

828
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Yeah, I just remember going because it was like cheap there.

829
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And I think AMC still does on like Tuesdays or something.

830
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Everything's but it now it's probably like it's only twelve dollars instead of 18.

831
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
These tickets have gotten so expensive.

832
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
They are literally like if you want an IMAX, it's like 27, 26 dollars now.

833
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,000
OK, we're talking about, you know, prices being out of hand, about the parking.

834
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Difficult about missing the quality of movies like Moe Better Blues and Ninja Turtles.

835
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I will say, Jack, you mentioned the Vista earlier. Vista still does 650 matinees.

836
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
We've got to get the stadium seating in there.

837
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
They have to, you know, rebuild the entire interior of the theater to my specification so that it's more like the Arclight.

838
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
There's only one way forward for the Vista.

839
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
But the only way that we're going to get a truly good movie deal is to do a little time traveling.

840
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Let me explain. I here's another thing I did while on while alive on the planet Earth.

841
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I went to on web dot archive dot org, the way back machine to CityWalkHollywood.com.

842
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And I discovered that in 2004, CityWalk had a movie and meal deal for 1995.

843
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You would get a selected menu item from one of CityWalk's fine restaurants.

844
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
You would see a movie. Yeah, there's a minimum two person.

845
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So you do it on you do it on a date. But 1995, a meal, a movie and an eight dollar parking rebate.

846
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And what I thought is that we should all together travel back to 2004 and pick out our individual ideal movie meal deals.

847
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So what I have with me, let me reach into my laptop case.

848
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I will distribute these. I've printed out from the way back machine.

849
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
If you could pass this down to Mike Jason. You said you had a lot.

850
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
It's all becoming crystal clear. Yes, you stapled papers together.

851
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I think that would be so much shuffling on the podcast.

852
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
A lot of black ink, too. Yeah, I wasted my own.

853
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So what you have in front of you is a list of all of the qualifying menu items and find CityWalk establishments that you could have picked.

854
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Choose one only and a list of the hundred top grossing films of 2004.

855
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Now, I don't know if these films actually played at CityWalk time, but let's make an assumption.

856
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And by the way, I'm no, you know, I'm no blockbuster big wig.

857
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
If there is a more obscure film of 2004 that you would like to select, feel free.

858
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But let's all say our idealized 2004 night. I'm going to go first.

859
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
So you guys have a second to look.

860
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I thought the most appetizing meal to me was the tradition, the classic combo at the Hard Rock Cafe of a hamburger with French fries and a coffee.

861
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Sure. Sounds great to me. And I will. And it's also the closest restaurant to the movie theater.

862
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Yes. Yeah. And get there because you weren't seat reservation was not so much a thing back then.

863
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So you have to be on time and I am going to get there and I'm going to see a movie I still have never seen.

864
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And what better way than seeing it in time travel is I'm going to see Tom Hanks in the terminal because I feel like I can really relate to the tale of a man trapped in a small retail area with limited dining and shopping options.

865
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So you don't get to bring in the meal with you. This is like you go for a meal at the restaurant.

866
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Yeah. It's a dinner and a movie and you have to you have to bring a date. So, you know, maybe keep that in mind. Maybe it's well it doesn't it doesn't have to be.

867
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Could be something. What year was this again? 2004. So feel free to apply if you were dating somebody at the time or if you just want to bring one of your bros. It's up to you.

868
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I think I was already in my 2004 girlfriend. She's she's coming along. Jenna. Let's have fun at the terminal. So you guys feel free to also say who you who you'd select for this.

869
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Well, I think I'm going to go with Carl Strauss and get the New Orleans dirty rice. Usually a solid food choice.

870
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I'm having a tough time deciding though whether I want to see Shrek 2 or The Passion of the Christ.

871
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Two movies I did see in the theaters. Yeah, I understand. That's a tough one. That's a pickle.

872
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Don't you have to see The Passion though? Yeah, I think I have to see The Passion of the Christ.

873
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Like we were talking about with Borat. It's like passion is better with a crowd. You know what I mean?

874
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
From all the hooting and hollering you're going to hear in the theater. It's fun to get excited.

875
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
You're going to be laughing as much at home as you would be in the theater. I'm going to laugh wherever I have the Shrek 2 experience.

876
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I could be on a plane and be having that experience. Who's going with it? Who's special to you in 2004? You want to take on a nice passion date?

877
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I'm probably just one of my high school roommate or college roommates. The people I hung out with in 2004. Hey, sounds good.

878
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Well, have a good time, guys. Mike, you ready?

879
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Well, I think I figured out. So I'm trying to really get in the head of me in 2004. That's like I'm not trying to do what would be fun.

880
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Now I'm trying to think where I was at. I was 20 years old. I had literally just gotten my first girlfriend. Oh, nice.

881
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:26,000
We were together and we were very into independent stuff. Oh, yes. We were into indie music. All the coolest indie music, all the coolest indie films.

882
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I think I know where you're going with it. So I think, you know, we're not maybe going to have a hamburger or a cheeseburger.

883
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:40,000
We're going to get something a lot more exotic like salmon teriyaki wasabi. OK, we don't just have like the normal meal.

884
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:49,000
We have something a little bit more creative and innovative. And of course, we're going to see the hippest indie film with the hippest indie music.

885
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I think I know what that is. Number 93, Garden State. That's the one. We are going to cheer up when the Fru Fru song comes on.

886
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:06,000
When he talks about his mom hitting her head on the dishwasher. When was this time when we were happy?

887
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And we're going to be like, that was good. Like that really kind of spoke to a generation. And that's a hell of a soundtrack.

888
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,000
The shins are wonderful. They'll change your life, I swear. And they did change our life. They changed it.

889
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I mean, you guys, I mean, it's hard to say, but could you like it was just adding up all the concrete ways that the shins changed all of our lives.

890
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Well, I did purchase Shoots Too Narrow, which was their follow up album.

891
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
The first album was like three years old at the point the Garden State came out, by the way.

892
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Most of those songs had been around for a while. The song was what? Carrying is Creepy. There's two. I forget what the other one was.

893
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
There's two on there. Am I going to have to pay royalties now? I got to pay Getty and pay the shins for singing all their songs.

894
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
The shins did a good job of like hitting all the parameters for like young men around that time.

895
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Because as somebody who's like not that into or knows about music, I know about the shins because of their music appearing in the anime FLCL.

896
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:15,000
No matter what type of weird little young man you were around the turn of the century, you were going to be aware of the shins.

897
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
That's a different, what are they called? I think they just use shins music in throughout the series, unless I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure they don't.

898
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Or maybe it's the pillows that are used. I think it's the pillows.

899
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Okay, well, because I was a big fan of FLCL. Just so long and cut this.

900
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:33,000
You can't see that. It's in a plex Odeon, can you? No, no, no, no, no. Probably not.

901
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's like you're back in 2004 again, fully, coolly progressive.

902
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Well, okay. So to start with, you know, I'm putting myself in my shoes when I was in 2004, just like Mike as well.

903
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I also don't want to brag, but I did have a girlfriend as well.

904
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
This would have been coming back to the end. Well, well, well, look at the billionaires.

905
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Well, this would have been coming to the end of high school where I did not date a single person.

906
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:05,000
And then right at the end of high school, I think for about like a couple months, I did find a way to get a girlfriend.

907
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
So I did have a girlfriend in high school and I'm going to beat you guys up after this.

908
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Scott had one that he saw twice. Oh, wow. In high school.

909
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Wait, oh yes, I was in a long distance relationship where I saw her once a year.

910
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
We just did a little fist bump over here. Long distance.

911
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So Nadya was a vegetarian who I joined the recycling club to impress.

912
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And so that just the fact that she's a vegetarian knocks out Gladstone, which doesn't have a vegetarian option.

913
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
It knocks out hard. Well, not a hard rock. It doesn't knock out a hard rock.

914
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Stuff there. There's some options there. You want to trade her something that's not a little better than a Caesar salad.

915
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,000
It's going to knock out Tony Roma's. It's going to knock out the Wasabi at City Walk.

916
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So I think that for us, we probably would have been going with Shanghai and Maine around that time.

917
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I think that I would have been very happy with the Mongolian beef or the sweet and sour chicken, any of the meat options, really.

918
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I guess I'll just choose the sweet and sour chicken for the purposes of this.

919
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And she would, of course, be relegated to the vegetable chow mein as her only option.

920
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,000
As far as the films we could see, I mean, it's also hard for me to pick to pick one as well.

921
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:32,000
But going with who I knew I was in 2004, I'm going to have to go with just the movie that comes in right after Mike's Garden State.

922
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:38,000
And that, of course, is Jersey Girl. I don't think I would have liked it after having seen the movie.

923
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
But being well aware of how big a fan I was of Kevin Smith around that time,

924
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I think I definitely would have checked out Jersey Girl.

925
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Was that the first film past the quadrilogy, the Quinn trilogy?

926
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Yeah, they had closed the book on the View-Isk universe.

927
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
The View-Isk universe was firing over.

928
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It's never coming back.

929
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And then six months later, it was back.

930
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Yeah, right after Jersey Girl.

931
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Right after Jersey Girl, coincidentally, he decided we're opening the book back up and there's more tales to tell in the View-Isk universe.

932
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Features the great Jersey specific of George Carlin saying, don't throw out that grease, I needed to cook the pork roll.

933
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
We all remember that.

934
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
A type of rolled meat specific to North and South Jersey and the Philadelphia area.

935
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I really like everybody's choices there. I think we're all having fun nights.

936
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
What's a great night, no matter what?

937
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:42,000
That's maybe a high note to take it out on, but I do want to wrap back around to the legitimate political quagmire that happened at this theater.

938
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Hopefully this isn't too much of a bummer, but here's what happened.

939
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Pre-City Walk, when it's just that theater up there amidst the Orange Groves, Boys in the Hood is released.

940
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And there was a shooting at City Walk, a non-deadly shooting, but the screening did not happen.

941
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:05,000
There was like gunfire before the movie even started, screening canceled.

942
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So then that was the first film, I believe, by John Singleton.

943
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
When his next movie, Poetic Justice, came out, the Cineplex Odeon refused to show it,

944
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,000
citing the previous example of what happened when we showed Boys in the Hood.

945
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,000
The NAACP was really upset about it. They reached out to LA Mayor Richard Reardon saying, what do you think about this?

946
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And he said, let business do its thing. If that's their judgment, that's their judgment.

947
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:42,000
The NAACP called Reardon's comments appalling. We can't just let business do its thing. Called it a blatantly racist move.

948
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And so, yeah, here you go. Actually, the cross-section of City Walk politics and films.

949
01:07:49,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Here we are. I mean, this has echoes that reverberate even today to cakes shops refusing to make wedding cakes for gay people.

950
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And then also, Sarah Huckabee Sanders not getting served at the Red Hen in Lexington, Virginia.

951
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I think everywhere at City Walk would be very cordial to Sarah. I think she can walk in.

952
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I think that there are some spots in City Walk that maybe wouldn't serve Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

953
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,000
If we had to eyeball it, yeah. Voodoo, I think Voodoo. Voodoo would not. They're progressive. Yeah, they wouldn't.

954
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:34,000
The Hard Rock Cafe. Love All, Serve All. They might have been poisoned by their own petard.

955
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,000
They have to. They have no choice. Margaritaville, she's fine. She's a queen in Margaritaville.

956
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Though Buffett himself is liberal. Yeah. But probably, but not so. But millionaire liberal. It's a big tent.

957
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:54,000
She probably wouldn't be allowed to do the iFly indoor skydiving because people would throw things at the...

958
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Yeah, to break the glass. I'd be worried that if she went to do the Zen Zone, that if the, though the very nice people at the Zen Zone,

959
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:11,000
they have some crazy tools and stuff they can ramp up and get going at full speed and they might be able to suffocate her.

960
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:18,000
They attached electrodes to me and they shot electricity through me. And then when I tried to put it up to 10, it was truly like I was being tortured.

961
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Oh, is that the... Didn't they used to have that at the, when it was the arcade there where Margaritaville was?

962
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Did they have what? They had like a chair that you would hold the handles and it was supposed to be electrocuting you.

963
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Yeah, I remember those in arcades. Yeah, no, this is like more like a holistic kind of massage thing.

964
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Oh, damn. Oh, gotcha, gotcha. It's literally like a thing that sends a jolt of electricity through your body.

965
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yeah. To relax you. So if somebody, if a Zen Zone employee was upset and took their anger out on Sarah Sanders,

966
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
they could crank some of those electrical implements up all the way. Yeah.

967
01:09:51,000 --> 01:10:00,000
That's the power that the Zen... We were putting a lot of trust in the hands of the Zen Zone people that they weren't mad at us about like our review of a previous Universal Ride.

968
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Like they disagreed with our views on what had we done by then, back to the future.

969
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Or they're like, no, we hate ET. How dare you talk about how much you love it.

970
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Scott, when you alluded earlier that there was like political stuff about CityWalk,

971
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I thought you were talking about the Universal Evolution Plan, which is constantly being updated and never fulfilled

972
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
about how they wanted to add extra lanes to Barham Boulevard and build apartments on the backlot.

973
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Oh, that's right. I would love to live in the backlot.

974
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
If you could live... The former spot of the psycho house.

975
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I would love to live in the exact place where King Kong burned down.

976
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Well, I believe they wanted to build them and more shops and a pedestrian mall on top of what is now the superstore itself.

977
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Oh, man. I was going to say that no matter where Sarah Huckabee Sanders got kicked out at Universal, the thing that I put forward,

978
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I theorized that no matter where it is, Chris Pratt would come to her defense.

979
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Chris Pratt, a member of the Jurassic family, I think would like make a comment being like we should welcome, you know, Sarah Sanders.

980
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,000
He's like famously a, you know, he sang Margaritaville at the opening of Jurassic World.

981
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Jimmy Buffett and producer Frank Marshall. So he might be hanging out at Margaritaville already.

982
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
When it happens. Also, I don't think we talk about this in this...

983
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
He might come up doing his dino hand stance and be like, let her eat, let her eat.

984
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Sarah, Sarah, it's me. It's me, Chris.

985
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:42,000
He also, by the way, worked at the not the city walk Bubba Gumps, but he worked at the Maui one, the one where my grandfather had a heart attack.

986
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I'm so sorry to hear that. Chris Pratt was literally discovered by...

987
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:59,000
He was being a Charmin waiter and a director. He was waiting on somebody who said, you know, I'm a director. Would you want to be in my movie?

988
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Was it James Tobeck? He was serving a table for Jeffrey Epstein. Discovered in Hawaii.

989
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
No, you know what's weird? Was it David Gordon Green? Because he shows up in one of those early movies.

990
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
The strange thing is it was Ray Don Chong, the female lead of Commando.

991
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Wow. Yeah. And she took him up on it, flew him out to L.A. four days later.

992
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
That's not true. That can't be true. He's in the movie and he was a waiter there.

993
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So what the fuck? Like you're just literally like come to like fly from Hawaii to whatever.

994
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
But this isn't a major film. Who knows what this movie is?

995
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You used to just sit at the counter at Schwab's Pharmacy.

996
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And then, you know. I don't believe that tale. I think that that's grown in the telling is what I think.

997
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Perhaps. Yeah, yeah. There's no way to know. But we do know that he would leap to Sarah's defense.

998
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Most of these stories, everyone leaves out like a rich parent or like a connected parent to like an agent or something.

999
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And then there's like just like this charming story where like I was living in my car and I didn't know somebody saw me and I waved to them and they said I look cute on screen.

1000
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:18,000
And then I was in a movie and my aunt told me to go to this restaurant, seek out this person and represent them.

1001
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
George Clooney was just in that studio apartment with his little pig.

1002
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Right. Iron Rick was just at the bar Mitzvah where Steven Spielberg discovered him. That's true.

1003
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Do you guys know that? That's true. That's a very yeah. His first Spielberg saw him in a video that was made specifically.

1004
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
That forehead needs to be on the silver screen.

1005
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
You always aim on that forehead.

1006
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
If you saw it at the City Walk IMAX, one of the biggest screens in the city.

1007
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:54,000
You know, the actual Alden Iron Rikes forehead was the size of a regular screen. If you watch it in IMAX, that's actually the size of.

1008
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:03,000
You can project a regular size movie in the movie screen. Move in solo on his forehead.

1009
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Well, let's get that event moving up at Cineplex Odeon. And with that, Jack Allison, you survived podcasts, The Ride.

1010
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
See, there was a ton there. I'm glad you could join us for it.

1011
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I didn't even tell the story about when I waited late at night at the GameStop before it was Things From Another World to buy,

1012
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I think, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. And so a comedy guy interviewed me in line for some like for like funny dot com or something like that.

1013
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And then tried to edit it to make me look like a fool for staying up so late buying a video game. What a nerd I was.

1014
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Comedy websites would never make people look foolish or take advantage of you. You have no experience with that.

1015
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I'm well guilty of it myself.

1016
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:53,000
That's what we do. That's the same. That's the same location where you got interviewed about the simulator ride.

1017
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Crazily enough, that is true. You spend enough time around that area in City Walk and you get a camera shoved in your face.

1018
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
That's just the magic of show business. I was just hanging out up at City Walk and somebody put a camera on me.

1019
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And before I knew it, I was a star. Yeah, I was a star of a funny dot com video.

1020
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I just wanted to go to Gladstones for some fried fish and I got caught up in a jaywalking segment.

1021
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:26,000
That's the gold standard. Funny dot com and on there like, you know, custom flash player that can't embed or whatever.

1022
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
That's kid stuff. Like jaywalking. That is that's really that's what we all shoot for.

1023
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
You want to get roasted because you don't know who like the 22nd president was.

1024
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Right. Exactly. Yeah. I want Jay Leno, of all people decked out in nothing but denim to call me a fucking idiot on TV because I don't know.

1025
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Can't name like all the Supreme Court justices in the 90s.

1026
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Yeah, that was the if you that was the World Cup of looking like an idiot.

1027
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Yeah. In for comedy. I don't know where you go now if you want to be a celebrated idiot without without jaywalking.

1028
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Well, Trevor Noah just plays a clip of you. It says like this guy looks ridiculous.

1029
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Yeah, you'd be lucky to get onto the Joel McHale show.

1030
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Maybe. So what has to happen is that somebody to do a video of you where you look stupid and that goes viral.

1031
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
And then you're on every show and then you're on every single show and everybody's got their little comment for you.

1032
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Yeah. And if it doesn't happen in a timely fashion, you're like crossing your fingers for next season of Tosh.

1033
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That's I mean, you know, it is that's huge. It's huge to get Tosh.

1034
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:49,000
But yeah, it's a little more on a longer timeline. You know, one time I made a little I made a video that was a sketch that was intended to be funny.

1035
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,000
It was on my YouTube and I got called by a Tosh producer who wanted to use it on the show as if it was like found a found object.

1036
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
He found it. Yeah. Yeah.

1037
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Hey, I'm a real Hollywood guy and me some rubes somewhere.

1038
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And he called me I was working at Funny or Die at the time.

1039
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I had a Hollywood job and he and this guy called me and and like could not have been more condescending on the phone, could not have thought I was more of like a Kansas kid.

1040
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And he was like, you know, so what we can do, we can pay you we can pay you one hundred dollars for that.

1041
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And I know that's not a lot of money, but you know what?

1042
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It's that's you know, maybe it's a little bit. You could buy a new camera.

1043
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And I'm just like, I like like I'm in the parking lots and, you know, hey, dog, you know, a lot of times with Tosh, though, they're they're just dealing with people who own a video they took of someone dying.

1044
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And so it's less like a personal investment from the videographer, because mostly they just took a video of somebody getting killed and then put that online.

1045
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Whereas you are just there like, hey, man, I think I'm down the street from the.

1046
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I can see you. I'm waving.

1047
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Are you sitting at the Daily Grill outside calling me?

1048
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I can see you, Jack. Thanks for being here. Anything you'd like to plug it?

1049
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:20,000
You know, well, not really. I mean, I do the struggle session podcast, which is at Patreon.com slash struggle session.

1050
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And I'm on Twitter at Jack Allison. Hello. Well, and, you know, there's all you know, I'm doing the Mitch live pretty soon, which is going to be that may have happened by the time this is.

1051
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Yeah, we'll have done Mitch live recently, which is like we're doing a brand new show that's based on kind of similar, you know, theme like another show we did before.

1052
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,000
But yeah, it's with Mike Mitchell, famously on the Doughboys podcast, interviewing people and all that kind of bullshit.

1053
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So, you know, enjoy it if it's happening. You're streaming that on Twitch. Are you going to archive it like?

1054
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Yeah, I think so. I'm not sure what we're going to do with that archive. I think we're going to have an archive. I'm not sure if we'll like have it live immediately or what the fuck.

1055
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
We'll throw it in the Bugman LLC vault or something like that.

1056
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Or if you'll play it, if you'll sneak in with a projector to the Dimex theater and play it on Alden's forehead.

1057
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
The next time there's an Alden movie.
