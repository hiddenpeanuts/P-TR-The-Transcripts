1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,200
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three men whose only problem with

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,620
going to the DMV is that the queue isn't themed enough.

5
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,120
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Scott Gardner.

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,320
Oh yeah, if you give us something to look at instead of just the ugly mugs next to me,

7
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,760
you give me a story, you give me an original DMV character, you make it seem like a mission

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,960
that I have to go on.

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,440
Yeah, and a narrative immersive with like, yeah, like either like a car that's not a Disney car's

10
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,840
car, but like an original DMV creation.

11
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,360
Oh sure, yeah, yeah, a talking car that's like, you know, like you don't get to get in me until...

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,000
Right, yeah, he's really cocky about it too.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Jason Sheridan, you have any thoughts on that?

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,240
I want someone in me.

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,520
Well, I would say I don't even need the theming if you were to have the DMV on just like,

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,040
another thing that's going to come up a lot today, massive scale.

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,120
If the DMV buildings were just gigantic, and I realize I'm probably describing a

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,400
bureaucratic nightmare.

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
So you want the DMV to...

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
1984 Brazil.

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,880
Oh, interesting.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,400
So you want it to not only have like a more of an immersive cue, you want an e-ticket DMV.

23
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,160
I just big, just like huge.

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Big budget DMV.

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,960
With like small rooms, big rooms, there's a cave, but then there's a big palace.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Yeah, there's little puzzles where, yeah, but it's a cave and it's got the lowest ceiling.

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,480
It's like the room we're in right now.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,240
Like it is a regular ass ceiling that you are traveling.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,560
So I mean, I wouldn't call this a cave, but yeah.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
You do like an eye test with somebody dressed as like a princess or something.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
They have like administer the eye test.

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,960
Sure, or any one of a number of costume characters.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,360
And then it would be like letters in a different like fun made up language.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,680
So it wouldn't just be the normal American alphabet.

35
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,760
Yeah, so it's testing your vision, but you also have to go by your gut sometimes.

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,960
And yeah, and spikes and ropes.

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,920
And if you drop the, if you pull the rope, you hear somebody fight.

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,080
The Indiana Jones, Q, specifically, it seems like is what we're just,

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,000
we just, all we ask is that the DMV be the Indiana Jones line.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,160
And it would be the most popular place, I think.

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,320
And we've really solved an issue here today.

42
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,920
Yeah, well, productive episode.

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,560
Yeah, we could stop now and it would be a great podcast.

44
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,920
But we won't.

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,640
Mission accomplished.

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,960
Yeah, because we got a whole thing to talk about.

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,360
Uh-huh.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,640
We have a good work here too.

49
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,320
We're globetrotting today.

50
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,240
We get to look at a nation we've never discussed anything from.

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,880
That's exciting.

52
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,520
I know it is.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,120
But let's bring our guest in.

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
She reviews films for the New York Times.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,880
She hosts the movie podcast Unspooled.

56
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,560
It's Amy Nicholson joining us.

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,600
Hi, everyone.

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,720
Hi, how are you?

59
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
I'm so excited to be here.

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
I want the DMV to be more like,

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,040
did you ever see that old Nickelodeon game show, Finders Keepers?

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,520
Oh yeah.

63
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm a big Finders Keeper.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,920
That's my favorite one.

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,800
That's my dream.

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,800
That's all I want Escape Rooms to be, is like a big giant Finders Keepers.

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,240
You get to tear through like dressers and drawers and upending things.

68
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,360
If you could go to the DMV and open Matilda's drawers and start rifling through,

69
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,320
try to find the magic pen that you need to stamp your card.

70
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
That's all I want is more action.

71
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,600
Yeah, sure.

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,880
If they can give you that on the way, then you forget the logistics nature of it.

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,480
If it's like Finders Keepers and some of the mess makes sense,

74
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,440
but some of it they just kind of need mess in bulk.

75
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,080
So there's just a drawer full of ping pong balls, just kind of arbitrary.

76
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,200
Yeah, right.

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,400
Well, that'll pop on camera.

78
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,200
I don't know why this young child's bedroom is a drawer entirely full of ping pong balls,

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,680
but why not?

80
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,080
Totally.

81
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,240
Or what if at the center of the DMV was a big statue of Gavin Newsom?

82
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,080
Now I'm merging it a little bit into Doubledare, but you had to crawl up his nose.

83
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,520
Oh wow, yeah, or fall out of his nose.

84
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,240
Whoa.

85
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,320
Yeah, and there's like goo in there.

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,920
There's like snot, like Nickelodeon slime and Gavin Newsom's nose.

87
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
That would be fun.

88
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,280
I have one more punch up to this.

89
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,120
What if you don't have to or get to have your driver's license at the end of it?

90
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,080
Let's eliminate the driver's license part of it, too.

91
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,000
So now what we're describing is a fun maze adventure without that boring part.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
I think we fixed the DMV completely.

93
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,400
OK, yeah, yeah.

94
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,080
So it has nothing to do with like handing out license or revoking.

95
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,720
No, because that's like, you know, after everything we've set up now,

96
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,240
doesn't that seem like kind of a letdown, like kind of not a fun finale?

97
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,200
Instead, it should go out on like a three minute ride or so.

98
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,760
OK, yeah.

99
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,720
Or hear me out.

100
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
What if at the very end, after you've like dug through the ping pong balls,

101
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,040
after you've climbed through Gavin Newsom's slimy nose,

102
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,040
what if they take a picture of you with whatever you look like at that state,

103
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,080
covered in goo, covered in pudding, and that picture has to follow you around for the rest of your life?

104
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,720
Whoa.

105
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

106
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,080
But it will like if you get pulled over by the police,

107
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,800
will they see like it would come up on a screen or something?

108
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,400
They'll be like, oh, you covered in Gavin Newsom's, sorry, Gavin goo, Gavin goo.

109
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,160
It seems like you already ran through it.

110
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,920
I'm going to let you off with just a warning.

111
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,080
I think, you know, everybody puts so much pressure on their driver's license photos,

112
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,480
and I think maybe it's that's actually a path to a better picture because you're caught

113
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,560
unaware, natural, having been through some really strange experiences.

114
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,920
But despite the goo, it might be a better looking picture of any of us than the one we actually have.

115
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,720
Yeah, you're probably right.

116
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,440
It's more you because it's like it's so natural.

117
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,400
It's a natural photo.

118
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,040
It's organic.

119
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,520
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080
Yeah, no, thinking they should make us all do it at puberty,

121
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,440
and that should be your online dating profile up until you find your person.

122
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,360
Because it's more if you see the real them coming out of the goo,

123
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
you see are they a frustrated person?

124
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,160
Are they overjoyed?

125
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,760
Are they gleeful, maniacal?

126
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,480
Yeah.

127
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,920
It's a really good shortcut.

128
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,880
A way to just like see someone's actual base in a way.

129
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,000
Wow.

130
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,040
Would anyone ever date again if that was the case?

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
Should we in the first place?

132
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,880
Well, that's a whole nother.

133
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,360
Yeah.

134
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,840
That feels like a good conversation starter, though, putting up like your high school,

135
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,400
your high school, like the fake gown or the fake tuxedo.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,840
They take the Velcro off you and then they put it on the next purse.

137
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Oh, you're saying you're calling it fake, the tuxedo you would rent when you go to prom?

138
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,320
No, no.

139
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,640
We did class photos and it was just like the false front of a tuxedo.

140
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,200
Wait a minute.

141
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,920
This is really weird.

142
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,200
I didn't know what you were talking about.

143
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,200
You just got a fake tuxedo.

144
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,280
Cancel the topic of the episode.

145
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,320
Cancel this topic.

146
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,280
Sorry, Amy.

147
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,240
You did a lot of research.

148
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
We're going to talk about Jason's fake tuxedo you wear in high school.

149
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:31,280
Well, because then it was like a fake gown and pearls for the girls and for the guys.

150
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,840
It was like if you went to an old time, like old West photo where like everyone's like a cowboy

151
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,560
or a can can.

152
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,560
That sort of thing where it's just like you put your arms in and then they Velcro off the back

153
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
and then they take the photo and take it off and do it to the next guy.

154
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,720
This is unbelievable.

155
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,160
Wait, have you ever heard something like this?

156
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,560
No.

157
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
Does it have a bow tie?

158
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,040
I want to make sure I'm picturing this.

159
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,320
Yeah, there's a bow tie.

160
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,560
Yeah.

161
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,600
Yeah, yeah.

162
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
But for the women.

163
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,640
Okay, there's kind of like a base of tuxedo, which that's strange enough.

164
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,880
You want your class photos in a tuxedo.

165
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,720
But then like women are going to want more variance in what they're wearing.

166
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,000
They don't want to all just be in pearls with multiple options.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,560
This is 20 years ago at this point.

168
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:16,800
Sure.

169
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,000
But I'm sure it went on for a little while after.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
But my question remains where there at least like here's the purple one and here's the

171
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,600
green one and here's the yellow one.

172
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,640
I don't think there was.

173
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Everyone was like dressed like Marge Simpson.

174
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,200
I think you would go up and you would do too.

175
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,200
You would do your formal one and then they'd give you like a graduation,

176
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,160
you know, mortarboard and they couldn't trust kids to wear a shirt and tie.

177
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,640
No, other schools did this where it's like you got to pick what you wanted your senior

178
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,760
photo, what you were wearing or what you wanted it to be.

179
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,920
So if you wanted cowboy, you could have cowboy.

180
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,800
I think you could.

181
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,080
You could pick if you did it yourself.

182
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Like it's like you can put in whatever one you want, but you're on your own if you don't

183
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,320
want the tuxedo or graduation gown.

184
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Okay, I have to back you up a little bit.

185
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,160
Yeah.

186
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,720
I went to an all girls school and we did have the pearl thing.

187
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,880
Yeah, we had a pearl thing and it was sort of like a black v-neck tunic that they draped

188
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,360
over us.

189
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,080
Yeah, yeah.

190
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,400
Yeah.

191
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,600
And then I brought my own pearls from my grandmother because I was like, I need this

192
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,400
to be a little personal.

193
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,200
But if you didn't bring your own pearls, wow, but bring your own pearls to the all girls

194
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
Catholic high school graduation.

195
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,920
I just realized how I sound.

196
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,800
But yeah, then you had the vest.

197
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
But because it was all girl, I've never heard about a Velcro tuxedo with a bow.

198
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,920
That's just blowing my mind.

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,760
I don't know how that would even fit because a drape is a drape, but a bow is something

200
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,480
else.

201
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,280
Yeah, like I'm sure if you look at them, it's like, oh yeah, there's like an inch long gap

202
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,320
on that collar.

203
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
How fast can you get us this photo of you?

204
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,120
Yes, well, before the episode comes out.

205
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
How many minutes will it take?

206
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,960
Well, we can just look, let's give him a week.

207
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,240
How many seconds does it take to you get?

208
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,360
Here's the thing.

209
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,040
If I do this, I'm going out on a limb because I don't like this photo.

210
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,800
I don't look good at 17.

211
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,160
On a limb.

212
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,840
In a fake tuxedo at 17?

213
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
I've got very small glasses.

214
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
My friends were encouraging me to get oval glasses, but no one said make it a little

215
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,720
bigger for your little doe face.

216
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Maybe go a little bigger on those ovals.

217
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,840
All right.

218
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,240
Can we put, we'll pay wall the photo at least so you know it's okay.

219
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,800
Sure, sure.

220
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,880
So on the highest tier on our Patreon, you can see this photo, I think.

221
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,440
Okay.

222
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,240
That's how we'll do it.

223
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,400
Then for Amy, I don't want to make you show us that photo of you, but I just, I do just

224
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,240
want to see a page from your yearbook with like 40 girls all wearing the same fake dress.

225
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
That's the weirdest thing ever.

226
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,200
I can easily get that for you.

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,680
Okay, great.

228
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,960
I can get that for you today.

229
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,200
Okay.

230
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,480
I'll give it to you for free even.

231
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,840
Oh wow, thank you.

232
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,360
No permission from the girls.

233
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,880
Doesn't matter.

234
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,920
We're not looking at your faces.

235
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,280
We're looking at your weird tunics.

236
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,640
Sorry, Kathy.

237
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,760
I'll just apologize now.

238
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,280
Wow.

239
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,600
Wow.

240
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,480
Oh my God.

241
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,600
I gotta calm down now.

242
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,760
Need to palette cleanse.

243
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,960
Yeah, I got too excited there.

244
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,520
All right, all right.

245
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,880
We have a different topic though today.

246
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,360
It's a place.

247
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,840
Here's the thing.

248
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,080
I was watching videos and I feel like I got the name.

249
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,920
I don't, somebody say the name of this place.

250
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,560
I've heard it like three different ways at this point.

251
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,520
Amy, do you know the actual name of this place because I don't feel it's secure enough saying it.

252
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,280
We're all putting ourself out on a limb by.

253
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,040
Before I came here, I actually tried to look up the pronunciation too and I heard three

254
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,440
different ways.

255
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,160
So I can only say it the wrong way, which is the way I've always said it.

256
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,480
Sure.

257
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,440
What is it?

258
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,360
Latte World Adventure.

259
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,760
Okay.

260
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,520
Latte is the way I heard it also.

261
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,280
So that makes me that was the last YouTuber who said it.

262
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,760
I saw multiple sources that are low.

263
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,280
I saw low.

264
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,120
And I maybe trust these a little more because they are in they are in prints.

265
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
They are in more official articles and the bloggers.

266
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,080
I don't know.

267
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,720
Do they know?

268
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,920
I think we just got to say anything goes.

269
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,320
Okay.

270
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,640
And listeners, if you live for listener knows for sure, you're going to have to cut all of us a break.

271
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,600
If you if you look on YouTube and you look up, you know, the latte Lotte Company,

272
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,080
there's a Korean news network and I saw three different anchors and I heard three

273
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,000
different pronunciations because the one guy was British, someone was Australian,

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
someone was Korean.

275
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
So I kind of got it every which way.

276
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,760
It might help if we go to the origin of how it was named this in the first place.

277
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,080
Yes.

278
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,640
Sure.

279
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:20,880
Yeah.

280
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah.

281
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,600
Sure.

282
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,520
Oh, wait and wait and just very really quick.

283
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,880
This is a theme park in I mean, it's a mega complex, but this is in Seoul, South Korea,

284
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
and you have been to this place.

285
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,120
I have I have I was there for a film festival and we took a day off and ran around and had the

286
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,760
greatest day.

287
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,320
Oh, geez.

288
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,560
Great.

289
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:36,880
Okay.

290
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,920
Very excited to hear about it.

291
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,400
But yes, the the backstory of the company feel yes, feel free.

292
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,600
Okay.

293
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,200
So Lotte is a giant corporation.

294
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,280
Like think about the giants that we have here in America and just ascribe it one of those.

295
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,600
I'd say it's maybe bigger than Coca-Cola, Walmart size.

296
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,120
It's huge.

297
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,440
Wow.

298
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
And it started as a candy company.

299
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,880
Part of the story behind it is that the founder is this man named Shin Kyokoh.

300
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,440
He grew up on a pig farm, you know, during the war.

301
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
He wanted to be a novelist.

302
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,640
But so he was very broke, one of 10 kids.

303
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,200
And he's when he's like a very young kid, he goes from Korea to Japan.

304
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,800
He smuggles himself over on a boat because World War II history,

305
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,840
World War II is about to start.

306
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,360
It hasn't quite started yet.

307
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
But they're, you know, under the territory of Japan at that moment.

308
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
So he sneaks over there on this boat.

309
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,640
He doesn't have a lot of money.

310
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,080
He tries to figure out how to make some money.

311
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,520
And World War II happens.

312
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,840
He starts seeing these American soldiers giving out gum to the people in Japan after it's over.

313
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,000
And he's like, I should have a gum company.

314
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,600
So he's like, I'm going to make gum, but I need a name for my gum company.

315
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,720
And because this guy is, you know, a young aspiring novelist, or he had been, he read

316
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,400
a lot of literature and he was really obsessed with the works of Goethe.

317
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,960
Goethe, like the novelist philosopher from the 1700s.

318
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,640
He goes up to Goethe is like a huge influence on Kierkegaard.

319
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,200
Why am I saying all of this right now at the beginning of this podcast?

320
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,080
No, no, it's interesting.

321
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,800
Oh my God.

322
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,840
And it's actually actually well researched and well presented information.

323
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,340
Yes.

324
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
We strive to, but we miss sometimes.

325
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,020
Thank you.

326
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,440
My pleasure.

327
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,720
So Goethe, you know, I also have down here that he's a massive influence on Mieche Young.

328
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,220
Okay, sure.

329
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,720
I just want to be able to say all these fun names.

330
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:34,160
Goethe, his breakout novel was a novel that was called something like The Sorrows of Young Werther.

331
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,360
And that's this love triangle where like a guy dies, spoiler alert,

332
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,920
but the guy is in love with a woman named Charlotte.

333
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,360
Gotcha.

334
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,880
Maybe you see where I'm going with this.

335
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,280
Yes.

336
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,040
So he loves this book by Goethe with a girl named Charlotte.

337
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,600
And he's like, I could take the name Charlotte and use it to be the name of my gum company.

338
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,000
So he cuts off the char and he goes with lot, I guess.

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,800
Lot, which again confuses it because it's a new way to say it.

340
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,720
It's totally a new way to say it.

341
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,200
Yeah.

342
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,240
But so that is how lots, latte, lotte.

343
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,040
Should we just pick one?

344
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,120
Yeah, I guess so.

345
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Latte though makes me think of coffee, obviously.

346
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,400
Yeah, that's a little confusing.

347
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,280
Lotte?

348
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,000
I think it's okay that it reminds you of coffee because that's the first time I came across it.

349
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,560
Right, right, right.

350
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
Because he expands really quickly.

351
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,200
He goes from like gum to booze, vitamins, hot dogs.

352
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,000
Canned coffee is how I first had him in Japan.

353
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,320
They sell a lot of canned coffee with the brand on it.

354
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,280
Then they expand further.

355
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,440
They go into like clothes, hotels, movie theaters, banks.

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,360
Chemicals, I saw.

357
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,800
It's a big chemical company.

358
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,400
Yeah, shipping, coordination of boats, electronics.

359
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,240
They own a baseball team.

360
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,320
This is just an everything company.

361
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,040
The most popular baseball team in Korea, I saw.

362
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,760
They own and made the biggest baseball team.

363
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,640
It's insane.

364
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
I had not heard this word before.

365
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,120
You just came across the brand name in Japan organically.

366
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
Yeah, but then if you start looking for it, you'll start seeing it everywhere here.

367
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,960
I mean, I live in Koreatown, so when I go shopping at my grocery store, it's everywhere.

368
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,160
But yeah, if you keep your eyes out, they're just massive.

369
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Their company headquarters in Seoul is like 123 stories.

370
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,320
It's the sixth biggest building in the world.

371
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,960
And this man, Shin, lives forever.

372
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,520
He doesn't die until January 2020 at the age of 98.

373
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,080
Setting up this secession style showdown with his two kids.

374
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,520
There's a lot of lawsuits.

375
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,480
He's actually sentenced to four years in prison for tax evasion when he's 95.

376
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,440
But they're like, you're so old and you're about to die.

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,480
It's cool.

378
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
This is the backdrop of Lotte World Adventure.

379
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,400
Wow.

380
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,800
Wow.

381
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,960
What a dynamic, exciting.

382
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:58,400
Disney is maybe the biggest company with theme parks, but this almost feels like some bigger,

383
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,040
more unfit, like Pfizer has theme parks or something.

384
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,080
Yes, yes, it does.

385
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
A big, weird, nefarious company.

386
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,160
It's almost closer to Comcast.

387
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,600
And that Comcast has a movie studio, a television network, internet and cable and phone service.

388
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
But if I can also...

389
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,520
The other thing about this company, I had never heard about this before.

390
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,640
And it was very fascinating to learn about this.

391
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,880
In South Korea, Lotte is a company called a Chebol.

392
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,600
And these are massive conglomerates that are controlled by one person or one family.

393
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,480
So again, very successionary.

394
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,360
Of course, this company, there was some money malfeasance.

395
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,480
They were raided a few years ago, investigated by authorities.

396
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:56,320
But I watched a Vice documentary called South Korea's Untouchable Families to set that up.

397
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:05,120
Because I think Lotte, it's not even one of the Samsung and Hyundai, or the massive Chebols.

398
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,040
And this one is big, but it is not on that level.

399
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,760
And the whole thing is that everyone is proud of these companies for saving the economy.

400
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,080
And by saving the economy, I mean in the 1970s, the government just went,

401
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,680
all right, you're doing cars, you're doing semiconductors, you're doing...

402
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,160
Just gave them money and power and stuff.

403
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,600
And so, I mean, it's a little comforting to know there's another country out there like ours,

404
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,480
where it's just like, oh, there's five big companies that rule your life.

405
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,840
Yeah, yeah, right.

406
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,480
Yeah, I know, with a particular, slightly different lineage.

407
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,440
And the weird factor of that, they love this, we owe the Chebols everything.

408
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,160
But then around the time that the founder of Lotte starts having problems,

409
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,560
there's a wave of, now we're mad at all of them.

410
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,080
Now we're going to try to root out corruption in all of these.

411
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Because not only is there the Lotte stuff, after which, yeah, so they decide,

412
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,680
never mind, you don't have to go to jail because you're old and falling apart.

413
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,800
Too old for jail.

414
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,280
But we are going to take your daughter, your daughter's going to jail,

415
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,200
and we have some questions for your vice chairman.

416
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,360
And like, oh, questions, really?

417
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,720
Yes, I'll be with you in a minute.

418
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,280
He commits suicide hours before he is supposed to talk to investigators.

419
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,560
So that all is happening.

420
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,800
And then Samsung, as you mentioned, Jason, the executive chairman,

421
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,240
the biggest person in Samsung went to jail around this time.

422
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
It was in jail for years.

423
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,040
I missed this entirely.

424
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,440
Samsung's a major brand here.

425
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,240
I never heard the story that the guy was in jail.

426
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,120
And then similar, he was not, it wasn't an age thing,

427
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,360
just at some point he was pardoned because like,

428
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,160
you are too important, you have to get out of jail.

429
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,120
So he is the fourth wealthiest person in South Korea,

430
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,880
was just in jail for a long time and also separately charged criminally

431
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,400
for illegally taking propofol, the drug that killed Michael Jackson.

432
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,640
Wow.

433
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,320
We didn't have to say what we know what propofol is.

434
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,720
Of course.

435
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,520
Yeah, yeah.

436
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,800
Conrad Murray heads here.

437
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,360
Yes, of course.

438
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,440
This is all some fucked up shit.

439
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,240
This is crazy.

440
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,560
Yeah.

441
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,440
And then there's like for every one or two that do go to jail,

442
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,880
there's like 10 more where it's like sentenced to five years,

443
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,480
commuted to three years probation.

444
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,160
Like the craziest one in the Vice documentary was the,

445
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,640
one of the family members of Korean Air.

446
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,680
They were in, it was, she was on a flight.

447
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,360
She was on a Korean Air flight.

448
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,040
She was served macadamia nuts in the bag, not on a plate.

449
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,360
And she demanded they turn the plane around.

450
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,400
And they did.

451
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
And then they did.

452
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,320
They did.

453
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,600
And she kicked off the head flight attendant.

454
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,320
And she got in real trouble because that,

455
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,560
the whole country was like, no, because this is like,

456
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,120
this is also a major safety hazard.

457
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,360
You're making a massive like 747 or whatever,

458
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,600
like do a 180 in the air and come back to the airport.

459
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,920
I just want to, like it is a blue satin v-neck tunic and pearls that I'm borrowing from SETI,

460
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,840
put on the idea of having that much entitlement that you would

461
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,080
ask to turn the plane around because your macadamia nuts are in a bag.

462
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,160
I just want to feel that power for a second.

463
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,560
Yeah.

464
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,120
Yeah.

465
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,440
Perfectly, it would never occur to me that bag is not the ideal setting for macadamia nuts.

466
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:21,680
Yeah.

467
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,120
Seems fine to put can perhaps those cans with the sharp lids

468
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,920
that I'm always worried I'm going to like slice my wrist on accidentally.

469
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,480
Oh yeah.

470
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,920
But I mean, I guess, yeah, if it's,

471
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,200
if it's like a bag is kind of like a peasant's way of eating,

472
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,320
you would never want to eat out of a bag if you're,

473
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,800
if you're a certain level of society, right?

474
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,240
Touch a bag.

475
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
I mean, it crinkles.

476
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,560
It's a filthy texture.

477
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,280
Now, you know what?

478
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,720
I'm against bags now.

479
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:46,960
Yeah.

480
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,920
You know what?

481
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Maybe I, yeah, I don't want bags either.

482
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,480
Maybe I want everything kind of like in a glass jar or something.

483
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,400
Like a glass jar seems like a classier way to do it or a diamond encrusted jar.

484
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,840
You know what?

485
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,160
Turn this recording studio around.

486
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,200
Jason certainly had a fit on a plane about nuts before,

487
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,280
but it was, he didn't make them turn the plane around.

488
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,680
It was just probably that weren't this story.

489
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,560
Oh, I'm just kidding.

490
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,800
I thought you knew something.

491
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,360
No, no, no, no.

492
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,480
Biscoff cookies?

493
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,600
Where's the peanuts?

494
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
I don't care if kids do have allergies.

495
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,640
Well, it would be funny if there's some viral moment with Jason that you didn't know about

496
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,480
that was online where he's throwing a fit about nuts on a plane.

497
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,760
It would like it passed.

498
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,060
Yeah.

499
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,360
No Scrapple.

500
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,920
Scrapple not available on this flight.

501
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,720
Eight nuts in this bag at these prices.

502
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,160
It was like an early viral video.

503
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,320
It was like an e-bombs world viral video.

504
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
I see if it was like a couple of generations ago.

505
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,480
Right.

506
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,880
Yeah, you needed WMV to watch it.

507
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,380
Right.

508
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,200
I feel like the biggest difference here culturally,

509
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,480
like yeah, we have these mega conglomerates and the ultra-powerful families.

510
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,360
I feel like I hear that plane story and I'm like in America,

511
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
that would never even make it across our desks.

512
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,800
It would be like, yes, sir, plane turned around.

513
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,920
No prob.

514
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,200
No one mad.

515
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,840
It does seem like there's a shared like consensus, like a shared,

516
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,000
what do they call it?

517
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,760
Like a reality because they interviewed some students who were starting either college

518
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,760
or getting out of college and they're like my three jobs I would like.

519
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,200
I would either like to be at Samsung or Hyundai or I think it was HK was the other.

520
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,640
They were just like fully committed to the hallucination.

521
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,120
Wow.

522
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,680
To the reality of like, it's very good to work for these companies

523
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,560
and they do so much good for us and it's just like, oh man, this is bumming me out.

524
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,680
But how different is that than people being like, I want to work at Google.

525
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,440
I want to work at Meta.

526
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,560
No, it's really not.

527
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,280
That's the thing.

528
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,480
We just have the issue that our companies like crash and burn and turn over more frequently.

529
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,360
These ones have been caked in.

530
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,860
Sure.

531
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:06,420
Yeah, we got one weird bank up in Silicon Valley and our phones might,

532
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,660
our apps might stop working on Monday because of the weird bank or whatever.

533
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,220
Is that right?

534
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,020
Wait, that's between now and when the list is sharing this.

535
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,540
That was like a month or two ago.

536
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,020
We passed it.

537
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,580
Oh, okay.

538
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,940
That was that bank that failed.

539
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,180
Yeah.

540
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,540
That was going to end our apps?

541
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,860
Well, it was just like, oh, a bunch of companies do payroll through this bank.

542
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,300
So like everyone at Vox is not getting paid next week.

543
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,580
Jesus Christ.

544
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,080
Yeah.

545
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,000
So it is interesting because it's like, everything is propaganda, but it makes it

546
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,960
feel more like this place is propaganda then as well, where it's like you like us as a company

547
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,480
and here's how much you like us.

548
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,040
You're going to go on our rides now and it will make you like us more.

549
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,040
Nothing like the American totally different.

550
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,680
Totally different.

551
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,200
We talk about week after week.

552
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,680
Totally different.

553
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,120
100% different.

554
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,320
It wasn't like the original Tomorrowland was just little exhibits from different companies

555
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,840
that were killing people with chemicals and lead.

556
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,640
It was pure.

557
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,320
It was the intention was pure.

558
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,600
They're not to advertise Monsanto.

559
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,480
Sure.

560
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,600
Yeah.

561
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,800
Well, so that's it.

562
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:15,320
Like, do you know any of this going into this place or is it just, hey, there's a weird theme

563
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,760
park next door?

564
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,760
I just know, hey, there's a weird theme park, but you start to get a sense that

565
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,000
it's very unusual when you arrive in this park is insult.

566
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,200
You can take the subway to it.

567
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,240
We took an Uber to it.

568
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,560
It's not like the hassle of going to Disney or something like that where it's in LA, but not

569
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,360
really in LA.

570
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,880
Yeah, actually better planned than any of our theme parks.

571
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,600
It's right there.

572
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,240
And when you show up, I thought we were in the wrong place because it's just a mall is what

573
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,640
you see.

574
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,920
Like you get dropped off.

575
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,960
There's this giant archway, a huge clock, and then you walk in and it is a mall.

576
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,480
There's a Chanel and there's a 7-Eleven and I kept thinking we must be in the wrong place.

577
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,960
And we're walking through this mall of just normal stores.

578
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,680
But every so often you see something weird that's like, oh, OK, there's a mural that looks

579
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,080
like it's from ancient Greece on a column, but it's a little cat girl and she's holding

580
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,520
a staff and she has a bow.

581
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,760
You're like, that's a little abnormal and I don't know what that is.

582
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
And there's a guy named Donkey Digger.

583
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,520
There's all these characters.

584
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Maurice and he's dressed like a Roman emperor.

585
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,800
He's a pig.

586
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,760
He's got a little mustache.

587
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,800
She's holding a bunch of grapes.

588
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,440
And you're going through this mall and you're just going down and down and down.

589
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,640
It's kind of my recollection.

590
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,680
Like you're going through escalators and stairs and thinking we must be off.

591
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,520
And then you go through a doorway and just kind of boom, you realize that you are in a theme park

592
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,720
and the theme park is in the mall and it's structured mall-ish.

593
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,240
You can stand on the railings and look down.

594
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:48,360
Kind of imagine maybe like a four-story spiral where you're at the bottom looking up.

595
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,920
You can just see all the rings of the theme park unveil itself to you like a seashell at once.

596
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,800
Interesting.

597
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,520
Did it feel at all?

598
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,080
Because watching videos, it almost reminded me of like Vegas, like the mall parts of Vegas.

599
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,800
Like it seems similar where it's like there's like, you know, sky painted on the ceiling

600
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,520
and then there's a very expensive clothing store.

601
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,200
But then you go and you're roller coaster your feet away.

602
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,040
Yeah, it definitely has that.

603
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,960
Well, it has that sound like the Vegas sound.

604
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,360
We know everything is just noisy and overlapping.

605
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,320
There's no store stores like normal stores.

606
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,840
Once you get inside the park of the mall,

607
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,400
there's no Chanel in the park.

608
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,080
There's just stores where you can buy, you know, ears for mascots who didn't seem like

609
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,120
they played a big role.

610
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,600
I couldn't find stories of the mascots anywhere.

611
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,920
But like I bought a pair of fox ears that had a cactus in the middle of them.

612
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,040
Whoa.

613
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,440
Yeah.

614
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,440
And I don't know who that was, but yeah, it was a nice little cactus, like a succulent type.

615
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,760
And my boyfriend bought Dalmatian ears.

616
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,560
My friend bought a cat that had a polka dot bow.

617
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,880
Um, and then what you start to see is like just tons of overlapping chaos,

618
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,360
because since it's not a theme park structured around a narrative or like the fairy tales,

619
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,600
like we have in Disneyland in particular,

620
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,880
it's kind of just structured around ideas of things that make you feel like you're somewhere else.

621
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,280
So there's ancient Greek kind of things, Egyptian things, French looking areas.

622
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,560
A lot of ancient Egypt is kind of the main theme.

623
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,440
A lot of that.

624
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,880
A lot of ancient Egypt.

625
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,920
Right, right, right.

626
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,400
Yeah.

627
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,800
Just to feel like you're somewhere else.

628
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,200
Yeah.

629
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,560
But all of them kind of clash in, especially if you have a view of this whole massive

630
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,120
like arena sized atrium, you're seeing like 20 different themes all jammed next to each other.

631
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah.

632
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,680
They're all just sort of right on top of each other in a way that's overwhelming,

633
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,880
but kind of magical because everywhere you look is just something fascinating and strange.

634
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,560
You know, a pharaoh next to a robotic dinosaur.

635
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,280
Wow.

636
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,760
Wow.

637
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,720
That's pretty cool.

638
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,120
I was going to say like that's the, we're always like,

639
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,480
look, we're always so upset when things aren't like separated in theme parks.

640
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,520
You know, we don't want like this.

641
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,800
They talk about like sight lines.

642
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,640
You know, if you can see a Comcast building in Universal while you're in Harry Potter or Mario,

643
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,360
it's upsetting.

644
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,800
You know, it's a theme park fans.

645
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,120
But also if it's like there's themes overlapping, you want everything sort of contained.

646
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,960
But this does seem interesting.

647
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,400
Literally everything on top of each other.

648
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,840
You can see it all at once.

649
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,640
That almost maybe is good in my mind.

650
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,600
I haven't been there obviously, but I maybe I do like that.

651
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,240
Yeah.

652
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,480
Yeah.

653
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,160
I like the mall aspect very much.

654
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,200
And that you get this, you got a giant mall walk before you're even

655
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,800
like the indoor nature.

656
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,880
I'm deciding how I feel about it.

657
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,680
I feel like in Japan, I got to do a lot of cool packed hyperactive indoor environments,

658
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:43,080
but there is something still like unsettling about it to me.

659
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,880
I don't know.

660
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,200
Did you feel anything off about the indoor nature?

661
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,080
Well, as a very pale person who sunburns and gets sweaty and Korea's really hot in the summer,

662
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,720
I loved it.

663
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,920
I loved it.

664
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,720
I loved it.

665
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,760
But yeah, it's discerning because you look up, it feels very brightly lit in there,

666
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,360
but you look up and there's these hot air balloons running around the ceiling.

667
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,280
But they're like light up rise that are attached to the ceiling on a track.

668
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,800
So you can take a hot air balloon and just sort of go around the entire upper part of the park.

669
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,440
And you can look down.

670
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,200
There's a there's like an ice skating rink.

671
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,480
So you can watch people ice skating in the summer while you're up on this hot air balloon.

672
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,600
That's on the roof.

673
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,320
That sounds good.

674
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,200
It sounds like if city walk had like a people mover on the top of it.

675
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,680
Yeah.

676
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,640
Wouldn't that be awesome?

677
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,560
Because we could see city walk from above.

678
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:30,760
Yeah.

679
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,360
We want to get all the beauty.

680
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,920
And I'm gonna say like, I'm a big fan of the indoor mall theme park.

681
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,240
One of my favorite places I've ever been to in my life is Kazakhstan

682
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,680
because their weather is either like extremely hot or extremely cold.

683
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,520
Where I was, it's like very high up on the steps.

684
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,240
And so most of their stuff is designed to be taken place indoors.

685
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,560
And one of their malls is shaped like a yurt.

686
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,880
And inside this year, it also has just like roller coasters kind of going around the top.

687
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,680
And then also a beach with like imported sand from the Maldives and water that you can soak in.

688
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,080
Wow.

689
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,040
It's incredible.

690
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,800
Like everywhere you go is just amazing.

691
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,200
Wow.

692
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,960
Geez, that's nuts.

693
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Have you been to Mall of America ever?

694
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,080
Yeah, I have.

695
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,200
Also a fan of that?

696
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,680
Yeah.

697
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,200
Yeah, with the cheese curds.

698
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,840
I don't know why we can't get cheese curds in Los Angeles.

699
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,760
So I've never had the cheese.

700
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,640
I've never been to Mall of America, first of all, but I've had cheese curds, I think.

701
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,600
Where they're like deep fried and all squiggly.

702
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,440
And it's like when you bite into them, they yell at you.

703
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,240
They make a sound.

704
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,120
They're squeaky?

705
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,360
Yeah.

706
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,480
You're backing me up on that.

707
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
Have you had Jason good cheese curds in Los Angeles?

708
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,920
Yeah, I have.

709
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:40,280
Because near where my mom lives, there is a very nice cheese shop run by Mennonites.

710
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,480
Oh, on the East Coast.

711
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,680
Yeah, on the East Coast.

712
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,320
And they sell both cheese curds and they also sell deep fried cheese curds.

713
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,920
And it is delicious.

714
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,080
It's like artery clogging, but it's delicious.

715
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,240
I've had them here somewhere and I don't remember where.

716
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,200
And they were okay.

717
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,000
It's catching on as like a bar food, like fried pickles, I feel like.

718
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,280
More and more sports bars, I feel like, have them on the menu.

719
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,200
Canada, a lot of that too.

720
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,440
Yeah.

721
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,000
Cheese curds?

722
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,160
Yeah.

723
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,720
I mean-

724
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,920
Did you have them there?

725
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,320
Yes.

726
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,960
Yeah.

727
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,080
Not my deal, but I'm glad I tried.

728
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,520
I want to imagine they're good because we all carry around cheese sticks like they're

729
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,400
something healthy.

730
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,960
Yeah.

731
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,520
So I don't see really the difference between a cheese curds.

732
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,160
You peel the cheese stick apart, you have these little curls.

733
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,640
Sure.

734
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,800
And then you get to put your hand in there and it's really fun.

735
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,920
Why don't I like the word?

736
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,880
I think curds is-

737
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,720
Curds is weird to me, yeah.

738
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,320
Like curdle?

739
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,880
Yeah, maybe.

740
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,120
Maybe it reminds me of the process.

741
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,800
Right, industrial nature of it.

742
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,960
Blood curdling scream maybe is added to it.

743
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,600
Yeah, it's close to some more negative words, I feel.

744
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,320
Yeah.

745
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,680
Okay, so maybe that's it.

746
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:40,920
Yeah.

747
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,880
But it's just cheese.

748
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,360
Plops.

749
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,720
Gone plops.

750
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,440
Cheese plops?

751
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,360
That doesn't make you think of anything else?

752
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,240
Not me, no.

753
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,960
What do you mean?

754
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,120
All right, we'll think of it.

755
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,800
The cutify plop and then we got it.

756
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,760
Cheese drops.

757
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,080
Sure.

758
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,320
When somebody has a blood curdling scream, does that mean that the person screaming is

759
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,760
having their blood curdle or that it curdles the blood of the people who hear it?

760
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,800
Oh.

761
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,200
Hmm.

762
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,160
Hmm.

763
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,800
Blood curdling.

764
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,680
I think that's a-

765
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,720
The quality of the scream would suggest that it makes people's blood curdle.

766
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,480
In the vicinity.

767
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,200
Yeah, I think so.

768
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,440
Right.

769
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,520
How does blood curdle?

770
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,440
It's a good question that I-

771
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,200
I've never broken this phrase apart.

772
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,400
Yeah, I don't know the answer to that.

773
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,000
What is that, biological process?

774
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,160
Yeah, how do you curdle blood?

775
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,120
Yeah, does it literally happen?

776
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,240
Does it like harden, thicken, become more of a gravy texture?

777
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,640
I guess it would kill somebody if your blood curdled.

778
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,320
Yeah, if all of it did.

779
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,800
Right.

780
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,360
At once.

781
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,720
Yeah, so if it's a blood curdling scream, it could make the screamer

782
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,800
curdle and it can make everyone around them curdle.

783
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,560
So it's sort of like a self-inflicted banshee wound?

784
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,800
Hmm.

785
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,300
Yes.

786
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,000
Nice.

787
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,360
Wait, so where- wait, wait, wait, banshee wound is very specific.

788
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,240
Because the scream of a banshee would kill-

789
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,600
Yeah, it kills you, right?

790
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,520
Kill or wound or maim at least.

791
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,920
Yeah, but could- but does a banshee scream curdle blood or does it do something else?

792
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,200
Does it like blow out something in your brain or you have an aneurysm or something?

793
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,480
I-

794
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,200
It's so loud.

795
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,480
As somebody a little Irish, I feel like I should know this.

796
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Well, Jason and I don't know anything other than we know that the X-Man banshee-

797
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,440
Yeah, I've been thinking about banshee and his daughter, Siren, who's also-

798
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,760
They both have similar screaming powers and we know that that can just hurt-

799
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,080
I think they can adjust the level of scream so they could just stun their opponent.

800
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,560
Yeah, they can use it to stun, they use it to fly.

801
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,520
Yes, they can also scream-

802
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,560
Don't look into that.

803
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,360
We don't know exactly how it works, but they have like little wings on their costume

804
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,040
and they fly with the scream as well.

805
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,440
Yeah.

806
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,880
I wonder if they screamed at a cow, if they could curdle the milk inside the cow

807
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,320
and then they could make the cheese curds?

808
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,040
This is- this is a good idea.

809
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,880
This is a Mythbuster-

810
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,160
That's a very good- I like the unique use of powers,

811
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,600
because I'm sure that's never been done before in the comics and it's been 70 years of whatever,

812
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,480
50 years of X-Men? How many years?

813
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:01,720
Sure.

814
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,640
I mean, very many years.

815
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,200
60, yeah, 60 I think.

816
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,400
I think like 60.

817
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,720
If you guys don't know this, then who will?

818
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,560
Well, X-Men is the late 60s, right?

819
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:17,080
I just watched an anniversary livestream and I don't remember the number plastered all over it.

820
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,720
We don't want to remember because it will say how old we are.

821
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,760
It reminds us how long we've been looking at these comics.

822
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,360
You want to hear X-Men is-

823
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,680
X-Men.

824
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,240
15 years.

825
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,840
15 years of the X-Men.

826
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,720
Right, yeah, yeah.

827
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,040
It's also going to get overshadowed because 1963 is the first Avengers too,

828
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,760
and they're like, you know, they're going to get all the love because they made so much money.

829
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,440
They're so popular, you know?

830
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,960
Right, everyone loves the Avengers.

831
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,240
The biggest event of 1963 was the starting of the Avengers.

832
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,640
Yeah.

833
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,360
Of course, for-

834
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:46,840
Lasting.

835
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,560
The most important event in film, maybe, you know.

836
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,800
Can't wait, bring them on.

837
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,760
I think you've written before you want three times the amount of Marvel movies coming out of a year.

838
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,800
You said it's not enough.

839
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,560
It was the headline on one of your articles.

840
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,000
I'm just very excited that I feel like when I look at the landscape, they are dying,

841
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,800
and it's wonderful.

842
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,680
They're definitely dying out, and it is time.

843
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,320
Not because, even if like-

845
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,600
Well, we have the comics.

846
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,560
I have the comics.

847
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,240
I still have the comics I wrote when I was a kid.

848
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,120
So I'm not like, if the movies go away, it's okay.

849
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,240
They're not going to go away, but if they go away, it's okay.

850
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,280
Also, if they don't go away, just something else too, I think is the-

851
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,680
I think it's the cultural monopoly that is the-

852
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,160
Of course.

853
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,800
The irritating thing.

854
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,480
If they were to keep doing that in their corner, but also there's lots of other more

855
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,000
inventive movies to check out.

856
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,040
The only thing that Marty Scorsese said, which made me more excited about the movies,

857
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,560
is he called them theme park rides.

858
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,120
Yes.

859
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,920
And I was like, yes, he's right, more, more.

860
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
What he intended as an insult.

861
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,320
I know.

862
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,560
Yeah, little did he know that Marty, that's the problem that we're not getting enough

863
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,800
theme park attractions of these movies.

864
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,640
They all get delayed and cut.

865
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,800
E-ticket, we want more E-tickets, Marty.

866
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,080
Well, and Mike, that was a little like Carol Burnett telling you on her ear,

867
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,680
that was a little message to you because you're friends, you call them Marty, like you're buddies.

868
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,200
Of course, yeah, me and Marty.

869
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,880
Just like Marty Short.

870
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,320
I don't know if you know this, we're friends, so I say Marty.

871
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,280
Yeah, yeah.

872
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,920
Very casual.

873
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,880
Okay, to go back to your journey into getting through the rungs of this multi-tier,

874
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,160
what is it, like it's four stories, the theme park part?

875
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,880
Yeah, it's four stories, and if you took a different turn in the mall,

876
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,320
you could go to an aquarium that's on a different side that I never saw.

877
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,360
Or there's also like a folk museum, which I didn't get to, but I think it's sort of

878
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,080
mannequins of different clothing periods throughout Korean history,

879
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,680
something like that is maybe my guess.

880
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,720
Wow, and this, yeah, the entire property by the way, yeah, there's the ice,

881
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,480
there's a classical concert hall in this facility too.

882
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:59,800
It is the largest cinema in Asia which boasts the biggest non-IMAX screen on Earth,

883
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:06,360
like the biggest regular screen, 35 millimeter, so that's, there's a lot of biggest throughout

884
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,600
this entire, because that skyscraper also is like the highest observation deck,

885
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:15,320
and this is the, Lotte World is the biggest indoor theme park, and like

886
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,360
just biggest record breaking throughout this thing.

887
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:24,040
Well, the ice skating rink is huge. It's got a giant glass ceiling a few stories above that,

888
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,520
letting in all this natural light, but then there's so many parts, like watching videos,

889
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,120
there's so many parts of this park that feel very intimate, again, because of the low ceilings.

890
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:39,560
There's like gift shops or some attractions where it's just like normal room size ceiling.

891
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,200
Yeah, normal. They have a panda express there if you get hungry.

892
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:51,640
It's sort of like being in a mall panda express, except it's classier. It's sort of brown, nice wood,

893
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:59,160
a little beige. It's got a sign that says like established 1983. It had two giant stuff pandas

894
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,520
in the front, so that it's just a little bit of like normal inside of the chaos.

895
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,320
Did you eat there?

896
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,360
Yeah, I did. I went to, the first thing we did is when we got there, we had ice creams at this

897
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,840
place called the Pharaoh Snack, because that was right by our first ride, and we got giant soft

898
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,800
serve cones. I feel like mine was grape or raspberry. I can't remember because we found

899
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,080
out very quick that the lines were short, which I've heard online that the lines are like crazy

900
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,600
long, but when we were there, there was almost no wait at all. So I bought an ice cream thinking

901
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,480
we were going to be in line, and then immediately they're like, you're on the ride and you can't

902
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,400
have that ice cream. So all of us were just holding ice cream, and we shoved them completely

903
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:42,200
into our mouths. It got through it, which was fine. But the meal that we had was from a place

904
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,200
that specialized in hot dogs. And so, you know, they have like the plastic hot dogs outside,

905
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,800
so you can pick which one you wanted. And I got this one called the white snowing,

906
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,840
and it was covered in a white cream that I believe was garlic because they have a hot dog also called

907
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,520
the crunchy garlic. And so it had all of that, but then also just powder that I think might

908
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,960
have been Parmesan cheese. It was a little bit hard to distinguish, but it was beautiful.

909
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,720
My friend got the bulgogi dog, which is gorgeous. They had one that had kind of the

910
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,120
rice cakes, I think, on it. Wow. These are extremely innovative hot dogs, an area where often

911
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,760
I find innovation is lacking. Yeah, well, lacking, but also then you try innovation and it's

912
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,800
not well executed and unwanted on my part. Yes, that's true. I mean, hot dogs of the month that

913
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,680
one Disney bar, those are the bad news. We went to Disney. We did an episode last year and we ate

914
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,040
every hot dog at Disneyland. They're all the same base dog basically. And then they just throw a

915
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,520
lot of crap. You ended up just like in basics, more so, but these sound like you sound like they

916
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,520
may have mind blowing. These are good. These sound like good conversation pushing forward.

917
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,160
They're much more innovative than the ones Disney had. Yeah. Korea is the innovator of hot dogs,

918
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,360
right? Corn dogs, right? Corn dogs are very intense. That is a true thing about Korea.

919
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,200
I don't think I know this. Oh yeah. Like if you go even here to the Koreatown mall, it's like at

920
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,400
fifth and Western, they have a really good corn dog place. It's like at the studded

921
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,240
french fries that are embedded in it. They're really textural kind of modern art looking hot

922
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,520
corn dogs. Whoa. Yeah. Door boys just did a place. I forget what it was. They just reviewed a place.

923
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,240
I should look it up, but yeah. When I wasn't even really that familiar with the corn dog phenomenon.

924
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,720
Yeah. There's a whole world. I mean, Korea is just really innovative. I feel like that will be one

925
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,960
of the, well actually no, and I'm going to take that completely back because everything in latte

926
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:43,080
world is such a direct rip of Disney. It's enchanting. It's enchanting. It's yeah,

927
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:50,280
it is strange how stuff is either like, Oh, that is a gag directly from the Indiana Jones ride.

928
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,560
But then there's other things where it's like, yeah, this is so much of everything. You can't

929
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,080
say it's a rip off because it just is all things, you know? Yeah. It's such a mashup. And like,

930
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,440
you should say that, you know, Shin himself, the founder of Lotte world has kind of a history of

931
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,160
taking things and making them his own. Like there was this huge fight when he was getting the candy

932
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:17,080
company off the ground where, you know, Pocky, the chocolate dip sticks. Sure. They accused him

933
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,800
of stealing the idea of Pocky to make his own company, which he calls Pepero. They're also

934
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,800
just chocolate dipped sticks. Huge fights back and forth. And he wound up winning because he,

935
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:34,040
I believe blocked Pocky from being sold in Korea. Whoa. Yeah. And then he formed a holiday called

936
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,680
Pepero holiday, which is a holiday in Korea where everybody buys his and gives them back to each

937
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,840
other. So he's I feel like we could just say he stole Pocky. Yeah. Probably like he's not going to

938
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,040
his ghost isn't going to sue me, but yeah, steals it, makes it his own, becomes incredibly successful.

939
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,240
Wow. That's all of a move also, like started that word. All right. It's Eminem day in America and

940
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,040
you have to buy Eminem and exchange them with others. That's interesting. Even just about

941
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:05,720
like copyright, whatever, like food. Like I'm, I'm, I should look into it because it's interesting

942
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,280
to me how like you can sell the same cereal and just call it something else. And it's like a

943
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,600
little bit different. Like it just tastes a little bit off of like rice crispies and just call it

944
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:20,200
like crispy piece, crispy pieces, not crispy pieces. That sounds bad, but there's gotta be a better

945
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,600
until you think of one, call Chris crispies with a C and then like a Z at the end. Yeah. Well,

946
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:32,600
spies like the store brand of frosted flakes is sometimes called frosted flakes because it's just

947
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,800
a description of what you're selling. I think. Oh, that's interesting. There's one or two where

948
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,720
it's just like, they get away with the same name because it's just a phrase. That's interesting.

949
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,760
Oh, wow. I mean, I wonder if there is, you know, like there's a movie that just came out, Guy

950
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,920
Richie's the covenant. If like, does Kellogg say like Kellogg's frosted flakes and the possessive

951
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:01,400
makes it singular. I think that's right. That movie also like, it doesn't, that's one that doesn't

952
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,800
feel like a real movie. I guess, cause I feel like doesn't, hasn't Guy Richie had like two or three

953
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:14,600
movies out lately and this feels like a faith flicks movie or he had operation fortune.

954
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,720
Ruse de Guerre. I think that's what it was called. Sure. Right. Yeah. And this is very serious one.

955
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,280
It's actually pretty good. Oh, yeah. I was startled. I had to review it and I was like, here we go.

956
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:31,880
No, it's really effective. It's very flawed, but powerful. Oh, okay. I was proud of Guy Richie. It's

957
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,040
getting over the top positive reviews because everybody's like, I can't believe Guy Richie made

958
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,320
a good film. Have you ever seen the film that he did with Madonna? We just watched that.

959
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,640
Oh, swept away. No, I've never seen that. I was trying to explain that to my girlfriend

960
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,520
recently because she was talking about Madonna's boyfriend or husband or something. I was like,

961
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,920
but she divorced Guy Richie along swept away and just her eyes glazed over while I was trying to

962
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,720
remind like, no, swept away. Remember it was real bomb for both of their careers.

963
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,080
It's wild. Like I love Madonna. So I'm coming into this from that direction. But when you watch that

964
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:13,720
movie, you just think he hates his wife. Like he hates her. She's never been filmed to be unattractive

965
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,920
in the way that that film shoots her to be unattractive. Even when her character is

966
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,720
supposed to be hot, he films her like she's a witch and it's just hostile and mean and everything

967
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:28,520
about her is terrible and in a way that has no warmth to it at all. And it's not supposed to be,

968
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,640
I think, as bad as it is. It's just, it's so toxic when you watch it. And I can't believe that she

969
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,280
didn't like divorce him as soon as she saw the first daily. Maybe she never saw one. No, actually,

970
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,000
no more room in this theater. I see some chairs. No, don't worry about it.

971
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,840
Recently, I was like, this person's wife is in this movie and they've been written to be

972
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:54,120
the meanest character I've ever seen. Now I want to take a guess. I feel like I have a guess.

973
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,400
Go ahead. Is it Jed Appetizer?

974
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,280
Yeah, that's not who I was thinking about. But that's a good thing.

975
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:09,080
Well, no, Jed writes all these great moments where his wife gets to have fake sex with

976
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,640
many of Hollywood's hottest leading men. I'm not sure what that one says.

977
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,720
That's a trade off. The character might be mean, but at least there's a hunk involved.

978
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,240
So that's good. And neither of these instances,

979
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:27,640
though, are when someone, they make themselves very ugly or very mean or they're going through

980
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,080
such struggle to try and win an award. It's not that presentation.

981
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,680
It's definitely not that. It's definitely not that. It's definitely that. It's like she could be,

982
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,760
because part of the story is about she's marooned on this desert island with just this hunk

983
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,760
who she's mean to relentlessly, so mean to him, and then he's mean back.

984
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:47,560
But she's in full sunlight and he somehow figures out how to shoot her so that her

985
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,440
face is covered in wrinkles. And he's like, that's going to be hard to do.

986
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,200
A beautiful woman on the beach. Yes. How do you arrange it with the worst harshest? Who's the hunk?

987
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,760
It's this guy whose dad played the hunk in the original version of it, because it's based on

988
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:08,520
Alina Wirtmuller film from the 70s. That's supposed to be about toxic masculinity and

989
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,040
domination. And it's a really tricky, brutally ugly film. And I like the idea that Madonna and

990
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,560
Guy Ritchie were probably watching this movie, like in his movie theater and talking about it.

991
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,280
Or it's because I don't know why else you'd make this movie and then had the idea to do it.

992
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,800
And then it was just cruel and punishing and terrible. But they watched art house films

993
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,880
together is my theory, which is lovely. It makes them feel like me and my boyfriend watching

994
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,280
Criterion. And I appreciate that. And if you picked one and said, let's let's do it.

995
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,880
Yeah, they got the son of the guy from the first movie to be the guy in this movie. I don't think

996
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,520
he really ever made that many other films. That's a really strange guess. I've never seen this.

997
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,920
You know, I guess I don't know. Maybe there's something up with Guy Ritchie's eye because

998
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,600
maybe it's just me. I thought that his presentation of Will Smith's Jeannie looked really ugly and

999
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:03,000
weird. I forget. I forget that. Yeah, that happened that we saw it, that we did an episode on it.

1000
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,600
Went to a theater. Yeah. We reviewed it for the show. Yes. That's right. You couldn't go to that

1001
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,880
was one of those. Now you can't go to a movie theater. And before we could just like waste time

1002
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:20,280
on this. We saw we paid money. We visited a place to watch that. There are a lot of positive

1003
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,000
memories from 2019 for whatever reason, that one doesn't bubble to the top.

1004
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:34,360
You're kidding. Yeah. OK. OK. The theme park. OK. So now we've gotten your your you had to down

1005
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:41,240
a popsicle later on. You had some ice cream hot dogs. OK. Yeah. But now you're OK. You were

1006
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:46,120
tired. Rides. Let's get into rides a little bit. What was the what was that first one you were

1007
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:52,200
about to go on? Yeah. The first one that we went on was a ride called Pharaoh's Fury. Yeah. Yes.

1008
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:57,320
And Pharaoh's Fury is probably the showpiece ride there. It's like a really elaborate one.

1009
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:02,120
And it is just you enter like it is the Indiana Jones ride. You know, there's fair. There's a

1010
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:07,560
hieroglyphs everywhere, really setting the tone. You get into a Jeep. The Jeep has a steering wheel

1011
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,720
that you could pretend like you're driving. And it even kind of kicks in with a little blast of

1012
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:17,320
like the John Williams horns. But it's all Egyptian themed. And you're just kind of driving

1013
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:22,600
around and there's like crocodiles and dragons and like the blasting air dart kind of gun thing.

1014
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,160
Oh, you got that. All right. And creepy shadows on the walls. And I swear, as I was riding it,

1015
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:33,960
I felt like we were taking the same turns and drops as the actual Indiana Jones ride. Like it

1016
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,560
didn't just feel like it was taking the idea of it. It really felt like somehow they had a blueprint

1017
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:46,120
of the track. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. It's you can't copyright a little shape. You can't copyright a

1018
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,280
road shape. Yeah. But it really felt like it had those same kind of mirrors. There's a part where

1019
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,160
you think this giant thing is going to fall on top of you, sort of like the rolling boulder,

1020
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,760
and it plummets down. It pretends like it's crumbling around you. So you start hurrying

1021
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,280
and jerking back and forth. And, you know, the whole theme park is really obsessed with the color

1022
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:09,000
neon purple. So there's a lot of like neon purple lighting and stuff to make it feel a little

1023
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,600
distinctive. But yeah, it felt like it felt like I guess it felt like the Indiana Jones ride.

1024
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,480
This ride is to the Indiana Jones ride as like if you were in the 80s and a kid wearing like a

1025
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,360
mask of Indiana Jones was trick or treating at your door. That's sort of what it felt like.

1026
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,200
I guess maybe it would be like if Harrison Ford was trick or treating at your door and he was

1027
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:37,720
wearing a mask of Aladdin. Right. Sort of like that. You're confused. Now I'm very confused.

1028
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,720
That's the effect. But it was awesome, honestly, to like be in a mall and then be on this ride.

1029
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,680
And I still don't quite understand, even having been there, where all the track is in the mall,

1030
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,240
because you just see the entrance from kind of the archway of it. And it's just there. And I

1031
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,480
don't know where the track goes. It feels like a magic trick. Like you just sort of disappear into

1032
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,920
a portal. Yeah, I can't remotely think of the physical layout of this place. Now it works

1033
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,880
because every ride through I watched, like how do they have that too? Wait, so this ride goes

1034
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,760
way up into the rafters. But then also there's a rapid ride. I don't know if I've ever seen an

1035
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:18,200
indoor rapid ride. So where the hell does that go? And then there's a whole like underworld area. And

1036
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,760
I don't like my mind is boggled by thinking about this all fits in. You have to like build the

1037
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,280
structure knowing all that was you can't like add on as much. It feels like that. Seemingly. Yeah.

1038
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,360
Like Disney can add on because it's land and it's outdoors. This ride, you mentioned Indiana Jones,

1039
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,960
there's a moment, there's a gag they do in this where you're in a dark section, there's bugs on

1040
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:46,520
the walls and the headlights flicker on that is one for one from Indiana Jones. Yes. But that said,

1041
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,080
there's a moment in this ride where you're going into a big statue of Pharaoh's mouth at some point.

1042
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:56,440
And there's like a projection above you that like draws the eyes up. And then there's a roller

1043
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:02,040
coaster style drop. And I don't think I've ever seen that before. Oh, it reminded me of the boulder

1044
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:08,120
drop. But yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. I put it. Okay. Yeah. That makes sense to me. It does that similar

1045
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,480
gimmick where it draws your eye up and then the drop is below you. And I will say there's a lot

1046
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:21,640
of rides here that are focused on going in and out of people's mouths. Yeah. Well, I saw this crazy

1047
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:29,720
clown train kind of situation. Fantasy dream. Yeah. Did you go on that? That's my favorite ride.

1048
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:35,400
Oh boy. I was going to save it for the last one. We can save it. Also, up to you. If you want to build to it.

1049
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,200
I'm happy to talk about it. I'm happy to talk about it. I do want to say really quick. So we're

1050
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,760
talking about the indoor part of the mall, right? Yeah. I didn't know until the very end, maybe an

1051
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,600
hour before the park closed that there was an outside part of the mall that there's this place

1052
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:54,040
called Magic Island, which is connected to it. And when you exit through the bottom of the mall,

1053
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,680
I think it was, then it opens up and you're like, oh, there's Sleeping Beauty's castle.

1054
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,600
And it just is the castle, but it's all lit up. And I've seen online call it Magic Castle. But

1055
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,160
we saw there, I think it just said Hotel Castle on the sign for my pictures.

1056
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:17,160
It is just the castle all lit up. Yeah. And then it is so, that is the most Disney world ripoff

1057
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:24,120
aspect of this by far. Yeah, it did a good job. It's a, there's a ripoff thing. I've seen worse

1058
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:30,360
Disney ripoff theme parks in like a band. I don't, I need to like try to catalog. Where are all of

1059
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:35,640
the weird ripoff castles? Cause I know there's like an abandoned one in China, but I don't know the

1060
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,760
deal with that. But yeah, this is a, this is a thriving, vibrant Disney world ripoff. The weirdest

1061
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:46,440
thing about it is when you get to the castle part, there's all these photos everywhere and they

1062
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,960
actually are stills from the Disney Snow White, like stills from the actual Disney. And that's

1063
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,600
where I don't know how they get away with it. There's also like kind of a really creepy looking

1064
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,240
mannequin of Snow White that doesn't look like Snow White in the slightest, just sort of lying

1065
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:06,600
in a bed, you know, as though she's knocked out unconscious, but yeah, several stills of just

1066
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,040
straight up Disney Snow White. That's the part that's the most audacious. I'm proud of them.

1067
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,400
But it is this part of the park where fantasy dream is the greatest ride. And by the time we

1068
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,360
got there, the park was closing. So we rode this road ride three times in a row by ourselves. It

1069
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,680
was the greatest thing I've ever been on in my life. Awesome. Wow. It's that great. Okay. Okay.

1070
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:30,120
Great. Great. I stumbled across this in the, this is the, uh, the YouTube channel attractions,

1071
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,240
three 60 that has a lot of great ride throughs. They just called their title for it was unique

1072
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:41,640
and creepy dark train ride. Um, yeah. Accurate. Is that too, is that too harsh? Do you love it

1073
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,920
more than that title? That doesn't sound like anything I went on. It's not creepy. Okay. Maybe

1074
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,200
it's a little creepy. It's not dark. It is like, it's like being inside an electric crayon box

1075
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,960
and it's not unique at all. Cause it's just, it's a small world, but redone with candy.

1076
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:03,960
Yeah. With the latte candy, the famous candy. It's a nod to the roots. That's great. Um, yeah,

1077
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:13,400
it's like a lot of, I feel like the count to me was like, there are 200 alive lollipops and candy

1078
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:20,360
canes and flowers and flowers. Yeah. It, the, the candy connection makes a lot more sense why the

1079
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:28,280
ending of this ride spoiler alert is just a mini candy amusement park. It's amazing. And like,

1080
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,920
it starts off kind of janky. There's like this, you go into a clown's mouth, but there's also this

1081
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,960
hand painted clown on the wall that looks like it's from the sixties. Like this park opened in

1082
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:44,280
89, I think, but the painting and the font looks like 1960s, you know, it's kind of wild West and

1083
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:50,360
neon orange. There's a lollipop who looks like he's under arrest and a clown is a very classic

1084
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:55,400
clown kind of yelling at him. And then, yeah, you go into this clown's mouth and there's all this,

1085
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,000
these Willy Wonka esque neon tubes, like rainbow tubes kind of coming at you. Like in the boat

1086
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,560
ride type. Yeah. Yeah. So you're going through that and it kind of twists and turns and you're

1087
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:13,080
in this little train car and then just like stuff gets going on a grand scale. You go through this

1088
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:18,040
marsh where there's an Aladdinish wizardy looking guy, but then these doors open and it's just like

1089
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:22,360
instant flowers and mushrooms. It's, it's, you know, when Roger Rabbit, when he enters toon town,

1090
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,840
that's what it feels like. Yeah. And everybody's just singing at you about, I mean, I'm assuming

1091
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,000
it's about how great candy is, but I don't speak Korean, which, you know, it really cuts down on

1092
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,360
understanding a lot of the mythology of everything happening in this park. But yeah, there's like

1093
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:41,320
bees who are inside giant mushrooms and they pop out at you and they're playing trumpets.

1094
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:46,120
There's random little bits of actual fuzzy stuffed animals that kind of don't go against the shiny

1095
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:51,080
plasticine texture of everything else. Like, Oh yeah, look at this scary cat with dilated eyes.

1096
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:57,320
Yeah. This is very upset to be alive. Like she's cooking. Yeah. Kind of a Mr. Rogers,

1097
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:03,320
like a cousin of whatever that cat. I forget the name. There's a room with a lot of colored

1098
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:10,680
spheres and a very large man. I don't know if he's supposed to be a genie or wizard. Yeah. Yeah.

1099
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:17,640
This guy, it's like these beautiful colored like war. He's sort of genie ish. Oh yeah.

1100
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,720
Very robust beer. But that's the beginning of the ride and towards the end of the ride,

1101
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,280
there's like a Merlin like figure. And if you squint, it's like, wait, that's a large Merlin,

1102
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:35,800
but it's also a fox. It's a large Fox. He's cute. I think I like this Fox. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1103
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:42,440
He's cute. This is really like, I feel like as a kid, I wanted a candy land ride really badly.

1104
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,760
And I don't feel like this, they're a good American candy based ride. I don't think so.

1105
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,880
Not Hershey's chocolate world. I mean, you're not getting like the color. Yeah. That's what I

1106
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:57,480
said. It gives you like, you know, gumdrops and jelly beans, molly pops. We've talked about

1107
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:04,040
before. I was not a chocolate kid. I was a multicolored candy nerds, sprees, tartan tinies

1108
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:09,240
kid. So this feels like fulfilling that promise. Yeah. There's kind of a part in the ride that

1109
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:15,240
feels like it's covered in smarties. It looks to me, to me, it looked like Dr. Mario. Oh yeah. But

1110
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,960
yeah, I think it's definitely supposed to represent the smarty landscape. Yes. This is, yeah, this is

1111
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:26,120
my dream, my childhood dream of like a candy land that you can visit. Is this the best candy ride?

1112
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,720
Listeners, if you have been somewhere with a better candy ride, let us know. Yeah. But it seems like,

1113
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,200
I don't think this is going to be the hottest take in the world. This might be the best candy ride.

1114
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,760
Might be the best candy ride. I don't know. Cause like what are the other Hershey's,

1115
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,800
Reese's cup challenge at Hershey world or whatever, but that's still like, I don't know. It's shooter

1116
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:48,040
and it's not as magical. Chocolate's a little rough, I think, cause you're dealing in brown

1117
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:53,560
and brown's a little dark and fun. You have to put colorful costumes on top of the brown

1118
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:59,800
chocolate characters. You have to give the, but like a, a brightly, an every color in the rainbow

1119
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,880
candy ride. It's vibrant already. Cause there is chocolate in this ride. Right, right, right.

1120
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,040
Please include it. Certainly. Like candy. Hershey's kisses, naked Hershey's kisses.

1121
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:14,120
Yeah. Those are really, there's like a, there's a crazy, I think, I think this little, this little

1122
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:21,320
kiss is high. I think he's going nuts. He's on a trip. This is, I think just watching a video of

1123
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:26,920
it on one end of the spectrum of like, this is the strangest ride I've ever seen. The other end of

1124
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:35,000
the spectrum is this ride. Is it pronounced V Paz salt cracking? V Paz salt cracking. Yeah.

1125
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where's that? What was that again? I've already forgotten where the ride is.

1126
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:45,720
This one is in Europe and it's based on a beloved like drama series, like a house on the prairie and

1127
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:51,560
of green gables kind of drama series, but it's a ride based on very mundane events.

1128
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:56,360
I've seen this ride. I don't know why I've watched a YouTube of this ride, but I have.

1129
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,320
Perhaps through Eva. I know she was, she was repping this after we talked about it. I believe.

1130
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:06,440
I think I was watching a movie that, or I heard a reference to the story it was based on as well.

1131
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,480
Like what a beloved story it is. It was like Holland or something. Swedish is, I'm sorry.

1132
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:16,520
I was right. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it was a, it was a TV movie or a show. Astrid. It was a limited

1133
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:24,440
series TV, TV series or limited TV show that was very beloved and heartwarming from the writer of

1134
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,720
Pippi Longstocking. It's a theme park all based on Pippi Longstocking. And of course the story

1135
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:37,480
Carlson on the roof. Oh, that's right. Also by this author with a K though, not to see.

1136
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,960
So that's all the way at the end of one spectrum. Cause it's strange. There's a ride and it's very

1137
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:47,720
mundane of like, well, we've got to get home. It's almost time for dinner. Like, and then

1138
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,960
there's this where it's like, well, there's a magical creature. And then you go through the

1139
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:58,840
candy cane, a amusement park, and then there's a wizard. Like this is just so much of everything.

1140
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:04,520
It is. And it takes this twist right at the end where you're going through just delirious,

1141
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,440
happy candy. Everybody has their hands up. They're screaming. There's a lot of black light.

1142
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,440
All the candy canes seem drunk. And then right at the very end, when you look to the left,

1143
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:20,680
there's a bunch of candy behind jail bars. And it just, they look sad. There's the definitely

1144
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,520
appealed Hershey's kisses back there. And I was watching the video I took with my boyfriend,

1145
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:29,960
like, you know, second or third, right. And I just heard my boyfriend say in the saddest voice,

1146
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:36,040
why are the, why aren't the presence? Wait, what is it? He said, why aren't the presence

1147
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,760
escaping from prison? Because there are also little wrapped gifts there too. But yeah,

1148
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,640
they're all just behind these bars and there's a sad, very overfed looking dragon on the other side.

1149
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:52,040
So it's almost like, don't have too much candy or keep away from candy or this candy misbehaved.

1150
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:56,680
And it deserves to be eaten or. But is this maybe the candy that they've like somehow like

1151
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:03,160
litigated out of the country? Or like, that's a pocky company. Right. Don't eat the disgraceful

1152
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:07,560
hockey game. So he's like punishing the candy that he's been able or what's the gentleman's name who

1153
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,200
ran it or owned it. Yeah. Yeah. Like, so he's just, yeah, maybe these are representations of

1154
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,440
the candy he has put out of business in the country. They're being detained. He's holding

1155
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:21,320
them in a cell unless they give up and say, all right, we will not try to do business in the country.

1156
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,480
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if there's any. I don't know if there's been an interview

1157
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:32,360
with the Imagineers who did this. Wow. I mean, I like, you know, it's rare, but a common component

1158
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:40,440
of a lot of the most fun, weird, dark rides, especially is punishment stakes. You know, it's

1159
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:46,120
Mr. Toad, obviously you go to hell. There's a dark side to your actions in this. It's not all

1160
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:52,920
fun candy land. Some of the candies have to be in jail. It's the Caribbean is jail. I really love

1161
01:02:52,920 --> 01:03:00,440
that Sanrio Pearl and boat ride. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Where the character Bad Bats Maru is. I forget

1162
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,920
what he's up to. I want to be Tom, though. Yeah, yeah, that's right. He's trying to like pervert.

1163
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,760
Uh huh. Yeah, yeah. He's trying to like take a peek at something he's not supposed to see. And

1164
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,800
then later in the ride, he's getting punished. He gets spanked in the ride. And this is the kind

1165
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:20,120
of weird I like. I love every one of these rides with punishment in it. Maybe this is needs to be

1166
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,840
a recurring theme more often. Yeah. Now that I'm thinking about it, there was a photo op in the

1167
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:30,440
mall where you could pretend to be in jail as well. And there are these two giant toddlers in that

1168
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:36,520
they can sort of the guess they look like the kid in who from Roger Rabbit, but it was like dangerous

1169
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:42,680
oversized toddlers with teeth sticking out in jail uniforms. Oh, my God. Almost like Tweedledee and

1170
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:47,640
Toodle Dum, but like toddlers. Yeah. And the lack of context of knowing if these are characters from

1171
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:51,880
the Latte universe, which really doesn't seem like they had on if like the people weren't labeled on

1172
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:56,440
the way in. Right. Like Maurice, I wouldn't have had any idea that there was a story. Yeah. Do they

1173
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:04,520
live anywhere else? Are there like are there TV shows in the the Latte verse? Yeah. I mean,

1174
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:09,640
I'm so curious, like these characters are on the front of the website. And I love the look of these

1175
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:19,400
characters, but they're all dressed in like school outfits. Are these the primaries? I wonder if that's the donkey. Yeah, that must be Donkey Digger.

1176
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:24,680
Yeah. Well, let's talk about these characters a little bit, starting with the basics. And we've been

1177
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:30,680
not sure how to say this word, but I feel like undeniably their Mickey is Lottie. Lottie, right. Because now it's spelled with a Y.

1178
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:38,760
It's Lottie and Lori. And one is in kind of a tux with some red. And then one is in a dress with red

1179
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:45,480
and polka dots and a bow. If you can imagine that outfit and that if it reminds you of any other

1180
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:53,240
sure main big characters in theme park world. But Lottie and Lori. Mike, do you love Lottie and Lori?

1181
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,240
Well, I'm looking at the different I'm looking at this newer these these versions of them.

1182
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:03,480
Whoa. Which I think are awesome. Kind of like they're like that's like a network hip or sort

1183
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,200
of throwback. It's like schoolhouse rock a little bit. Yes. That one dabbing on the side. Yes, he is.

1184
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,840
Yes. That's why I really like it. If it's an out of date dance, Mike loves it. That's right. If he's

1185
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:21,320
doing the Macarena, I'd be even more thrilled. But yeah, yeah. So he represents the Che balls hitting

1186
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:26,840
the dab on the people of South Korea. So that's Lottie and Lori, I'm assuming, right? I guess so.

1187
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:31,320
Yeah, these are very different than I'm looking at these more like Disneyfied versions on their

1188
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:37,320
website. Right. So so yeah, certainly from these and they're all in little it says blooming world

1189
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,520
school. So I think that's maybe like they're back to school, like, you know, how they have like an

1190
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,600
event at Disney or something or Tokyo will have like the Halloween season and they'll have the

1191
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:50,040
Disney characters and like different outfits. But yeah, these certainly are cute for sure. And I

1192
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:54,680
like them. Yeah. And then I think I saw the ones you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. Here's the

1193
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,760
vibe. Just pretty like classic. They're going for classic Disney. Yeah. I mean,

1194
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,600
I mean, Lori is Lori is ripping many off hardcore here. Yeah. As far as her look.

1195
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,120
But she has her own interests that are different than many.

1196
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:17,240
Lori, who spreads warm love is the symbol of Lottie World Adventure together with with Lottie.

1197
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:21,880
She has such a good heart as a courteous friend. She's always spreading warm love to many people.

1198
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,840
What are you just saying that if she's the opposite of many, many is a bitch?

1199
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,640
I didn't know not the opposite. I'm just saying I've never specifically heard of any

1200
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:37,560
interests many has in warm love. I don't think many has any. Many always makes me think of

1201
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:43,800
one of my friends once profiled Hallie Bieber, Edo, who is married, of course, to Justin Bieber.

1202
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:48,840
And she said she walked into a room where Hallie Bieber was as Justin was in the main room living

1203
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:54,600
his life and Hallie was just sitting on the bed looking out at nothing. Not on her phone,

1204
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,920
not reading a book, not watching television, just sitting on the bed. And that's how I've

1205
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:06,680
always pictured many. Wow. Like no real like vacant. If she's not with Mickey, then what's

1206
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:11,960
going on? What's the point? What's my point? If I'm not with Mickey, my identity is standing next

1207
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:17,800
to this person, this character. It sounds like that's not Lori. Lori seems like she's busy

1208
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,760
spreading warm love when she's not with she's she's she spreads warm love to many people all

1209
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:28,840
the time. And she and it's an after the fact she is also the pretty girlfriend of Lottie.

1210
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:35,800
It's not the first thing in the right. It's after the fact. So that speaks to some some

1211
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:41,160
unique identity. There's also like 10 or 11 other characters listed on the website.

1212
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:46,360
We'll get to them. I was just wondering if pretty girlfriend implied the existence of,

1213
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:52,120
you know, a different girlfriend, the smart girl. She is the pretty girlfriend of Lottie.

1214
01:07:52,120 --> 01:08:02,520
Lottie is dating three different animals at once. What animal are they? I saw. Raccoon

1215
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:09,800
as the but they are more it's a lighter brown than I associate raccoon. Yeah,

1216
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:15,960
Fox. I thought they were foxes at first. They're sort of chipmunk as well. They look like tails

1217
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:22,840
from Sonic. Sure. A little bit. Mm hmm. And he was a fox. So I guess they are they are

1218
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,240
light raccoons. Right. Does it say anything about Lottie hitting the dab in that description?

1219
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:35,720
Lottie loves to hit the dab. He knows he's he's our friend who nurtures his dreams with a bright,

1220
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:42,280
warm heart. So if a dream of his was to do the dab, then he would surely nurture that dream and

1221
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:46,200
probably do it. OK, that's cool. The only information I can give you at this time.

1222
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:52,600
All right, Jason, other characters? Yeah, go ahead, please. Well, Maurice is a little pig.

1223
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:58,680
He's the wine expert. You mentioned Maurice. Yeah, little must a little and in their stock photo,

1224
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:05,400
seemingly drunk at the moment. I'm a Maurice fan. Is he your guy? Maybe of all these scouts of

1225
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:13,000
these guys. And look, it's not do I like him more than the French aristocrat? Yes, I do.

1226
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,880
Do I like him more than the bulldog woman who has like looks like big testicle jowls? Yes,

1227
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:24,440
I do. Yeah, it's I'm just saying it's a low bar. And yeah, I like the drunk pig.

1228
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:28,360
I wonder if the existence of Maurice, who is holding wine, as you pointed out in that picture,

1229
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:34,600
is why they do have a ride called Drunken Basket. Wow. Because instead of teacups,

1230
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,640
their ride is called Drunken Basket. It is just baskets spinning around, but it doesn't seem to

1231
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:45,640
have an alcohol theme besides the name. Like the middle of it is just a giant animatronic snake

1232
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:51,240
coming out of a croc and kind of opening and closing his mouth. And I was wondering what the

1233
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:55,640
baskets were made for. Like I Googled, like, how do you make soju or something if it's like a

1234
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:02,440
traditional drunken basket event? But Maurice just looks like he's holding a nice pinot. So

1235
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:08,520
maybe it's just an idea. Yeah, I know. What he's holding looks very delicious to me. I think he's

1236
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:15,640
got good taste. Drunken Basket, I don't know, is the idea that like the basket that's spinning

1237
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:21,960
around will give you a drunken feeling without even consuming alcohol? Maybe that's the it is

1238
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,800
like the notion there. Alice in the teacups is all like, obviously, it's they're just talking

1239
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,360
about drugs. And that's like, they're simulating what it would be like if you were hallucinating,

1240
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:35,480
I think, on the teacups. That's your view of what the teacups are? Well, the whole Alice is,

1241
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:39,960
she takes the potion or whatever. But we're just talking about hallucinogenics. So it's like it's

1242
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:44,280
trying to disorient you. But yeah, well, that's other parts of the movie, though, the teacup part,

1243
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:50,040
she's having some tea. But it is interesting that it's teacups in that ride and not vials or

1244
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:55,880
something. That's true. Not the magic vials. Yeah. And I would say hallucination. But I think I

1245
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,880
think you're bringing this air. You think so? Yeah, I've never thought I have never thought of

1246
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:08,520
the teacup ride as being a simulated hallucination. No, Jason. I think there was probably already

1247
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:13,400
half a dozen companies making spinning teacup rides. And they're like, oh, we want one of these.

1248
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:18,680
What is it closest to? Oh, yeah, Alice has a tea party. You don't think Bob Gurr was thinking when

1249
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:24,520
he put together the teacup ride? I assume he did. He was like, we're going to simulate a trip in here.

1250
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:29,880
I don't know. Well, I don't know where he stands on the hallucinogenic enthusiast's

1251
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:37,480
scale. Because there are some that are pretty on the record as pro. Rolly, Rolly, he just passed

1252
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:43,240
away. He was pretty upfront that he's like, yeah, I did some drugs. Sure. So I don't know, maybe

1253
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:48,920
we'll look into it. Maybe I'm wrong. And that and you'll well just just take a bunch of

1254
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:54,920
hallucinogenic drugs and tell me which one is exactly like spinning around for two minutes.

1255
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:02,680
Well, you know me, I'm always doing hallucinogenic. So not necessarily hallucinogenic per se, but I

1256
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:08,600
got to say, like taking a few hits off a joint and then watching fantasy dream was kind of a bad time.

1257
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:15,320
Oh, really? That was kind of a little bit. Oh, Jace. Oh, no. All of the rides, the jungle,

1258
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:21,000
the rapids ride and the other. I was just like, I regret putting this off into the evening.

1259
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,120
I regret doing it. Fascinating. I didn't know this was part of your research sometimes that there was

1260
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:31,160
there was a little bit of stimulation involved. I had already watched a lot of like day in the life

1261
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:39,800
kind of we're going to Lotte World and I watched the Vice documentary and then I was I find I don't

1262
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:45,640
know. I was having a hard time looking I think because Attractions 360 kind of more describe

1263
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:51,560
the I think I looked up the Lotte World website, found what their English translations rides were

1264
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:57,160
and I was having a harder time finding those. And then once I found a few ride throughs,

1265
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:01,640
I found all of them. That's all very interesting. Now, what were you smoking, dude? What were you

1266
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:07,400
puffing on pretty chill Indica? But still there was a lot going on in that fantasy dream where I

1267
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,240
was like, this is the strangest thing I've ever seen. Jason was keeping his lips zipped in the

1268
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:15,080
world talking about how wonderful it is. Best candy ride and then you're thinking of terror.

1269
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:19,960
I liked it. I was just like, oh man, this is there's so much happening here.

1270
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:24,360
Jason look, in case you didn't know, I mean, Jason is the wild one of the three of us because he

1271
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:29,400
takes six hits of weed a week. Wow. Mr. Loose Cannon.

1272
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,680
I'm going to try to sound cool when I say this so that you take me seriously. Like I know what

1273
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:37,640
I'm talking about, but like does, does blaze in bro? Does that help you feel like you're on the

1274
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:42,600
ride? Like when you're watching now you're speaking his language. Now you're talking to him.

1275
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:48,680
I finally called me bro. It's been 300 episodes now. Now he's connected. Now he's locked in.

1276
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:55,960
That I think is helped more by the size of the screen. Like on a bigger TV, it does feel more

1277
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:00,360
like then what do you do? Do you plan for the biggest screen you can find and try to pretend

1278
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:05,240
like you're on the ride? I usually just like, as I'm going through stuff, I throw stuff in my,

1279
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:09,800
in like a playlist on YouTube or watch later. You're not answering my questions. Do you sit

1280
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:15,160
in front of a big TV and pretend you're on the ride? I sit on the couch and watch it. And then

1281
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:21,480
I type on a computer, my observations. This is much more boring than the bit you're looking for.

1282
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:25,160
Yeah. We're looking for some fun thing where you're like blazed up and then you like kind

1283
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:31,400
of go up to the TV and like hug it and watch the screen. Yeah. Like I don't have a big wingspan,

1284
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:39,960
Mike. My arms don't go very wide. It's your old TV and you know what it looks like. I gave

1285
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:46,360
Jason my old TV three years ago. So yeah, it is a big TV. Yeah. Um, but yeah, you don't get that

1286
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:52,520
close. No. And you don't like bend your, you don't bend your body around like you're on the ride.

1287
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:58,520
No. No more often than not, I like hit the 15 seconds back because I was typing and missed

1288
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:04,440
something. It sounds like you take one hit of marijuana. Yeah. You sit and point yourself on

1289
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:09,560
the couch and you just like stand still really like rigidly. And then you start typing furiously.

1290
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:15,800
You know, one of my favorite fast sides is sitting very still and watching things.

1291
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:23,560
Very Bieber-esque move. I have to ask, did you toke up and watch fly venture?

1292
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:29,480
Their California Soren version. I missed fly venture. I think I didn't there because again,

1293
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:38,840
there's so much stuff here. How, how, what does that fly over Seoul? It flies over hell. It's like,

1294
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:44,520
Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fly venture is, it starts like it's real and you are in Soren,

1295
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,560
you're in the little chairs, your feet are dangling, giant screen. Everybody's moving around.

1296
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:52,520
It feels real, but you quickly go from overlooking the ocean, like you're like Soren.

1297
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:58,920
Then you're in this avatar land where there's all these floating pools with waterfalls leading from

1298
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,720
one pool to another. So you kind of sail around these pools for a little bit. And there's these

1299
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:08,680
neon flying fish. And then these thunderstorms start to happen and you go into this wormhole.

1300
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:12,600
And when you come out, you're flying over at this desert with all these like impossible

1301
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,920
cliffs that are just really jagged and you're going into these goalies and these birds are attacking

1302
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:20,520
you. Then there's dinosaurs because there's just dinosaurs. If they can put a dinosaur in the park,

1303
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,120
they're going to put a dinosaur in the park. Then these fireballs start coming at you and this rock

1304
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:28,440
monster starts attacking. And then you go into- Oh, I just landed on him. He's so scary.

1305
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:32,760
Then you go and see the sea out of him. He has glowing blue eyes. Wow.

1306
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:37,480
Oh, this is a bad trip right here you're describing. So if you were blitzed out of your mind-

1307
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:41,000
This is what he saw when he watched the candy ride. He saw this instead.

1308
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,480
Then there's like lightning and tornadoes and hurricanes and lava.

1309
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:50,760
Lava birds. This is, I mean, it's very inventive, but it's terrifying the lava bird.

1310
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:55,640
So on top of everything else, they fit a flying theater in this building.

1311
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,880
Yeah. That's insane to me.

1312
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:02,040
Yes. What was the, when you were sitting on it, what was the like, was it like Soarin basically

1313
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,200
where you was just kind of an open chair and you were like hanging out?

1314
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:09,880
Yeah, exactly like it. It was exactly like Soarin. I don't remember they were piping in smells to go

1315
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:14,680
with everything. Like magma smells. Magma smell. What does magma smell like?

1316
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,440
Just like, I don't know, like burning, just like charred. Yeah.

1317
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,200
You could probably just do incense and then it would work.

1318
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:20,920
Incense, yeah.

1319
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:25,720
It's just big cyclones. Yeah, you're right. This is some very end of the world shit.

1320
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:31,560
This is for a genre of ride that is typically like the wine tour of rides.

1321
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,120
This is maybe the only one I've seen that is scary.

1322
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,000
Yeah. Even the music is a little Roland Emmerich-y.

1323
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,360
Oh my God.

1324
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:44,440
Yikes. God, I missed again, the size of this place. I didn't even see the words fly venture.

1325
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,320
The great clunky title fly venture.

1326
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,000
Fly venture. Yeah.

1327
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,880
It looks cool though. Oh my God.

1328
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:58,200
Interesting. That's like, cause in Disney world, they have a Pandora ride, an Avatar ride where

1329
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:06,120
you're on like a mighty Akron, you're on one of the beasts. But that feels much more like appropriate

1330
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:13,560
for a ride like this with a lot of action. Like in a motorcycle position versus like just chilling

1331
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:18,520
out in a chair in the sky. Yeah. It really felt like you were going places you shouldn't see.

1332
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:19,640
Interesting.

1333
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:24,920
Yeah. But you know, to even just keep thinking about the scale and how they fit things in,

1334
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,400
the longest ride by far is their knockoff of Pirates of the Caribbean,

1335
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:34,120
which is called the Adventures of Sindbad. There's an extra D in there.

1336
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,600
Oh, we love our Ds in our Sindbad.

1337
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,240
Sindbad, yes. We've talked about this before. Sindbad.

1338
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,600
It always feels so weird.

1339
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,400
Is Sindbad real? Are we wrong for calling it Sindbad?

1340
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:49,960
I don't know. Well, look, culturally, our Sindbad is the standup comedian who does not have a D.

1341
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:55,320
So that's, I think, what is stinging our ears the most is that we, the one that we know doesn't have

1342
01:18:55,320 --> 01:19:00,840
that extra D. But maybe, I guess the story. Oh my God.

1343
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:05,240
Who, again, you know, first kid is my main Sindbad pop culture.

1344
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,200
Of course. But I think, yeah,

1345
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,880
I think maybe the real story. Most?

1346
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:12,520
I do have the other D. Yeah, there's a Tokyo Disney ride that we love,

1347
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:15,400
but I think most places we were looking at it. So it does have that D in there.

1348
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,520
Whoa. It's weird, doesn't it?

1349
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:21,480
Yeah. This is like my mandala effect. I never knew it actually had a D. I was making fun of it the

1350
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,440
whole time. The joke is on me. I think there's-

1351
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:29,400
We've had the same thing. There's a stunt show in Islands of Adventure in Florida that always,

1352
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,880
yeah, it was like sticking in our head the whole vacation. Sindbad? Sindbad?

1353
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,120
It's why it's so upsetting. Yeah.

1354
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:42,200
I think there are like American versions of Sindbad that call it Sindbad, I think, without the D.

1355
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46,600
Yeah, there are. So I think, yeah, there's, but I think maybe around the world, it's more

1356
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:53,080
D Sindbad than non-D Sindbad. Do you think when our Sindbad, like comedian Sindbad,

1357
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:58,040
goes to Korea and tries to order a coffee and he gives his name is Sindbad, they add the D?

1358
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:04,760
Yeah, yes, I do think that. And does it confuse it with any other Sindbad's who are waiting for

1359
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:12,360
coffees as well? I think it happens all the time when it's over there. Korea problems.

1360
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:19,960
The Sindbad ride you mentioned, you're right, it is very long. It takes place seemingly 90% in caves

1361
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,960
and again, very low ceilings, real low clearances on this.

1362
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:28,520
I mean, I love this. This is what I want. The intimacy on the rides is what I always talk about

1363
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:34,440
and that's what does it. Low ceilings, close quarters. I like feeling like cozy like this on

1364
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:38,520
the ride. I think Jason's concerned. I don't think you like the, I think you're feeling claustrophobic

1365
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:43,800
just thinking about it. Well, you know me, I like enclosed spaces. I was just amazed at a place

1366
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:51,800
that's so grand in scale, like a giant atrium with a giant ice skating rink, an indoor amusement

1367
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:59,320
park next to an outdoor amusement park. I was just taken back by how many things feel so intimate.

1368
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:03,640
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess, you know, to pack them all in there. Mike, you were talking about the

1369
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:10,280
only the like lack of expansion abilities and I think one of the only times they were able to add

1370
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:15,160
something else was like, because where else do we go? We can't really go outside. Well, there is

1371
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:20,520
this recently, there is this level of the mall that we could take over that is as everything we're

1372
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,160
describing very low ceilings and they were like, how do we justify it? And it became like this

1373
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:32,760
world of goblins and trolls, which is called what it underland. Did you go to underland? Was

1374
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:40,200
underland there? I don't know if we did. It feels like we we did go to some wild rest wild west thing

1375
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:48,280
where we were riding horses. We did go to this astro blasters knockoff where you're shooting dragons.

1376
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:53,640
I feel like these things are all in the basement together. Wow. But goblins, I don't know if I saw

1377
01:21:53,640 --> 01:22:00,600
goblins. I think maybe I don't know. Again, it's hard to track the zillion things here. So yeah,

1378
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,840
I don't know. It's the only way they can fit all this in is to take them all out. Low clearance.

1379
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:11,480
We did go on their space mountain knockoff, which was called Comet Express. And the structure is a

1380
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:16,200
lot like space mountain where it's a dark ride. But the one difference they have is that your

1381
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:21,080
seats rotate more like you're in the Haunted Mansion. Yeah. OK. Yeah. So your seats can kind

1382
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:25,640
of wobble back and forth as you're in the dark ride. And it's not perfectly dark because they

1383
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:30,920
on purpose have a bunch of black light planets and aliens surrounding you. So you're sort of

1384
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:34,840
zooming in the darkness. And then sometimes there'll be like a giant Saturn or a giant alien

1385
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:40,440
yelling at you. That's good. Yeah. That's what I want in space. In space, in Disneyland, there is,

1386
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:45,160
I've said this before, and I don't know, there is a giant like either it's an asteroid or it's a

1387
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:50,840
planet if you look, but you can't see it because it's too dark in there unless it's like the Star

1388
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:55,800
Wars overlays happening. It's a little brighter. But I want to see planet. I want that because

1389
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:02,600
space, I understand, is actually dark. I don't care. I want big, colorful planets. I think you

1390
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:09,160
get that in France. Yeah. I was too scared to go in France, but I believe you get that there.

1391
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:15,800
I saw a review of this ride, several reviews or comments about Comet Express that said this ride

1392
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:21,240
is better than at least some of the space mountains. OK. Yeah. Like maybe not that that

1393
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:27,400
France one or Disney. But like, I know it's heresy to some people to say that the Florida one is

1394
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:34,040
bad, painful and it's a refurbishment or the Tokyo one, which they they're blowing up and just starting

1395
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:39,320
again. But that's a pretty good review of Comet Express better than some space mountains. Yeah.

1396
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:44,680
Yeah. Seems good. By the way, all of this is situated on a lake. I don't know if we've said

1397
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:51,240
that yet. This whole massive complex, there is a lake and the Magic Island part is like built on,

1398
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:58,120
I guess, still she would say you take like a footbridge out into the Magic Island part.

1399
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:03,400
Yeah, I guess I just thought the lake was fake or like fake. It's real. They just built this on

1400
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:08,520
a body of water. Yeah, I don't quite know how the body it looks pretty sizable. The wall.

1401
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:14,200
So maybe it is fake. No, no, no. There on top of it. Like Mexico City.

1402
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:20,840
I don't know the geography of Mexico City to say either way. Like Key West.

1403
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:29,160
Like the lake that the Toothsome Chocolate Emporium is on in Orlando.

1404
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:34,680
Now we're talking about Seven Seas Lagoon in Orlando. Yeah. Now that's a body water.

1405
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:41,080
I also go ahead if you had something. Oh, well, I this is a long tangent. Did you have something?

1406
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:46,520
We mentioned school uniforms earlier. And when I was watching some of these, like,

1407
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:51,800
this is my life in Korea or like I moved to Korea now. So today I'm going to Lauday World. And

1408
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:59,400
I'm one of them just very casually said, it's popular to dress in school uniforms at Lauday

1409
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:09,160
World. There's a couple places to rent school uniforms nearby. And I had to rewatch this whole

1410
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:15,560
segment of this video. And then I found I did find a news article from a Korean news outlet.

1411
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:22,600
I think that works in conjunction with the New York Times. And this is countrywide. This is a

1412
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:29,080
thing that you can do. You can rent a school uniform close by to change into change out of

1413
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:35,160
your clothes, change into the school uniform. And then you go to the theme park. And I was like,

1414
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:40,760
oh, God, is this going to be weird? And it seems just like we just like taking nice pictures in it.

1415
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:47,240
And it makes us feel like we're kids again was the justification. And it is very popular. Like

1416
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:53,320
there were rows and rows of like shirts and vests and pants and ties and skirts.

1417
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,320
This is what they should have done for your school pictures.

1418
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,680
You should have been renting school uniforms for the day.

1419
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,960
Yeah, we never wore school uniforms before. But for the pictures, yeah,

1420
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:08,040
it would have looked a lot nicer than the shitty fake tuxedo. My takeaway from this is that

1421
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:17,320
Disney fans are leaving money on the table. Yeah, not having like rent Disney bounding, rent clothes

1422
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:22,760
that look kind of like characters. Rent uniforms. Jason and I heading down to Anaheim at 8 a.m.

1423
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:29,640
We make a quick stop outside of Anaheim to rent little boy school uniforms. We put them on. We

1424
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:33,880
have the little shorts like the Angus Young from ACDC, little shorts, little schoolboy outfit on.

1425
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,840
And then we go to Disney and feel more like kids than we already do.

1426
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:40,760
Why do I feel like a country that invented Pizzagate will not get the joke?

1427
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:48,520
That's fair. Yeah, that's currently eyeing the operations of this company and hoping for any

1428
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:53,000
slip up like, oh, I think it's like a pedo place, but I know I'm watching them.

1429
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,520
Ron DeSantis is furious at the rent, the business of renting little schoolboy outfits to adults.

1430
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:03,000
And you by the, your plan, you are insisting that, and thank you for leaving me out of the plan.

1431
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,320
No, I think you didn't want to do it. No, I did not. You rent me correctly.

1432
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,040
We'll meet at the bar at the hotel at lunchtime.

1433
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,040
Also, it's possible you already own your own little schoolboy outfit

1434
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:15,800
and you'll just meet us down. Okay. You're not renting like Jason and I are.

1435
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:22,840
Yeah. I bought the finest schoolboy uniform. That's an investment and I'll hold onto it.

1436
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,120
And it encourages me to stay in shape so I don't outgrow it.

1437
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:31,880
You know me, I'm thrifty. I'm no sucker. So you're going to get a better rate on a big lolly outside

1438
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,920
the park and then you carry the big lolly into the park.

1439
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:39,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As long as it's not too big to fit through the metal detectors.

1440
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:44,200
Yeah. Yeah. I could be a part of that. It's so big. It's not clunk. Sorry.

1441
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,160
You're going to have to lick some of the layers off of that before I can let you come in.

1442
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:51,880
But my other thing about the school, everyone in the school uniform rental place

1443
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:56,600
seemed like they were having a blast. And then when they were in the park,

1444
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:01,240
all taking pictures together and taking pictures next to rides and stuff,

1445
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:05,720
everyone seemed like they were having so much fun. I was like, oh, I kind of get it.

1446
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:11,080
And then if you do the rapids, your nasty rental school uniform takes all the chlorine water and

1447
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:14,040
then you can change back into your regular clothes. You are on board 100% for this.

1448
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,480
Oh, that's a great idea. And I think about it because we didn't do the splash rides

1449
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,080
because we didn't want to get too sticky. Yeah.

1450
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:22,840
Wow. That's maybe a good idea theme park wide,

1451
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,360
I guess, is to let clothes absorb and then you leave those clothes.

1452
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,640
Renting clothes at theme parks should be a whole business out here.

1453
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:35,000
Or before you go into the parks, at least. Yeah. I mean, I said that it's a good idea,

1454
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,600
and yet I do not want to do this myself. The fact that you use the word nasty before the water was

1455
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:47,080
part of it. I guess I don't want to pay money and then have nasty clothes handed to me.

1456
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:52,680
Well, no, the clothes seemed very pressed, very clean, very dry, clean. They seemed a good shape.

1457
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:56,360
Like the headmaster of the school would not be upset with the quality of the clothes

1458
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,760
because they have to be authentic to your school experience.

1459
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:05,160
They imagine a headmaster and try to uphold the headmaster's quality.

1460
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:10,200
You're representing your fictional school when you go into this park, so you've got to look neat and

1461
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:15,160
tidy. I mean, I will say as a person who had to wear a school uniform, did anybody else have to

1462
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:19,800
wear a school uniform? No. I did. No one took out of school. Yeah, it wasn't so embarrassing and

1463
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:25,320
restrictive. I really like polyester pants and shorts. They're just so easy to wear. They're

1464
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:30,200
very breathable. They don't wrinkle. I'm wearing polyester pants right now. It's hard to find

1465
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:35,240
polyester and I would like to see an embracing of polyester as a wardrobe choice. We've really

1466
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:44,680
demonized it. It became this like 70s relic leisure suit. Do you find it comfortable? I guess I

1467
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:48,280
haven't worn a lot of polyester yet. You do find it comfortable though? It's not like a scratchy

1468
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:53,800
ear-taining fabric? I'm a person who can't iron and so polyester pants, you just feel a little

1469
01:29:53,800 --> 01:30:01,560
bit slick all day. They're amazing. Sorry, tiny polyester. My aunt is trying to make me pants like

1470
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:05,880
my favorite pants, but we can't find the polyester anymore. They don't sell it. So we're having to

1471
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:11,400
buy vintage giant pants and then cut them down to be my size of pants. Why is that? Why don't they

1472
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:16,440
just sell like big, you can go to like a fabric store and get it? No. Yeah. We've really been

1473
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:21,240
checking. Wow. And so I don't know if anybody has a beat on polyester out there. Anyways, sorry,

1474
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,840
but if I could rent polyester and wear it all day and run around, it's a miracle fabric. Sure. And

1475
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:29,640
then you just throw it in a garment bag at the end of the day and put your t-shirt and jeans back on.

1476
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:37,000
Yeah, sure. Miracle fabric. I had a lot of bad experiences growing up of like Kmart dress,

1477
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:45,000
like really shiny, too slick, uncomfortable polyester pants, I feel like. Because they

1478
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:53,080
didn't have a lot of options in the husky boys section. So I feel like it was the mix of limited

1479
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:59,800
selection and like, well, it's going to grow out of this anyway, you know. I made my fortune selling

1480
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:05,880
husky boy polyester. Selling husky boy polyester. Son, you're going to take over for me. Suits and

1481
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:10,680
shirts in the nineties were like really baggy too. And it's come back around, of course. Yeah.

1482
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:15,640
You're only getting huskier, so there's a lot of opportunities for you. You're taking over the

1483
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:20,120
business. I don't know about that. We never hear about the child obesity epidemic. I feel like we

1484
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:24,920
were hearing about 10, 15 years ago. We don't hear about it anymore. We're onto other things.

1485
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:33,320
Yeah. Where's other focuses? Yeah. Yeah. The woke agenda. C-E-R-T. Mine. Mine. Yeah. Yeah.

1486
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:38,280
The Borg. There are all these kids. They're all doing those Borgs, those gallons of water with

1487
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:43,560
vodka. What's the Borg? Do you know that soppy boys just did this? This is like the college

1488
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:48,440
getting fucked up. Like, did you ever do Edward 40 hands in college? I've heard of it, but I didn't

1489
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:54,120
participate. So this is. Don't spike the levels, Mike. He wasn't accusing you. It was a simple

1490
01:31:54,120 --> 01:32:00,120
question. I played flippy cup, but I did not do it. This is like the new get. It's like, OK,

1491
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:07,960
you pour out half a gallon of water. You pour in like a handle or pint of vodka and then a

1492
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:14,600
full one of those meal flavoring things and you shake it up and you just drink that and it gets

1493
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:19,800
people insanely fucked up. But also hydrated. It's called Borg. Borg. Yeah. It's named after

1494
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,640
my favorite Star Trek. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why is it called? Do we know why it's called Borg? I don't

1495
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:29,960
know why it's called Borg. Interesting. But I think it is. It's not like the vodka tampons of like

1496
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,200
10 years ago or whatever. It's not like the Tide Pods where it's like, oh, this is made up. Like

1497
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:37,480
two people did this. Like two couple of people. Yeah. This is a real phenomenon. And the rest of you had to write

1498
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:41,160
articles. Yeah, this is a real thing. Is somebody listening? Is multiple people listening right now

1499
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:46,280
or doing this? Yeah. Are you doing a Borg and listening to this show? Let us know. Doing a Borg

1500
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:52,680
and watching the videos I bet would be more fun. Sure. Than the Smoke and Bees. Ride through video.

1501
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:57,400
You see. Ride through videos are best paired with Borg-ing. For Borg-ing. Yeah. I don't know if I'd

1502
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:03,160
Borg and do FlyVenture. Yeah. Yeah. That's the hangover ride. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It depends. Yeah.

1503
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:07,960
Could we real quick go back and just, there's a few more characters we haven't talked about.

1504
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,520
That's true. We missed everything. I apologize to go back. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. So the characters,

1505
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:17,800
yeah, we talked about Maurice. We didn't, there's Lippy Louie, who's the aristocrat.

1506
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:24,600
But then I want to talk about Toulouse. You guys see Toulouse? You know, I don't see Toulouse. Oh,

1507
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:30,200
wait. Oh, sorry. Oh, Toulouse. Oh, now I go. Okay. Does Toulouse seem like another character?

1508
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:34,280
Yeah. Jason knows what I'm talking about. Yeah. Scott, you know what I'm talking about as well?

1509
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:39,400
There's a character, of course, in the Duffy verse in Disney named Gelatoni. He's an Italian painter

1510
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:44,040
cat. This guy- You're making a big leap that Amy knows the Duffy verse. I'm not saying she knows.

1511
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:48,280
I explained what he is. I put it all, all the context I had is right there. He has like a stuffed

1512
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:53,320
animal. There's a whole world of stuffed animals. It's much more popular in the Asian parks than

1513
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:58,040
here. And one of the characters is an Italian painter. The only Duffy I know is Patrick Duffy.

1514
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:01,880
So I'm really glad that you guys are giving me this. He has his own Duffy verse as well.

1515
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:08,840
As a step-by-step fan. But I wonder, yeah. So I wonder who came first, Toulouse maybe came first.

1516
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:15,160
Who do you think came first? You know what we've been, you've been looking at the whole history of

1517
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:20,440
this park together. Think, look inside your heart. I don't want to admit. You know who came and give

1518
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:25,960
credit to your pal Gelatoni for coming first. Okay. Yeah. Toulouse looks a little phoned. I mean,

1519
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:30,760
some of these characters like, okay, white bear, the darling of the North Pole. He's got overalls

1520
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:37,320
and a cockeyed hat and a little ice cream cone. Sharon cat, the glamorous and pretty cat. And she

1521
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:44,440
has like a gown on and a feather boa. And human breasts. She's a cat with human breasts. Just

1522
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,880
I'm going to make sure you see this too, Amy. Only two human breasts or six? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well,

1523
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:52,440
unless there's others under the gown that we're not seeing. You know, she's got Jessica rabbit.

1524
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:59,240
Why do I feel like Sharon cat is going to move in on Lottie? Oh yeah. But maybe, yeah, maybe it's okay.

1525
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:03,640
Maybe that's part of it. Part of the relationship. Yeah. Which kind of Lottie's girlfriend do you

1526
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:07,240
look? I already have a pretty girlfriend, so you have to find another quality if you want to be

1527
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:12,040
another one of my girlfriends. Do we feel that Sharon cat and Jenny hippo are sort of in our

1528
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:17,400
Helen test where we feel like sometimes the female characters get less fun names than the male

1529
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:24,520
characters? Hmm. You're in Jenny Sharon cat and Jenny hippo, which I do like sort of the like just

1530
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:29,640
a regular name and then an animal, but it does feel like it's not as fun as digger donkey or

1531
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:37,160
burger Meister or Toulouse. Even Lippy Louie. See, I think Sharon cat and Jenny hippo have a little

1532
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:42,760
bit of character, but like Burger Meister, the German bulldog, Mrs. Burger, talkative wife of

1533
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:48,200
Mr. Burger. Like those, I think are a little more fun names. That does not pass the test. Yeah, yeah. When one character, when the male

1534
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:55,240
character has a name and the other one is just Mrs. Male character, then that does not pass the test. I think we're in the zone

1535
01:35:55,240 --> 01:36:01,800
of that, of the Helen test. Yeah, a little bit. They're getting lazier for sure. I'll tell you one

1536
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:08,680
thing. The character Fiddler does not pass the test of not being a ripoff of Jiminy Cricket. That's true, yes.

1537
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:14,840
That very specific test. Now I will say I did not see a lot of lore with these characters, but I do

1538
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:19,480
believe they all showed up at one of the two parades that we saw because there's an indoor

1539
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:24,600
daytime parade where everybody marches around and then there's a nighttime parade called Dark Dreams

1540
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,960
and everybody marches around again, but everything's like covered in black lights and there's

1541
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:34,760
more Arabian stuff, more genies, more lights glowing, but there are people inside of these

1542
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:39,320
marching. But I didn't even know their names, honestly, so I'm really glad to get to know more

1543
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:43,320
of the names than the ones that I saw statues of. I wish they were more central in the park.

1544
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:50,760
You got to do extra research. We've talked about this lately, needing to have extra reading materials

1545
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:56,200
for the thing in the park to make sense. To know the lore. It doesn't seem ideal. There's something

1546
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:00,360
about like, oh, now I've learned more and it enriches the experience, but it seems like you should

1547
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:05,480
kind of know who they are and why they're having a parade. I want to know why my ears have a cactus.

1548
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:12,760
Oh yeah. None of the, because I had this character tab open and I looked as soon as you said that and

1549
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:18,920
I don't see no character with a cactus head. I cannot account for that one. I'm not sure. Any

1550
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:23,000
listeners, if you've been to this place, do you know this pathology really well? Do you get cheese

1551
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,360
curds in LA and do you know why the cactus is there? The ears seem very popular. I feel like

1552
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:35,240
one vlogger immediately walked inside and there was an ear stand and everyone was buying ears.

1553
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,880
I think I have a picture of my ears. I'm trying to pull it up to show you guys.

1554
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:43,320
I think most importantly, if anything you've described, if there is a good picture of that

1555
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:48,840
hot dog, I feel like we need to see it and the listeners need to see it. Send us whatever.

1556
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:54,040
Can I bring up, I didn't realize this. I think I saw the name years ago whenever this happened,

1557
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:58,600
but there was a viral video. Do you guys know what I'm talking about? That was basically showing

1558
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:04,440
a ride that was kind of like a giant drop that looks crazy. The gyro drop. Yes. That's the name

1559
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:12,600
of the actual ride and someone did some special effects to make this ride look extra insane,

1560
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:17,880
where it would be drop up and then like these like, like chairs would kind of drop out once it was at

1561
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:21,720
the top of its, we're seeing it. We're seeing the cactus. That looks like a little like, that looks

1562
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:28,520
like a nice little like cactus pear kind of thing. Yeah, that's fun. In the succulent. I wonder why.

1563
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:33,160
It's a very attractive plant. Why is it there? I don't know. That's a riding fantasy dream,

1564
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:38,040
by the way. That's fantasy dream. Wow. That's great. Yeah. But no, you're right. There are like gyro

1565
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:43,720
drops and the whole thing, because in addition to the rides, there's the carnival ride section,

1566
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:48,760
basically where they've also got bumper cars and all the gyro droppy swings, the pirate ship,

1567
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:53,800
all of that. Yeah. So yeah, but they, somebody made this to look like it was some insane,

1568
01:38:53,800 --> 01:39:00,120
like a torture torture device, essentially as if like every you're on this spinner ride and it goes

1569
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:06,600
way up on a tower and then every single seat is separately deployed and drops flies out of 50 feet

1570
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:12,600
in one second. They all swing around completely untethered to a vehicle, right? Like they're going

1571
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:21,080
to get sucked back in and then the entire tower drops 150 feet. It's a really well done video,

1572
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:25,960
except that you're watching it thinking this is just not physically possible. There's no way this

1573
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:29,640
thing could move this quick. So this is the, yeah. So cause this was going around, I believed it.

1574
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:35,880
All the car like seats drop out as you go up and then the thing just spins around and it does look

1575
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:41,560
like you're torturing a bunch of people at a very high, a high distance. Oh, that looks awesome.

1576
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:48,360
Which I assume a human being could survive this, but it looks scary as shit.

1577
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,600
Too good to be true. It's just Guy Ritchie style drops like visual effects. Right.

1578
01:39:55,320 --> 01:40:00,360
Incredible CGI. The people who created the genie created this. We're learning now

1579
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:06,280
is that the same CGI wizards were able to have a little respect. That's at least

1580
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:11,960
Sherlock Holmes book of shadows level quality. All right. Fair enough. You're right. If we're

1581
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:15,400
wanting to attend anything else you want to shout out ride wise, what it's just like,

1582
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:19,880
let's just like grab bag anything else that was, that was fun that you got to go on in this place.

1583
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,680
Well, I want to actually grab bag something that's right around the corner.

1584
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:27,880
And it is a theme park that opened before latte land. It opened up in 1983.

1585
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:34,920
It's called Yungma land and it is more of like your, your county fair kind of place.

1586
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:40,920
Where there are like this, the spinning copters and the octopus who like scrambles you around

1587
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:46,600
and the, and the carousel and everything about that. But what is special about Yungma land

1588
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:51,800
is that when latte world opened, it just like killed it, totally decimated it, like ruined it.

1589
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:57,960
Nobody went there anymore. So they finally shut down Yungma land in 2011, but they kept it open

1590
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:03,480
as just a place you can go to, to wander around a destroyed and abandoned theme park. Wow. And it

1591
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:08,760
is amazing. Like it's so wild. I think it's $5 to get in and there's this groundskeeper there

1592
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:14,120
and he just lets you do whatever like total free range. They have the giant swinging pirate ship.

1593
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:19,560
You can climb on it. You can climb on anything you want like ladders and everything. Like you

1594
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:24,760
can climb on like these big laser trains they have that sort of look like they were maybe a space

1595
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:31,080
ride back in the day. They have just everything stored together. So if you wanted to see like,

1596
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:37,000
um, you know, okay, kind of, uh, you know, like those supermarket rides, even that they have for

1597
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,760
little kids, we can ride a little car up and they have just like stacks and stacks of them just kind

1598
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:45,160
of heaped together outside and you can kind of climb on them. Everything's a photo op. You can

1599
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:50,680
just run around and just do whatever you want in this place. Oh yeah. What I'm looking at here is

1600
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:56,520
like some kind of spinner ride, similar to what we talked about at the Bo craft where there's like

1601
01:41:57,240 --> 01:42:02,440
airbrushed rock star. Yeah, they've got Madonna on it. They've got an airbrushed Madonna on it

1602
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:06,840
and also a Michael Jackson. And like bad era Michael Jackson and then maybe I don't, I don't

1603
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:11,640
really recognize if these are, we're supposed to know who these are or are they? Cindy-ish? Lopper-ish?

1604
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:19,080
Cindy-ish Lopper. Yeah. Uh, Julio Escaglaceus. I don't know. But then there's photos of this is

1605
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:24,280
just like, this is just this ride with nobody on it, but then there seem to be photos of people just

1606
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:28,760
in the middle. Like they got to climb on and kind of surf in the middle. Like it seems like a

1607
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:35,320
potential for a danger maybe, but also like it's cool that the guy's just like, I don't know,

1608
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:40,040
your own peril, just go run around. I don't care. They don't make you sign a waiver at all. It's

1609
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:45,400
one of the most freeing places I've ever been in because you can just climb. You can climb.

1610
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:49,240
There's everything is overgrown. There's weeds on the different roofs at the only facilities they

1611
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:56,760
have is like a bathroom stall and I think like a, a little, what do you call it? Concession vending

1612
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:00,760
machine, a vending machine where you can buy like sodas. And that's it. Otherwise it's just like,

1613
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:05,160
you pay the five bucks, you can do whatever. And if the guy who kind of keeps an eye on things,

1614
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:10,600
not to tell you to stop, but just to make sure nothing gets stolen, I guess. He does this one

1615
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:16,360
thing where there's this giant pool of water kind of by the carousel. And I thought that it was just,

1616
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:21,080
you know, a leak or a mistake, but it's this deliberately filled shallow pool of water that

1617
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:25,480
the guy does, because if you're nice, he'll take your camera and he'll take the most beautiful

1618
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:29,000
photo of you you've ever seen where you're reflected in this pool of water in front of

1619
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,360
the carousel. And I have a Samsung phone cause I won't do iPhone stuff. And so he like grabbed my

1620
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:38,520
Samsung phone, switched all these buttons on it that I don't know how he did. And I've never been

1621
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:43,800
able to figure it back and took just like the Spielberg photo of me and my boyfriend kissing

1622
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:52,360
of my life. Wow. Did he pose you too? He posed us, he directed us. I'll dig this out in a second

1623
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:59,080
too. And it's just stunning. Wow. So this man is an artist. This park is amazing and it's just

1624
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:04,200
frozen. There's like tiny little kids roller coasters frozen in midair. And I feel like if

1625
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:08,520
you wanted to jungle gym up there, he wouldn't stop you. Wow. Did you do anything where you were

1626
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:13,160
like, this is dangerous? Did you climb on anything? When I climbed, I did climb the ladder in the

1627
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:17,800
center of the pirate ship because the pirate ship is my favorite ride. And so I, yeah, I climbed up

1628
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:22,760
there pretty far. I got covered in mosquito bites. So there was a minute where I was like, I should

1629
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:26,680
not have worn shorts here. So I'd recommend not wearing shorts there. Yeah. We've got on roofs of

1630
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:32,680
things. Oh, no, the best one was, you know, those little carnival rides that you can go on where

1631
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:38,040
you're sort of sitting in, it's like a kidney bean shaped metal chair and it's all enclosed. So the

1632
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:42,600
ride can flip the metal chair around and around. Do you know what I mean? So yeah, you can get in

1633
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:47,000
those and he'll just, he does not give a shit if you're pushing your friend into circles. Oh,

1634
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,160
really? Okay. That seems dangerous. That was probably the most dangerous thing we did. Wow.

1635
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:56,280
This is kind of a dream to do this. It feels both scary and exciting. Yeah. And there's this

1636
01:44:56,280 --> 01:45:02,280
statuary everywhere and it's broken. There's a tiny cop man by the entrance and his hand is broken

1637
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:07,000
off and there's sailor moon and she's just beat to hell. She's just like, like somebody just like

1638
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:12,920
ripped her stomach out of her chest. Yeah. Is it, oh, scary. And the $5 is like an official like

1639
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:19,160
booth you give the fire or is it, you just slip the guy $5 like he is sometimes at the booth,

1640
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:25,640
but yeah, very casual, very casual. There's not a ticket or anything. And I don't think I saw

1641
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:31,880
anybody else working there. Wow. There's like one employee. Yeah. This feels like a dream.

1642
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:38,040
It's magical. It's so magical. It's almost as good as latte land. Just getting to run around

1643
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:41,880
this place for 90 minutes. It's just like the flip side of the coin. It's like, you know,

1644
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:46,200
here's the fancy high tech one. And then that, that killed this park, but they found something

1645
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:52,680
cool to do with this. It's like, it's like a good dismal land or something like a park, but you get

1646
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:58,920
to have fun running around. It's not, yeah, it's not making up, making a point about, yeah, no

1647
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:05,560
politics in my failed parks. They, they ran the numbers of like, okay, it's too much of a liability

1648
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:11,560
for the backpack urban Explorer guys to come into this abandoned place. But if we open the

1649
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:18,600
gate of the abandoned place, it's less liability than we're just on a walk around park. And that

1650
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:24,920
keeps our bills lower than letting the backpack guys break in every other way. That's smart.

1651
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:29,160
It's smart to turn it around on the backpack guys. It's magical. So both sides, I mean,

1652
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:35,800
both of these places just like utterly trippy dream. Like you get your, you get your world of

1653
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:43,560
200 polished candy canes and lollipops, but then you get your several decaying figures as well

1654
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:47,800
that you can climb on and kick. Yeah. You're decaying walrus that you can just mount.

1655
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:53,800
Wow. If you ever wanted to mount a decaying magical South Korea is the place for you.

1656
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:58,360
Jeez, that's beautiful. Well, I don't know any, any closing thoughts here on the way? I mean,

1657
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:03,800
this makes me want to go. So yeah. There's this like a monorail that has like a little character.

1658
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:08,680
Oh yeah. There's also a whole like cute animal monorail. I know that looks really great, but

1659
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:14,840
yeah. So there's probably plenty of stuff we could talk about. Yeah. And there's, and if you want the

1660
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:21,320
Lotte world experience at home, there is a, in the spirit of them ripping things off, there is a

1661
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:29,560
roller coaster tycoon mobile game ripoff Lotte world tycoon, which is a one star pretty universal.

1662
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:35,160
So man, I'm going to play a terrible mobile game and not get the experience of this place.

1663
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:40,600
You can too bad. Jeez, but Hey, thank you so much for, for bringing this to the table here.

1664
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,880
A wonderful place that I'd like to go. I don't know when the hell we'll get to go, but listeners,

1665
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:48,680
you gotta go. I think mainly you gotta go to, to the Yama land, right? At first. And if you have

1666
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:53,640
time, go to the right. The giant one. Thank you for letting me revisit two of the most magical

1667
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:58,520
days of my life. Oh my God. I'm so, I am so glad you could. Jeez. And thank you for bringing them

1668
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:03,720
to the table for us. Amy Nicholson, you survived podcast, the ride. This is wonderful. Let's

1669
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:09,800
next to the gift shop. Anything you'd like to plug? I, yeah, I do my podcast with Paul Scheer. I'm

1670
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:14,280
sure y'all know and love that man. He's the greatest. Yeah. Yeah. And our show is just called

1671
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:20,280
We started by doing the entire AFI top 100, going through all of them and seeing if they were as

1672
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:25,240
good as people said they were. We ended up kicking 60 of the films up from the AFI list off the top

1673
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:30,040
100 and now we're just rebuilding. So we're going on little detours. We're about to do young

1674
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:35,160
Frankenstein. Oh, cool. Oh, wow. We're filling in the holes that weren't filled because it's just

1675
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:41,960
like, we love Spielberg. He gets nine movies. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I, uh, do you like then, do you pick

1676
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:47,080
those like, is that just things that you've suspected should be on there or that you're

1677
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:54,120
passionate or why? I like, or are you dipping into like, uh, numbers 101 through 200? How does

1678
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:59,160
that, how does it work? We are following our curiosity. So it's been nice. We did in Bruce

1679
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:04,280
earlier this year, a movie that I deeply, deeply, deeply love. And then Paul made a case for us to

1680
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:09,800
do John Wick and I got to talk about what's wrong with John Wick. So yeah. Yeah. Um, is Guy Ritchie

1681
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:15,640
sneaking on there? Is he gotten one? You know, I do kind of want to go back and watch Locks

1682
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:20,760
Dock and two smoking barrels. Oh yeah. I haven't watched that in a while. That and Snatch. I remember

1683
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:25,880
both being, liking them a lot in high school. Those were cool movies at the time. They were very cool. Yes.

1684
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:31,400
Like that and Boondock Saints. They were cool. And we were cool too, Michael. Well, yeah, of course.

1685
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:37,400
We still are. Yeah, we, of course we are. There has been no cultural fade to Boondock Saints. No.

1686
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:45,080
Exactly where it was at the time. No way. Well, yes, check out Unspooled. Check out all of Amy's

1687
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:49,640
writing and check out, please send us some pictures if you can. I'm so curious to see some of these

1688
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:53,720
epic shots you got. We didn't even talk, we didn't even talk about, I want to talk about Pitbull today,

1689
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:57,240
but we didn't have time. Are you like, that's right. Pitbull. We've talked about Pitbull. Yeah. The greatest

1690
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:01,640
live show on the planet. But that's, we don't have time. So sorry. You come back and we'll talk about

1691
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:06,280
Pitbull. We can talk about Pitbull and we can talk about the steam park in Guatemala. Oh wow. Yes.

1692
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:11,800
Oh, that's great. Yes, please. Anytime. As you're bringing us some stuff we truly have not covered,

1693
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:16,760
taking us to real other worlds. And there's not been a full Pitbull episode, certainly that. So

1694
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:20,920
that's high on the priorities now. But thank you so much. As for us, you can find us on all the

1698
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:40,040
it just depends on Jason's feelings about it. Once he sees the photo, if you put the high school

1699
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:46,040
fake breakaway tux photo on, if you make it for the world to see, or if you pay wallet.

1700
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:50,600
I, oh, oh, it's my decision. I guess so. Is that right? Yeah, I guess it should be.

1701
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:54,600
I well know I'm stuck. It really shouldn't have been. Although we should have an official vote

1702
01:50:54,600 --> 01:51:01,400
here maybe, Scott and I can all vote you. Seems like that's already been decided. Amy, vote.

1703
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:06,680
I believe that you should get the addresses of all the listeners and send them a physical copy.

1704
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:12,200
That's what I vote for. Go back, get the negatives from the high school photo taking place.

1705
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:17,480
And you pay for the shipping. You pay for the photos. You pay, not Scott and I, you pay.

1706
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,160
I vote for that one as well. That's what I'm voting for.

1707
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:24,120
Okay. All right. Wallet sized high school photos of Jason coming to all the listeners.

1708
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:27,800
To your mailbox soon. Yes. Okay. Bye.
