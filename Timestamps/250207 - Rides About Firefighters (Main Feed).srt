00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

All this plus a grab bag of rides about firefighters

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey, we're back on the main feed! It's Podcast The Ride!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, today a tribute to First Responders by us, the worst responders,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to conflict, stress, or faint interest from the opposite sex.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, I'm here, yes, and the way I respond is bad.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No matter what kind of thing is happening, it's bad.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sometimes it'll be bad and people won't even notice.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It'll just be like destroying my insides bad.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
My stress response will be internal, and that's bad too in a different way.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It does. I can only imagine, yes, what we don't know about what you internalize.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, my stomach kind of hurts recently, and it's definitely because of stress.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why? How come? What's been going on?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know, some stuff has been, you know, fleeing.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, wild stuff, and as you may know from a little check-in,

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000
we kind of delayed the proper start of the main feed here for 2025 due to a bunch of stuff.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Again, we are all safe, though cub reporter Jason Sheridan is out on assignment.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We eerily await his return.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But generally, kind of, we are back here on the main feed, ready to kick off 2025,

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
if with calcified internalized stress deposits forming all over.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There's no telling what's going on in there.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We would need a full, like, scan, futuristic scan, I don't know.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's a real theme park journey to go, like, you know, in a body wars fashion.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If we could do body wars.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who crystallized stress deposits?

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Would it be more fun going to the doctor if it was a body war situation,

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
where they shrunk down a little ship and a team of people were to investigate you,

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
versus just, like, the boring doctor looks in your eyes, looks in your ears, snooze.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If they were to shrink, I guess it maybe would take longer.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
For every little thing.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I mean, you've got to be selective.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you saying just any doctor visit equals a miniature team is dispatched?

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes, but you know what it could also be is that they just, like, a miniature team is dispatched,

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and then you go about your day, like, normally, and they go through and they check everything thoroughly.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And that way, they're really getting a good look inside of you.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, they actually, they live there.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They get to see your body is at home, so they get a sense of it.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, they live there for, like, a week or something.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So that's your physical.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Your yearly physical is that the body wars team goes into your body in a tiny ship.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And then there's just a couple things you probably can't do.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can't, like, they got to figure out where to go so you don't poop them out or pee them out.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's the biggest thing.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, because in that ride, the ship would get caught in currents,

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and suddenly you're in an out-of-control blood flow.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And that would be the toughest if you're anywhere near one of the exits of the body.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Right, so they would be worried.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, so they would tell you, like, different things not to do.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And then, yes, they could go and check, and they'd be like,

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
oh, Mike, you're from the stress of the last few weeks.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You've developed a kidney stone, but don't worry.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We blasted it with our lasers on the ship.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't worry about it.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It seems more fun and thorough, fun and thorough.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Mm-hmm.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, it would have improved the ride for sure if the ride was a week long.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, that's true.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That would be more accurate.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And to live in a body for all that time.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But also, like, in your case, they blast a stress kidney stone, great,

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
but then another one forms because you, like,

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
missed out on a, like, X-Men branded Flamin' Hot Cheetos deal.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, that's...

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
They're never going to make Wolverine Strikes Men Flamin' Hots again.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
X-Men character Pyro is featured on the Flamin' Hots,

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and I, there's a limited time drop, and I missed it

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
because I was picking up a drop for Batman Oreos,

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Batman villain Oreos that I had procured,

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and I missed the Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's two-faced Oreos.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You know, we all like to take the Oreos apart,

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but in this case, you take them apart,

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and there's two types of cream in there,

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and do you want it to be good cream or evil cream?

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Right.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Perfect.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's a pretty good snack idea, actually.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, they did that with Star Wars,

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
with the dark and the light side.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, was it Oreos?

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It was Oreos.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, a couple months ago.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And was it the cookie or was it the cream?

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The cream, it was the cream.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, so it was blue or red Oreo.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Now, it tastes the same.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Does that line up with lightsaber colors?

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is that the idea?

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The red's usually the bad.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't know if there's an exception,

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
but yeah, red is the bad, is the Sith.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is it the First Order?

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I mean, it's the Sith.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The First Order is the government part of it,

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the army part of it.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Sith is the Jedi specials.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You know what I'm saying.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I know I don't, actually.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I've watched all the movies,

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and I don't know the boundaries.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't care.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The Sith is aligned with the Empire,

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
but the Empire is just the government

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and the army, basically,

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and the Sith is this extra thousand-year-old,

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
multiple thousands of year old,

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
like kind of magical, evil entity

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that is the counterbalance to the Force,

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
the light side, the Jedi.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So it's like the relationship

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
between the government and the Meta.

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes, to some degree, yes, you're correct.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And Tesla.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They technically are separate entities,

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
but they move in the same stream, certainly.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, well, look, we are kicking it off here, finally,

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and of course, we're sort of getting our bearings

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
from the crazy time that we've had in Los Angeles,

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and after everything that our city went through in January,

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
we have, of course, been extremely thankful

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
to the incredible firefighters

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
who have stopped all these fires from becoming much worse.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's been wonderful to watch.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
As we talked about in our little check-in episode,

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
just knowing how bad they can get

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
if they're able to get bad very quickly.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There was a Hollywood Hills one,

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and one out in the valley by where my folks are,

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and getting to watch the planes do these drops

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and snuff them out has been amazing to watch

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and heartening amidst a bunch of situations

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
that didn't go that way.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, well, past guest Justin Donaldson,

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
literally on the news,

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
watched his apartment get dusted with pink flame retardant.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He watched the drop of pink.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes, he saw his apartment get hit

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
because the fire literally was just feet away,

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
tens of feet, hundreds of feet away.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
My God.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Just got dusted with pink flame retardant.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, he got driven out with barely enough time

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
by other past guest, Matt Mazzani.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, that's a whole nother story, yes.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Matt Mazzani saved him.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Guest Parvius the Ride guests

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
are saving other podcasts the Ride guests.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's the month we're coming out of.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes, and then Justin stayed in my house

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
for a week.

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It didn't occur to me we could talk about this stuff

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
on the show.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes, I don't think they're going to be.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Because you went to San Diego,

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and again, you were never really in danger,

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
but that left an empty house,

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and Justin had to vacate his premises

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
because it got pinked.

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It got pinked, yeah.

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And there was all these just movements of like,

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
my mom and my sisters dated our house that night

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
because their power went out,

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
so I got family in my house,

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and then they leave,

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
then all of a sudden I'm getting multiple texts

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
from a friend of the show, Andrew Grissom.

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Is there a place to put Justin?

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Mazzani's on the way.

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm trying to take a nap.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, he was part of this coordination, too?

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Grissom was part of it.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
My God.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So I'm directing traffic now from San Diego.

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
From another city.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
To try to figure out,

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
okay, I guess we can put him in there.

187
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Justin's got a big dog.

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So this is a little behind the scenes,

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and again, we're very lucky.

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't mean to bother you, Mike.

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I know you've got a family to worry about,

192
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
but is there any way that from afar

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
you could use, I don't know,

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
some kind of mobile device

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and check if there is a way to keep your friends safe?

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Do you think this is a task for you?

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes, I rose to the occasion.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Civaco, I did it.

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Everyone's had to Civaco.

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And yes, another friend of mine had to evacuate,

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and then I'm calling him.

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes, so again, we were very lucky.

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Our stuff was not in direct danger or anything,

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
but then yes, there was just a lot of figuring out

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
if everyone was okay,

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
trying to figure out if everyone has a place to go.

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's just great.

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The non-specific tragic version of this

209
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
is still a lot of hassle for everybody,

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and kids out of school and everything's changing,

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and the situation's different day to day,

212
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
even if something obviously much worse doesn't happen,

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
which is far worse than anything

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
that we all had to go through.

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But it's been, yeah, varying degrees of difficulty

216
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and craziness and luckily kept at bay

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
by firefighters and first responders

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and everybody who's helped keep the city safe.

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So much respect for what they do.

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
My brother-in-law is a firefighter out in Santa Barbara,

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
which itself is an extremely dicey area with wildfire.

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
They've had massive, awful situations,

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and it's very difficult.

224
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The work they do that isn't,

225
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the firefighting is incredibly hard.

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Just rescues and their day to day calls

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
are far more difficult than anything you or I deal with.

228
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Not to play down the work of theme park podcasting.

229
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, all right, you don't have to.

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're right, I don't have to beat us up

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
in order to make them look good.

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's true, yeah.

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They look good already, physically.

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
They're in much better shape than us as well.

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, and then obviously they're very strong,

236
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
they can hold the hose,

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and then the people are in the pilots,

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
they dump water from helicopters and stuff,

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
but can any of these guys nail a reference

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to Lucy's second husband, Gary Morton,

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
like we can?

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't think so, that's all I'm saying.

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's just different skills, different skills.

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Different types of heroes.

245
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Equally talented, different types of heroes.

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Mm-hmm, well, it's the hero you need

247
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
in any given situation.

248
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We try to be the heroes you need,

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
listeners in those ways,

250
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
but today we're triveting the other kind,

251
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
because also in the little check-in episode that we did,

252
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
at some point while talking about all the serious things

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
going on, we were saying,

254
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
wait, is it like when they do the helicopter rides

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and dump all the water, does that count as a ride?

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Is that something we could talk about?

257
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And at least one listener pointed out that,

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
while that is maybe stupid,

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
there are a number of rides that are about firefighters

260
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and that pay homage to this process,

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
to that experience, to the work that they do.

262
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is an odd little subgenre.

263
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There's a good amount of theme park real estate

264
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
across the country internationally.

265
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't even know, I didn't even get into that.

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But I know that in America,

267
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
there is a firefighter presence at theme parks,

268
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
which makes sense, because there's a couple things going on.

269
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
A couple things we'll talk about today

270
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
have old timey fire engines, and that's always interesting.

271
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's interesting if you're into history.

272
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's interesting for a little kid

273
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to be able to climb on those things.

274
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And then fire engines in general

275
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
are more dazzling to a young child like mine

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
than a lot of the stuff you're going to see at Disneyland.

277
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You put it all together, you get the fire truck

278
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
in Radiator Springs riding around.

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, right.

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Well, that's all of it.

281
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's the interest in big vehicles

282
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and rescue vehicles merging with the silly stuff that we like.

283
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
All of that to say,

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
we just thought that maybe an appropriate way

285
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
to start our late start in 2025 would be this,

286
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
collecting the rides that we could find

287
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
that are rides about firefighters.

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah.

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Can I ask, does your son like

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
the Main Street Fire Department at Disneyland?

291
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Not sure that we've done it.

292
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I thought about this because

293
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I finally made it out to Disneyland for a minute,

294
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and we'd had this idea, and I was like,

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
well, I should go poke around there.

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We haven't been to Disneyland together in a minute.

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm sure that he would.

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I also saw kids climbing on the fire wagon in there,

299
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and I don't think I realized that you could.

300
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I assume that was a very bolted down, which it is.

301
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You can't even do the Morse code tapper.

302
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There's not a lot of interactivity

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
in that Main Street Fire Station,

304
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
but kids can climb on that thing.

305
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But yeah, you're right.

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You flash to theme parks and fire department.

307
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's one of the first things you see

308
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
when you enter Disneyland off on the left

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
in Main Street is the fire station.

310
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It is interesting, because yeah,

311
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
that is the one realistic store

312
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
you would have to have in a town square.

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I mean, like a city hall too.

314
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I would hope if your town has the budget for it.

315
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But not a theater with Abe Lincoln, necessarily.

316
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's more fantastical.

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But yeah, I don't spend a lot of time in there either,

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
but I'm like, I guess I should,

319
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
especially because kids seem to like it.

320
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's a little bit unexplored in my mind.

321
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, I don't know.

322
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah, it is, but I walked in there.

323
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I mean, I think we're eating up a half hour in there

324
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
with my son for sure.

325
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But for me, without a kid in my prayer,

326
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
because I was there solo, as we do,

327
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I looked around.

328
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You got an old stove.

329
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's good.

330
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You got a checkerboard built into a table

331
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
that you can't fold down.

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You got buckets that you can't take down.

333
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You got an axe that you can't remove.

334
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And you got pictures of very angry-looking men

335
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
with fine mustaches,

336
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
real tombstone Doc Holliday in there.

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So if you feel like you've been missing out

338
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
on the Disneyland Fire Department,

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
you are missing the angry faces of at least four men.

340
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's, of course, under Walt's apartment in Disneyland.

341
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, he picked as his residence to be above.

342
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Was there ever a time when he could jump on the fire pole

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and write it down?

344
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's a great question.

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't think so, but it seems perfect

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and seems like what he would want.

347
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I mean, I would want that if I had my own apartment

348
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
in Disneyland.

349
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If you were designing an apartment from scratch,

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
much less in Disneyland, yes, the fire pole,

351
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
though do you trust yourself on a fire pole?

352
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Because I think it's pretty easy to get hurt on those things.

353
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You think so?

354
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I think probably.

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I think that seems like one of those things

356
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that's harder than you imagine.

357
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm imagining Dan Aykroyd sliding down in a Ghostbusters

358
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
when he runs into the firehouse for the first time.

359
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I think I'd be fine on the pole.

360
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You're fine on the pole.

361
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think so.

362
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
When was the last time you went down a pole, a fire pole?

363
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't think I've ever been down a fire pole.

364
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Well, even at a playground or something.

365
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh.

366
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's a similar thing.

367
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm not sure.

368
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I do end up on the playground equipment a lot with my son,

369
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
but I don't think I've done a pole slide.

370
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But I'm worried about that.

371
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm worried about that friction.

372
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think it depends.

373
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I think I got to be like ...

374
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You go like this.

375
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah, Aykroyd goes like this.

376
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He kind of tucks his arm in, I think, in that.

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Well, it's not a bear arm, right?

378
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't think so.

379
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You need fabric to soften that blow.

380
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah.

381
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What's the nearest fire pole here?

382
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I mean, how quickly could we slide down it?

383
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Well, I think there's a lot of fire poles around.

384
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't know that they're going to let us on,

385
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
especially not right now.

386
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Well, yeah, I guess I'm not going to barge into a fire department right now

387
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and ask to use a pole.

388
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Also, they're up high.

389
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We toured the Burbank fire station as part of some community event,

390
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and you peer down that, and it's higher up than you think.

391
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think the Disneyland one we can do no problem,

392
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
because that's a little two-story.

393
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But I think your average fire station pole, I think, is a little more ...

394
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I think you'd have a little bit of the hesitation.

395
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You'd get some kidney stones peering down.

396
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I think you're probably right, but I think if all of a sudden you were like,

397
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
oh, there's a fire pole in the room next door, I think I'd run in there and do it.

398
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But now that I have time to ruminate on it, maybe I would get a little more scared.

399
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If you were just jumping and you didn't look at what was ...

400
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
If you just went straight for it, maybe you're fine.

401
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But if you have time to peer, then you're getting nervous.

402
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah, I guess.

403
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
In my mind, you always just grab the pole.

404
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, that would hurt a little bit, so you would want to tuck your arm.

405
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I think you'd want to think your way around the physicality in general

406
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
instead of just jumping and hoping for the best.

407
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Well, this is the kind of thing.

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is why we are respectful of their work.

409
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And before we get too far, I also want to say,

410
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
we figured if we were going to do an episode in this area,

411
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
we should also try to do some good related to these fires

412
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and try to help out Los Angeles and California.

413
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So that's why in this episode, we are going to be raising money

414
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
for the California Community Foundation.

415
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This foundation focuses on the long-term fallout of disasters like this one.

416
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
They help rebuild homes, provide mental health support,

417
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and build up infrastructure to tackle future emergencies of this nature.

418
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So the California Community Foundation, there is a link in the show notes.

419
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But if you'd rather just hear a link out loud the way we do our Patreon link,

420
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
then let me say, if that's what you're used to,

421
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
then I would say go to pledge.to slash PTR.

422
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Nice, convenient, short URL, but it's in the show notes too.

423
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Donate if you can.

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Let's see if the good boys and the Cliffords together

425
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
can't unite and do a little bit of good.

426
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah.

427
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, there you go.

428
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So if you want to reach out and do something,

429
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and thank you to the George Lucas Talk Show boys

430
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
for identifying this great cause.

431
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So click on that link.

432
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll try to remind you throughout the episode.

433
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So there you go.

434
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But yeah, the Disneyland Fire Station right at the front.

435
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah, can I ask, it has an actual address, the fire station.

436
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And my question is, do all the stores on Main Street have addresses in Disneyland?

437
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Because I see 105 Town Square on Main Street, USA and Disneyland.

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Do all the stores have addresses to all the different places?

439
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Don't know that.

440
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Is there some technicality?

441
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Does like the Temple of Mara have an address?

442
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah, that's a good question.

443
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It is some weird code that technically the haunted mansion,

444
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
you do have to be able to, if it's a structure in California,

445
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
you have to be able to send it mail.

446
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, maybe.

447
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Not sure.

448
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't know. That's interesting.

449
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Let's go digging.

450
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And if we can find all those addresses, then we can read them out loud.

451
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh my God, I'm so excited to read them if there are more addresses.

452
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Reciting numbers and street names.

453
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Sounds like a blast.

454
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Let me ask you, I mean, I have sort of a sense of an order

455
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
that we could go in terms of fire-related attractions,

456
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
but when I brought this up, when I said,

457
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
what if we corralled all the rides about firefighters,

458
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
did you flash to anything in particular?

459
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Well, you kind of walked me into it, but yes,

460
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
it was the ride I went on as a little kid, the Santa's Village,

461
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
which was a local park in Illinois,

462
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
where you would put out a fire at Santa's house in the middle of the summer

463
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
with real water, and it wasn't a real fire,

464
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
but it would be like a little whatever, you know, torch or something.

465
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, how are they representing it?

466
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because this is something to talk about too,

467
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
is the representation of fires in theme parks,

468
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
because in some of the attractions we'll talk about today,

469
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
you get very much the Pirates of the Caribbean thing,

470
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
you get the fans blowing on the fabric on the like bright lit fabric,

471
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and that is a cool effect, but in something like that,

472
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
where it's got to be kid safe, what is that fire?

473
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What are you fighting?

474
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It was real fire.

475
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What?

476
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It was just probably, yes, it was real fire,

477
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and it to this day remains real fire.

478
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What?

479
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It was real fire.

480
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm shocked by that.

481
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm walking, I thought you were going to tell me that it was just like

482
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
a clip art of a flame and it kind of spins around.

483
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Nope.

484
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So you were fighting a real fire when you were...

485
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well, when I say like it was like a torch in the same way,

486
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
like a torch blows fire and then you would shoot water at it,

487
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
but you weren't actually putting it out.

488
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The torch would just turn off.

489
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Okay.

490
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Now...

491
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Do you think, and is somebody operating that or is like how are...

492
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I mean, I don't know if it's, I would assume there's a man,

493
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
maybe the person on the...

494
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So basically what you would do is you would go around

495
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and there would be like almost like the universal tram kind of a situation

496
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
where there's like little, it's like little different cars all being pulled,

497
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and you would get these little like fire hoses that dribble water to start.

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Mike, this is blowing my mind what you're showing me because I pictured...

499
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
First of all, you said ride,

500
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and I assumed that was a catch-all for like any attraction.

501
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I didn't think it actually was a ride.

502
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It is a ride, yeah.

503
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You're on a big long truck and there's so many hoses to choose from.

504
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes.

505
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You're riding past real like chain link fences with barbed wire at the top,

506
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and then it just landed at a real fire on top of a house.

507
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So what's interesting about this...

508
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
This ride's crazy.

509
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What's interesting about this, and maybe you define interesting, but...

510
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It is.

511
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It used to be...

512
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's so...

513
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Because I'll describe what I was...

514
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I got to do something that's chintzy or like what I was imagining this was

515
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
for all these years.

516
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So what actually, that's a newer version of this ride.

517
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This Santa's Village closed for a little while

518
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and then opened up as like Santa's Village's Zoosment Park,

519
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
which they added like animals or something,

520
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
and I haven't been there since that happened.

521
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Love a good word that your mouth rejects while you're saying it.

522
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah.

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Zoosment.

524
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But that is a new Santa's house that just looks like a shed now.

525
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay.

526
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Santa's house used to be that there would be the fire inside.

527
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So there would be, in my mind, and I cannot find a good video of this.

528
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I have been looking and I cannot find a good video of what it used to look like,

529
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
but it was probably like, let's say like a dog house for a St. Bernard

530
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
or something size Santa's house, and there'd be one or two windows,

531
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and then the fire would start in one of the windows,

532
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and you'd all sort of shoot the water, the real water into that window.

533
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And then at a certain point, when I got older,

534
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I noticed at a certain point the flame would just go out.

535
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So when I was young, I thought we were putting it out for real,

536
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
but it was pretty clear then it would just sort of turn off,

537
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and they go, oh, you saved Santa's house.

538
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Because also this is what we've encountered with escape rooms,

539
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
like the city walk escape room where ultimately they got to get groups through.

540
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
If they're dependent on a bunch of children to actually put the fire out,

541
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
then the capacity is going way down on this baby.

542
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah, and also that's dangerous.

543
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah, yes, that too.

544
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Uh-oh, it's spread for real.

545
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So now what it is is that they constructed a big shed

546
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
that doesn't really look like Santa's house or anything to me.

547
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You could buy this at Lowe's, I'd say.

548
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And I think maybe that it's not themed to Santa's house anymore is what the situation is,

549
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
because it's called just Santa's, or wait, what is it called here?

550
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Santa's man cave.

551
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That's where he practices the base.

552
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Uh-huh, but I think you're just putting out a fire and it's no longer Santa's house.

553
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's what I get from this, because it's just a shed.

554
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's not themed at all.

555
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's not like a quaint little cut.

556
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's just a big shed.

557
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And then they have this fire thing at the top

558
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
that's almost like you see at the Waterworld stunt show when fire appears.

559
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You can tell it's on a track of some kind.

560
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yes, it's very controlled, right.

561
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Right, so then the water comes out of the hoses.

562
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
These hoses are getting nowhere close, and it's not really the kids' fault either.

563
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That was a real sputter.

564
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Oh, wait, oh, no, no, no.

565
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
They get a little bit, yeah, this is...

566
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
How much, do you know how much control you have over the hoses?

567
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You mean direction-wise or like strength-wise?

568
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because the stronger it is,

569
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
like a kid's not going to be able to keep that thing, you know, it's going to go...

570
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I see it's kind of a short length.

571
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What I recall is that you would be driving in this car

572
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and that they would start to just dribble, the water would start out dribbling.

573
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So you couldn't shoot water constantly.

574
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And then as soon as you pulled up to Santa's house, the pressure would turn on

575
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and it would shoot pretty hard.

576
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And it would get in the window of Santa's house.

577
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I can't tell from these videos if you're getting anywhere close to that fire,

578
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
but they would turn the water on just for that moment.

579
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And then that was it.

580
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But you didn't have like a gun like when you're doing those carnival games

581
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and you shoot water at the target.

582
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It wasn't like that.

583
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So they would turn it on and off.

584
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But as a kid, you're still like, that's real fire.

585
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm shooting real water.

586
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's a pretty impressive ride for a little kid.

587
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I am blown away by the scale of what you're showing me.

588
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Low's shed or no low's shed.

589
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And this is probably the most tangible way to act out this child dream job

590
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
of any of the things we'll talk about in this episode.

591
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yes.

592
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So it was interesting too because it's another one of those things

593
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
that you don't question that hard as a kid.

594
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Because in the actual amusement park, you could go to Santa's house.

595
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And there was a building.

596
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And then you'd go here and it was Santa's house.

597
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And you're like, when was Santa's house over there?

598
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I was there already.

599
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I met Santa.

600
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
This is his house too?

601
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And then you wouldn't question that like it's in the middle of the summer

602
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and it's not like there's no ice around and we're not at the North Pole.

603
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And I think there was some logic to like this is Santa's summer home.

604
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He lives here part of the year.

605
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And then it was right next to a place called the Polar Dome,

606
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
which is an ice skating rink.

607
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah.

608
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Which I sat and watched many boring sister recital along whatever they call them

609
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
where they cram about 200 kids into a full show, four hour show.

610
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Oh my God.

611
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And everyone gets a turn.

612
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah.

613
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Every group gets a turn and you're sitting there going, oh my gosh.

614
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah.

615
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah.

616
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I know it, you know, and it's something I've been worried about as a parent

617
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
of having to sit through things like this.

618
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
However, I think in the last few months,

619
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I got to go to my first little show that my son was in.

620
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh yeah.

621
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Which was a delight, a triumph.

622
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I couldn't believe how tight they kept it.

623
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This was a TV level of stage management.

624
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I can't believe how well the groups came in and out.

625
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And it was space themed.

626
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So my little boy's up there dancing to Fly Me to the Moon.

627
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Wow.

628
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And then the other ones were all like, you know, like space oriented,

629
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
like Levitating was one of them, or like Men in Black and Space Jam.

630
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I like, my son was up first.

631
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
We were like, okay, well, he'll go and then we'll leave.

632
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Right.

633
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
We were so captivated by all the rest of the space performances,

634
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
by all the other grades.

635
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Like, no way I'm leaving this.

636
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So I'm pretty high on the kid shows.

637
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But, you know, again, this was like a tight 45.

638
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It doesn't sound like the ice shows you were seeing.

639
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
No.

640
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And I was also a child as well.

641
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So that wasn't, I think as a kid, as an adult,

642
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I will be much more interested in watching kids perform than as a other fellow kid.

643
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I guess, yeah.

644
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And you're more invested if one of the 200 children is a child that you made.

645
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah.

646
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh, yeah.

647
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm very invested in that.

648
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You physically produced.

649
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes.

650
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Can we call a shot later for just doing this collection of Santa's villages?

651
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Absolutely.

652
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
If, you know, I had the concern.

653
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, yeah.

654
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And there's only so many Christmas things, honestly, that we can do.

655
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So I would love to.

656
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
We had one in San Bernardino or kind of Lake Errehead, right?

657
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yeah.

658
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
There's so many of those.

659
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I was almost concerned about taking this material away by pulling it into the fire episode.

660
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah.

661
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's okay.

662
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But I'm glad you did because those are very real flames the kid gets to fight.

663
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And the notion of having to save Santa Claus' real house,

664
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
especially given that, you know, now that we're on this, like, we're all on the watch duty app.

665
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You're looking up like, oh, it's North Pole's in the red zone.

666
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Uh-oh.

667
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Right.

668
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Doesn't Santa live?

669
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah, geez.

670
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
If this house goes up where Christmas is not happening this year.

671
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That's extreme pressure.

672
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah.

673
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Right.

674
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah.

675
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I did feel pressure.

676
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
The app shows you, do I get presents this year?

677
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Because it also tracks naughty and nice.

678
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And like, oh, my God, I do have presents from Santa and they're in the house.

679
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The house is in level two.

680
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
God forbid it gets to level one.

681
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
The only other game, I'll call this a game because there was some element of it, it was a game,

682
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
that was as stressful was the underwater level in the first Ninja Turtles game for Nintendo,

683
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
which I just, I have such a clear memory of just going, oh, my God, I have to do this.

684
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I have to do this. I have to do like, I have to win.

685
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's so disastrous if I lose.

686
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And it's a similar thing with Santa.

687
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Because your friends would drown?

688
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yes, even though they would drown often with that turtles game because you would switch between turtles.

689
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So sometimes I'd lose three turtles, but beat the level at least.

690
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But you watch their corpses just float up to the top.

691
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yes. And do you know what I'm talking about this level?

692
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
No.

693
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This level is the first Ninja Turtle game for the Nintendo.

694
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
This game is, this is the ultimate, I've played it a thousand times,

695
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
but just the first level and then didn't put in more coins.

696
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Well, no, no, not the arcade.

697
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Not the arcade.

698
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Nintendo game.

699
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yes, this was different because those were, yeah, those were different games.

700
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I don't think I own the Nintendo game somehow.

701
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's a bad game. It's hard to play.

702
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Okay.

703
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
The controls are bad. I've never beaten it either.

704
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But like the third, fourth level is an underwater like sewer level where there's all these different like vines that you can't touch when you're underwater.

705
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Let's call them vines. I don't know what they are.

706
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And like you would hit it like and you'd be like swimming through narrow thing like vines on the ceiling, vines on the floor.

707
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And you got to swim through this narrow path.

708
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And then you have to defuse bombs and there's a timer.

709
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So you have like 90 seconds, let's say to beat the level and you have to defuse 10 bombs and you have to swim through these precarious situations.

710
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And just as a five year old, six year old, whatever I was, I just was white knuckling that Nintendo controller because of this.

711
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And then like when I would win, it would just be like euphoria.

712
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah.

713
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And it's still, I can feel it.

714
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And so you would win. I mean, that's good.

715
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I have beaten the level plenty of times, but I would lose and you would cycle between all four.

716
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Like sometimes I would, yeah, three turtles would die and I would get on the fourth one.

717
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Like Michelangelo would survive with like a little health left, but I beat the level.

718
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And it was fully, they float up to the top.

719
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Then it fully cuts cut scene of splinter at the funeral.

720
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
They take you fully out of the level and throw you back in and you're right next to a vine.

721
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You can't even think about that.

722
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You can't even think about that.

723
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You can't even think about leaping splinter.

724
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Right.

725
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And then, yeah, it's a whole, the funeral is in real time on the Nintendo.

726
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You'd have to watch it an hour.

727
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Michelangelo was a, above all, a crying turtle.

728
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Honestly, it's like kind of the plot.

729
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
A turtle of faith.

730
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Wants to search every Sunday.

731
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The plot of the last Ronin comic book, honestly.

732
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It is.

733
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Michelangelo is the only surviving turtle.

734
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
His brothers are dead and they appear to him as ghosts.

735
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't know.

736
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And then the rest of the game is just.

737
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Well, that's a comic, but yeah, that's, they're going to make, I don't know.

738
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
They said they're going to make a movie, but I don't know.

739
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Of a story where the turtles are, most of the turtles are dead.

740
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Three of them.

741
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Yeah.

742
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Jesus.

743
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Wow.

744
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That's what they said.

745
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't know.

746
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I don't know.

747
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
But then they also said that Colin Jost and his brother were making a turtle movie and

748
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
that's not happening.

749
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So who knows what's going on?

750
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And I can only assume they've announced a Josh Gad turtles.

751
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Well, here it is.

752
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I see it's been announced an hour ago.

753
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes.

754
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
If it is, if it is a property from before the year 2009, Josh Gad has been attached

755
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
at some point.

756
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
That's right.

757
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
This is all, I think all of the emotions that every emotions stress, everything that you

758
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
contain.

759
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I think everything that you shove deep down only to come out as kidney stones.

760
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I think you see a movie where the Ninja turtles all die and you're crying for a month and

761
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
a half.

762
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I think that is how all of it, it all just gushes out of you.

763
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You're an entire life's worth of stress and trauma.

764
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Right.

765
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I agree with you.

766
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You need this movie.

767
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I think this I need it as a catharsis.

768
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And then, yes, there's so many different traumatic, like when I saw the mighty mutanimals die

769
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
in the comic book series, the mighty mutanimals, the friends of the turtles, I saw them gun

770
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
down in a horrifying issue of an Archie comic book completely out of nowhere.

771
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Are you just at like high school?

772
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You're just in Riverdale and then they come and then they publish by Archie.

773
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Okay.

774
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay.

775
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Though they did cross over a little bit.

776
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You think it's about like, oh, do I ask Veronica to the dance and then the mutanimals suddenly

777
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
show they're brought to Riverdale to be executed?

778
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
No, it was not that.

779
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Although there is an Archie Punisher issue that's kind of like a tongue in cheek funny.

780
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Punisher comes to Riverdale to solve a problem.

781
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I forget what the plot is.

782
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh, wow.

783
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You can trace my anxiety to just things that happened to the turtles and their friends

784
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
when I was little.

785
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And so, yeah, you're seeing some, if I see something as an adult, it'll be good for me.

786
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You see all of the stresses in your life as big sharp guys charging at you.

787
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Big sharp guys.

788
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Big sharp guys.

789
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
There were big sharp guys that took down the mutanimals, so you're all right about that.

790
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, basically.

791
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You know, sometimes the problems of the world are more complicated than a big sharp guy,

793
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
but I don't know.

794
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Maybe someday we will face big sharp guys, too.

795
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
My daughter runs around now yelling, I'm craying.

796
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And then I have to run away from her.

797
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Cool.

798
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And then she goes, you're craying.

799
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And then I'm craying and I run after her.

800
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
That's a good one.

801
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That's pretty good.

802
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And she loves in the picture.

803
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Little stuffed craying she's got.

804
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
She's like, craying.

805
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
She's hugging it this morning.

806
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's all happening for you.

807
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It really is.

808
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah.

809
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You can let it all melt away.

810
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm a lucky guy.

811
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You get to live craying in your home.

812
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm craying.

813
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And then she'll go, it's only me to make me know that it's not really craying.

814
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Let me bring this into another memory with my son, which is that I got to do a little

815
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
firefighting attraction when we went to Legoland, San Diego early last year.

816
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We did this thing.

817
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I had to look up what the name was.

818
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Legoland is the Funtown Police and Fire Academy, which in and of itself.

819
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That's good, yeah.

820
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Funtown.

821
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But you still do need law and order even in Funtown.

822
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Why yes, we face the threat of burns here in Funtown.

823
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Anyway, you go to Funtown, you help out Funtown.

824
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What this thing was, truly, I've always been imagining your Santa's Village thing as a

825
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
kind of a cutesy pretend sort of situation like this was.

826
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
This is a very unique attraction where there's four or five vehicles all lined up.

827
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And this is a family attraction.

828
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Everybody does it together.

829
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And I think it's probably optimal for there to be little kids to do some of it and then

830
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
grownups to do some of it and the bigger, heavier lifting.

831
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Because you have to get on a vehicle and you have to pump it and pump your way all the

832
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
way across a little tarmac or something.

833
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And when you get to the end, as fast as you can, you got to jump out safely, still hold

834
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
the kids hands.

835
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Don't want anybody tripping and falling.

836
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Don't want actual emergency.

837
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Don't want them to have to go to the Funtown emergency room.

838
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
But you get down, you got to get to a fire hydrant, you got to start fighting a little

839
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
fire.

840
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
In our case, we had a little blaze to put out at the Funtown post office.

841
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
We had to save the Funtown post office.

842
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And then put it out as quickly as you can and then jump back on, pump your way back

843
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
to the starting point.

844
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And it's like four or five cars, families all facing off against each other.

845
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And this was pretty fun.

846
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
This was like a family double dare kind of situation.

847
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I don't think we've been in something like this where the three of us all together have

848
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
to solve a little problem.

849
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
It was pretty neat.

850
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Very worried the entire queue, however, that we would end up dead last.

851
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And this was my feeling the whole time is that there would be, hey, I don't even want

852
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
to put it entirely on our son.

853
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I don't have the strongest belief in my own physical capabilities.

854
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
This could be a referendum on all of the Gardiners if we come in.

855
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And like markedly, if we are last so much so that it slows the entire experience down

856
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
for everybody.

857
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And the feeling of coming in third in the...

858
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Being third in the Funtown Fire Rally to me felt more victorious, I think, than winning

859
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
a gold medal in the Olympics.

860
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The relief of our family together not being the dead last family, which I think is my

861
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
philosophy in general.

862
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I don't, you know what?

863
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm not going to require perfectionism out of my son academically, athletically, if

864
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I already don't got a good feeling about that.

865
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But that's not what the Gardiners are about.

866
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But the lack of dead last, I think that's my...

867
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Just not last is my parenting philosophy.

868
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
If we can...

869
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Second to last, fine.

870
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Second to last, love it.

871
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Amen.

872
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I remember feeling that way all the time growing up with contests like that.

873
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
As long as I'm not last, you just beg not to be last to God, to your whatever, whoever

874
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
you believed in.

875
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Please don't make me last.

876
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But then, of course, I've said I was last picked in a basketball draft in seventh grade.

877
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, man.

878
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And my dad's...

879
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Despite your height.

880
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Despite your height.

881
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And I know that because my friend's dad was really a jerk and told me.

882
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh, God.

883
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That could have escaped you entirely.

884
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah, I wouldn't have to know.

885
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Fuck.

886
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Why did he tell me?

887
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I don't know.

888
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Jerky thing to do.

889
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I should just say his name here.

890
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Just try...

891
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Would there be any real percussion against...

892
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't think so.

893
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Saying the dad's name.

894
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
No, he's not hearing this.

895
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's up to you.

896
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
No, it's fine.

897
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It's so tempting just to hear some boring name.

898
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Some guy's name.

899
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
His name's kind of interesting, actually.

900
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Oh, really?

901
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
He won't say it.

902
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Eddie, can you say half of it?

903
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
If my friend is listening...

904
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
My friend that I talk to still, if he's listening, I don't want to, like...

905
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I don't want to do it.

906
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I guess it's better.

907
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We know our listener.

908
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Our listeners are going to go to your hometown and they're going to let this guy down like

909
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
a dog.

910
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
They would find...

911
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah, you could do it pretty quick.

912
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Figure it out.

913
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Please, listeners, no more killings of vengeance in our names.

914
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
No, please.

915
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
We've appreciated the first few, but come on.

916
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
We're going to end up in trouble at some point.

917
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Right.

918
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,200
Well, in terms of bigger attractions to talk about, the thing that I flashed to that I

919
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,840
was aware of in realizing, oh, there are rides about firefighting, what I flashed to is an

920
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,840
attraction at Dollywood because I remember them opening this, and I assumed this was

921
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,360
about a few years ago, but in fact, this ride has been open since 2014.

922
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,480
They put in a coaster called the Fire Chaser Express.

923
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:08,320
First things first, while I would like to talk about this Dollywood ride, I would also

924
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,600
like to say we've got to get our asses to Dollywood.

925
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,600
We've got to figure it out, come hell or high water.

926
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:21,840
If this podcast reaches a so-called conclusion and we have not made it to Dollywood, then

927
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,760
what was it all even for?

928
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,040
Why did we do it?

929
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
Well, it's not.

930
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,320
We're going to be replacing ourselves with different hosts.

931
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
It'll never end.

932
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,000
That's the first thing, but second of all, yes, you're correct.

933
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,480
I think maybe what we should do, and I guess I'm spitballing on the ear here, is that we

934
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,320
should probably a year out announce we're going to Dollywood.

935
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
That's the only way.

936
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,280
We're doing whatever, two shows, give everyone plenty of time, because I have a feeling that

937
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,120
the audience there would be more of a show of people coming in from out of town.

938
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,240
I don't know that the Pigeon Forge population is such a big podcast of ride listeners.

939
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,160
I don't know that there are so many locals.

940
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,520
There might be a few, or do you do it in Nashville and then, you know.

941
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
Could do something like that.

942
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
I don't know.

943
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,600
I'd be curious, listeners, strategies, is anybody out there?

944
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,680
Have you seen a podcast like ours in your area, and how did they do it?

945
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,520
We're flying, but we got no tour manager.

946
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,800
We're figuring this shit out ourselves.

947
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,240
We would love to do it.

948
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,440
Every reason on earth is getting in the way of us coming to your town, but God knows we

949
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,240
would love to come to your town, and if your town is Nashville, or even Pigeon Forge, put

950
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
some help in the comments.

951
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
We'd appreciate it.

952
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,440
Would we be allowed to swear in a live show at Pigeon Forge?

953
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,640
Are there some rules on the books?

954
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,000
I think those aspects of Pigeon Forge are exaggerated, because I once thought it was

955
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,600
a dry town, and that's not correct.

956
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
I don't know.

957
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Swearing may be another.

958
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,160
That might be a Dollywood thing.

959
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:03,960
That might be Dolly herself's preference of gosh and dag gum, which I would accept and

960
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
honor.

961
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Right.

962
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
I mean, yeah, I don't have to swear.

963
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
You don't have to talk about 30.

964
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
We can talk about innuendos.

965
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Dolly is fine with an innuendo.

966
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Probably.

967
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I've seen her make plenty of innuendos.

968
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,320
I mean, maybe she's not uncomfortable with us doing it, but she does it.

969
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,520
So I'm just saying, if that's the level of-

970
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,520
Because y'all don't own it.

971
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
You seem nervous.

972
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,520
That's fair.

973
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,520
She's right about that.

974
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,520
No, she doesn't.

975
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
But yeah, I don't know.

976
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,560
I don't know if there's a venue for us in Pigeon Forge, if they could stop running that

977
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
Civil War medieval time show.

978
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,600
I know they've changed it.

979
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,600
But Dolly's Dixie Stampede has been changed.

980
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
Yes.

981
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,480
Yeah, I think it's not called that now.

982
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,560
But could we perform there?

983
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,560
I don't know.

984
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,560
I don't know.

985
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:56,360
I mean, it would be really fun to perform in an area of dirt or gravel meant for horses.

986
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,360
That would be great.

987
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:02,400
And also having to divide people into, you know, they only- all right, now this side

988
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,440
only laughs at Mike and this side only laughs at Jason.

989
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,440
Yeah, that'd be fun.

990
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Cheer on, your host.

991
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,720
Anyway, all this to say, we're gonna talk about Dollywood ride, doesn't mean we're closing

992
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
out Dollywood.

993
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,560
You know, I don't even like talking about rides where it's all my intention to go there.

994
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,980
And in looking into these attractions, because there are multiple, it's only further whetted

995
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:30,440
my appetite to get down there because these look like a real blast.

996
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,680
Air Chaser Express is what they call the first dual launch family coaster.

997
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:43,080
So it's kind of tame enough, the whole family can do it, but it does one forwards, one backwards.

998
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:49,640
It's like, you know, a little bit of Hagrid's kind of stuff, but not so extreme, even to

999
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,160
where there are like little show scenes.

1000
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,560
This ride seems like a lot of fun.

1001
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,760
Dollywood in general seems like a lot of fun, especially because at least at this point,

1002
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,720
they got a big new ride.

1003
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,800
She's coming out and doing a little, I watched the opening ceremony, which starts with her.

1004
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,640
She comes out in a fire uniform, looks incredible, obviously.

1005
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,880
She performs great balls of fire.

1006
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
Delightful.

1007
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,680
From her rock and roll album that she's recently put out, because she was inducted in the Rock

1008
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:24,280
and Roll Hall of Fame and felt that she owed it to getting in the, well, remember she

1009
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,520
turned down the Hall of Fame initially.

1010
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,340
And then they're like, no, you're in whether you want it or not.

1011
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,480
And then she was like, well, I'm not a rock and I don't do rock and roll as much.

1012
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,680
But then she like performed an original song about rock and rolling at the Rock and Roll

1013
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,720
Hall of Fame and then put out this album of rock and roll songs.

1014
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,280
This seems, this is delightful, but seems needless.

1015
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,600
I don't think she had to prove herself in this area.

1016
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
I agree with that.

1017
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Yeah.

1018
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,400
I think she doesn't like, it's an interesting track, it's like, this might not be it, but

1019
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,880
Hey Jude with Paul McCartney or something.

1020
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,560
Like, there's something like that where you're like, wait, what?

1021
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
But yeah.

1022
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,560
Rock star.

1023
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,560
Oh my God.

1024
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,560
This cover.

1025
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,560
Oh, we're in like Angeline territory.

1026
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,560
This is insane.

1027
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
Yes.

1028
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
Oh my God.

1029
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Yes.

1030
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,280
Anne Wilson's on there.

1031
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,280
Linda Perry.

1032
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,720
Oh, a new version of hey, hey, hey.

1033
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,800
Kid Rock in there in the mix.

1034
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
All the best rockers.

1035
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,200
Joan Jett.

1036
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,560
I hate myself for loving you.

1037
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,040
I think I tried listening to this and it wasn't necessarily my favorite album.

1038
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,040
Okay.

1039
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,040
Yeah.

1040
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,040
It wasn't awful.

1041
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,200
It wasn't, I like a lot of Dolly Parton stuff.

1042
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,200
But yeah, anyway.

1043
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,200
So wait a minute.

1044
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,680
There's, wait, there's 30 tracks on this album.

1045
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,320
It's let it be with Paul McCartney.

1046
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,880
There's 30 songs on this?

1047
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
A lot of songs.

1048
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,800
One of the densest works.

1049
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,800
Yeah.

1050
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,800
Wow.

1051
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,800
She really like, I don't know why she's.

1052
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,920
There's been 29 tracks and then she does Freebird, an 11 minute Freebird.

1053
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,920
I don't know why.

1054
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
She put the work in.

1055
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,960
She felt so insecure about getting into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

1056
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,960
Wow.

1057
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,960
Like who cares Dolly?

1058
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
Purple Rain?

1059
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Just go take the.

1060
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,000
This album is 141 minutes.

1061
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Yeah.

1062
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,200
This is like, this is getting close to a brutalist.

1063
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,400
So you need an intermission on this.

1064
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Yeah.

1065
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,400
Yeah.

1066
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Wow.

1067
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
Okay.

1068
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Well, didn't know any of this.

1069
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,720
I'll try to reserve several days to listen to Rockstar, but anyway, I really liked her

1070
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,280
great Balls of Fire and then she comes out and does like folksy jokes and she talks about

1071
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,320
we're investing, we're investing $300 million into the park.

1072
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,920
I got most of it in my back pocket.

1073
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,640
There's a, they, they perform a bucket brigade and she says that she loves the firefighters

1074
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,160
and they're on her bucket lists.

1075
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,160
It's nice.

1076
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:52,000
I think from Bruce Valanche's recent WTF interview, he discusses being like a ghost writer, like

1077
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
writing her banter.

1078
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Right.

1079
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,640
I think that's still kind of a big, I think that's a good like ghost writer area in general

1080
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,320
is if they're the kinds of artists who, I think like a Lionel Richie, I think there's

1081
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,680
people who do still commission jokes from the boys and get their banter jokes, but I

1082
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,480
think that was, yeah, pretty, you know, Valanche was in the Dolly mines.

1083
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,800
I've seen Elvis Sastello a couple of times and sometimes I go, it feels like he has a

1084
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,400
bunch of little jokes written.

1085
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,120
I can't tell if they're him.

1086
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,120
I can't tell.

1087
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,120
Could be him though.

1088
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,760
But sometimes I suspect there's different, different, there is different.

1089
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,280
That's a whole episode of a show that I don't do about the different banter between songs

1090
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,000
for different bands and artists I like, go see.

1091
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,400
So that's a different show, but you insisted Lucy is ours.

1092
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,920
Lucy is a podcast, a ride thing, but do you want to hear like how I think, like what I

1093
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,440
think Jeff Tweedie's humor style is when he's doing a solo acoustic show versus think

1094
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,440
so.

1095
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,160
We might be kind of Lucy territory here.

1096
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,160
I think it's funny.

1097
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,280
I'm just telling you, that's a different show.

1098
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,400
Lucy is different.

1099
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,840
But yeah, that's, oh, my sister saw Bruce Valanche somewhere like a week ago and I was

1100
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:05,280
like, should I just walking around or watching a show, he's watching a show and I was like,

1101
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,000
should I have her ask Bruce to be on this show?

1102
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,360
I didn't, I didn't make her do that.

1103
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,560
Got a book to promote, I think maybe, maybe a podcast, I think, maybe a podcast.

1104
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,560
You know what?

1105
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,560
Let me send an email.

1106
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,560
Yeah, that's that.

1107
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,560
I should, I really need to do that.

1108
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,560
Ooh, a Valanche.

1109
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,560
You know what?

1110
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Feel free to tune out right now.

1111
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
You could do that right now if you want.

1112
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,320
I want, we want that to get done.

1113
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,400
That's more important than you saying anything here.

1114
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
You know what?

1115
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,440
Actually here, you write the email and I will read, I'm going to write an email on the air.

1116
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Yeah, why not?

1117
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,440
Yeah.

1118
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,880
Just bring the mic close to your, that's, you know, that's actually not a good idea

1119
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,440
because I, if you weren't listening to this, then we'll be in deep shit because it's,

1120
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,360
what I'm going to do is I'm going to read the narrative of the ride, Fire Chaser Express.

1121
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,360
Yeah.

1122
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,360
And I need somebody to be hearing this.

1123
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,360
Oh yeah, I'm present.

1124
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,320
Because, you know, it's a little bit, just to try to track what's, what's going on.

1125
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,480
Again, I think you can go on this ride just thinking, okay, I'm a volunteer firefighter

1126
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,360
and I'm going to go on a little adventure.

1127
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,560
I don't think you need to know any of this, but I want to pay homage to this because I

1128
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,000
don't think I knew there was this degree of mythology in Dollywood Attractions and

1129
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm impressed.

1130
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Please go ahead.

1131
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,760
So, the ride is themed around the fictional volunteer fire station Seven and its fire

1132
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,480
chief, Pete Embers.

1133
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,480
Great.

1134
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,600
Pete, love that.

1135
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,760
Pete Embers is a man of considerable patience and he's always more than happy to let sleeping

1136
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,760
dogs lie.

1137
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,760
Okay?

1138
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,760
Okay.

1139
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,760
They convey that in a cue.

1140
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,480
I'm like, maybe there's a sleeping dog in there and he's like, eh, fine.

1141
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,480
He's conflict-averse, I guess.

1142
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Like me.

1143
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,800
Except, except, when the great beautiful smoky mountains and their forests are in danger.

1144
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,600
That's Pete Embers' home and lately, he's had to deal with this local businessman and

1145
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:54,920
eccentric fireworks enthusiast, Crazy Charlie Cherry Bomb and his, I didn't, you know what?

1146
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,280
That was hiding in plain sight.

1147
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,280
I copy pasted the phrase Cherubom written and it didn't even occur to me until I said

1148
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,720
it out loud that his last name is Cherry Bomb.

1149
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,720
They got it.

1150
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,320
Does Dolly do that song on Rockstar?

1151
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,320
Cherry Bomb.

1152
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,600
I don't think so.

1153
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:16,680
So Crazy Charlie Cherry Bomb and his gas station and fireworks emporium.

1154
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,680
Love that.

1155
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,160
Combo, gas station, fireworks place.

1156
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,160
That's funny.

1157
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,880
Crazy Charlie's asking for trouble.

1158
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,100
Because of an increase in dry lightning in the area, Charlie has been calling the fire

1159
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,340
station on a daily basis.

1160
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:33,360
If he sees the slightest hint of smoke, he says, get out here and help me.

1161
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,720
So to deal with Charlie while leaving his regular volunteers available to deal with

1162
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:43,760
real emergencies, Chief Embers has decided to deputize almost everyone in town to keep

1163
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,560
an eye on Charlie and his latest creation, the Big Bertha Firecracker.

1164
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:55,200
So what we are now is like all of the, we're through the regular firefighters and we're

1165
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,480
through even the regular volunteer firefighters.

1166
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,080
We, the riders of this ride are the riffraff.

1167
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,680
We qualify just by like having human bodies.

1168
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,640
We technically have limbs.

1169
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,640
So close enough.

1170
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,720
You can deal with this idiot.

1171
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,640
You go help Charlie out.

1172
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,640
If he.

1173
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,800
I guess that's what Fire Marshal Embers has to do.

1174
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,640
What is his first name again?

1175
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,240
Pete Embers.

1176
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:31,320
The original Dollywood creation, Pete Embers has asked you to help him help out a nuisance

1177
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,600
in town who distracts from real emergencies.

1178
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,880
Wow.

1179
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,880
It shows the respect.

1180
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,280
I mean, this is a very smart plan, but I guess I'm a little insulted that Pete Embers puts

1181
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,280
me in the F pile.

1182
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,280
He's just a no.

1183
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,080
I mean, it sounds like he might not be very good at his job.

1184
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,480
I mean, I don't know what the size of the fire force is at Dollywood, but maybe that's

1185
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,880
the best way to do it.

1186
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,280
Maybe that's the only thing they can do.

1187
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,280
You don't want Charlie Cherrybaum taking all the attention.

1188
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,280
Yeah.

1189
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,280
It makes sense.

1190
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,280
Yeah.

1191
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:08,320
He's just a nosy neighbor or something, but I think then you go on the ride and you determine

1192
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,480
that maybe they should have paid more attention to Charlie the whole time because now he's

1193
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,920
got Big Bertha, which is a very big firework.

1194
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,920
And when you're on the ride, first the ride's just going and you're just kind of riding

1195
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,640
through the great smokeys.

1196
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:30,040
But then you enter the fabled gas station and fireworks emporium and then things start

1197
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,040
going off.

1198
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,040
Real fire.

1199
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,040
You're right next to it.

1200
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,760
And then Big Bertha points at you and you're launched backwards and you propel out of there.

1201
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,760
That's really, yes.

1202
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,760
That's fine.

1203
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,600
It's so similar to like the Big Thunder redo 10 years ago in a lot of ways, like stuff's

1204
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,320
blowing up and you got to get out of here.

1205
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Yeah.

1206
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,320
Yeah.

1207
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,160
It's cool that they have things of that production value.

1208
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,000
I think the equivalent, which is like Grizzly Mountain or something in Hong Kong, I think

1209
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,400
is kind of this structure.

1210
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,600
I think you get cornered, you do a backwards launch, track changes, but it's kind of like

1211
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,800
Everest too.

1212
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:12,200
In that case, I think there is a bear chewing on a cord that you need to keep you safe.

1213
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,280
I don't know if you've watched that ride through.

1214
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,280
That's a fun looking ride.

1215
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,280
I haven't.

1216
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,920
Anytime there's an animal chewing through something on a theme park ride, like the beaver

1217
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,600
chewing through the train tracks at Disneyland, which is a newer thing.

1218
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,600
Really good.

1219
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:32,560
Pete Embers, I always, it's interesting because sometimes Pete fights Embers, shouldn't it

1220
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:38,360
be like Pete Firehose or Pete Firehydrant, Pete Hydrant?

1221
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,360
Pete Pole.

1222
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,120
Pete Pole, Pete Truck, you know what I'm saying?

1223
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,360
Why would his last name be something he's fighting?

1224
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,360
I don't know.

1225
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
I guess it depends.

1226
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,640
But then he cuts in his blood.

1227
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,640
He comes from it.

1228
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,880
Yeah, I guess so.

1229
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,280
He's of the Embers.

1230
00:53:54,280 --> 00:54:00,080
It does feel like a 90s, 80s action movie character would be called Pete Embers because

1231
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:08,200
I've mentioned this before that Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando is John Matrix and then I was

1232
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,560
just watching Demolition Man last week.

1233
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,280
The only person left alone is John Spartan in that.

1234
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,280
Oh, right.

1235
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,280
Yes.

1236
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,280
Detective John Spartan.

1237
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,280
Oh, Demolition Man's up there.

1238
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,280
You just named my two favorites.

1239
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,720
I think Commando, my favorite Schwarzenegger, and Demolition Man, my favorite.

1240
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,440
Which stands, I just watched Cliffhanger and I enjoyed Cliffhanger, but it's no Demolition

1241
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,400
Man to me because they don't show you the future of what Taco Bell will be like.

1242
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,480
Yes.

1243
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,600
And you remember Wesley Snipes' character's name in Demolition Man?

1244
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,600
Simon Phoenix.

1245
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,600
Fantastic.

1246
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,640
Fantastic.

1247
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,640
God, hell yeah.

1248
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,640
Masterpiece.

1249
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,640
And I'm not going to do this to torture you, but I didn't realize this until last week

1250
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,520
and I almost fell out of my chair.

1251
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,680
Don't tell me Gail Gordon's in Demolition Man, for God's sake.

1252
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,220
Well, Podcast the Ride character, or person that comes up once in a while, it plays the

1253
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,720
warden at the start and is killed by Simon Phoenix.

1254
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,720
Who's that?

1255
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,720
Andre Gregory.

1256
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,720
Oh.

1257
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,720
From My Dinner with Andre.

1258
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,720
Really?

1259
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,720
Yes.

1260
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,720
Oh.

1261
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,720
I'm watching this.

1262
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,720
Wow.

1263
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,480
Wait, what the fuck?

1264
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,880
My Dinner with Andre?

1265
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,480
Of course, with the story, you've heard the story on Podcast the Ride, but yes, he gets

1266
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,440
killed pretty early in the movie, like he gouges his eyes out.

1267
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,440
I didn't know that.

1268
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,440
Yeah.

1269
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,440
Wow.

1270
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,440
It's an all-star cast.

1271
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,440
Geez.

1272
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:33,680
Well, it's also the dystopian future with big scary buildings as portrayed by the San

1273
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:40,640
Diego Convention Center and this one office park in Westlake Village.

1274
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,960
It's right next to a Caruso property.

1275
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,960
Yeah.

1276
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,360
Anyway, do yourself a favor.

1277
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,720
Take yourself on the Demolition Man locations tour.

1278
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,520
You'll see a lot of nice stuff.

1279
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,360
I was just there last week.

1280
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,680
That's the thing about not swearing, also, like we were just talking about.

1281
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
Wow.

1282
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,680
That ties it all together.

1283
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,200
It is a Pigeon Forge world in which swearing is not allowed, which makes Simon Phoenix

1284
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,200
all the more abrasive.

1285
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,200
Right.

1286
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:17,880
So anyways, yeah, I don't know, I love Pete Emmer's, I love Charlie Cherry Bomb, yeah,

1287
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,800
you get in there, things start going off, Big Bertha tips at you.

1288
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,560
I just love that there's a show scene in a Dollywood attraction.

1289
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,760
I didn't know the degree of theming there and it looks great.

1290
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,760
It looks like a lot of fun.

1291
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:34,400
There is another fire themed attraction, but it sort of ties into the other big one that

1292
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,400
I want to talk about.

1293
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:41,720
So maybe I'll kind of like move along in that order, because one's sort of like a cousin

1294
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,520
of the other one.

1295
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,880
And as we transition from thing to thing, I will remind you that in this episode, we

1296
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,720
are raising money for the California Community Foundation.

1297
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,360
That's at pledge.to slash PTR.

1298
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,360
Link in the show notes.

1299
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,360
There we go.

1300
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,360
All right.

1301
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,360
I'm doing my hosting here.

1302
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,360
Professionally done.

1303
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,360
Yeah.

1304
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,960
The park drops.

1305
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,960
Wow.

1306
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,960
Mid episode.

1307
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,040
Didn't even call any attention to it.

1308
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,040
Just kept moving.

1309
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,040
Casual.

1310
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,040
Yeah.

1311
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,040
Casual is all I'll get out of it.

1312
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,040
Didn't make a meal out of it.

1313
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,040
It was more of a snack.

1314
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,040
Quick snack.

1315
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:19,920
Well as we get to the main course in my estimation, because this ride I was not previously familiar

1316
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,160
with and now I am dying to get there and go on it.

1317
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,380
Another place that I, you know, I don't even know that this park was on a list of places

1318
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,140
I was especially dying to go, but I am now because we're talking about a ride called

1319
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,100
Fire in the Hole.

1320
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,300
This is at Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri.

1321
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,300
Here's another thing.

1322
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,300
That's another place.

1323
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,340
If we're like planning flags for future things, I feel like if we made it to Branson and we

1324
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:48,020
like really planned it in Branson, I think we could become an all Branson podcast for

1325
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,020
a year.

1326
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,020
100%.

1327
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:54,660
I watched a Club 3 loser at one point was a Branson, it was, I think it was called Lights

1328
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,060
Camera Branson or something.

1329
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:02,540
And it was, it was like a promotional video hosted by Willie Ames, who played Bible man,

1330
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:08,300
of course, more famously from Charlie and Charlie and Charles in Charge.

1331
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,020
I got old Charlie Cherry bomb in my head, you see.

1332
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,860
He's never in charge.

1333
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,860
Shouldn't be.

1334
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:19,220
But so anyway, I, that was just like suggested as a maybe Club 3 and I'll like, I'm like,

1335
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,220
I'll watch it.

1336
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,220
I'll do it.

1337
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,220
It was so fun.

1338
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,220
I'm like, Oh my God, Branson.

1339
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:29,340
I mean, it seems like it might be like maddening to be there too.

1340
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,700
I can't tell.

1341
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:35,500
But because it seems like it's all just on one big street, just like one long highway

1342
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,980
you drive down.

1343
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,820
It's just theater after theater after theater.

1344
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,980
But also this theme park, Silver Dollar City, and I will be honest, I've never looked into

1345
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:53,100
anything at Silver Dollar City and I am so surprised and delighted by fire in the hole

1346
00:58:53,100 --> 00:59:00,620
because what we have here built in 1972, this is, I think lays claim to be the first

1347
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,980
indoor dark ride roller coaster, right?

1348
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:09,220
I think it is the first ride with coaster elements where it does speed up and get fast

1349
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:15,180
and his lift hills and drops, but there's also animatronics and sets and show scenes.

1350
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:20,220
And when you add all that, I mean, this is like this today remains one of the most challenging

1351
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:21,500
genres of ride.

1352
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,980
And when they open, you know, it's it's it's gigantic news.

1353
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:32,140
I mean, this this genre is this is this is Guardians of the Galaxy, Cosmic Rewind.

1354
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:33,500
This is Gringotts.

1355
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,100
This is like, you might say Journey to the Center of the Earth in Tokyo, Disney.

1356
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:41,380
See, it's just a hard thing to do to get animatronics along.

1357
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:47,700
And they they were doing it in this crazy homespun dressed up mannequin kind of way

1358
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,100
back in the early 70s.

1359
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:49,700
It's crazy.

1360
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:55,660
Yeah. Some version of this ride system is probably my preference for ride system.

1361
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,980
I don't like if I had to design a ride, I want some thrills.

1362
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,500
I want something exciting.

1363
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,780
But obviously, we want the show scenes.

1364
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,220
We want the robots.

1365
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,300
So like, that's the tricky thing.

1366
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,420
I mean, I guess Indiana Jones ride vehicle is close.

1367
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,620
Yeah, it could be exciting without a coaster proper.

1368
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,300
I don't require, but it certainly is.

1369
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,540
But it's cool to combo coaster and show scenes.

1370
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:21,020
Mummy, I guess, is one that's for mummy.

1371
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:28,660
And like Gringotts, in my mind, Gringotts never fully that first part of Gringotts

1372
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,460
when you kind of dip down, you do the drop.

1373
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:31,940
They're exciting.

1374
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,020
I go, holy shit.

1375
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,780
And then the rest of it is like fine to fun.

1376
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,420
I guess it gets a little more like anonymous screen.

1377
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,620
Yeah, it gets a lot of spinning in your eye.

1378
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,780
It's not quite.

1379
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,460
It never gets the high of that opening thing.

1380
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,060
I like Hagrid's better.

1381
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,220
Yes, I guess, obviously.

1382
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:52,820
But yeah, but even with Hagrid's, it's still like tricky because it's like some of the

1383
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,860
stuff you see too fast.

1384
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,660
It's like you wouldn't always time out, right?

1385
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,740
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

1386
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,260
Not that I still I think it's pretty great in a lot of ways.

1387
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:04,900
But yeah, it's the ability to speed up and slow down, which I don't know that they

1388
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:09,900
particularly had that ability on this or it was just like a gradual lift hill that

1389
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,860
you don't even it's so gradual you don't realize it's happening.

1390
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,980
Yeah, I frankly don't know how they did.

1391
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,860
And this is before Space Mountain, even right.

1392
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:23,140
And it's like that's when we were talking about that initial idea for Star Wars in

1393
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:27,780
the Disney Disneyland with the like track like decision point.

1394
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,460
Yeah, essentially, it looks like it would have been like this.

1395
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:34,020
Yeah. And then like they had other ambitious things like the scene.

1396
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,100
I guess it wasn't that ambitious.

1397
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,420
The scene would kind of lift or raise.

1398
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:41,420
I forget you'd be in Dagobah with Yoda at the start of the ride, I think.

1399
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,860
And then it would lift you up.

1400
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:43,780
Yoda lift you up.

1401
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:48,020
But I think what it'll be just the scene, the whole scene would lower or raise up.

1402
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:50,540
Oh, it might be like an optical illusion like Haunted Mansion.

1403
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,780
Right, right, right. Gotcha.

1404
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:56,500
But yes, that's in my this is this is the feeling I've always want.

1405
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:02,020
I always want from rides is like the ability to see robots, but then go really fast.

1406
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,220
Yeah, that's what you want.

1407
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,580
It's actually sort of a rare combo.

1408
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:09,820
Yes. Right. Because you want to like, you know, we love pirates and we love Haunted

1409
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:13,780
Mansion. These are these are rides where you have all the time and we slow down to

1410
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,980
appreciate the robots.

1411
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:20,900
But something that lets you do that to some extent, but then also keeps going.

1412
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:25,100
Now, here's another I think we're very fond of these Knott's Berry Farm,

1413
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:31,540
the Calico set of rides of Calico Mine Ride and the log flume.

1414
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:35,540
But those are sometimes in that log flume, you rip it through and you can't see all of

1415
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:40,820
you can't see how poorly articulated the electronics are.

1416
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,940
You can't see how scary their faces are.

1417
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:48,180
Yes. Other side of the coin on the Calico Mine Ride, it's so slow that you have nothing

1418
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:54,140
but time to see the sad, sad faces of all the miners and maybe get a little bit depressed.

1419
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,740
This is a ride I've been very hesitant to take my son on who is obsessed with trains.

1420
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,460
But and like, that's the train ride.

1421
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:04,420
But then I'm like, you get on it and it's so dark and it's so claustrophobic.

1422
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:09,780
And the the sound of it is just like, oh, it's like, yeah, it is.

1423
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:15,100
Yeah, yeah, I am really worried my boy would would freak out trains or no trains.

1424
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:20,100
So you're not now that's not look, we love the creakiness.

1425
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:25,780
We I think in general, all of that to say, I think we love scary,

1426
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:31,460
limited animatronics or not animatronics or just like, you know,

1427
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:36,900
mannequins with old timey costumes on them, it's like it's an area

1428
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,860
that seems synonymous with theme parks is is like

1429
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:46,460
like cowboys go, well, well, fancy seeing you here.

1430
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:50,500
But it's actually it's actually a little hard to think of tons of examples

1431
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:55,500
of that kind of thing, of unmoving, weird looking characters

1432
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,820
who talk to you in folksy voices.

1433
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,980
And this is the mother lode fire in the hole.

1434
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,460
This is exactly what you want.

1435
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,140
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

1436
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:07,660
I mean, we were spoiled, I guess, by having knots here,

1437
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:11,940
because there is a lot of kooky old timey guy.

1438
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,980
Yeah. It's like three rides, I guess, with that actual like figures.

1439
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:18,260
Maybe more. You know, it's weird.

1440
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:22,540
It's like less the I wouldn't really call the raft ride that

1441
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:25,380
because those are kind of these like charming, realistic bears.

1442
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,500
There's one guy with a musket.

1443
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,740
OK. Oh, is there? Yeah.

1444
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,660
There's one like musket guy.

1445
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:36,700
And you used to have Mystery Lodge, which is not was not a animatronic.

1446
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:41,260
That was a guy in a costume and a mask who would talk about the Raven.

1447
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,980
Oh, the Raven.

1448
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,860
And it's it feels like kind of related to that.

1449
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:51,420
But like, anyway, I like it just it seems like you're always.

1450
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:56,020
I'm always chasing a weird old weird creepy cowboys.

1451
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,980
Yeah. Well, I park attractions.

1452
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,180
But where do you where do you really get them?

1453
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,780
And you certainly get them here.

1454
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,140
Yes. This is you get. Yes.

1455
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:06,860
You feel fills the promise of the idea, because even it feels like

1456
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:10,140
you would get more of it at Disneyland, but you don't really anymore.

1457
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,420
I mean, there's not really that many cowboy performers.

1458
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,420
Golden Horseshoe is not running.

1459
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:17,540
Yeah. You hear the prospect, your voice on Big Thunder.

1460
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,860
Yeah. So, yeah, it's becoming a little bit.

1461
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:24,500
Does anything at Disney in any of the parks fit the bill here?

1462
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,740
I mean, like you've got Carousel of Progress, but that's a different

1463
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,900
that's old timey, but kind of a different.

1464
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,260
I mean, like for specifically for cowboys or. Yeah.

1465
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,660
I don't know.

1466
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,580
Where they're creepy.

1467
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:39,900
The Hooptie Do review or there are cowboys in that in Disney World.

1468
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,980
I mean, I think I think it's in that vibe.

1469
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,980
Yeah. I don't know if there's like scary,

1470
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,900
you know, figures whose mouths don't move.

1471
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,540
No. Yeah, that's that's what I want.

1472
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,500
I want it just.

1473
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:53,500
Yeah. The creepy off putting soot covered faces.

1474
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,780
Yeah. And this is wonderful.

1475
01:05:55,780 --> 01:06:00,340
It's wonderful. So so the to tell the story of this,

1476
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,180
this is all based on real local legend and lore.

1477
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:09,020
Again, volunteer firefighters, which this system is flawed to me.

1478
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,540
I mean, this is, I guess, the way they get you to be part of the experience

1479
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,700
is that you're a volunteer firefighter.

1480
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,540
Having been through a bunch of fires in our city,

1481
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,260
I don't want I don't want no Scott and Mike fighting these fires.

1482
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,740
I hope we're not doing volunteer firefighters.

1483
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:24,460
I've learned a lot.

1484
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,500
Now, there's not the podcast to discuss all the different people

1485
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,340
fighting the fires at the same time.

1486
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,420
But it's interesting because, yeah, there are volunteers.

1487
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:34,860
There are people that are serving time fighting the fires.

1488
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:35,900
Yes, that's terrible.

1489
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,540
But I think if we and I were fighting the fires,

1490
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,340
they would give us an easier job.

1491
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,660
Like somebody needs to keep an eye on the keys

1492
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:47,340
and the ignition of the firetruck while we fight the fire.

1493
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,780
So I feel like there's Dalmatian jobs.

1494
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:55,020
Sure, we could keep that Dalmatian calm, make sure to check everyone's

1495
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:58,020
like pants to make sure they're not falling down while they're fighting

1496
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:01,140
the fire and you like I run up behind a firefighter and pull their pants up,

1497
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:04,940
make sure their suspenders are or are tightened,

1498
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,340
whatever you call them overall.

1499
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:11,540
Cook up a giant vat of chili for when the boys come home.

1500
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,700
I don't know about that.

1501
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,980
I wouldn't be good at that either.

1502
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:14,940
Yeah, that would be good for me.

1503
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,620
I could technically I could read technically get like physical food

1504
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,500
I would get something that resembles the ingredients of chili in a pot.

1505
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,860
It'd be the worst chili you've ever had.

1506
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:28,180
But yeah, I look, I'd fill that vat with something.

1507
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:31,460
Yeah, I could take I could take all the firefighters Taco Bell order.

1508
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:32,580
That's a good idea.

1509
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:36,060
And I could really like what in the middle I could get really figure out down to like,

1510
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,340
OK, Brian doesn't want lettuce.

1511
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:43,140
OK, and I can do that in the app and a whole light light sour cream.

1512
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,500
Is that right, Leroy? OK, got it.

1513
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:49,460
Ben's going to need extra beans after all that effort.

1514
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,940
Right. So I could do that.

1515
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:51,540
That's too bad.

1516
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,500
You know, I like what we're donating to the California Community Fund,

1517
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:58,020
but I do wish that we could also just get a just get everybody to chip

1518
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,100
in on a really good Taco Bell order for some local firefighters.

1519
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,580
That would be fun. Yeah.

1520
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,580
I might as well.

1521
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:08,380
I'll repeat a joke that was from a text thread that we're on.

1522
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,300
There's this app that we've been looking at,

1523
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:15,060
you know, showing like are these fires spreading and what's in level one

1524
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:18,340
and what's in level two, but it also shows food distribution centers

1525
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:21,860
for first responders and people helping out places that are giving out food

1526
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:24,940
for free. And I saw on the map like, oh, they're giving out food

1527
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:27,660
at the the Hollywood Boulevard Hard Rock Cafe,

1528
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,940
to which I thought, haven't these people struggled enough?

1529
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:35,060
This is how we treat the best among us.

1530
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,860
I mean, I guess no firefighters at CityWalk.

1531
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:43,900
I'm banning them for we need to let's let's raise them up.

1532
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:47,820
Well, I mean, there's no way to eat at CityWalk anymore.

1533
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,460
There's no restaurants other than Toothsome.

1534
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,620
That's right. It's all going.

1535
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:51,660
Oh, that too. Yes.

1536
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,860
Thanks for really letting it being respectful of our time off

1537
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:58,100
as we cope with every single CityWalk establishment going away.

1538
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,660
We're feeling it's a whole other episode is like, which we could do.

1539
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,380
It's just like, what do we think's happening?

1540
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:06,980
I really didn't want to do any more CityWalk content for a while.

1541
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,500
But I feel like we got it.

1542
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,460
I guess we got to do something we can give that we can, you know.

1543
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,260
It's not going to be like a saga.

1544
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,860
Stephen Kempner is living his life.

1545
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,060
I don't know what's the thing.

1546
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,220
This is just about podcast, the right.

1547
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,020
It's still our right to talk about.

1548
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,940
And I remember we're the only people who can make heads or tails of this.

1549
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,020
Well, we'll see if we're called into duty as time goes on.

1550
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:32,020
Anyway, I think a firefighter deserves a great big firehouse sub.

1551
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,220
But just don't go don't go to the CityWalk one

1552
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:38,100
because you're going to end up with plastic in there, which Jason called.

1553
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,940
What? It's just a little oh, it's just a little nub and little nub.

1554
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,900
Yeah, my God.

1555
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,100
I love you can get away with anything

1556
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:50,700
by just doing that little he's forgiving a place that put plastic in the sandwich.

1557
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,780
I mean, they're twice.

1558
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,940
I mean, they're twice since Jason got the little nub.

1559
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,500
I like firehouse.

1560
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:02,340
And I even I'm so I'm hungry right now worried about nubs with every bite.

1561
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,460
You might have eaten nubs.

1562
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:06,020
I do. You're worried about microplastics.

1563
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,700
And then you're getting those.

1564
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,820
Yeah, I know. I'm eating those.

1565
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:12,340
I'm for sure eating those, depending on what the wrapper is made of.

1566
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:14,900
Yeah, you're going to get mega plastics in those.

1567
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,580
I made this joke already. I think I did.

1568
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,940
Yeah. You know what?

1569
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,140
We're all in a blur here. Right.

1570
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:23,100
I do a quick check to make sure there's not a piece of plastic in there.

1571
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,380
And then there's usually not.

1572
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:28,260
I bet Jason would enjoy if you made a fire.

1573
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:32,380
If you got him up in that on a second level firehouse subs,

1574
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,260
make a sub as long as a fire pole.

1575
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:43,180
Oh, yeah. Cover it in giant nubs just to like make it like stay solid for a while.

1576
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,780
But then right before it's time to go, remove the giant nub

1577
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:50,620
and and just let him slide down it and eat as he goes.

1578
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,100
Oh, yeah, that'd be fun.

1579
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:53,340
Yeah. Yeah.

1580
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,980
Uh huh. So I'm going to draw that Jason was going to get executed.

1581
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,140
I think we should arrange for that to be his final meal.

1582
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,580
Execution by Hoagie.

1583
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,260
Well, who could complain about that?

1584
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,860
No. All right.

1585
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,780
Look, fire in the hole.

1586
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:14,140
This attraction, you're in an old minor town.

1587
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,860
You're in the town of Marmaros.

1588
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:21,540
And you are, you know, in the town's businesses,

1589
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:24,500
harvesting guano, you know, bat shit.

1590
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,340
Yeah. So you life's good.

1591
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,820
You work in a bat shit mine.

1592
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:32,540
But there's some no good nicks who make your paradise

1593
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:35,060
a little less great than it could be. Yeah.

1594
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,660
And they are called the bald knobbers.

1595
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:41,540
The bald knobbers are a group of vigilantes.

1596
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:44,860
And they are starting to burn down the town.

1597
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,580
Now, I get into this.

1598
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,700
I'm like, OK, so what are they?

1599
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,620
They're weird vigilantes.

1600
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,460
Yeah. The 1800s.

1601
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:57,260
And they wear weird masks and hoods. Go ahead.

1602
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,500
I'm nervous about what's going on with these.

1603
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,740
And it's a real thing.

1604
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:03,060
So I don't know. I'm like, I'm oh, yeah.

1605
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,820
What are these bald knobbers?

1606
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:09,300
Would you call these bald bald knobbers, you know, kind of a clan with their

1607
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,980
they sort of together? Do they all form a clan?

1608
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:13,540
Sure. Good question.

1609
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:15,260
You look it up and I guess not.

1610
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:18,580
I was a little lost in the literature.

1611
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,820
Yeah. About the bald knobbers.

1612
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:25,580
If anything, it seemed like they were sympathizers of the union.

1613
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,500
Really? I think so.

1614
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:31,100
OK. The enemies in this riot are on the union side.

1615
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:35,140
Interesting. I guess I'd rather not ask any more questions about what's going on

1616
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:37,820
here and just focus on that. It's fun animatronics.

1617
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,180
OK, all right.

1618
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:42,980
Anyway, but I try to dive in a little bit.

1619
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:45,500
So you've got to watch out for the bald knobbers.

1620
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,860
They're trying to turn.

1621
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:50,860
They're trying to burn down the fine homes of all the best batshit harvesters.

1622
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,260
This side of the Ozarks.

1623
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:54,540
And that's real, too.

1624
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,300
People were harvesting batshit.

1625
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:01,260
Yeah. OK, I guess is used as fertilizer.

1626
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:05,180
Like there's there is need for specifically batshit, though.

1627
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:06,860
Yeah. Just a funny joke.

1628
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,660
I guess so.

1629
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:11,860
OK. I mean, I guess batshit crazy comes from somewhere.

1630
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,780
Some somebody snuffed a bunch of guano.

1631
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:19,100
Right. Guano would make give you some sort of madness.

1632
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,180
And that's why that's why that phrase exists.

1633
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:25,180
I don't know. I think you go up to that pinks hot dogs at City Walk.

1634
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,700
I think those I think those wieners are made out of guano.

1635
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,740
That's probably true.

1636
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:32,540
I don't cut to you up there as soon as we're done recording.

1637
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:35,460
You say firehouse subs in my mouth waters.

1638
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,700
You say pinks hot dogs and it dries up.

1639
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,900
I swear. OK. All right.

1640
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,660
There are still there are still rules and there's the right.

1641
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,660
Aren't so guano crazy in this world.

1642
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:51,100
No, I get my my tummy rumbles for firehouse subs, but not pinks.

1643
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,300
Thanks. Yeah. In general, so it's like a rough brand.

1644
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,100
City food, though, there's no rumored closings.

1645
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,900
If we should say at City Walk.

1646
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,020
Well, yeah, I've got my theory.

1647
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:01,260
I think that zone is safe.

1648
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:04,220
I think the closer to the parking garage as you are, you're safe.

1649
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:07,020
I think that I think but I think we're going to see an entire building

1650
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:10,540
go and replaced by a new hotel or by some kind of talk.

1651
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,540
Yeah, we have talk about speculation in this.

1652
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:15,940
But it seems like there's the least funny episode you've ever heard.

1653
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,500
We'll just we're going to get our maps out.

1654
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,860
We're going to send you your maps.

1655
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:19,580
We're going to. Yeah.

1656
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,660
Speculation and four and a half hours. Yeah.

1657
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:26,020
But it's no concrete facts of any kind.

1658
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,980
No, nothing entirely guessing.

1659
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:31,580
Just like the three differently universal accounts to post all the time

1660
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,980
that post these things that in my mind have popped up in the last six months.

1661
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,020
Yeah, I know there wasn't this.

1662
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,500
There wasn't so much universal Twitter.

1663
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,260
Yes, there's like three or four.

1664
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:45,540
Universal High, Universal High with fires and five fires.

1665
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:47,580
Five fires doing streams now.

1666
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,580
I don't know anything about him other than I see some on streams.

1667
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:50,860
He goes to Disneyland sometimes.

1668
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,420
Yeah. But then there's another like universal account.

1669
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:56,460
I forget the name of it that's posting like these are the rumored closings.

1670
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:58,700
And it's like Margaritaville's on the list.

1671
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,100
It's that whole section over there.

1672
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,300
But then they're also building escapology,

1673
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,300
which is not a universal owned escape room.

1674
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,660
It's a different company.

1675
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,300
Because I think that building is safe, too.

1676
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,540
That's my theory. I think it's structure by structure.

1677
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:13,420
Well, that's the only because it's connected to Toothsome.

1678
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,260
Yeah, but it's too.

1679
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,980
But Toothsome seems like as failing as a business could possibly be.

1680
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,740
No one was. And what else is in that building?

1681
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,300
It's just it's a Wetzel's right.

1682
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,020
The Wetzel's is there. Mm hmm.

1683
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,500
But then everything other than that and city food.

1684
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,540
Yeah. Who knows? Mm hmm.

1685
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,620
I guess Vivo is safe.

1686
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:31,460
I don't know, though.

1687
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,780
I think a lot of its neighbors are going away.

1688
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,060
Right. Can't tell.

1689
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,980
I don't know. It's another.

1690
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:37,860
I'm just glad it's going.

1691
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:40,860
I'm glad that the fires spared the universal hills

1692
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:44,220
and that all these buildings and businesses can go out on their own terms.

1693
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:45,420
We got to do this next week.

1694
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,820
Maybe so. I got to get up there.

1695
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,700
And we should probably just do with this episode.

1696
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,060
Measure, spy, get up as high as we can.

1697
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:55,220
Look down at construction sites, see if anyone dropped any permits.

1698
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,060
Yes. Let's see what we can do.

1699
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,180
I'm going to do. Yeah.

1700
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,660
Reconnaissance.

1701
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:02,460
Yeah, we'll try. Well, without without our cub reporter,

1702
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,980
we will try to do our best.

1703
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:06,580
Barrel ahead as best as we can. Yeah.

1704
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:08,940
Anyway, so this this just becomes like,

1705
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:11,940
all right, fires are breaking out in the city.

1706
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,100
We're trying. I think we're trying to help.

1707
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,580
I think firefighters are part of it, but mainly just like trying

1708
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:22,340
to navigate all of the craziness as it starts breaking out.

1709
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:26,140
And what you end up with is just it's just this like very

1710
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:31,100
charming homespun ride that has a lot of great and memorable scenes

1711
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,980
that seem like these are these clearly are the equivalent of like

1712
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:39,660
the dynamite goat if you are a lifetime silver dollar city person. Right.

1713
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,580
Like if you've been going here forever,

1714
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:47,740
then you then you might you would just toss off casually a reference to

1715
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:53,140
why, of course, Red Flanders and his missing pants.

1716
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:53,700
Yeah, yeah.

1717
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:57,060
There is a bald knobber trying to climb up into a window

1718
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:59,260
and steal a guy's pants.

1719
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:04,300
And his name is Red Flanders, not Ned Flanders, Red Flanders.

1720
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:08,060
So you got that.

1721
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:12,500
You got a collapsing bridge scene.

1722
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:18,580
This is really cool and clever, especially for 72. Right.

1723
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:23,380
That it's a situation sort of like it is really

1724
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:26,740
a predecessor, I would say, to the Indiana Jones adventure

1725
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:28,860
where you're heading for the boulder and then where do you go?

1726
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,020
You go down under it into the darkness.

1727
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:35,260
Similarly, the drop on the Jurassic Park ride,

1728
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,740
Jurassic Park River adventure, whatever you want to call it.

1729
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,780
The threat is looming. How do you escape?

1730
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,900
You escape down below it. In this case,

1731
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:48,580
you are you you approach a burning bridge

1732
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,660
and you see it the whole length of it burning.

1733
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:55,100
Then you come around and you come around a turn and realize,

1734
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,460
oh, I'm going in there.

1735
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:58,620
I've seen that's on fire. Now I'm in it.

1736
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:04,500
You go in all the woods ablaze, then it all drops down on you

1737
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:08,060
right as you hit an invisible drop in the dark.

1738
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:12,820
This must have been so killer in 1972

1739
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:17,780
when Imagineering has not necessarily gotten to this point on on a lot of attractions.

1740
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:18,860
Yeah, it's interesting.

1741
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:22,300
I wonder like it feels like 72.

1742
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:23,940
It's like what else?

1743
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:28,820
Disney didn't have anything that would like a blow my mind that much in that way.

1744
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,220
Back then, I guess.

1745
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:32,660
Well, you've got pirates and you've got Haunted Mansion,

1746
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:35,580
but you don't have the thrills combined with it.

1747
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:39,100
Yeah, I mean, it's the drop of the water drop on pirates in the dark.

1748
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,140
Sure, sure. But the coordination.

1749
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,420
Yeah, this was more intricate.

1750
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:47,940
This feels like like an illusion that would belong on the Universal Studio tour.

1751
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,380
This is like the coordination of it.

1752
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:53,500
Looks like you're you're spinning in the, you know, infinite looping tunnel

1753
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,980
or it looks like or, you know, or the track is shaking.

1754
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,660
So you think earthquakes happening to you.

1755
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:01,340
This this is like it's really it feels very universal ahead of Universal.

1756
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:05,780
Yes. And I also thought that it's an interesting genre of ride,

1757
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:09,260
of like natural disaster ride, like, oh, right.

1758
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:12,460
Yeah, isn't also very universal, which is universal.

1759
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:15,620
But then like, yeah, with Twister or Backdraft, it's tied to a movie as well.

1760
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:20,900
But they are rides about awful stuff that happens in real life.

1761
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:25,140
Yeah. And in these cases that paid tribute to local legend and things

1762
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,140
that really happened.

1763
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:29,020
And this is all referencing like stuff that happened in the Marvel

1764
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:32,100
cave and the ball knobbers put people in the cave.

1765
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:37,780
And so you can understand why these be so beloved that, you know,

1766
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:41,100
because to get anything even remotely Disney-esque around there.

1767
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,220
And then it's about like the stuff you grow up learning about.

1768
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,620
It's it's it's cool.

1769
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,420
I really like this. That's right.

1770
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:53,660
What is the most like close to real life ride at Disneyland?

1771
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:58,420
Is there anything is like knots in this ride real that is closer to like knots?

1772
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:02,020
It's a mining. It's a it's logging industry rides.

1773
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:04,980
It's like but Disney's everything is pretty elevated.

1774
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,220
It's still fantastical.

1775
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,820
And I'm trying to think, is there a good exam?

1776
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:11,900
Big Thunder, I guess, but it's still like runaway railroad.

1777
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:15,740
Like that's still like most people don't experience that.

1778
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,220
That's kind of a fan.

1779
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:21,660
Not it's not fantastical, but it's it's a pretty crazy scenario.

1780
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:27,260
The canoes are canoes that are real canoes that you have to row

1781
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,900
the way real people row real canoes.

1782
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:32,700
Yeah. So it could be that you might say.

1783
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,780
Is it maybe mission space at Epcot?

1784
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:36,860
Like we're like, this is just this is how it is.

1785
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,540
You go to space. Yeah, it's pretty dry.

1786
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,740
You're in a real machine and you get real nauseous.

1787
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:45,780
Right. This is like this is that's even closer to real

1788
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:49,220
life than seeing a bunch of people being sad while they mine.

1789
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,380
Yeah. Yeah. Like that's that's as close as it gets.

1790
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:57,580
Well, the ultimate example might be the proto, the early DCA attraction,

1791
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,020
Bountiful Valley Farm. Oh, right.

1792
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:02,260
Where you just are on farming again.

1793
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:05,340
You know what? A ride that my son today would love.

1794
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,540
Yeah. Ride. It's a bit.

1795
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:08,660
Let me be clear. It's not a ride.

1796
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,900
It's tractors that you can briefly sit on. Right.

1797
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,820
But this is so up his alley, more so than a lot of the things

1798
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:15,940
you can actually do at Disneyland.

1799
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,060
Do you think if Michael Eisner appeared in front of us

1800
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,900
and we said Bountiful Valley Farm, would he know what we're talking about?

1801
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:25,180
Hmm. Yeah, I do, because he I think that was a passion project.

1802
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,900
He might not remember the name.

1803
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,940
He might just go like, yeah, the farm, you know, the California.

1804
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,340
Yeah. Yeah. He knows.

1805
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,500
That's his baby. You remember your baby's name.

1806
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,420
You remember Breck and you remember Bountiful Valley Farm.

1807
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,260
Right.

1808
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,340
Now, it gets a little confusing here because we get into things

1809
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,580
that two attractions do.

1810
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:47,460
Here's some history that I did not know is that Dollywood before it was Dollywood,

1811
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:50,580
which is a switch over that happened around like 86, I want to say.

1812
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:55,020
Before that, it was Silver Dollar City, Tennessee.

1813
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:58,900
It was in the same family tree of theme parks.

1814
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:03,740
And that is why they got a really similar attraction called Blazing Fury,

1815
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,780
nearly identical.

1816
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,980
And a lot of the same gags happen.

1817
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,940
And even though those parks aren't related anymore, they share this.

1818
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:14,300
They have joint custody over this type of ride.

1819
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:18,940
And so and a lot of the same beats occur, including

1820
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:21,540
you run into a train like Mr.

1821
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:24,980
Toad, like you're heading down a path and then you get

1822
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:29,860
smacked by a big bright light and honk and you're barreling into a train.

1823
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,260
And once again, then you do a little dip after that.

1824
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:36,540
I think I think you get you end up in a dynamite storage shack.

1825
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,860
And so another good thing is that that's a great thing

1826
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:41,540
always to happen in a fire-oriented ride.

1827
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:43,900
Dynamites got to be stored somewhere.

1828
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,700
Fireworks have to be stored somewhere.

1829
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,180
You can end up in those places.

1830
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:49,860
What else?

1831
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:52,140
I think it may be only the Dollywood one has

1832
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:55,660
is a woman who's trying to jump onto a trampoline,

1833
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:58,220
but the firefighter says, wait, because he's got a bad back.

1834
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:01,860
And the voices on this, by the way,

1835
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:07,620
my buddy, Andy Maxwell, has been on this and he was telling me about it.

1836
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:10,500
And he said his main memory was like, oh, those that is

1837
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:14,020
the voices on that ride is like, that's fair.

1838
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:16,140
There was a little boy.

1839
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:21,460
It is definitely this is a musty, very musty attractions.

1840
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,420
But I think that's got to add to that.

1841
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:27,860
You've got like Boomhauer voice on an old radio, basically.

1842
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:29,300
That's the audio system.

1843
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:31,900
You know what? If I can hear it, I'm upset.

1844
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,420
Yeah, you want to hear it like that.

1845
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:34,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1846
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:38,900
I don't want one actual word poking through because it opens it up to everybody.

1847
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,340
Then if you speak another language, it doesn't matter

1848
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:42,940
if you don't understand what they're saying.

1849
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:45,020
Yeah, yeah, I want it.

1850
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,060
Yeah, I guess.

1851
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:50,380
I feel like when I'm on the not rides, sometimes you can hear things clear.

1852
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:52,820
It's almost like some of the speakers have been replaced and some haven't.

1853
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:54,820
That's something I'm making up, probably.

1854
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:58,460
But like you do want to hear like you want to feel like

1855
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,820
you're hearing the ghost of the person or something.

1856
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:02,700
You want to hear some ghostly version.

1857
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:06,300
Sure. Hearing everything crystal clear would not be right.

1858
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:08,060
Yeah. For those rides.

1859
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:11,300
Yeah, because it adds to the it feels like traveling into the past.

1860
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:15,660
Right. And like, I don't know, there's a weird charm to it's like drive in speakers.

1861
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:20,060
You know, we're all right crackly, which I think they did a good job.

1862
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,700
I think those the new animatronics, which are this point,

1863
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,500
some of them are over 10 years old.

1864
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:29,420
Yeah. When they've put new reinstalled animatronics into the Natsukaliko

1865
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:32,180
attractions, they move, but they're still.

1866
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:37,140
Yeah. I don't want a bunch of Navi Shaman a song, you know, flailing around.

1867
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:42,140
I want I want I crave limited movement on old west attractions.

1868
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:43,700
Yes. No, you don't want.

1869
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,660
Yeah, I'm trying to think of a newer kind like Kylo or those

1870
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:49,220
Beauty and the Beast ones from Japan.

1871
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:51,460
No, thanks. Yeah. Yeah.

1872
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,100
I would like a blink.

1873
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:55,460
I would like, you know, let's think about that.

1874
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:58,540
What do you actually what do you need out of the robot

1875
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:02,300
when it comes to these old creaky like minor types?

1876
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:06,380
Well, I'll tell you, as far as fire in the hole is concerned,

1877
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:07,900
I don't need them to do anything.

1878
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,100
Yeah, they can they can not move whatsoever.

1879
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,660
They can be wax figures.

1880
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:15,700
But if they're going to move, I'd say like a light arm.

1881
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:19,820
Let's let's go like five degrees on the arm.

1882
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:24,340
Let's go. Let's let's like if the arm is pointed at five o'clock,

1883
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,980
let's get it to four. Right. No more. OK.

1884
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,660
I would say like a slight lean forward.

1885
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:30,820
That's what I want.

1886
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:33,260
Well, that's a little scary, too, because you think I might lean all the way.

1887
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,380
Yeah, but they're not going there.

1888
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:38,220
They're going to lean like, oh, wait, it's going to be an inch difference.

1889
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:40,060
You know, what else is this?

1890
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:42,140
OK, that's fine. That's great.

1891
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:44,860
I mean, because you know what?

1892
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:49,220
The one of our fundamental favorites, the adventure.

1893
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:52,060
Yeah, those cops, they don't move one bit.

1894
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:55,020
Yeah. Yeah, those are truly very static.

1895
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,780
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

1896
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:59,460
Well, what did we just find out from one of these universal accounts?

1897
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:00,500
I didn't know this.

1898
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,340
There's a there was a different E.T.

1899
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,340
on his head in the universal out here.

1900
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:10,060
Standy handstand, which you can see when Spielberg goes on the ride

1901
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:13,300
with a Bradley and 60 minutes. Right. Yeah.

1902
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,340
Did you know that that was different?

1903
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:17,580
I mean, standing on the head felt familiar to me.

1904
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:21,020
It definitely feels like in the, you know, in the world of artwork

1905
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:24,700
I've seen or promotional photos, but I've never really tracked

1906
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,300
the individual E.T.'s too much. Wow.

1907
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:29,940
I know this all these good information coming from these different accounts.

1908
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:32,820
Yeah. Yeah. There's you know what? Good work, everybody.

1909
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:36,580
Good, recent big crop of new universal information.

1910
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:39,580
You keep sending all these great like universal shows

1911
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:41,380
that are barely documented. Never heard of these.

1912
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:43,900
Yeah. There's a land before time live show.

1913
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:46,580
This is something I want to I want to figure out.

1914
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:47,780
There was something.

1915
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:51,500
Oh, this is also something I wanted to propose to you was

1916
01:26:51,860 --> 01:26:53,460
there was some summer show that was there

1917
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:56,220
attempted a phantasmic kind of thing called Spectra Blast.

1918
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:58,500
Yes, we just I sent that to you. You sent spectrum.

1919
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:03,220
OK, I found the audio of Spectra Blast, like what the show is comprised of.

1920
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,260
I'm pretty interested in Spectra Blast.

1921
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:08,220
We got to do Spectra Blast for sure.

1922
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:10,380
But they all I asked one of these accounts, I said,

1923
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,420
is there any more information on Womp Hoppers?

1924
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,980
And that's all they could give me was that's out there, basically.

1925
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:16,820
Wow. OK, all right.

1926
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,140
Geez. So really not well documented.

1927
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,780
You're the only person in this.

1928
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:23,820
No one gives a fuck about Womp Hoppers.

1929
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:25,500
Yeah. Yep.

1930
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:27,500
What about the future?

1931
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,100
What if there's what if there's what if they're bringing?

1932
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,180
What if there's Womps to be hopped in the future?

1933
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,580
Wow. Well, we deal with that.

1934
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:34,620
What if there's Womp Hoppers?

1935
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:36,820
What if Womp Hoppers is coming back?

1936
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,620
That's why all the restaurants are closing.

1937
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:42,460
Yeah, they're building the they're building a Womp Hoppers three times bigger.

1938
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:45,980
I would love a wizard's back wizard's wizard's back.

1939
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:49,380
Holy shit. They're not going to do anything fun, but we need it.

1940
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:52,820
If anyone from Universal is listening, you know what the city's been through.

1941
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,540
You know the morale right now.

1942
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:58,140
You know that we need a five room

1943
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,980
magic restaurant now more than ever.

1944
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:05,020
I am so I would cry if they announced either of those being opened again.

1945
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:07,220
It's very emotional. Yeah. Yeah.

1946
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,340
Like, oh, my God.

1947
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:11,460
And the and the heads of Comcast would also cry,

1948
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:14,780
knowing the profits that would be funneling out the door.

1949
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:18,100
What if I can I sneak my way to a meeting and propose

1950
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,740
that they just change tooths into Womp Hoppers?

1951
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,500
Because why not?

1952
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,860
Doesn't matter. No one goes to this restaurant anyway.

1953
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:26,140
That is so true.

1954
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:28,300
It's a yeah. Look, it's dying.

1955
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,900
And yeah, it is. Yes.

1956
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,060
They can't get it to work.

1957
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:32,500
Do you have to lose? Right.

1958
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,260
Just change the sign. Yeah.

1959
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:35,220
And it's still like a way.

1960
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:38,780
It's still like, oh, he's Womp Hoppers back and he has a robot sidekick.

1961
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:41,260
Yeah. Yeah. And then and then you just change all the like,

1962
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:44,380
you know, it's I'm always at Knott's Berry Farm and I see the word a say.

1963
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,860
Yeah. I was like, what's a say again?

1964
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,060
Well, in this case, it doesn't matter.

1965
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,500
You just call it a say salmon.

1966
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,900
It's all the same. It's the same shit.

1967
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:55,340
You ate a flounder, a flounder, a salmon Dean.

1968
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:00,100
Wow. This is the best old West themed salmon I've ever had.

1969
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,580
Yeah. Like caught by a bear.

1970
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:06,500
Why a bar reached in himself and pulled that out with his mouth.

1971
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,620
And we stole it from him.

1972
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:09,700
He didn't get to eat his dinner, but you get it.

1973
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,260
That's fine.

1974
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:13,300
Who cares? Let me change it.

1975
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,460
I'll draw a salmon from a crick.

1976
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:18,180
I'll run this restaurant.

1977
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,740
That would drop everything to run Womp Hoppers.

1978
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:22,580
Wizards and Womp Hoppers.

1979
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:25,020
I mean, there's no there's no way it's happening.

1980
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,940
They're not going to make it through the opportunity to dream.

1981
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:32,420
After a grim January, you deserve to be able to that's what I think.

1982
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:35,940
To fantasy, to live in the realm of fantasy where anything's possible.

1983
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,540
Did I do we get to anything?

1984
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,340
I mean, we got to miss anything here.

1985
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:42,900
There's plenty of stuff to dig in.

1986
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:45,140
But like, you know, we've hit some of the big stuff.

1987
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:47,180
Oh, well, I mean, the big thing to say, I've been talking.

1988
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:51,140
OK, so Blazing Fury is there in Dollywood and has been there since 78.

1989
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,980
But fire in the hole

1990
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:58,340
ran from 72 and went down in 2023.

1991
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,420
Silver Dollar City closed it.

1992
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:02,580
Fire in the hole. No more. Yeah.

1993
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:08,180
But replaced by a brand spanking new fire in the hole.

1994
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,140
Brand new for 2024.

1995
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:14,060
They respect their legacy, unlike Universal, that callously

1996
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:16,500
rips out Womp Hopper after Womp Hopper.

1997
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,020
They they just put in a new fire.

1998
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:21,620
This is like it's the heart of the park, clearly.

1999
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:26,380
This this story, this experience, this innovative type of ride

2000
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,620
and these creepy, creepy dummies.

2001
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:32,300
And I've watched the new one and they didn't go that much.

2002
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:35,860
I think they like enhanced it to the point where now it's like safe,

2003
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:38,980
but yeah, still creepy as hell.

2004
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:39,900
That's what we want.

2005
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:41,340
Thank you, Silver Dollar City.

2006
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:45,060
This this in this delve of research and doing this episode

2007
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:49,300
just served as an advertisement for myself to go to Silver Dollar City.

2008
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:50,100
I really want to.

2009
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:52,260
This is one of our sampler episodes.

2010
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:54,220
Yeah, I would consider it like a sample.

2011
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:58,300
You would get a Womp Hoppers, mozzarella sticks or or a planks

2012
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:01,300
mozzarella planks, as Jason would call them.

2013
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:02,540
Yes. You know what?

2014
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,060
Real quick, I forgot I wanted to mention this.

2015
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:05,460
There's another Santa's Village called.

2016
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,980
There's a ride called Hot Shots Fire Brigade at Santa's Village.

2017
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:09,820
They got more fires.

2018
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:12,540
And it's it's you go in a circle on these fire engines

2019
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:17,260
and then they raise up and down and then you shoot into these little holes.

2020
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:19,580
And the kids are just standing like on crane buckets.

2021
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:20,620
Yes, it's really interesting.

2022
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:22,420
It's like you're in like a whatever.

2023
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:25,140
You're fixing the electrical wires or something that's interesting.

2024
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,260
Wow. It's an interesting.

2025
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:27,860
I've never seen like a ride like that.

2026
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:30,340
Wow. But we'll we'll, you know, we'll get to that.

2027
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:33,060
You're fixing downed power poles. Right.

2028
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:34,340
Which is amazing.

2029
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:36,140
Yeah, which is another

2030
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:38,180
that's another sort of slice of life ride.

2031
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:39,820
You know, well, this is what when you're.

2032
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:42,820
Yeah, you're you're asking what are like rides about real stuff

2033
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,140
and real heroes because we needn't go,

2034
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:52,140
you know, experience the tales of Finn and Ray to hear stories of heroes.

2035
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,460
Of course, real life heroes all around us.

2036
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:58,340
And they say of Los Angeles and and we appreciate it.

2037
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:02,900
And these are a good excuse to talk about this silly stuff.

2038
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,220
And boy, does it plant a flag.

2039
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,420
Oh, I want to get to these places.

2040
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:06,060
Wait, you know what?

2041
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:08,700
Let me do a little taste of just really quick.

2042
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:09,940
The all right.

2043
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:13,020
You know, I have to admit, they kind of you might be OK with this.

2044
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:14,780
There is a fire in the whole theme song.

2045
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:19,940
And they did a new one, which is kind of like more current country tone.

2046
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:21,060
And that's less up my alley.

2047
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,300
But I do I do prefer the original.

2048
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:24,140
It's the same song.

2049
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:26,060
They just did it with kind of more current production.

2050
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,780
But here's the old fire in the whole song.

2051
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:54,020
Oh, that was something I realized that with this Chipper song,

2052
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,500
everybody's heart is filled with fear.

2053
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:00,340
That's what I was going in my head last week.

2054
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:06,660
But you tried to make it a little hoedown for yourself to try to keep morale high.

2055
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:13,420
Yes. Well, your belongings in the car going for a drive real far.

2056
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:20,340
That's all we can do is to try to turn our fears into a into a fiddle jam.

2057
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:23,820
Yeah. But anyways, this is great.

2058
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:26,340
Would would love to go.

2059
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:29,780

2069
