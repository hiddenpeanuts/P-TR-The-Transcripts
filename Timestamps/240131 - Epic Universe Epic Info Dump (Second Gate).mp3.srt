1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,280
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,240
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second portal?

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,580
I'm Scott Gertner, there's Jason Sheridan.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,160
Hi.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,620
Oh man, Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,680
Hello, yeah, we're in the new portal.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,060
We're all about portals.

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,100
It's portals now, apparently.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,560
We're all doing portals.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,900
Simply everyone is doing portals.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,700
The other thing, not to just be so crazy out of order here,

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,680
circles, it's portals and circles,

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,300
and the portals are circular,

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,360
but have you noticed there's so many circles in this park?

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,380
Like if you look at it from overhead.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,040
They haven't said circles though,

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,980
you're just saying there's so many circles.

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,180
Just look at this video, look out for it.

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,040
You'll see so many circles, like interweaving circles.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,900
I was gonna say concentric circles,

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,160
but literally that is not true,

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,320
because concentric circles,

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,780
they have the same middle point.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,980
So interweaving circles, that's what the carousel is like.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,080
Suns, moons.

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,860
Yes, and it's celestial, it has planets around.

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,520
Exactly, they're very consistent with the planet.

28
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,900
Spheres.

29
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,300
Spheres, you might say, they don't say,

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,020
because there's already a big sphere in town.

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,200
But here, let's be very clear

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,180
about what we're talking about.

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,440
Thank you, audience, for being patient with us.

34
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,380
We thought let's just push it a day

35
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,340
so we can talk about what everybody was talking about

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,380
a few days ago now.

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,920
We told you we'd talk about something epic,

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,300
and here it is, the epic log flume,

39
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,320
epic voyage to moon haven at Genting Skyworlds Malaysia.

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,920
Let's talk about it.

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,840
We all saw the ride through Nimgaloo Animatronic,

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,400
and all of them are there,

43
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,060
the knucklehead worm guys or whatever.

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,940
I'm so sorry, I prepared wrong.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,120
I watched all the epic movies.

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,400
Oh, shit.

47
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Watched the epic movie timeline.

48
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,140
Oh, no, and I watched the YouTube channel Epic Meal Time.

49
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,480
Oh, no, good, no, that's right.

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,420
Oh, that's right, too.

51
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,780
I would have accepted it was gonna be

52
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,080
a half and half episode.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,560
I hope we were gonna switch over to that.

54
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,380
Your shirt is disgusting.

55
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,360
It's covered in food,

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,580
because you said you were doing a mukbang right before this.

57
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,180
Yeah, I was doing a mukbang right before this.

58
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,880
That is what I said.

59
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,320
So yeah, I'm sorry I'm filthy, dirty with food.

60
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,780
It doesn't matter for your ears, I guess.

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,260
That doesn't matter, yeah.

62
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,120
It's just gonna hurt us looking at you.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,020
we are downloading the big universal epic universe,

64
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,900
the epic info dump that they dropped on us.

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,760
By surprise, this is where we had to just react fast.

66
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,540
We had a block of episodes we were recording.

67
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,140
We didn't know in the more there was gonna be this,

68
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,460
like this majestic video, this lengthy,

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,760
very dynamic, moving, touching, tear inducing piece,

70
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,820
showing us so much more about Universal's third,

71
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,060
I say third park epic universe coming soon to Orlando.

72
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,140
Look, we are treated pretty well by Universal,

73
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,260
so I'm not gonna be upset or anything,

74
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,240
but we didn't get a heads up from Universal or anything,

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,780
and we didn't get any sort of special big box ahead

76
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,620
like some other people in the theme park space did.

77
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,300
I don't know if you know what I'm talking about.

78
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,820
Yeah, well here's what happened.

79
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,620
I got a text from Bethy Squires, hey Bethy,

80
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,740
and she said, did you guys get the epic universe mailer?

81
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,760
And I'm like, why yes, we did get an email with,

82
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,980
I don't know what I said to her,

83
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,240
but mentally I'm like, yeah, we got an email

84
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,220
with a bunch of concept art and info and restaurant names.

85
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,000
So yeah, we sure did, I said, and then she said,

86
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,780
yeah, I'm worried about this thing in an earthquake.

87
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,560
And then I had to analyze what that meant.

88
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,500
Wait a minute.

89
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,720
You got something that's so massive

90
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,460
that it might hurt you in an earthquake?

91
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,340
She got the miniature Kronos?

92
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,220
She got, and yes, the miniature Kronos,

93
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,920
but there's nothing miniature about it.

94
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,640
This is a gigantic, this is a chest.

95
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,160
So I had to figure out via context clues,

96
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,960
oh no, we did not get the mailer.

97
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,380
How did we get on the Kronos thing?

98
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,320
I don't know, I'm not sure.

99
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,300
Jason texted me late last night

100
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,640
that we didn't get a Kronos,

101
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,860
which I had already seen, was already upset about.

102
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,160
I'd already was stewing about it

103
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,720
and I expected us just to talk about it today.

104
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,680
But yeah, people got a giant,

105
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,820
I wanna say it's like two feet tall box,

106
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,520
like a wooden box with one of the like,

107
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,460
like the main entrance way.

108
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,820
The main portal to Epic Universe.

109
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,620
But only the medallion for Celestial Park,

110
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,700
the landscaped area, the center of the park.

111
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,800
So this would be like,

112
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,920
as if you got like before Islands of Adventure,

113
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,600
you got the like entrance way to Islands of Adventure.

114
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,500
Can you imagine what that would have been like

115
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,580
if you have like a miniature Islands of Adventure entrance?

116
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,660
As I'm wearing a shirt of early Islands of Adventure

117
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,120
promotional art, yes.

118
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,540
I could imagine.

119
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,960
We were denied.

120
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,520
Bethy is the first person I've heard in California get one.

121
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,540
Jason was she the only in the state?

122
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,400
Jason was thinking it was a local thing.

123
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,080
Cause I was seeing all the Orlando vloggers getting it

124
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,900
and I'm like, well, maybe it was a local drop off.

125
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,260
Mr.

126
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,220
Morrow got it, I haven't texted him about it,

127
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,880
but I do wanna see where everyone's setting it up.

128
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,780
Times like this, you just have to be thankful

129
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,900
that we know so many Kronos getters.

130
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,640
Yeah, that's true.

131
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,000
I mean, what is that,

132
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,620
we live among high society,

133
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,860
even if we are not them ourselves.

134
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,380
Did anyone put it up on eBay yet?

135
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,120
Let me look.

136
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,920
Yeah, I'll set up that alert.

137
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,760
Cause I do want it, I have a big toy wall

138
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,540
and I really could use a Kronos.

139
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,020
I also, yeah, absolutely.

140
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,560
Oh yeah, more than anyone, you need it.

141
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,100
I also, then we walked into Forever Dog Studios to record

142
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,120
and the person behind the desk was like,

143
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,420
oh, you guys got something.

144
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,300
And I was like, here it is.

145
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,320
And instead it was something else.

146
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,640
It was a care package from Canada.

147
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,060
Forgive me, listener who dropped this off.

148
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,920
Whatever it is, it's nice.

149
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,700
Don't know if, I haven't gone through it yet.

150
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,440
But it's a bunch of like Canadian items

151
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,680
I'm gonna have to show you guys after this.

152
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:38,960
Oh wow.

153
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,920
I'm sorry, I can't do the full download and thank you.

154
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,980
I'm still processing this,

155
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,340
but it has a bunch of maps for that Edmonton mall.

156
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,980
Oh yeah.

157
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,040
Which I believe is mentioned on tomorrow's episode.

158
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,740
A little preview.

159
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,560
So anyway, we got a bunch of cool stuff from Canada.

160
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,400
So things are going our way.

161
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,700
Thank you for that.

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,280
Thank you Canada.

163
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,700
But I did have to go, I was like,

164
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,720
Kronos, is it Kronos?

165
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,140
Oh, it's not Kronos.

166
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,940
It is not Kronos.

167
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,720
I said it to Jason, I was like,

168
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,520
I guess it's because we're not,

169
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,440
we've done video in the past,

170
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,700
but we're not known primarily for video.

171
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,840
So they probably thought it was a waste.

172
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,580
But still, I don't think we would be on a list.

173
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,260
I don't think any calculation was done.

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,100
I don't think anyone said,

175
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,920
should we send it to podcast the ride?

176
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,980
Those audio goons, that would only be a waste.

177
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,180
Yeah, maybe that didn't happen.

178
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,820
If we weren't even on a list, a long list,

179
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,940
and then we were edited, it was edited down,

180
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,160
I would be a little upset.

181
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,500
So you like the idea that we were cut.

182
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,680
Okay, would I like the idea that we were cut

183
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,480
more than just ignored?

184
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,420
Yeah, I guess so.

185
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,480
I guess I would, yes.

186
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,780
Better to have loved and lost.

187
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,360
Yeah.

188
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,620
But we should have three big boxes

189
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,940
with three Kronos's here, right?

190
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,800
We all get it, we aren't sharing.

191
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,780
I hate to be a baby.

192
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,200
Here's the thing, I'll pay for it,

193
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,340
unless it's like a grand.

194
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,620
Might be, this is so big.

195
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,680
I'm starting to exactly clear on what's in it.

196
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,100
I mean, I assume it's gotta be some amount of work.

197
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
Okay, if anyone, okay, here's,

198
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,560
I'll throw two offers out right now.

199
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,300
Someone, if you got one from Universal,

200
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,160
make me an offer, and we'll see if I'll pay it.

201
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,540
Number two, if anybody works for Universal,

202
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,840
I'll also pay it.

203
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,580
This is like Chuck E.

204
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,500
Cheese when you go and ask

205
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,040
if you can just buy one of the prizes.

206
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,520
Yes.

207
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,160
And not get it with your tickets.

208
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,620
So if somebody wants the back channel at Universal to me

209
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,440
and offer me an amount of money, I'm listening.

210
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,600
My DMs are open.

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,800
Our DMs are open.

212
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,040
This is your chance to get to shake down

213
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,460
Mike Carlson for cash.

214
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,680
You can try shake me down.

215
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,940
I might be shakin' downable.

216
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,100
It's possible.

217
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,640
Because I don't know, will they sell this?

218
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,480
Is this part of the gift shop coming soon?

219
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,120
Like will that be a thing you can buy?

220
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,080
I don't think so.

221
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,040
I feel like if it is, it's gonna be a tiny version of it.

222
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,280
It's not gonna be.

223
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,980
How many people are gonna want a big weighty?

224
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,320
Would they sell all of the different portals?

225
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,680
The Kronos?

226
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,880
I mean, I hope so.

227
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,980
They're already iconic to me.

228
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,460
I agree.

229
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm excited.

230
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,440
I think the portals are one of the big excitement points

231
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,480
of this.

232
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,240
If you can't picture what we're talking about also,

233
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,760
I mean, it's like a giant lighthouse,

234
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,180
but kind of more mystical.

235
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,480
It's like a, you know, like a tower, a temple tower.

236
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,780
There's a big circle where you walk in

237
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,080
and then on the top, there's different like kind of artifacts

238
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,960
or things that suggest the land you're going into.

239
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,660
That's the different portals for the different pieces

240
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,840
of the different parks or the different lands,

241
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,300
I should say.

242
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,860
I mean, that's one of the big pieces of info here

243
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,560
about this park.

244
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,020
I think that, you know,

245
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,100
there's a lot that we've known about it.

246
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,940
I think I even sent some disappointment out there.

247
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,020
Like, what did this tell us?

248
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,780
We didn't already know.

249
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,480
We knew there was gonna be Harry Potter.

250
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,880
We knew there was gonna be How to Train Your Dragon.

251
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,420
Well, I think a lot of specifics did come out

252
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,420
and obviously there's been like flyovers of it,

253
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,440
the bio reconstruct, the drone footage.

254
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,180
So there's a lot vaguely that we knew,

255
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,040
but I don't think we knew the root of it, the heart of it

256
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,800
and what ties it all together.

257
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,400
Like the premise of the park,

258
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,500
I don't think was clear until this, at least not to me.

259
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,680
There were pieces, but yes,

260
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,420
this really like gave it to you, I feel.

261
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,480
And the connective tissue that is the,

262
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,040
not just, you couldn't even just call it the main street

263
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,060
because it's kind of this like bigger land

264
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,800
that weaves through the entire property.

265
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,880
That being the instantly iconic Celestial Park.

266
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,200
Celestial Park.

267
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,140
It's really the big thing to talk about.

268
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,580
I think my number two land I'm most excited about

269
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
because I think they say,

270
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,740
do they say in that video

271
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,360
or is it some other social media posts

272
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,220
where it like, it puts the park back in theme park?

273
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,820
It puts the park.

274
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,380
It's in the video.

275
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,200
It's in the video.

276
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,360
And so to me, it feels like going all the way back

277
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,420
to the beginning of the show when we were,

278
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,040
I was coincidentally finishing Devil in the White City

279
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,520
as we were starting the park.

280
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,580
And that was so much about the world's Columbia Exposition

281
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,260
in Chicago in the late 1800s.

282
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,120
And they followed the Frederick Lowe Olmsted,

283
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,700
the father of modern landscape architecture

284
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,880
and the center of this park is so much greenery

285
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,380
and waterways like it reminds me of that.

286
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,060
And it's a good reminder of like,

287
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,440
yeah, some of the design stuff

288
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,740
for these public private like entertainment places,

289
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,400
it doesn't really change.

290
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,360
The greenery and water are always.

291
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,840
Don't reinvent the wheel you're saying.

292
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,320
Yeah, don't reinvent the wheel.

293
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,900
Hopefully it's good for people's like, you know, mood

294
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,800
because these rides will likely be very popular.

295
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,980
So you're saying Celestial Park is gonna be a calming park,

296
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,680
a place for dad who might be upset with the long lines

297
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,780
and then the disorienting VR on the Mario Kart ride

298
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,980
to come and chill out in a pleasant space.

299
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,840
Kids screaming cause they got menaced

300
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,220
by Victoria Frankenstein.

301
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,780
Right, she gave him the business.

302
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,060
Yeah, no, I think you're right.

303
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,900
I think that that.

304
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,300
There's beautification going on.

305
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,420
Yeah, I think that this, especially at night,

306
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,560
I feel like this thing is gonna be really cool at night.

307
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,180
Oh yeah.

308
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,960
Nice little hang.

309
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,120
That restaurant seems nice.

310
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,060
Yeah, it looks out onto it.

311
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,700
All of them look pretty good.

312
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,820
All the restaurants from what they've shown

313
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
look pretty good.

314
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,340
I mean, really like what, I mean, it's very,

315
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,360
it's Epcotty you might say,

316
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,300
but maybe even more kind of like that you get to,

317
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,420
really the big difference is a lot of,

318
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,780
and both of the existing Orlando Universal Parks

319
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,480
have big lagoons.

320
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,680
And this has some of that,

321
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,140
but maybe there's more space that you can actually go into

322
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,120
and chill out in.

323
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,500
That's kind of the difference, you might say.

324
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,620
It seems like a much bigger scale of like

325
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,720
the new Epcot future world,

326
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,800
like sort of green spaces and public seating.

327
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,280
Yeah.

328
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,040
So are you saying that maybe Epcot's new

329
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,400
world celebration space with its benches

330
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,140
where you can plug in USBs might struggle to compete

331
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,640
when this gigantic new beautiful theme park opens?

332
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,700
Oh, they got double the amount of trees and USBs.

333
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,180
They might have USB-C ports by that point.

334
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,580
They didn't even say what type of ports they had.

335
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,180
Yeah.

336
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,100
It was all about portals and not about ports.

337
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Yeah.

338
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,920
Yeah.

339
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,440
Does port of entry have ports?

340
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,040
Does port of entry have ports?

341
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,920
That's a good question.

342
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,740
Are there any ports?

343
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,060
That's a good question.

344
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,240
There might be charging lockers.

345
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,720
We really should have figured that out

346
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,800
when we did the episode.

347
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,240
That would maybe have changed my opinions early on.

348
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,160
Mm-hmm.

349
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,720
That would have put you in a better mood

350
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,480
for you to sell on the whole thing.

351
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,200
That any type of phone or electronic device

352
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,980
could be charged efficiently there.

353
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,580
Do you use those Target freebie charging lockers?

354
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,840
I have, but that's a big pain in the ass.

355
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,440
It is, because I put my list on my phone and Target app.

356
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,140
I have coupons.

357
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,040
I think they pulled those things,

358
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,480
at least from the Burbank Target.

359
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,920
There used to be, you don't know what Jason's talking about,

360
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,100
there would be these little lockers.

361
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,460
And let's keep the focus on the Burbank Target

362
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,120
as much as we can also.

363
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,800
Just a three square mile, right?

364
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,160
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,680
They're also having to restock their NECA toys in months,

366
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,360
and I don't know what's going on with that.

367
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,820
Yeah, they took those lockers.

368
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,120
But yeah, you could put your phone in there,

369
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,300
you would charge it, and it would lock up with a code,

370
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,880
much like Harry Potter lockers or something.

371
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,400
And I don't know, I'm never in Target that long.

372
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,540
Only if you need.

373
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:56,700
Sure.

374
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,140
My phone was dead, I would do it,

375
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,320
but I have a charger in my car.

376
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,120
How often would you do that?

377
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,300
No, never.

378
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:04,960
Oh, okay.

379
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah, no.

380
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,420
This whole conversation has been about something

381
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,500
you don't do and don't like.

382
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:09,980
He brought it up.

383
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,720
That's what we've been talking about.

384
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,380
He brought it up.

385
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,100
I was wondering,

386
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,220
because I never see anyone using it.

387
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,740
No, I hate it.

388
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,920
Yeah, me too, okay.

389
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,880
That's why it was taken away.

390
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,920
Nobody cares about it.

391
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,760
We have a new theme park to talk about.

392
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,480
We're talking about lockers that we don't like.

393
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,520
Well, and the Circle app.

394
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,500
And this Target, well, Target Circle app,

395
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,320
I could speak about.

396
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,720
Oh boy.

397
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,220
There's no way we have other circles to talk about.

398
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,400
That's not what we're here,

399
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,100
those aren't the circles for today.

400
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,360
That said, I'm lost.

401
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,500
I don't remember what we were talking about before.

402
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,040
We were talking about the ports.

403
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,600
We got caught on ports.

404
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,240
as I just did a post that was like,

405
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,780
hey, episode's gonna be delayed today,

406
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,860
but what do you think?

407
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Questions, thoughts, concern?

408
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,740
I sense some general feeling, Jason, of like,

409
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,060
this isn't what the listener said exactly,

410
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,900
but everybody thought of your affection for port of entry.

411
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,720
And I think there was maybe a feeling of,

412
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,340
do you feel threatened or insulted by this new space

413
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,960
trying to take the crown of best universal entry area

414
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,940
from port of entry?

415
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,040
I think more what I was focused on was like,

416
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,300
wow, the last two new theme parks I got to experience

417
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,040
when I was a child were Animal Kingdom

418
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,320
and Islands of Adventure and later on, California Adventure.

419
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
And that made me go like,

420
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,560
yeah, no one has opened a new theme park in Orlando

421
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,400
since 1999.

422
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,700
Well, we're taking the recent Peppa Pig Park

423
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,280
out of the running.

424
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,460
And I suppose Volcano Bay, the water theme park.

425
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,940
Well, it's third gate, yeah, of course.

426
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,420
So yeah, look, this is obviously going to be the star.

427
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,240
It's part port of entry, part city walk.

428
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,900
It is a classier city.

429
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,780
I hate to insult the beloved city walk.

430
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,120
Well, I think by invoking the word classy,

431
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,500
you've clearly indicated this is not part city walk at all.

432
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,920
Well, but there's a fountain

433
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,400
and there is retail space and dining.

434
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,060
Yeah, but it's not the same.

435
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,860
I mean, I guess it's got a couple rides.

436
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,040
There was the promise or the possibility

437
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,340
of like truly another city walk.

438
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,740
And this is not that, let's be clear.

439
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,980
Celestial Park is its own beast.

440
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,600
Because I don't think it's a city walk

441
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,180
unless it's outside the gate.

442
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,300
I guess that's true.

443
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,420
You have to pay to get into Celestial Park.

444
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,120
For a while there were some rumors of like,

445
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,220
oh, it's going to be free.

446
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:38,900
Yes.

447
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,820
And I guess they really haven't said that for sure.

448
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,960
They don't say anything about that in the videos,

449
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,900
but I doubt that's going to happen.

450
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,980
Too confusing, I would think, to like have to be scanned.

451
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,440
Now those portals are terrible.

452
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,760
Like there's a big line to get into all of those.

453
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,540
Forgive me.

454
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,340
There's an Alicia Stella podcast

455
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,620
where they were maybe speculating

456
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,720
that like after a certain amount of like time at night,

457
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,320
maybe it would be free to get into just Celestial Park,

458
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,240
but I don't know.

459
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,660
There are, yes.

460
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,280
There's a couple.

461
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,380
So it does seem like that would be nuts if it was free.

462
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,200
It's a tad complicated.

463
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,520
That's, yeah, that's a good point.

464
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,460
It's not just vibes.

465
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,560
There are attractions.

466
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,340
There is the dancing fountains.

467
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,440
We're mentioned, don't worry folks.

468
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,300
There are dancing fountains still

469
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,080
in this new innovative zone.

470
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,640
And kind of listed it as a ride.

471
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,000
They refer to it as astronomical.

472
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:33,860
Yeah.

473
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,060
So when you see astronomical, that equals dancing fountains.

474
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,300
And they said like three attractions, I think,

475
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,340
and they said that.

476
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,000
Fountains are wild.

477
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,920
So the fountains are included.

478
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,200
Well, that's wet play,

479
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,420
and presumably the others are dry play.

480
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,360
They did use the phrase wet play in one of these videos.

481
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
It is a wet play area.

482
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,000
Is that the only wet play that's been announced for Epic?

483
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,060
You know, I don't know that there's any other water rides

484
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,580
over there.

485
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,320
Sound off in the comments, listeners.

486
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,600
What's your favorite wet play area?

487
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,100
And don't forget dry play.

488
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,300
Well, that opens it up.

489
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,520
Yeah, so this is, I guess, right now the only wet play,

490
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,180
because the rumor is there will be a creature

491
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,800
from the Black Lagoon.

492
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:14,780
Indoor boat ride.

493
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,900
Like a boat ride coming eventually,

494
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,220
or it's on the Blue Sky phase.

495
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,760
Well, that sounds like wet, but not wet play.

496
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,360
I guess you're, well, it depends if you're playing,

497
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,580
if they encourage you to do a little splash in the water.

498
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,260
Can't imagine.

499
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:26,980
All right, everyone.

500
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,640
Splish him.

501
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,480
Splash him.

502
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,920
Only you can stop the creature.

503
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,240
Reach out of the boat.

504
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,500
Not too far, though.

505
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,980
Lost another kid.

506
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,580
Yeah, so we'll see.

507
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,140
Maybe that's an element they could add.

508
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,100
If it hasn't been, they're not building it yet,

509
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,000
so it's possible.

510
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,040
Constellation Carousel.

511
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,000
Now, this is something,

512
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,840
I watched this with my wife Erin last night,

513
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,280
and she, after all, after the buildup,

514
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,280
you basically, in this video that they released,

515
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,180
you get the full history of the resort and the company.

516
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,180
We reached out to the fans and what do they want,

517
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,040
and they want storytelling, and they want,

518
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,340
and then, once they got into what is it,

519
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,720
she was kind of like, oh, a carousel?

520
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,480
After all that, a carousel?

521
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,140
And I did go back and I said, well, I hear you on that.

522
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,720
However, I think that Constellation Carousel

523
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,600
is no ordinary carousel.

524
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,580
You can tell, I think, just from the art,

525
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,520
and then they indicate in the description of it,

526
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,340
I mean, this seems akin to some weird track list.

527
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,640
Like it's somewhere, it's like the Mater,

528
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,200
or maybe more like the,

529
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,580
one of the Luigi's reliquing roadsters.

530
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,980
Luigi's, yeah, roadster, reliquing roadsters.

531
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,240
Or like somewhere in the Aquatopia realm,

532
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,440
because it has this weird future, heavenly vibe

533
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,240
that everything has, but I think that not only

534
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,920
do these cars go round and round, up and down,

535
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,440
but I think they go on different tracks.

536
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,740
They do, yeah.

537
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,760
Maybe it's trackless,

538
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,600
and then they rotate, and this seems like

539
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,580
a real reinvention of the carousel, I hope.

540
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,140
And there's colors in the ceiling,

541
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,740
or there's some sort of thing happening, I believe,

542
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,300
in the ceiling as well.

543
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,840
This is the beautiful,

544
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,880
kind of like, yeah, like the skylight thing.

545
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,760
Lot of color lighting.

546
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,420
One of, what you bring up, there's a,

547
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,100
I don't have the exact dialogue,

548
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,040
or the exact thing that's said in the video,

549
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,600
but it's like, we asked our guests,

550
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,400
what do they want from Universal?

551
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,500
And they said just more of the same like,

552
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,160
magic that you offer us.

553
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,920
And you're like, that didn't happen.

554
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,740
Like they didn't.

555
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,240
What, the focus group?

556
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,900
Yeah, they asked people what they wanted,

557
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,040
they'd be like, I want more Harry Potter, please.

558
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,620
They would say, everyone's not like,

559
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,680
ah, do you know the little pixie dust

560
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,280
that you leave on my nose every time I,

561
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,000
I want more of that whimsy, and more of that.

562
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,420
No one's saying that.

563
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,080
They're going like, I like Spider-Man.

564
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,160
Could we have more of Spider-Man?

565
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,500
People give specifics.

566
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,380
They're not saying.

567
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,860
The special magic and storytelling that I get

568
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,160
from Fast and Furious Supercharge.

569
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,720
Right.

570
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,020
Somebody's going like, I want more Dom, please.

571
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,480
I want to see Dom.

572
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,400
I want to meet Dom.

573
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,220
Like people are probably giving some specifics

574
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,300
and not just saying like, well, giving you like,

575
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,740
ah, the little, the unicorns,

576
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,020
the magical unicorn rides that are so special.

577
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
By the way, is Fast and Furious done?

578
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,060
In Orlando?

579
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,580
No, no, the movies.

580
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,120
Is Fast, that's the last one?

581
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,900
There's 11?

582
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,940
No, are you kidding me?

583
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,260
No, I lost track.

584
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:19,880
I forgot.

585
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,700
God, I never watched nine, so I haven't watched 10.

586
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,120
There's no, that's not gonna end.

587
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,540
Nothing is going to end.

588
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,840
If something is popular, it will not end anymore.

589
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,320
Oh, good.

590
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,540
So it's like comic books just act two forever.

591
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,920
The office ended, and I pray every day

592
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,900
that we finally get the reunion news we've been waiting for.

593
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,120
It's been like, they're doing it.

594
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,060
Is it official?

595
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,540
Well, Greg Daniels has assembled,

596
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,280
he's assembled a room to come up with ideas

597
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,620
for the new office.

598
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Because it wouldn't actually be the old cast.

599
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,020
It might.

600
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,840
Or some, or I don't know.

601
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,900
It would probably be some.

602
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,440
Yeah, yeah.

603
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,000
Might be some.

604
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,220
How will they get them?

605
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,260
They're all so busy with projects.

606
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,660
On the concert, they're busy.

607
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,300
Some characters probably still, you know,

608
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,020
got telecommuting contracts.

609
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,100
There is probably mere meters from us right now.

610
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,200
There's a room that's being convened to under,

611
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,560
to try to figure out what the next.

612
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,200
To right this wrong of what?

613
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,560
Like seven years with no office.

614
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,840
So there will be more of.

615
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,620
Nothing will end anymore.

616
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,380
Nothing ends.

617
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,720
It's all eternal now.

618
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,020
That's right.

619
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,000
Let me, so what you were saying about kind of

620
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,300
the tone of the video.

621
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,700
We got some really good questions and comments,

622
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,620
and I'll try to pepper them in through the episode.

623
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,620
Maybe do a bunch at the end.

624
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,380
This is from Chad H.

625
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,720
And I'm calling you Chad H.

626
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,380
Because I'm gonna butcher your last name.

627
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,200
Let me, let us know how you pronounce your name.

628
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,860
Because I think we have to say it.

629
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,940
Because I think you won a poll recently, Chad.

630
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,340
Yeah.

631
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,860
But anyway, what's your favorite bit

632
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,340
of over the top language from the video?

633
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,640
I got so happy when they said,

634
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,860
the overarching emotion that Epic inspires

635
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,380
is what it's like to have your wishes ultimately fulfilled.

636
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,560
Absolutely my answer.

637
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,020
And Jason and I re-listened to the video

638
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,980
on the way over here.

639
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,040
And I also pointed out how insane that is.

640
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,560
I got in my car and I, or I got in Mike's car.

641
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,880
He picked me up and I was like,

642
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,020
is he listening to like a motivational speaking book?

643
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,980
Why did, what is this?

644
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,560
Unlock your potential.

645
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,800
And then yeah, they start talking about the ministry of magic.

646
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,980
And I was like, okay, now I know what this is.

647
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,340
Your wish is fulfilled.

648
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:24,800
Ultimately.

649
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
Well, there's something later.

650
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,880
This is like in death.

651
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,800
This is like when you die happy.

652
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,900
There is something later in the video

653
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,140
about the thrill of being alive or something.

654
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,060
Yes, that's my answer, Chad, is how they close it.

655
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,040
Which is, yes, that you get, it's basically,

656
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,160
that ultimately this park is where you get to experience

657
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,920
the full thrill of being alive.

658
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,660
Which is ironic, cause the universal monsters,

659
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,920
so many are undead.

660
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,760
There's so many thrills when you're not alive.

661
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,640
I mean, this is crazy.

662
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,380
As Chad says, they're finally, they're getting Disney-esque.

663
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,120
And I feel that throughout this video piece

664
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,860
and look it up at listeners if you haven't seen it.

665
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,860
I mean, Epic Universe, I forget the name,

666
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,100
but you know, Epic Universe reveal or whatever.

667
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,560
You'll find it from the last couple of days.

668
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,360
But not only tone and that insane,

669
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,980
and that it's stuff about wishes.

670
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,740
Like they're going for Disney territory.

671
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,020
And not only that, but we're getting into this zone,

672
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,440
and I'm glad they are, they deserve to be,

673
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,840
where the universe has been at it so long

674
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,400
and they just improve and improve.

675
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,820
And I think, and they're going for heart and nostalgia.

676
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,860
And they're showing you, and I felt it,

677
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,900
cause this is my, I wasn't around in the 50s,

678
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,380
my nostalgia is Universal Studios Florida

679
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,740
with that logo and that fountain as teased

680
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,640
in Nickelodeon shows and Spielberg cutting the ribbon.

681
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,560
And so that old footage was giving me a lot of

682
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,240
like nostalgia feels.

683
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,840
And it just, I'm like, this is, they are not letting,

684
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,080
they're trying to conquer Disney on like

685
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,680
the one thing Disney has, which is nostalgia.

686
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,580
And you grew up with this and your parents grew up with it.

687
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,280
And look, it's Walt in the map.

688
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
Is there's Walt in the map?

689
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,240
There's Walt, do you know that before they built it

690
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,000
that Walt was like walking along

691
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,740
and counting the steps himself.

692
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,540
And Universal's like, fuck that.

693
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,620
We don't need Walt's to give people nostalgia feelings,

694
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,280
especially because our quality is so much higher

695
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,400
than what they've been doing lately.

696
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,040
They also have, this was in the Vlasa Coaster special too.

697
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,460
There is some sort of drone footage over the lagoon

698
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,780
at Island of Adventure that makes it look so awesome.

699
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,900
Like I was like, holy shit.

700
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,800
I've never seen that angle of Island of Adventure.

701
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,200
It's like fast drone footage.

702
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,080
And I was like, man, that got me both times I saw it.

703
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,420
Hearing that from you who adores Island of Adventure anyway,

704
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,700
that felt like a moment of like, we're just one morning,

705
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,680
you've been married for 30 years

706
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
and you just, you to your wife out of nowhere.

707
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,000
Just like, you know what?

708
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,600
You're really beautiful.

709
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,120
I'm just in the kitchen.

710
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,900
Yeah, I know, but you are.

711
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,860
And don't forget it.

712
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,800
It just hit you on.

713
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,820
Yeah, yeah, it just hit you in a way.

714
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,400
Just a little moment of love.

715
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,220
It's you.

716
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,900
I mean, I do try to also do that to my partner.

717
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,800
I do try to do that for normal things in addition to,

718
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,040
oh, I think they launched a drone by Mythos.

719
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,380
What a unique angle to capture Island of Adventure.

720
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,560
Island of Adventure is more of your mistress, I would think.

721
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,980
Or your, oh, what's the word?

722
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,200
What's the word you've been saying?

723
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,100
Parmore.

724
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:37,860
Parmore.

725
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,520
Parmore.

726
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:38,940
Jason's parmore.

727
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,060
I was almost said side piece,

728
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,820
which is another thing Jason likes to say.

729
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,260
But parmore.

730
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,520
I don't think I said it.

731
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,660
You love to say the phrase side piece.

732
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,000
I don't think I said side piece in a number of years.

733
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,340
You said it on the show recently,

734
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,640
like in the last year, I think.

735
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,260
I may be the first to say,

736
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,740
yes, Jason says it every episode,

737
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,780
but it doesn't sound familiar lately.

738
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,500
Here's what I'll say.

739
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,780
He has said it on the show.

740
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,540
Maybe it's been in the last two years

741
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,140
because time has fucked up for me.

742
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,720
But it is, he said it in the last year or two,

743
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,360
but there was a time in this man's life

744
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,200
when he was saying side piece all the time.

745
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,420
And if he pretends that's not true,

746
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,680
then he's a freaking liar.

747
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,260
I think he usually said it in a facetious manner.

748
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,820
Well, I didn't say it wasn't facetious.

749
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,260
He was joking.

750
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,940
I was never quite comfortable dating.

751
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,920
I was never comfortable on dating using dating apps.

752
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,120
He did not have a side piece.

753
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,840
Were you ever a side piece?

754
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,040
Were you the side piece?

755
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,820
Not as far as I know.

756
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,480
I'd love to discover that it turns out I was.

757
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,320
Yeah, so no, he was being funny about it,

758
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,760
but there was a time in our lives

759
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,340
when he was saying that a lot.

760
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,600
But he has said it on the show.

761
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,660
Let me tell you that about a year or two ago,

762
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,480
I learned, you know,

763
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,660
Jane and I had been dating for quite some time,

764
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,520
and at some point I learned,

765
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,640
wait a minute, people talk to multiple people

766
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,620
at once on these dating apps?

767
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,120
You didn't know that?

768
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,400
The people were not committed?

769
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,500
I thought, no, not committed.

770
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,900
I thought it was disrespect.

771
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,300
I feel like maybe if I was talking to multiple people,

772
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,900
it's like, because one went silent and someone else.

773
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,760
But I was like, wait, how many people are like,

774
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,280
I didn't know multitasking was a thing to do on these things.

775
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,800
I think people do it with dozens at a time.

776
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,820
I have not ever been on these apps.

777
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,980
I don't know anything about them,

778
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,120
but that doesn't surprise me.

779
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,520
I've been in a relationship

780
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,460
since before there were dating apps.

781
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,220
Yeah, me too.

782
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:42,980
Yeah, wow.

783
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,880
So you're the man who knows the most,

784
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,140
but apparently knows the least.

785
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,920
with somebody that they seal that up.

786
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,200
All right, no more messaging allowed until you,

787
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,900
until you, it's like closing a job

788
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,020
in some kind of file system.

789
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,600
But it's like, wait, people,

790
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,720
yeah, I didn't know until I was pretty well into my 30s

791
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,780
that it's like, wait, people date multiple people at once.

792
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,340
Now I've heard everything.

793
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,040
That's progress for you.

794
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,280
That's progress for you.

795
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,380
This is like, my dad did this.

796
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,480
My dad in the 60s dated multiple people.

797
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,800
My mom would be like, oh, so are you exclusive?

798
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,260
Like she would say that word.

799
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,380
She would be like, oh, are you exclusive?

800
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,220
I go, oh, yeah.

801
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,100
Yeah, I've said that word too.

802
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,220
I don't think exclusive is the most behind the times.

803
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,100
No, I'm not saying it is.

804
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,720
I'm just saying that, I'm agreeing with Scott

805
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,340
that that's an old time thing that you're talking about.

806
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,860
You're talking about the new version of it

807
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,260
where you're just chatting with multiple people,

808
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,100
but in our parents' day,

809
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,300
that was just called dating around or not being exclusive.

810
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,200
Dating, that's a good way to put it.

811
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,500
Yeah, now are you, do you think that would have been

812
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,740
overwhelming to have to deal with

813
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,200
that many personalities at once?

814
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,220
Potentially, or I feel like the more awkward thing

815
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,160
would be like, oh, remember that thing we were joking about?

816
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,580
And you go like, oh, that was the other.

817
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,120
Oh, you'd forget who you were talking to.

818
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,460
Yeah, I forget the other.

819
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,620
I was like, oh, this new Succession show

820
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,840
is pretty interesting.

821
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,740
You know, oh, fuck, no,

822
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,640
I was talking about Breaking Bad with them.

823
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,340
I was talking about Succession with someone.

824
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,640
Oh, no.

825
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,800
This hypothetical dating app conversation

826
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,280
is sparkling.

827
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,520
It is stressing me out,

828
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,660
actually, right now.

829
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,760
All right, well, yeah, let's not stress you out forever.

830
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,880
Wait, she doesn't even have Macs.

831
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,540
She couldn't watch Succession if she wanted to.

832
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,100
This is great.

833
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,880
Anyway, but like they say in this video,

834
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,640
what you don't have to worry about is,

835
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,080
with all the Universal parks now,

836
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,920
you spend a full week just at the Universal,

837
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,920
those hotels and resorts.

838
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,060
Well, that's a real gauntlet they threw too.

839
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,920
Universal is saying this.

840
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,760
I'm so sorry, this is a very important joke.

841
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,580
Universal is no longer the side piece.

842
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,540
Universal is your main.

843
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,200
Wow.

844
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,660
Yeah.

845
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,040
Wow.

846
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,780
That's what they're saying.

847
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,760
You DM on the side with Disney

848
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,900
if you're just sowing your oats.

849
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,520
Yeah.

850
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,120
But now, yeah, Universal is your main.

851
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,860
Hey, that's how I felt for a little while, my man.

852
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,060
They should market it that way.

853
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,080
Disney, I hope you like being a side piece.

854
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,000
Yeah, yes.

855
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,920
Or just like, if they just like,

856
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,300
if it wasn't tracked to them,

857
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,800
and just like, there was a billboard

858
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,500
next to like the exit for Disney,

859
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,560
pointing at Disney, and it's just an arrow

860
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,980
that says side piece.

861
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,620
Now that would be throwing it down.

862
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,580
That would be throwing it down.

863
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,740
That's not the, they don't wanna use language like that

864
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,880
when they're trying to inspire

865
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,880
and tug on the heartstrings, our nostalgic heartstrings.

866
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,860
So I understand that, but maybe they can make

867
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,340
some like cruder videos

868
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,540
for a different section of the audience.

869
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,800
Yeah, well, and that's where you bring us in.

870
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,560
Well, of course that's where you bring us in.

871
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,160
It's a whole different,

872
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,940
they've got like these two guys called like the Ride Guys

873
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,060
that are on YouTube that do all their rides now.

874
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,620
It's a little too close to the title here,

875
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,660
which even though I know those are generic words.

876
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,460
Yeah, Ride Guys, podcast the ride.

877
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,840
It's basically the same thing.

878
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,180
Basically the same thing, I don't like it.

879
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,200
I thought you were gonna say close to the Try Guys,

880
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,900
and they are certainly trying things.

881
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,500
They are trying things.

882
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,320
Like all the great attractions, the Universal, or whatever.

883
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,740
If I was a Try Guy, I would wanna sue them, but I'm not.

884
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,840
And now a serious message from the Ride Guys.

885
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,800
There's like two of them.

886
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,680
There would be one left.

887
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,820
We, I mean, I am committed to providing

888
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,760
the great Ride Guys content, even though Barry,

889
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,580
Barry the Ride Guy had a side piece, okay?

890
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,540
And unfortunately, he's been fired.

891
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,540
I saw them kissing at the top of Rip Ride Rocket.

892
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,260
And unfortunately we had to,

893
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,460
we threw him off the top of the Velocicoaster.

894
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,900
We're so far off.

895
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,740
So I will point real quick, nostalgic stuff.

896
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,020
Having a discussion with somebody about this,

897
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,620
that like Universal, like,

898
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,900
or I guess we've talked about it a lot too,

899
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,660
where it's like embracing the 30 year olds stuff

900
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,300
and the little kid brains of us kids

901
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,740
and who went at that time.

902
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,220
And they are doing it.

903
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,920
I do wish there was a little bit more

904
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,660
of an actual presence of that stuff.

905
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,020
I know people have said,

906
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,620
and I'm sure multiple people have,

907
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,960
and I'm not stealing one person's idea,

908
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,380
but like, one of these lands should be classic Universal

909
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,000
land, that would be almost the ultimate

910
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,500
new Back to the Future ride or something.

911
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,540
Have we ever said that in an episode,

912
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,320
that if there was, I mean,

913
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,400
I think we have, yeah, for sure.

914
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,560
This would be a killer fourth park idea

915
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,920
that one of the little, one of the lands,

916
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,240
one of the, whatever you wanna call it,

917
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,240
is just like, that Back to the Future is there

918
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,520
and some new version of Jaws and some,

919
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,300
just pick the three that are the most unimpeachable.

920
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,740
Yes, so that's the only thing that missing

921
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,680
because if they had,

922
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,020
ET is the only thing that's left

923
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,780
and it's in a weird part of the park

924
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:10,200
and I'd almost propose now to build up that land over by ET

925
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,380
into a full little ET with the magic of the forest outside

926
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,340
because obviously it's still stuck in a big soundstage,

927
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,620
but if you could really even dress up the outside of that

928
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,360
to make it feel more Disney and like,

929
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,140
oh my God, we're going into the forest

930
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,660
and it's hard thematically with the Steven Spielberg stuff.

931
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,480
But this is where I think part of it for me

932
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,680
is the soundstage.

933
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,700
The fact that it is just the way that it was

934
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,420
and I like those pink stripes

935
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,840
that the soundstage used to have

936
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,800
and they're disappearing.

937
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,680
There's very few of those pink stripes left.

938
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,540
I think, you get your forest inside.

939
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,320
You have to go through some double doors

940
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,920
in order to get to that forest.

941
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,080
You're right.

942
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,460
I guess what I'm saying is that Universal has nothing

943
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,560
that's almost authentically left from the early days.

944
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,420
They still have the tiny replica

945
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,420
of the Gardens of Allah apartment building.

946
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,040
Oh, what?

947
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,340
The Gardens of Allah,

948
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,980
this was in Los Angeles, I think close by the 50s,

949
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,900
but it's right in Universal.

950
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,360
There is a neon sign that says Gardens of Allah

951
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,780
right by ET, like by that quote, Central Park area.

952
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,280
Really?

953
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,900
That's one of the like old Hollywood,

954
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,560
oh, I kind of recognize it now that I'm looking at it.

955
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,920
Yeah, visually the building, I think is-

956
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,280
Spanish colonial revival building.

957
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,760
And there was some AT&T exhibit in there.

958
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,560
All I'm saying is that like,

959
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,740
unfortunately so much of the old stuff is gone.

960
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,080
All they really have left to point to

961
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,220
is like the Universal sign and like the globe and then ET.

962
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,620
And I just wish they still had some of it

963
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,280
to really kind of highlight when you go to the parks.

964
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,720
And obviously the way they could do it now

965
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,260
is what we were saying with like a new land

966
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,520
that had classic properties.

967
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,740
You gotta spend more time at Lombards at Richterberger.

968
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,380
Yeah.

969
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,680
That's true, that is the silly old school feeling.

970
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,500
I hear what you're saying.

971
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,700
What are the three that if like, you could, would you do,

972
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,100
it's Back to the Future for sure.

973
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,240
Somehow Jaws, why not?

974
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,800
I know that's complicated, but-

975
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,000
I mean, Kong, Kong I think always had the longest line

976
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,500
that I remember.

977
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:20,920
Just bringing back the old Kong

978
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,100
in some smarter way.

979
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,380
I know they have the new Kong,

980
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,360
so like I guess that wouldn't make sense, but still.

981
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,100
Not Twister Rided Out.

982
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,640
Probably not Twister Rided Out.

983
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,160
Twister Rided Out kind of was, I was like,

984
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,540
I don't know, like I was enjoying going on old school rides

985
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,400
last time we were there and which, you know,

986
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,200
there's not that many.

987
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,000
Men in Black is honestly, I know it's not original,

988
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,960
but like I like that it's still, it's very 90s feeling.

989
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:46,920
Yeah, yeah.

990
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,940
But I was leaving that, thinking like,

991
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,800
I could really go for Twister Rided Out right now.

992
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,660
I was really hankering for it.

993
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,620
That's not probably the mass site.

994
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,240
You know what, I would accept just a room that I walk into

995
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,820
where I watch those Bill Paxton, Helen Hunt videos,

996
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,200
and then I don't do the attraction itself.

997
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,740
Sure.

998
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,620
But I could also do that on YouTube on my own time.

999
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,060
Sure.

1000
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,100
Like even just, and they never did this,

1001
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,200
but Ghostbusters ride.

1002
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,080
Like why not?

1003
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,780
Like that, and that could be a dark,

1004
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,220
that doesn't even have to be that expensive.

1005
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,980
Even just something, I mean, it would be expensive,

1006
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,100
but not expensive, expensive.

1007
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,640
Like even just something that invokes the feeling

1008
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,760
like it would have been there,

1009
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,920
but obviously it's a high tech version of it.

1010
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:25,580
Yeah.

1011
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:25,920
Like, just yeah,

1012
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,960
Ghostbusters Back to the Future is something else.

1013
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,180
These movies that also will never die,

1014
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,900
even though Back to the Future,

1015
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,060
we've said this a hundred times,

1016
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,260
that it will be, they'll remake it when Zemeckis is dead.

1017
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,700
But like why, yeah.

1018
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,220
Something like that, that's so popular immediately.

1019
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,780
People would be going nuts for that,

1020
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,800
just because it's not in,

1021
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,040
well Ghostbusters is in the theater soon,

1022
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,320
but like that just makes too much sense to me to do.

1023
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,240
And maybe, and they're building aggressively,

1024
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,160
so maybe this is on the drawing table somewhere.

1025
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,380
That's a matter of, I mean, yeah,

1026
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,940
because the universe is all about change.

1027
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,620
They don't want to get like locked in time,

1028
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,800
like frozen in time.

1029
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,720
You don't want the park to become some kind of,

1030
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,220
I don't know, frozen empire.

1031
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,920
You do not want a frozen empire.

1032
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,740
One thing nobody wants is a frozen empire.

1033
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,040
There's an ice, it could be an Ice Age,

1034
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:13,980
says Dan from the trailer.

1035
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,800
Suck an Ice Age.

1036
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,260
We've been on tangent so long,

1037
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,040
we have not talked about the roller coaster Starfall Races,

1038
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,640
a racing coaster, and it looks good, I don't know.

1039
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,660
Looks cool.

1040
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,080
Supposedly, yeah, there's some like lights

1041
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,460
on the coasters themselves, the trucks, excuse me,

1042
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,500
the vehicles themselves, I think.

1043
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,740
And then there's like a place where

1044
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,260
it goes through some smoke,

1045
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,960
there's like a little hole that goes into,

1046
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,800
and it's got smoke.

1047
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,860
There's supposed to be like comets or something.

1048
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,780
That sort of vibe.

1049
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,980
Yeah, there's a statue

1050
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,200
of like a falling star or a comet or something

1051
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,900
that the coasters go around.

1052
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,820
So it's supposed to look,

1053
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,740
probably especially at night, it'll look like it's,

1054
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,080
you know, shooting stars or comets or something.

1055
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:02,520
It is funny to me that the movie studio based,

1056
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,680
the theme park coming out of movie studio

1057
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,700
has now with Celestial Park done more original rides

1058
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,480
and lands that non-IP than Disney.

1059
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,760
Disney has not done an original one in ages.

1060
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,500
Yeah, that's true.

1061
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,400
Yep.

1062
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,320
Yeah, Starfall Racers is not,

1063
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,540
there's no movie called Starfall Racers.

1064
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,960
There will be after the popularity of this.

1065
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,280
No, this whole thing is kind of this like,

1066
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,840
I like Island's Adventure before it,

1067
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,380
besides the obvious IP in there,

1068
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,740
the fact that there is some like original worlds

1069
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,520
as Lost Continent and all that.

1070
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,560
Yeah, I don't know.

1071
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,160
You're right, it's cool.

1072
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,040
They are not, IP is obviously the base of it

1073
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,780
and like half of it, but there's a lot that isn't.

1074
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,740
You're very right.

1075
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,040
And they have a lot of,

1076
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,060
and I say this in the best possible way,

1077
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,660
they have a lot of nonsense kind of backstory

1078
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,200
going on around this place, which I like.

1079
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,480
Well, yeah, because you enter through the Kronos

1080
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,780
where all of the planets will align.

1081
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,520
So remember that, you're not just going

1082
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,860
through the turnstiles of a park,

1083
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,580
you're entering the ultimate portal

1084
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,200
and all the planets align upon your entry.

1085
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,840
Right, so exciting.

1086
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,520
That's good.

1087
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,600
And then the hotel, a hotel?

1088
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,380
It's a 500 room hotel, Helios Grand, huh?

1089
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,360
Sounds like a good hotel.

1090
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,880
No, it is not just a hotel.

1091
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,280
It transports you to a world

1092
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,480
where the heavens and earth unite.

1093
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,800
That's what I said to Jason.

1094
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,500
Well, that's what you said.

1095
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,280
You were trying to see if there was another place.

1096
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,660
Helios is the god of the sun.

1097
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:37,640
Yeah.

1098
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,900
We were looking this up on the drive over.

1099
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,220
Helios pulled the chariot from east to west.

1100
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,500
Helios moves the sun with like a big chain or something.

1101
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:46,960
I don't know.

1102
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:47,500
Whoa.

1103
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,420
He moves the sun.

1104
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,680
Helios makes the sun his side piece.

1105
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,400
That's right.

1106
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,140
Literally next to him in the side.

1107
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,560
I think him and the sun are end game.

1108
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,820
Oh yeah, they're in it to win it.

1109
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,980
So the heavens and earth align.

1110
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,100
So again, heaven exists in Celestial Park

1111
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,580
or multiple heavens.

1112
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,400
What kind of heavens?

1113
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,200
This is Greek.

1114
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,180
It's Greek and there's multiple.

1115
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,360
All the ideas of heaven.

1116
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,120
Yeah, so a certain kind of heaven exists here.

1117
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,360
And it looks like there's a bar at the top.

1118
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,040
There is a rooftop bar.

1119
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,300
Looks like there's a lounge or rooftop bar.

1120
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,460
Which I guess will get you the closest to the heavens.

1121
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,140
Yeah.

1122
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,980
Which is nice.

1123
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,640
That's right.

1124
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,880
Talking about classic Disney,

1125
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,520
believe it was theme park stop.

1126
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,780
Someone was posting about how,

1127
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,960
or it was by a reconstruct.

1128
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,040
The rooms aren't modular like the contemporary.

1129
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,460
However, they appear to,

1130
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,580
the bathrooms appear to be pre-built and slid in.

1131
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,920
There is a company that makes,

1132
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,080
they prefabricate full bathrooms

1133
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,720
and then they slide it into the hotel room.

1134
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,500
And you can see in the construction photos right now.

1135
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,600
They're sliding bathrooms?

1136
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,660
They're sliding bathrooms.

1137
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,160
Wow.

1138
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,880
Sliding the bathrooms.

1139
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:05,940
That's cool.

1140
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,720
Hopefully they secure them

1141
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,020
so the bathroom doesn't fall out when you're going.

1142
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:11,660
Whoops.

1143
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,220
Well, that's, yeah,

1144
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,020
that's a fear a lot of us have probably.

1145
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,300
That one of the bathrooms in a hotel just slides out.

1146
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,380
Just slides fully out the roof down many stories.

1147
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,080
Oh no, I'm falling right into Blue Dragon.

1148
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,860
What if Beethoven has his leash connected

1149
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,040
to one of those bathrooms and it's not secured

1150
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,440
and he pulls the whole bathroom out one day?

1151
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,760
Remember Beethoven from Beethoven 2?

1152
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,060
Yeah, when he, yes.

1153
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,140
I posted this on Twitter recently.

1154
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,300
He yanks the supports of a big douchebag party

1155
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,640
and saves a girl from an assault.

1156
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,540
Even though he didn't, he doesn't know she's in it,

1157
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,680
but I guess, but he knows.

1158
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,440
He knows.

1159
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:50,980
He knows.

1160
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,660
So what if he has.

1161
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,400
He's getting a bad vibe from upstairs

1162
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,180
and also, and they're pouring beer on his face.

1163
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,460
This is one of the finest scenes in movie history.

1164
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,280
This scene, as a kid, seeing this scene was as memorable

1165
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,160
as the most famous scenes in cinema.

1166
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,020
This stuck with me for a long time

1167
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,300
and it still is with me today.

1168
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,300
He does the big yell, not the Wilhelm scream,

1169
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,660
the Howie scream, which is so much better

1170
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,620
than the Wilhelm scream.

1171
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,800
It's the yeah.

1172
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,660
It's the most.

1173
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,840
He flies out.

1174
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,940
Oh, it's the, yeah, there should be an attraction

1175
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,560
based on this.

1176
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,180
That's my only, that's my plus up.

1177
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,660
No Beethoven presence.

1178
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,880
No Beethoven, yeah.

1179
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,860
And that's universal.

1180
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,940
It's sitting right there.

1181
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,980
Yeah, so that would be nice.

1182
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,500
Yeah.

1183
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,920
But yeah, all the restaurants, everything, I don't know.

1184
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,860
It seems like it's gonna be pretty good to hang here.

1185
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,060
Let's talk some portals.

1186
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,380
What are the lands called?

1187
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:45,880
Is it land?

1188
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,900
The portals take you to worlds?

1189
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,880
Worlds, universes?

1190
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:49,680
Worlds, yeah.

1191
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,200
I don't know.

1192
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,900
You know, we knew the basic shape of these, I would say,

1193
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,500
but that doesn't mean we don't get some new info.

1194
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,000
For example, we knew there was a How to Train Your Dragon

1195
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,660
area, but I don't think we knew.

1196
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,880
We were going to Isle of Berk.

1197
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,780
We did not know.

1198
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,420
We're going to Berk, baby.

1199
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,660
We did not know.

1200
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,080
Berk, baby.

1201
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,840
See you in Berk.

1202
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,460
Yeah, Isle of Berk.

1203
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,480
I assume Berk is the place from the movies

1204
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,560
that I've never seen.

1205
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,900
And we'll never see.

1206
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,340
And maybe, well, I have a child, so maybe.

1207
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,860
Yeah, but there's a lot of kid stuff to watch.

1208
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,980
There's a lot of kid stuff.

1209
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:26,680
There's no guarantee I'll ever make it.

1210
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,520
These ones are supposed to be pretty good, though, right here.

1211
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,300
Okay, well, if they're pretty good, maybe I will see them.

1212
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,260
I guess maybe before I take her to Epic Universe,

1213
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,260
we'll have to watch them.

1214
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,240
But yeah, that's a specific we didn't know,

1215
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,100
or didn't remember.

1216
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,660
It's possible it's out there, I don't know.

1217
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,540
And they say you'll be able to ride on the top of a dragon,

1218
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,460
that's what they express.

1219
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,520
Now, there's some cynicism in our comments.

1220
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,980
There's somebody, and this struck me, too,

1221
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,220
where you're like, is this a little bit,

1222
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,920
is this gonna be a little bit Flight of Passage?

1223
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,660
Well, that's, yeah, I don't know.

1224
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,940
Because there are building a roller coaster there

1225
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,360
that you can see on all the aerial photos.

1226
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,260
Oh, it's another coaster, okay.

1227
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,200
But I don't, I think what they're talking about

1228
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,400
is a different, yeah, it does seem like there's gonna be

1229
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,900
like a Flight of Passage type ride there.

1230
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,360
Is there?

1231
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,320
Am I wrong?

1232
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,080
I saw Hiccup's gliders, Hiccup the main character,

1233
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,440
in these movies, in the new Alicia Stella video,

1234
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,040
she's like, there's trains on the track for the coaster,

1235
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,080
but they're all covered,

1236
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,000
so we can't really see what they are right now.

1237
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,980
So you're saying there's not like a big screen ride?

1238
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,000
Yeah, I don't know if there is a big screen ride.

1239
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,760
There could be.

1240
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,420
So when they were saying ride on the back of the track,

1241
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,480
and they just meant this coaster.

1242
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:41,720
Maybe.

1243
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,320
I don't know.

1244
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:42,940
I don't know.

1245
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,440
I genuinely don't know.

1246
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,280
I think I know a lot of stuff about this,

1247
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,180
and now I'm realizing I guess I don't.

1248
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,940
Yeah, the most unknown to me, this area, I think.

1249
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,420
Well, yeah, they're still being, you know, we haven't,

1250
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,600
they certainly said more about everything in Celestial Park.

1251
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,880
These, the specific attractions,

1252
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,620
we didn't get a lot of new info on.

1253
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:07,800
They really don't say, they very clearly just refuse

1254
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,600
to give details at this stage about the new ride

1255
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,020
in Wizarding World, Ministry of Magic.

1256
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:13,420
Yes.

1257
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,680
We don't know what that is.

1258
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,960
I said the most daring thing, their most,

1259
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,700
the biggest risk they took,

1260
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,480
including snippets from the Fantastic Beasts movies,

1261
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,120
which recently described, I believe, as on ice,

1262
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,640
is the Hollywood term in the trades.

1263
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,100
Like they are, we're not doing four more of these,

1264
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,680
like we said.

1265
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,480
Enter the most cursed world there is.

1266
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:43,740
Yeah.

1267
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,740
I don't, you know, I'll be interested to see

1268
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,580
what the big ride here is,

1269
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,000
but it doesn't seem like they're doing

1270
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,980
what I'd like to see them do with Harry Potter,

1271
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,640
which is trap J.

1272
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:54,880
K.

1273
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:55,300
Rowling

1274
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,900
in a windowless soundproof box forever.

1275
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,280
Like they did to Lane at the end of Mission Impossible 6.

1276
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,060
Oh yeah.

1277
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:03,760
Or five.

1278
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,420
Or the Magneto Prison.

1279
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,140
Or the Magneto Prison, yeah.

1280
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,300
Or the plastic prison.

1281
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,280
Or where the Superman 2 villains, you know,

1282
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,760
where they like tumble into space

1283
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,160
in those diamonds forever.

1284
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,140
In the, not the negative, the negative zone,

1285
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,040
Jason, help me out here.

1286
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:16,840
Negative zone DC?

1287
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:17,540
Yeah.

1288
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,780
What's the other one in Marvel?

1289
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,020
The micro, for micro-noids?

1290
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,660
In front of the micro-averse?

1291
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,780
I'm looking at something else, I think.

1292
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,980
Well, the point is, Universal's about great storytelling,

1293
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,940
and I think they could concoct a pretty great story

1294
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,560
for something that could happen to J.

1295
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:36,780
K.

1296
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,640
Negative zone is Marvel.

1297
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,680
Oh, the negative zone.

1298
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,780
What, the Phantom Zone is DC?

1299
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,660
The Phantom Zone is DC.

1300
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,860
I'm so sorry, everyone.

1301
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,520
And the woke zone is our current world, right?

1302
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:49,940
K.

1303
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,120
waited on something about that.

1304
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,100
It's just a shame she fell in that well,

1305
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,900
so really can't make out what she said.

1306
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,380
What's that?

1307
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,060
What's that?

1308
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,560
Oh, and you don't have Twitter down there?

1309
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,260
That's too bad.

1310
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,440
I'm not going to look up a website called Mumsnet.

1311
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,780
That's not happening.

1312
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,640
I don't know what that is.

1313
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,220
Well, that's the news to me.

1314
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,040
Oh, that's England.

1315
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,140
Weird stuff going on over there.

1316
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,420
All right, I don't know.

1317
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,480
There's dark stuff.

1318
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,320
Yeah, that's not going to that portal.

1319
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,220
It's funny that all of this stuff is so exciting

1320
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,880
that by the time in the video, and we're bringing,

1321
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,600
this is loaded, we're bringing a lot into this,

1322
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,720
but by the time that they say,

1323
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,860
we've got Super Nintendo World, it's funny that we're now,

1324
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,180
we're probably all now a little like, okay, yeah.

1325
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,020
Yeah.

1326
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,180
You know, I hear you.

1327
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,760
I wish that wasn't the feeling.

1328
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,680
I know, I know, I know.

1329
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,780
And, and, and to give them some credit,

1330
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,560
they're going to have Yoshi.

1331
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,860
They're not going to screw us like here in Hollywood

1332
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,620
and not do a little, the funnel Yoshi.

1333
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,140
Right, right.

1334
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,680
And then, and then Donkey Kong,

1335
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,800
and they make a point of.

1336
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,700
And that's the, yeah, that's the,

1337
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,380
I'm holding out hope, yes, that Donkey Kong is the thing.

1338
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,500
I'm worried.

1339
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,980
I'm worried about it.

1340
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,460
It's, but it's, the pictures look good,

1341
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,320
and they cast the moves somewhat fast,

1342
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,000
like fast, 10, 15 miles an hour.

1343
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,600
I get, yeah.

1344
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,660
It can't be two miles.

1345
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,420
It can't be as slow as Mario Kart.

1346
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,380
The jumps, they're going to be jumps.

1347
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,300
Yeah, but what if.

1348
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,260
The big robots.

1349
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,820
I just, I just feel so.

1350
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,700
I know.

1351
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,360
Let down by.

1352
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,120
I know, but I'm holding out hope

1353
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,820
that that one is what we want.

1354
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,480
Yeah, yeah, but either way, I mean, like,

1355
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,200
with a little more space to breathe,

1356
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,980
and that being like, I mean, that's also the gauntlet

1357
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,300
that's turned down by this park, where like that's,

1358
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,620
Nintendo has just won four expansive,

1359
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,620
five expansive new areas, as opposed to Hollywood,

1360
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,740
like all this buildup for Hollywood to get it,

1361
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,900
and then it's just like, it's a miniature version of it.

1362
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,920
It's really cramped in there.

1363
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,080
It's kind of unpleasant in there.

1364
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,360
It won't be like Hollywood.

1365
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,900
They just should not have tried to jam Hollywood

1366
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,020
into that space.

1367
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,220
Ultimately, that's the mistake.

1368
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,800
Probably, yes, I agree with that.

1369
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,940
Or they got to kick the voice out of there.

1370
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,540
Stages, you're out.

1371
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,400
The voice is pretty far away.

1372
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,040
It's all the way practically by the

1373
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:04,420
part of the bed sheet.

1374
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:04,660
Doesn't matter.

1375
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,940
It's all gone, all of it.

1376
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,040
They got the voice.

1377
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,380
Anything close to it.

1378
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,560
It's a- Not making movies in TV there.

1379
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:09,560
It's an animal.

1380
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1381
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:10,720
That's your big mistake.

1382
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,920
That's really the mistake.

1383
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,060
And then, I mean, I think the highest excitement

1384
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,720
has got to be for, and the end of an exciting moment

1385
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,700
in the video is the official reveal

1386
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:26,140
of the monster world name, the classic monster realm,

1387
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,360
which is Dark Universe.

1388
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:28,420
Yes.

1389
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,640
Dark Universe is officially back.

1390
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,500
They've reclaimed the title for the series of films,

1391
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,140
the Univer- Yeah.

1392
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,660
The MCU of monsters that never happened,

1393
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,360
that was just teased with Tom Cruise.

1394
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,400
And a photo shoot.

1395
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,580
And that photo.

1396
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,040
That one weird photo shoot.

1397
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,800
Yeah, yeah.

1398
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,020
Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp, somebody else?

1399
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,480
Russell Crowe in there?

1400
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,300
Somebody else, I think?

1401
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,540
Imagine, imagine what Depp could have done for us.

1402
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:56,600
Depp.

1403
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,420
The woman who was the mummy, right?

1404
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,440
Or is it Penelope Cruz?

1405
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,180
Oh, maybe Penelope Cruz, I don't know.

1406
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,080
So they don't say much about here,

1407
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,060
but it's certainly a big part of the excitement

1408
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,680
of this video that there's the quotes from Frankenstein,

1409
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,480
you're hearing it's alive,

1410
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,540
and you get some sense of the castle.

1411
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,780
Not much is said about the ride.

1412
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,820
I might have a complaint here.

1413
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,380
Well, Jason and I have a complaint, too.

1414
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,760
I wonder if we all have the same complaint.

1415
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,400
Maybe the same as you.

1416
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,780
Well, you guys go for it.

1417
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,060
Mike phrased it best, you say it.

1418
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:30,940
Well, what did I say?

1419
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,040
I don't even remember how I phrased it.

1420
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,860
You said Dracula does not have a cape.

1421
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,880
Yes, and my version of this is why does Dracula

1422
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,840
look like he's in my chemical romance?

1423
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,960
I saw somebody say that as well.

1424
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:47,220
And I said why does Dracula wear a track jacket?

1425
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,760
So all the same.

1426
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,920
Dracula was in Crush Groove, I didn't know.

1427
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,060
I just think that classic Dracula

1428
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,140
with the big medallion on his neck and the big cape,

1429
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,540
I feel like that design is just untouchable

1430
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,040
in terms of costuming.

1431
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,520
There's something about the quality of video

1432
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,680
where they showcase the new looks for the monsters

1433
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,200
that is a little unpleasant.

1434
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,100
Yeah, I think they all look a little dumb.

1435
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,680
Maybe Wolfman's kind of whatever.

1436
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,540
That's like basic Wolfman.

1437
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,000
Frankenstein looks a little goofy to me.

1438
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,740
I thought that, too, and then I went back

1439
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,500
and I'm looking and I go,

1440
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,080
Frankenstein looks fine, Wolfman looks fine,

1441
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,560
but this Dracula bothers me.

1442
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,300
And he's wearing a drum major's outfit or something,

1443
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,480
like a dark drum major's outfit, like the Black Parade.

1444
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:41,500
We've all written jokes for Johnny Carson.

1445
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,140
We gave him all different, okay,

1446
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,700
here's three different jokes on the same idea.

1447
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,320
When Johnny Carson is gonna do a bid on,

1448
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,200
when he does a bid on the new Epic Universe video.

1449
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,480
I don't know where Conan, I was just picking a late night.

1450
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,540
Late night shows that are on.

1451
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,280
No, we're J, we all wanna write J.

1452
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,240
Still have a name for them.

1453
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,420
The Dracula joke.

1454
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,020
Seth.

1455
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,160
Then Gordon, Ferguson.

1456
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,380
Ferguson.

1457
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,480
Yeah, so I mean that's so, I just give them a cape.

1458
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,080
That's like, it's fine, I understand the difference.

1459
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,160
Give them a cape, they can change that.

1460
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,300
They can give them a cape.

1461
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,180
That's not set in stone, right?

1462
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,860
The cape's not gonna interfere

1463
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,000
with whatever the ride is.

1464
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,900
Give him like the crazy spawn CG cape.

1465
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,200
Well that's okay, if we wanna do something like.

1466
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,140
That has a mind of its own.

1467
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,180
Yeah, if you wanna do that, I'm all for that.

1468
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,800
It's like kind of a living cape, that would be cool.

1469
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,680
All eyes are on this costume, because this would,

1470
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,800
we've been looking forward to this land a lot, I think.

1471
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:41,720
Yes.

1472
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:47,660
I don't want it to be undone by 2005 emo goth vibes.

1473
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,960
I mean, in the right lighting on the ride itself,

1474
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,040
maybe it's not as big of an issue.

1475
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,620
Maybe if he gets shocked by like a Tesla coil,

1476
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,120
if he gets electrocuted, the track jacket becomes a cape.

1477
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,960
Maybe he was in a drum, he was in a marching band,

1478
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,700
and he got struck by the Tesla coil,

1479
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,220
and he became Dracula.

1480
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,080
Okay.

1481
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,620
Maybe there's a new order for him.

1482
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,780
Lightning shot through his tuba.

1483
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,140
Right.

1484
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,480
And went right down his lungs.

1485
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,120
Right.

1486
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:24,200
So, this is, did they say the name of the,

1487
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,200
I know the name of the ride,

1488
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,600
but did they say it in the video or am I?

1489
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:27,720
I don't know the name of the ride.

1490
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,380
The name of the ride, you know that you've,

1491
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,000
am I crazy?

1492
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,780
I think this is from Alicia Stella videos.

1493
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,620
Cause she talks about the spinning wolf man coaster.

1494
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,300
It is a very modern title.

1495
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,640
I believe it is,

1496
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,960
Monsters Unleashed the Frankenstein Experiment.

1497
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:45,380
Okay.

1498
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,660
Which is like,

1499
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,280
Not super.

1500
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,920
It's not such a punchy.

1501
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,220
You gotta start tight.

1502
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,140
Space Mountain, y'all.

1503
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:52,620
I know, I know.

1504
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,000
That's what rides are called.

1505
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,080
Monster party.

1506
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,440
Monster Mountain.

1507
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,540
I'd be happy with Mountain.

1508
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,200
Monster Mountain is awesome.

1509
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,240
Monster Mountain's good.

1510
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:00,720
Yeah.

1511
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,640
So, yeah, it's Monsters Unleashed,

1512
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,820
the Frankenstein Experiment.

1513
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,260
The new, is it a new,

1514
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,860
have they ever used a female Frankenstein,

1515
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,220
Dr.

1516
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,120
Frankenstein before?

1517
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,300
That's their new thing here.

1518
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

1519
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,360
It's a Victoria Frankenstein.

1520
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,040
I'm assuming it's going to be a granddaughter,

1521
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,380
or a descendant, maybe?

1522
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:23,920
I don't know.

1523
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,940
Yeah, I don't know if this is like,

1524
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,240
the descendant restarting all of the monsters,

1525
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,440
or bringing them all back.

1526
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:30,860
Yeah.

1527
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,700
Or if it's a full new origin,

1528
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,080
as if they're being created,

1529
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,820
like in this day and age.

1530
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,020
There was that rumor for a while,

1531
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,340
that there was like an Elvira type character

1532
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,220
around the land.

1533
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,680
I don't know if that's involved.

1534
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,780
They didn't say anything about that.

1535
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,920
I don't know if that was a blue sky,

1536
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,800
but they have revealed a few characters now

1537
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,440
from Dark Universe,

1538
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,580
which are the three monsters,

1539
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,800
and Dr.

1540
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:52,560
Frankenstein.

1541
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,960
I mean, it seems cool.

1542
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,760
I'm definitely, I got an open mind.

1543
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,280
It seems like they're gonna do something cool here.

1544
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,860
They show the mansion,

1545
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,380
or they show whatever the ride itself,

1546
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,420
I'm sure the outside of it.

1547
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,960
And yeah, the rumor of course is Kuka Arm,

1548
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,600
scary dark ride.

1549
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,680
All right.

1550
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:14,700
I hope.

1551
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:15,520
Are you doing it?

1552
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,220
What's that?

1553
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,000
Are you doing the ride?

1554
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,720
Yeah, I do Kuka Arm.

1555
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,500
What are you talking about?

1556
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,020
Yes, I do rides like that.

1557
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:21,480
Well, it's scary.

1558
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,800
Well, but it's scary, it's spooky.

1559
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,660
No, I don't even say that to be a jerk.

1560
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,820
That's different than,

1561
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,460
in a ride, I know what's happening.

1562
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,720
That's different than haunts.

1563
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,220
Okay.

1564
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,500
Give me some, give me my credit for that.

1565
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,600
It seems like the way people have been hyping it.

1566
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,760
Am I not gonna do that?

1567
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,060
The way people have been hyping it up

1568
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,160
seems like it might be scary.

1569
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,780
I would be a little scared to go on it.

1570
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,840
Yeah, I'm a little scared of it.

1571
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,440
If they do what they're talking.

1572
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,460
But it seems like, you know,

1573
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,020
maybe that's akin to the Harry Potter, which is Kuka Arm.

1574
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,160
It's possible.

1575
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,700
And been very scary at times.

1576
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,300
It's possible.

1577
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,380
There was a, supposedly they were running it

1578
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,680
and that like, this is of course,

1579
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,960
what probably always happens where it's like, it's scarier

1580
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,440
and then they're like,

1581
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,300
we gotta turn some of the lights on a little more.

1582
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:56,820
Oh.

1583
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,400
So we'll see.

1584
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,080
Oh, interesting.

1585
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,560
That was a rumor I had heard.

1586
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,240
Yes, is that, yeah.

1587
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,340
The restaurant bar, I think is the windmill,

1588
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,700
the flaming windmill.

1589
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,600
Yes, the windmill.

1590
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,400
The flaming windmill.

1591
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:07,800
Frankenstein.

1592
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,340
Okay.

1593
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,400
There's like a bar, yeah,

1594
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,920
and the windmill will be on fire as it's spinning.

1595
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,460
Whoa.

1596
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:12,880
Yeah.

1597
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,580
Oh, I didn't know this.

1598
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,980
Yeah, it's really, that looks cool.

1599
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:15,540
Wow.

1600
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,280
There's, yeah, the Wolfman roller coaster that's pretty.

1601
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,560
I didn't know that either.

1602
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,400
I missed all these, dude,

1603
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,200
because they didn't say anything.

1604
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:21,840
This is still the one for me.

1605
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,560
Yeah, that's just unconfirmed.

1606
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,880
And then at the end of this, talk about iconic characters.

1607
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,580
Then you get, the end of this big video,

1608
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,420
I think what really landed big for everybody

1609
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,320
was a guy we haven't seen in a while

1610
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,000
talking about the Universal Parks, Mr.

1611
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:42,600
Spielberg.

1612
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,920
I know, I was just asking somebody,

1613
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,280
I go, do you think he's even like,

1614
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,320
looked at any of these plans?

1615
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,920
And then here he is to not necessarily confirm that,

1616
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:50,880
but at least.

1617
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,120
They filled him in.

1618
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:52,940
Yeah.

1619
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,400
Steven loves portals.

1620
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,160
He's obsessed with the idea of these portals.

1621
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,580
He can't wait to go through the portals.

1622
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,160
He says something that seems mildly dismissive

1623
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,140
of the portals, or just that he's like,

1624
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,880
he says like some kind of portals or something.

1625
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,780
There's a little qualifier.

1626
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:08,800
Portals, Steven.

1627
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,620
It's portals, it's full on portals.

1628
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,820
He's not wrong about it.

1629
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,580
He just like, he goes,

1630
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,380
eh, it'd be some kind of portal you go through.

1631
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,800
Again, he probably, he was debriefed very quickly.

1632
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,740
And none of his movies are in here.

1633
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,000
None of his properties are here.

1634
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,620
That's a first, I guess, for Universal probably.

1635
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,140
I guess that's right, yeah, because Jurassic Park,

1636
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,800
and then obviously the stuff in the first park.

1637
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,920
Unless you consider these portals to be kind of terminals

1638
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,440
that take you from place to place.

1639
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,780
I guess I would consider them terminals.

1640
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,800
Portals are terminals.

1641
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:41,840
I wish you mentioned it.

1642
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,740
But yeah, you get to experience

1643
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,440
the full thrill of being alive.

1644
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:50,580
Clearly the presence of Steven mattered to people.

1645
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,980
I think this guy Mark Woodbury, who narrates it a lot,

1646
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,160
he's becoming this kind of like roadie Baxter,

1647
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,740
kind of like you clock him.

1648
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,880
He's compelling when he talks.

1649
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,900
The whole thing, just tonally, this video's very cool.

1650
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,140
It was a very good hype up, got me excited.

1651
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,500
Maybe I'll run through a couple questions or comments.

1652
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,580
Let's see.

1653
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,280
This is from David.

1654
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,900
Hey gang, thoughts on this being the first off property,

1655
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,640
quote unquote, Universal Park.

1656
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,880
I'm hearing 10 to 15 minute drive,

1657
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:26,800
kind of akin to pop century to magic or animal kingdom.

1658
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,700
Can their highly rated transportation

1659
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,140
keep up the reputation with the new challenge?

1660
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,600
We're kind of getting into,

1661
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,800
and I think they're trying to build some new roads

1662
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,620
or some new private roads, but at some point

1663
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,760
you're just gonna be on regular Orlando roads,

1664
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,320
and that's a little bit of a concern.

1665
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,160
Hopefully it's smooth.

1666
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,220
That's the tricky thing, because people argue,

1667
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:48,460
I've gotten into some big fights lately,

1668
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,380
some mild discussion about Disney Universal.

1669
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:57,020
Some people feel we're too kind to Universal recently

1670
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,560
about it being like the energy's there and we're excited.

1671
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,680
Disney still has the magic, be this person's point.

1672
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,600
And I said something earlier about

1673
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,860
Universal's doing better stuff than,

1674
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,420
we all love Guardians of the Galaxy.

1675
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,660
It's a Mario car, didn't necessarily meet our expectations.

1676
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,780
So of course Disney's still got it.

1677
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:17,920
I try, I really like trying.

1678
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,020
But I do think Disney, the thing they have,

1679
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,000
a one up that's gonna be hard to beat,

1680
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,660
is that you drive into the middle of the swamp woods

1681
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,300
to get to Disney World.

1682
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,280
That feeling still is hard to beat,

1683
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,820
and it's still what's doing a lot of the heavy lifting,

1684
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,560
I think, when people talk about

1685
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,500
Disney World Magic Universe versus Disneyland.

1686
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:41,300
Because that's what my mom will be like,

1687
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,720
oh I like Disney World, but Disney World,

1688
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,320
and it's like the idea of driving into the middle

1689
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,480
of nowhere and then there's the land there.

1690
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,440
That is gonna be tough to overcome.

1691
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,900
Not being out on the roads.

1692
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:54,980
Well, you know what, I think you just gotta rethink how you,

1693
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,880
you know, you're probably not doing days

1694
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,260
where you're bouncing between studios,

1695
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,240
Islands of Adventure, and Epic Universe.

1696
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,480
I think you just make, all right,

1697
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,340
we're doing the Epic Universe sojourn,

1698
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,400
and we're just gonna get some outside Orlando,

1699
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,540
and you're not immersed for that part.

1700
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,600
I know, so it'll be fine.

1701
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,200
I'm sure they'll figure out an efficient way

1702
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,340
to get everyone places.

1703
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,660
But the Disney bubble, the parks can decay

1704
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,760
another 50 years in Disney, in Disney World,

1705
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,000
but that bubble, I think, is what people hold onto,

1706
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,380
and even sometimes in more ways than actually the rides.

1707
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,820
Greenery and waterways go a long way.

1708
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,300
I feel like I have a discussion with a lot of people

1709
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,380
where I go, Disneyland is better than Magic Kingdom,

1710
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,120
and they argue with me, and then I go,

1711
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,920
but look at the list of what you can do

1712
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,320
in Disneyland versus Magic Kingdom,

1713
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,880
and then it's like, oh yeah, but nobody thinks about it.

1714
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,940
I think they just are like, I'm in the bubble.

1715
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:49,800
I like the bubble.

1716
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,820
Yeah, actually, the buildup is part of it,

1717
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,980
as opposed to, and if you live in California,

1718
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,720
it's hard to, you mean the place where I gotta do

1719
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,680
kind of a smoggy drive, and I'm mad,

1720
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,260
I'm in a parking garage, and then the castle's small.

1721
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,880
But if you get past those things,

1722
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,020
and just think about what really,

1723
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,780
how packed it is in the history.

1724
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:10,000
Yes, so that is the only hurdle Universal has,

1725
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,360
is not having a bubble.

1726
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,620
Yeah, that's the only hurdle to me.

1727
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:17,620
I really wanna stay in this Helios Hotel.

1728
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,140
Yeah.

1729
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:22,320
500 rooms is so few hotel rooms.

1730
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,840
Is this thing just gonna be booked solid for two years?

1731
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,840
I probably, or are they still gonna be building awareness

1732
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,900
of it in a way?

1733
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:31,700
Like, potentially.

1734
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:33,140
Yeah, I don't know.

1735
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:33,840
Yeah, I think you're right.

1736
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,800
It's either fully sold out, or they have to get people used

1737
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,520
to the fact that you can stay on that part of the property.

1738
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,960
Because when we went down, I mean, again,

1739
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,620
I loved Sapphire Falls, it was awesome.

1740
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:49,080
And the water taxis, huge plus.

1741
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:53,960
But I ended up there because I was like,

1742
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:55,480
well, Road Pacific is booked.

1743
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,480
Well, what about Hard Rock or Portofino?

1744
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:58,860
Totally booked.

1745
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:03,040
And I'm like, it is, we went in early November.

1746
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,760
Well, I'm sure this is gonna be booked solid.

1747
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,620
I'm just curious what it'll cost.

1748
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,240
The ones across the street also look very fun.

1749
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:12,780
Yeah.

1750
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:16,580
The reflective and the space screen windows.

1751
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,100
Seeing how crazy Disney got so fast

1752
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,580
with all their top hotels, I'm like,

1753
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:25,420
they could probably charge something like 1,000 a night.

1754
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,980
But I also wonder if they'll try to not,

1755
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,120
so that they don't get into Disney territory.

1756
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:30,720
At least not right away.

1757
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:33,680
I mean, I think probably it would book up at 1,000 a night

1758
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,660
if it's only got 500 rooms, especially opening

1759
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:37,700
like the first year or two.

1760
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,700
So I wonder what they'll do, what strategy they'll take.

1761
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:41,540
I don't know.

1762
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,020
I don't know.

1763
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:44,220
Jake D, let's just do this quick.

1764
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,340
Which land are y'all going to first when you get there?

1765
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,280
Oh, that's a good question.

1766
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,820
It's interesting, we haven't talked about,

1767
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,680
cause like the idea with this place is that you cannot go

1768
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,420
from land to land once you're in one of the lands.

1769
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,440
You have to go in and out the same way.

1770
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,120
Oh, I see.

1771
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,180
There's no like transition from land.

1772
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,440
So you have to come back out into Celestial Park.

1773
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,180
You fully go explore over there.

1774
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,640
Right, which I've heard is like easy

1775
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,500
if somebody wants to just buy Super Nintendo,

1776
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,940
like a company wants to buy Nintendo land for the night.

1777
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,900
That's cool, you can fully just section off that.

1778
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,740
So yeah, so like for corporate events,

1779
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,580
you can just buy pieces of it and it's easier

1780
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:23,980
and you don't have to watch as many people coming in and out.

1781
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:26,940
Monsters, the answer is monsters.

1782
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,080
The answer is probably monsters,

1783
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,280
but wouldn't you maybe want to save dessert for last?

1784
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:37,700
So maybe I go to the Burke, I'll Burke first.

1785
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,800
Or are you like Jason and you save dessert

1786
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,960
for every meal?

1787
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,660
Dessert components for every beverage.

1788
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,380
I just go to the lighters all day.

1789
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,900
Homer with the rotting sandwich green over the garbage can,

1790
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,620
but it's just me with like small bites

1791
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:56,360
of like two some hanging on.

1792
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,920
I don't want to let go of chocolate bread.

1793
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,040
Oh wait, to that end, Kate Mollo,

1794
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,920
which land does Jason think will have

1795
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,140
the best treats and snacks?

1796
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,940
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1797
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,880
That is a great question.

1798
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,280
I think I know the answer to this.

1799
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,000
Do you?

1800
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,460
Cause now I'm thinking about this.

1801
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:19,720
I think it might be Celestial Park.

1802
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,220
Cause they have like moonshots.

1803
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:22,260
What are we talking about?

1804
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:22,860
What's it called?

1805
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:23,960
Like a bakery or something?

1806
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,660
The sweets, the candy shop,

1807
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,020
like right at the entrance.

1808
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,640
Maybe even outside if you look at the art.

1809
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,940
I was just gonna say like Harry Potter ends up having

1810
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:38,020
seemingly the best sweets I feel like in the park.

1811
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,660
The most variety.

1812
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:40,740
Yeah, I guess so.

1813
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,260
Like the ice cream in Diagon Alley is just really good.

1814
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:47,120
But it does seem like Celestial Park is gonna be,

1815
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,140
like they're thinking of that in a Main Street way of,

1816
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,320
that's where the stuff is.

1817
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,900
That's where the relaxing stuff for the grownups is.

1818
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:57,860
Some table service, some quick service,

1819
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,540
some stuff that was left out of that video.

1820
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:04,160
Alicia Estella's, I believe most recent video,

1821
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,520
she's like, okay there's a restaurant coming,

1822
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,580
or two restaurants maybe.

1823
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,620
One Mexican, one Italian.

1824
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,960
And then there's another that I think is not on the

1825
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,200
concept art cause it's just like ground being broken.

1826
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:20,280
Oh okay, gotcha.

1827
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,400
I will say for all the Nintendo complaints,

1828
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:25,760
I think Nintendo treats have been pretty good.

1829
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:26,520
They've seen that good.

1830
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,900
I think there's new ones just introduced around here.

1831
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,400
I think there's a whole separate cafe there.

1832
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:37,160
For this one, you guys are gonna have to open your email.

1833
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,380
I've sent you something because this comes from Kevin Tully.

1834
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,280
What's up Kevin?

1835
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:47,240
Please rank the portal towers, beacons, spires,

1836
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,540
whatever they call them, from least favorite

1837
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:50,880
to most favorite.

1838
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:51,900
At least first.

1839
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,200
This is a very good question.

1840
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,520
Because yeah, they are all, all right,

1841
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,460
so there's the unified premise of these big circular tubes

1842
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,700
that take you into the lands.

1843
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:06,380
So it's all, and there's like one round kind of icon

1844
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,420
up at the top.

1845
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,640
And then yes, they have these spires that kind of

1846
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,640
thematically introduce you to what you're gonna be getting

1847
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,180
once you're through the portal that represent their IP

1848
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:20,500
but that also blend in with the celestial park around it.

1849
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,440
I've got an order in my head, but do you wanna,

1850
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:25,960
should I go or do you guys have a?

1851
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:26,500
You go first.

1852
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,120
You go ahead.

1853
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:27,700
I think I know.

1854
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:31,360
From least favorite to, and I'm trying to not do this

1855
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,320
based on like property, I'm really trying to judge

1856
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,600
the spires themselves.

1857
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:35,800
That's what I'm doing as well, yes.

1858
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,480
And not bring my feelings about the IP into it.

1859
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,440
However, gotta say Potter is last.

1860
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:43,600
Ultimately, that's just, that's a big pillar.

1861
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,640
It's gonna be, it's a cool look, it's gonna be cool.

1862
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:47,980
But it's like it's a hand with a wand.

1863
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:48,840
Least good, I agree.

1864
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:49,740
Fine, whatever.

1865
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,260
Dragon is third and I like this.

1866
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,220
This is kind of a, yeah, I don't know,

1867
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,780
this is kind of some mystical mixed with some like

1868
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,980
Disney Discovery Land kind of feel.

1869
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:05,340
And then also around it too, there's like either greenery

1870
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:08,960
or like around that one are hills kind of terraced

1871
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,260
in a very like Disneyland Paris castle way.

1872
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,940
So I think that's good.

1873
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,700
Nintendo is too, love those pipes and the flower

1874
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,560
and the coin and stars shooting out of them.

1875
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,020
And Dark Universe is, that's what I think.

1876
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,000
Awesome, awesome.

1877
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,980
Zappin' lights, gonna be so cool at night.

1878
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,560
Yeah, that is true.

1879
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,680
Anybody disagree with that order?

1880
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:39,780
I personally, I would probably swap, and this is just me,

1881
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,080
but I would probably put Dragon at two

1882
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,040
because I like those hills.

1883
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:51,440
And that portal, it's got a little bit of Lost Continent

1884
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,040
Port of Entry flavor that I hope.

1885
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:53,720
Oh, right.

1886
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:54,580
Yeah, yeah.

1887
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:57,080
So, no shade to Mario.

1888
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,440
I'm loving Nintendo stuff recently.

1889
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,200
That's a really good entry.

1890
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,880
Oh, and it says, here we go on it.

1891
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,160
There's little inscriptions too.

1892
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,420
I don't think we can read all of them.

1893
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,380
Here we go might be my favorite part of that.

1894
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,500
Yeah, I miss, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1895
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,920
That makes me wanna notch it up even,

1896
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:13,500
but I think it's Monsters still.

1897
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:18,000
Is that my, wait, let me skim through these.

1898
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,920
Oh, important one from Nard.

1899
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,160
If the park is underperforming in its early days,

1900
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,300
could we see the Sacred Hearts band coming in to save it

1901
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,560
like they saved DCA?

1902
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,400
Nard is, of course, referring to when

1903
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,660
California Adventure opened in kind of an underwhelming

1904
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,000
fashion, they had to plug in some stuff, some concerts.

1905
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:36,780
The Beach Boys were drafted.

1906
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,400
Mike Love was called into service, and not long after,

1907
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,760
the second best band to the Mike Love Beach Boys,

1908
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,480
Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts.

1909
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,920
I say don't even wait, just have them play the opening.

1910
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,620
Get the Belushi spirit, get everybody dancing,

1911
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:54,040
because if this is about where the heavens meet the earth,

1912
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,020
what's more heavenly than the pipes of Jim Belushi?

1913
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,380
Can he wear a Mario outfit?

1914
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,260
Can he wear the overalls or something

1915
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,200
while he's performing?

1916
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,620
Yeah, I think he's gotta wear the overalls and the hat.

1917
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,380
He pops up out of, Jim Belushi pops up out of a pipe,

1918
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,480
and he's like, I'm a soul man.

1919
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,940
Here we go!

1920
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:12,360
Sweet.

1921
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,720
It's a me, the Belouche!

1922
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,020
What if he gets it wrong?

1923
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,900
What if he yells, here we are?

1924
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:22,500
Here we are!

1925
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,040
People will forgive him.

1926
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:24,420
OK.

1927
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,160
Here, we're gonna do it!

1928
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,060
Is there a musical venue for Celestial Park

1929
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:30,960
for bands in the 90s to play?

1930
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,680
Oh, that's an important question in any universal planning.

1931
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:35,940
I don't know.

1932
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:40,300
Can you put a stage out in the lagoon?

1933
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,940
Marty Graum moves to Celestial Park.

1934
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:43,660
Yeah, OK.

1935
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:47,160
Sugar Ray 311, you know?

1936
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,060
But should it be like…

1937
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,160
Beats Bad Foodie Daddy, they all get in there.

1938
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,860
Could you do another flavor, like, spacer 90s music,

1939
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,620
or more electronic 90s music?

1940
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,740
Like the real McCoy or something?

1941
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:01,520
Oh, I'm in now.

1942
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:01,920
Yeah.

1943
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,580
That sounds great.

1944
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,140
But even like Aqua.

1945
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:05,440
Yeah, yeah.

1946
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:06,420
Aqua.

1947
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:07,420
Yeah, what's the band that did like…

1948
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,140
Saving town, six underground.

1949
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,940
Oh, yeah, I don't know.

1950
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,060
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1951
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,740
I'd like if they play, I'd be there if they play.

1952
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:16,720
Hataway, you know?

1953
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,240
Just any sort of like electronic or dance music from the 90s.

1954
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,100
Doesn't have to, yeah.

1955
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:23,060
Sugar Ray, keep Sugar Ray at City Walk.

1956
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,740
But a different flavor of 90s.

1957
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,240
Sure.

1958
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,580
Should be playing at Celestial Park, I believe.

1959
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:29,460
OK, OK.

1960
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:32,300
So still, yes, still kind of out of it music.

1961
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:32,600
But let's…

1962
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:33,800
Yes.

1963
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:35,840
Theme it a little bit.

1964
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,800
I don't know, sneaker pimps?

1965
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,540
OK, all right, OK.

1966
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,340
I'm not sure exactly.

1967
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,020
I'm calibrating what kind of music.

1968
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,700
No, we're just doing, yeah, we're just doing brainstorm here.

1969
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,060
Yeah.

1970
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:48,420
Well, I think that's the bulk of it.

1971
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:53,160
Also, the big Kronos tower that showed up, it had a poem on it.

1972
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,160
Bethy pointed that out.

1973
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:54,620
Oh, wow.

1974
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,000
I was mailed a box with a poem.

1975
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,660
Let's hear this.

1976
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,220
Nice note to go out on.

1977
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:06,260
With sun and moon, the stars and time, the Kronos spins and worlds align.

1978
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,840
For if you seek the curious heart, your compass true and stars to chart.

1979
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:16,260
Beyond this gate, find gardens green and epic worlds to fill your dreams.

1980
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,420
Wow, that's good.

1981
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,320
Yeah, it's good.

1982
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:22,260
I like I like where they're headed with this.

1983
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,740
I like the it's fully it's fully embracing magic.

1984
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,280
They're coming for Disney.

1985
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,140
They're coming for Mickey's snoot.

1986
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:34,780
They're rubbing Mickey's snoot in the dirt with all this stuff.

1987
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:36,060
Yanking him by the snoot.

1988
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,800
They're yanking Mickey by the snoot.

1989
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,520
And shoving it in their big circles.

1990
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:44,560
Disney is going to build the Tiana ride and then do nothing.

1991
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,860
Nothing else for.

1992
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:46,200
Yeah.

1993
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:51,740
But who knows what lies beyond frontier land, not the houses,

1994
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,000
but in front of the woods.

1995
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:57,480
Who knows we could do bulldozing these woods?

1996
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,240
That's true.

1997
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:03,660
So this D23, you say something, say something specific.

1998
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:04,640
I don't know.

1999
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:09,600
Yahoo and The Washington Post had an article the day that this all drove

2000
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,940
like here's what Universal this is Universal's press today,

2001
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,260
but this is incredible new park.

2002
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,000
On the other side, this article,

2003
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,320
Disney trips are so complicated now that you need a class to plan one.

2004
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,140
Yeah, it's not wrong.

2005
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:30,200
And there's just there's so like, look, the company is not in great shape right now,

2006
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,520
but there also is just an enormous amount of hubris from Disney.

2007
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,600
That this is this thing going to change.

2008
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,540
We've got the foot.

2009
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:40,320
Whenever we need to remind people where they belong, we've got the footage of

2010
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,260
what and the map.

2011
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:41,720
Yeah.

2012
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,740
What point of the map?

2013
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,360
Tell me it all began with a mouse.

2014
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:44,800
Yeah.

2015
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,720
So walking along the empty orange groves.

2016
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,220
They'll they'll fall in line.

2017
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:49,540
Why?

2018
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:50,680
They'll fall in line.

2019
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:51,880
That is a stupid poem.

2020
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,640
Who said that?

2021
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,100
Who said it all started with a mouse?

2022
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,320
Well, fucking Disney.

2023
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:55,980
That's who.

2024
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:56,700
You know what?

2025
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:56,940
Me.

2026
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,260
You're you're insolent.

2027
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,760
You're you're fighting against us.

2028
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,300
Universal, we're coming with both barrels.

2029
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:06,280
Eternals, too.

2030
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,620
This whole vibe, this epic universe vibe is very eternal.

2031
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,340
And it is very about it.

2032
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:15,120
Maybe there's a lawsuit.

2033
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,420
That's how they strike back is with a lawsuit.

2034
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,300
That's true.

2035
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,920
Yeah, they could get them.

2036
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:23,900
And then they but then they own then they own that park and it all becomes Kingo land.

2037
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,620
Oh, yeah.

2038
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,380
Well, Bob Iger, probably he's just meters away from us.

2039
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:31,440
He probably heard that and he will now sue.

2040
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:32,100
Yeah.

2041
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:32,480
Yeah.

2042
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,160
Universal, you start you'd better get in fighting shape.

2043
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,940
You getting as good a shape as Kumail because we're coming for you.

2044
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:39,760
Yeah.

2045
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:40,340
Mm hmm.

2046
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,360
Be begging for that Frankenstein.

2047
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,100
Reanimate, reanimate.

2048
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,940
And if we get done with you,

2049
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:49,160
you'll be undead soon.

2050
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:52,300
Well, hey, exciting stuff.

2051
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,860
Thanks for bearing with our little delay so we could talk about it.

2052
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:56,500
You survived podcast the ride.

2053
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,180
Thanks for subscribing to the second portal.

2054
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:02,520
Let's let's now go out of the portal

2055
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,100
and back into the the main.

2056
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,340
If you want to join us on the main portal tomorrow,

2057

a long overdue return of a beloved guest.

2058
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,240
And you're going to get that ad free if you bump it up to our VIP

2059
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,300
Patreon tier club three,

2060
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:22,000
which also includes one more bonus episode every month, which you help select.

2061
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:27,700
All every one of these tiers is like the heavens and earth

2062
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,040
you will find.

2063
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,360
So obviously, the higher up you go, the closer and closer you get to

2064
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,620
the heavens, the heavens, multiple heavens.

2065
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:37,340
Club three is really where you're going to feel those heavens.

2066
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:38,780
So, yeah, do it.
