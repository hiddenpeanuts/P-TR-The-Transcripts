00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:29,440
Is

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:48,360
Welcome to podcast the ride the theme park podcast hosted by three guys you just had

4
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,040
a rip roaring pre-show argument about who is which country bear joining us.

5
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,800
I'm well I'm Scott Gardner and Jason Sheridan's here.

6
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,200
Mike Carlson is here.

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,160
That wasn't going to be the lion but I figure we might as well acknowledge it because if

8
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,000
it's real you've just the episode that you've just started is a podcast the ride post office

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,920
and hopefully somewhere on our Instagram or Twitter you've seen a logo in which were depicted

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,320
in small world form and we started talking about well if we were depicted as other theme

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,360
park characters right who would we be and we were we couldn't figure out country bears

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,160
exactly but some strong opinions were had yeah I mean we've on the podcast talked about

13
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,760
what we would name our children if they were all country bears but we have yet to talk

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,840
about who we are as country bears so it was a little bit rendered in a t-shirt or a yeah

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,960
just art on the on the Twitter I mean the audience now is of course yelling names of

16
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,440
country bears that they think we are so we'll just say what like I was saying Scott should

17
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,560
probably be Wendell I was saying I could probably be Henry or liver lips and then Jason wants

18
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,280
to be big Al it feels like but I said no he should not be big Al he should be the little

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:11,280
bear which I can't the little bear represents my like the vibe and mental state much more

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,840
sure oh sure yeah like the desperately grasping a teddy bear yeah you're not a big Al type

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,420
in real life I would never say you're a big Al type no I mean I'm slovenly well that's

22
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,360
fair yes but a very clean I pride myself on being well how clear are their types in general

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,160
well I think that you for sure get a sense of their character via the song they choose

24
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,600
and the way they perform so like Henry is of course like a very kind of like oh he's

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,400
a little stuffy and he wants to make sure the show goes right Henry is the I don't know

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,440
the country bears that well Henry is the host Henry is the host yeah he's got the raccoon

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,360
in his hat yes his raccoon tag and he kind of like chuckles like nervously when something

28
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,200
goes off the rails or when something's a little blue is that is that you I guess do I chuckle

29
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,880
when we go a little blue as you chuckle nervously as you ask I guess I'm like Henry so there

30
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,240
you go there's the proof what do we know about Wendell's personality Wendell is like seems

31
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:14,480
like a madman to me oh that's Scott big time yeah I could you maybe we're all Henry really

32
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,360
we're all I mean I'm a nervous laffer that's for sure okay so I feel like a Henry maybe

33
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,000
you're that maybe I'm Henry I sort of I don't know I'm not like the host I guess but I try

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,640
to be the guy who explains things such as if I try to talk to the people in the audience

35
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,240
who don't know every right bear by heart well Henry's trying to keep the show on the rails

36
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,680
so I guess there is some truth to that that would make sense to me mm-hmm I'm trying

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:50,520
to think other the the Sunbonnet trio well we all secretly want to be the Sunbonnet tree

38
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,160
what and if that makes sense because there's a there's a it's a trio obviously and there's

39
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,920
three of us and really the Sunbonnet trio I'll be very honest their game is that they're

40
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,880
all horny they're all looking for a man we all have low t though so that's not us oh

41
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,440
I don't agree with that Jason is a Jason honestly has bragged to me about having a high T before

42
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,680
he thinks he has high testosterone I am talking about I am all three of the horny bears so

43
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,160
maybe you're more Sunbonnet or you have as much testosterone as the three horny girl

44
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,760
bears that's what you're saying I was just trying to gauge like horny don't back off

45
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,520
of it that's what you was horny not it was hornyness not testosterone yes okay yeah

46
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,520
all right it is getting confusing yeah I did I am glad you you did use that joke though

47
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,160
because that feels very fitting for like the the mailbag the first post office episode

48
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,200
because it's like a rush overnight letter we had that conversation and seconds or a

49
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:01,720
minute later sure it became odd audio content for everyone to enjoy well people's ears yes

50
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,120
it feels good to be to be doing material as fast as the post office can turn it out no

51
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,480
better speed metaphor I do like that you know sometimes we end up having episodes in the

52
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,880
bank for a long time and it is nice to be able to to do stuff a little bit quicker with

53
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:29,000
hot off the wire theme park news sure as well as news for us and in our in our personal

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,840
win or within the world of the show which to that end we have an announcement yeah this

55
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,720
is the very first episode that is being released on our new podcast network yeah we did it

56
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,880
guys we have a podcast network again it's forever dog forever dog we're on forever dog

57
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,600
about it feels like a weird announcement to make because we're it's not as if we're surrounded

58
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,760
by forever dog people no yeah right now we're not recording it in a new place we're still

59
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:03,680
in the living room so it's it's feels hypothetical however we we are very excited about this

60
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,820
and I think I think it's gonna be a great arrangement they seem very excited about having

61
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,840
us on board and I think they are going to help take care of some logistical things that'll

62
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:23,080
let us focus on delivering pure raw great theme park rambles yeah yeah after week that

63
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,840
five minutes about which of country bear are we is they're gonna it's gonna be even better

64
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,480
yeah we're on forever dog because we're gonna be able to focus we're really gonna be able

65
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,880
to pinpoint which country bear each of us are exactly what Jason's testosterone level

66
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,440
is and does it compare to any of the other country bears we're gonna be able to do so

67
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,200
much better for you guys on forever dogs all excited forever dogs forever dog also features

68
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,000
podcasts such as teen creeps which your girlfriend Lindsay does true yes very good and and and

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,800
and lost culture East as with past guest Matt Rogers who was a lot of fun so we're we're

70
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,880
in the company of some some great fun podcast yeah yeah yeah for for young Jason sake if

71
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,560
you had told me when I was a kid like oh you will be on a podcast network with one of the

72
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,040
kids in the hall Kevin McDonald has a show on forever dog my favorite kid in the hall

73
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:25,560
I love being Kevin yeah I remember like an acting class where we had to like I was when

74
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,960
I was a freshman in high school and they're like do all right everyone find a monologue

75
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,600
to bring in next week and going to is it believe kids fan org oh yeah they had transcripts

76
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:43,920
of the hall monologues and I think we had to do it and then do it again like later so

77
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,800
I think I started with the Kevin McDonald monologue where he talks about like hitting

78
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,880
his head like go falling over his bin trying to get a bunch of mail and then hitting his

79
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,800
head but it has so many cutaways it didn't make sense oh that's right yeah yeah oh but

80
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,880
you tried to do that I tried to do it on stage just me and then I ended up changing to a

81
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,920
letter to the guy I clotheslined as he rode by on his bicycle oh okay fully monologue

82
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:17,040
okay okay wow wow I had a did at a in front of like hundreds of people at a Boy Scout

83
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,200
Jamboree for like the talent show you're trying to be all subversive and prove your cool taste

84
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,640
well also we didn't realize we had to have something and I was like well I did this for

85
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,960
an acting class a few weeks ago I still remember it so your talent was a kids in the hall monologue

86
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,920
that's pretty fun hey let's wait let's tie it together can you can we name the kids in

87
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,480
the hall theme park appearances because there's a few couple of them oh well Dave Foley on

88
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,000
tough to be a bug right on and some other I think yeah somewhere else in the soon to

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,560
be departed bugs at California Adventure but the other one oh Kevin McDonald in Stitch

90
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,760
is great right I assume there was original dialogue done for that he's does sound like

91
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,240
his character in the right does sound like him mm-hmm yeah I think I think he did new

92
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:26,400
stuff for that so the yeah kids and all representing in the finest theme park attraction but wait

93
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,200
now I'm thinking about the other is there I'm thinking about mr. show and isn't there

a John Ennis appearance oh yeah John Ennis is in I think we maybe talked about this in

96
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:51,880
yeah yeah yeah and obviously Tom Kenny the voice of Spongebob in all of those odd regional

97
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,360
Spongebob there's I think there's like 19 Spongebob theme park attractions all oh yeah

98

119
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:09,120
into the right cast the right waters for the first time right and some very complex storytelling

120
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:17,600
awaits in the city walk saga this is it this is a 19 part series yes no joke to begin yes

121
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,800
that actually people laugh when I told them about it and they go haha and then I go no

122
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,400
we it's 19 there's 19 of them well you're the original when you first pitched it it

123
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,120
was if we did an episode about city walk and we said part one of 19 yes and then that was

124
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,880
obviously not going to be true and then it slowly just became true yeah let it wash over

125
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:48,440
us and it is true now I'm very exhausted but but happily so I mean I don't want to get

126
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:56,160
into that we're not done doing work no no no no yeah a lot and it was essentially our

127
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,720
summer vacation this is just may as well be called city walk saga our summer vacation

128
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,740
how I spent my summer vacation at the end of the day we will have done more hours on

129
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:15,560
city walk than like the best rides at any of these theme parks yeah and because there

130
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:23,480
are very few themed attractions yo very almost nothing you would quantify as an attraction

131
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,720
would you count Zen zone the Aqua massages as a that almost is somehow that's somehow

132
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:37,080
closer to a ride to me yeah if you were to theme Zen zone to an IP maybe I could see

133
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,800
it being an attraction but other than that it's just sort of us I guess a service if

134
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,880
it was like themed to seems like a water world seems like a missed opportunity for water

135
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,000
world or to me for whatever reason I first think of when they load mr. Spock's corpse

136
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,120
into a photon torpedo at the end of Star Trek wrath of Khan or you could pretend you're

137
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,160
in the you're one of the Superman villains trapped oh that's good the Phantom Zone the

138
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:10,760
Phantom Zone right or you could be young Kal-El in the rocket rocket yeah for whatever and

139
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,120
then you can you have to explain away why you're getting massaged by water but whatever

140
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,980
there's a gotta be some sort of imaginary way to justify pods Universal released the

141
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:27,440
eat prey love movie you could also go that angle what do you mean oh I see like you're

142
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,880
just having a nice weekend new well starting a new you're getting your age in your life

143
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:38,760
you're getting your groove back and you're relaxing and I see yeah you could do it more

144
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,160
on the nose like like it could be like a Stella got her groove back yeah themed extra attraction

145
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:52,760
would people on the internet be upset with the anti IP crowd be furious to see the original

146
00:14:52,760 --> 00:15:01,840
story of Zen zone yeah co-opted by the monsters behind the love franchise petitions to get

147
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:08,680
rid of the you pray love overlay return it to its former glory of the Zen zone it's just

148
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,160
a cheap quick they just they know they slapped a coat of paint on it and they expect me to

149
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:22,320
pay more now the purity of the Zen zone experience destroyed anyway if you liked that there's

150
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:31,200
a lot more stuff like that coming up and I wonder what what do what's the response of

151
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:38,160
the audience who are not in Hollywood or LA who have not been to LA who now get to hear

152
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:45,400
19 episodes but every excruciating detail yeah I'd like to think that we brought City

153
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:52,640
Walk to life yeah in an audio fashion and there's gonna be a glut of Twitter ancillary

154
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,440
content during this time and that'll help you know make it a multi-dimensional experience

155
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,000
right but I don't know does this shut out the people not lucky enough to be within the

156
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,320
zone of City Walk Hollywood oh I don't think so yeah I think we're bringing it to them

157
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,760
you're right we're providing a service yeah we're shoving 65 stores and restaurants straight

158
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,220
into their ears yeah our listeners like if they're not in California or Florida they

159
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,000
are aware of City Walk they know what downtown Disney is they know what a weird mall is outside

160
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,440
these theme parks maybe they don't have as much they probably don't because they don't

161
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,000
live around here in Florida they don't have as much time to just waste over at a weird

162
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,240
mall that's right out that's hard to get to and it's expensive to park like horrible parking

163
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,360
situation yes we'll get into yes so yeah but we know we have a lot of time to waste we

164
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,280
know a lot of people who have created who who don't have time to this people with children

165
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:59,240
and children on the way who have taken important valuable time to sit around with us hours

166
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,680
and hours of time with us but the bonus like to all this like you know you know if you

167
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,880
have Amazon Prime you get all this bonus crap with you know you get like you get all the

168
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,160
streaming stuff and you get the the free blending books the ebooks and all that crap I don't

169
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,240
know anything about that continue so but the bonus with the City Walk is you get to listen

170
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,440
to three men in their 30s stare into the gaping mall of madness and will they come out the

171
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:38,200
other side like changed and broken or who will they just come out like a few hundred

172
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:45,860
dollars poorer each I mean that's probably true yeah I think both yeah not to no spoilers

173
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,640
but yes that yeah but also maybe just with a better stronger appreciation for this wonderful

174
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:58,920
place yeah that's really what I'm thinking and a desire to eat better and treat yourself

175
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:07,440
better and not jam buka de beppo and maybe what I've taken out of it so far is I need

176
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,400
a diet with less fried calamari and I'm gonna try to get to that as soon as we're done that's

177
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,320
lightly because the official flag of City Walk is just a chunk of fried calamari the

178
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:29,000
tentacles flapping in the wind yeah also the city bird bird bird city fish Jesus Christ

179
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,360
is the official bird and losing my mind already fried calamari which Ludo is still furious

180
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,800
about oh yeah Ludo of Ludo bird is still come on it's not even a bird why can it not be

181
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:51,480
my bird Ludo heavy French accent oh oh is that okay yes heavy that's so heavy I couldn't

182
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,200
even tell what it was yeah you need some we'll try to put subtitles on that part of the podcast

183
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,600
somehow well so that's that's news going on in our world but before we start getting into

184
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,080
some some letters that that y'all have sent there's very important news and theme park

185
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,760
world to report and Jason I'll throw it to you sure yeah you know you guys know me I

186
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,240
am probably the biggest as Matt Rogers had called himself and I would call myself the

187
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,240
same the biggest universal Stan among the three of us Stan about what's still like big

188
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,040
fans of something what does it come from what is it oh he comes from the Eminem song Stan

189
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,520
oh it does yeah no no the original version of it but it now just means like super like

190
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,240
the years about stands on the internet yeah dear Stan and Stan is an obsessive fan who

191
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,840
you want to be a Stan Stan kills the original etymology but now it just means more like

192
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,200
people who are really into like still don't care for it hearthstone or Ariana Grande and

193
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,960
stuff anyway this is a big tangent already no thank you I didn't know what it meant what

194
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,680
nice news for Ariana Grande that she's got a lot of stands waiting around yeah yeah actually

195
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,760
I'm Davidson looks like Stan with the dyed blonde hair is does look like Stan he looks

196
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:18,640
exactly like I would go ahead he's gonna kill her I would go and call her him the biggest

197
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:28,320
Ariana Grande Stan I'm the biggest Stan once he gets the tattoo yeah so some big news out

198
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,080
of Universal this summer a lot of media coverage you know a lot of people were down there for

199
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:39,240
this I think we all know what I'm talking about folks the wimpy's hamburger stand at

200
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:47,440
islands of adventure reopened this summer for the first time in years wow so now you're

201
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,360
probably you are probably expecting me for a long time yeah I'm sure listeners were

202
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,640
probably like oh he's talking about the Aventura Hotel Universal's latest move in an attempt

203
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,760
to slowly turn all of Orlando into hotels range hotels sure I don't think anyone was

204
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,720
thinking about the Aventura Hotel I was not I the host of the theme park podcast show

205
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,040
I have no thoughts about Aventura well that's the only other news out of universal this

206
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,840
summer so well there is news that they're possibly starting to build a fourth park yeah

207
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:27,160
that's true I mean it's not a track they filed some permits to expand a road down there fantastic

208
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,240
worlds but whatever doesn't matter let's focus on the here and now focus on this character

209
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:40,560
that wimpy's I mean everyone knows wimpy from Popeye oh everyone knows everyone knows him

210
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,280
and I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today and this is one of the seven different

211
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,400
old-timey cartoon characters we've compared you to on the episode of islands of adventure

212
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:59,920
yes I a dear friend that I admire and this hamburger stand it's very charming it's not

213
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,920
super like themed it's just a little cute cute little how long was it closed when did

214
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:11,360
they close it I am honestly not sure and I am not sure if it was ever open I believe

215
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,440
it you know it would have been open right when it first opened and then I'm gonna do

216
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,160
some may have went seasonal but it has so it's like its its origins are in question

217
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,520
and it's been dark for a long time for a long time it's almost like this the wimpy's hamburger

218
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:33,680
stand is the hat box ghost of islands of adventure yes long rumored long dreamed about by fans

219
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,280
copious fan art but only now do we finally get to experience it or like a sizable chunk

220
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,780
of future world and Epcot oh yeah yeah remember when I had rides and stuff in it yeah body

221
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:52,200
world what sorry what are you wife and the the restaurant right at the edge of future

222
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,280
world I'll see so when these hamburgers stand reopened for this summer and honestly I was

223
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,880
having trouble seeing if it was even still open because we're into as we record this

224
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,720
we've hit the slow a slower season for theme parks until the Halloween season kicks into

225
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:20,240
full gear so and I the thing I thought was interesting about this is just how if I'm

226
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,120
being nice I'll say unique if I'm being a little more critical how odd this menu was

227
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,320
so that's as mean as you get when you're talking about wimpy's hamburger stand yeah because

228
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,240
I don't want to hurt his feelings so brother through time what are you looking at of course

229
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,840
you're looking at hamburgers you got your bacon cheeseburger you got your specialty

230
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:47,520
burger which is a spinach special sauce topped with a sunny side up egg which is a very

231
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,680
odd combination wait repeat that again spinach special sauce surprise thousand island huh

232
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:58,640
topped with a sunny side up egg you mean this just seems excessive no it's just a lot of

233
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,560
disparate elements because the spinach would be weird ye spinach and thousand island and

234
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:11,560
the sunny side up egg I mean I guess the spinach Popeye you know oh oh so then it makes perfect

235
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,520
sense it makes sense I'm just thinking about eating that it seems like a lot going on and

236
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,000
then of course you got a footlong hot dog onion sauerkraut jalapenos that is an interesting

237
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,760
combination of hot dog toppings and then what do you want for the vegetarians of course

238
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,800
a grilled fish pita blackened cod lettuce caramelized onions pineapple salsa with a

239
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:39,040
vegetarian menu yeah pescatarian pescatarian there's not a vegetarian option at wimpy's

240
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,200
that would be insane well there is a caprese salad and a fruit plate okay and then all

241
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,600
of the combos are served with fries and a milkshake so like you got a milkshake coming

242
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,580
in oh so everything in wimpy's has a milkshake it comes with a milkshake I'm sure there

243
00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,920
is a non milkshake suggested option it's cramped this milkshake and this is injected

244
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:06,960
into the bun this is a new menu what we yes so this is a like is the spinach egg thing

245
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,280
new do you know yeah I mean that that I think is like new a egg on a burger uh while a popular

246
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,460
regional delicacy in upstate and central New York you've never there's a plenty of burgers

247
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,920
with eggs on them out here yeah but yeah there is now but I feel like you see that until

248
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,320
a few years that that is like a food trend now you put an egg I feel like is it mcdonald's

249
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,040
been around for over five oh I don't know if they did one of those like I feel like

250
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:42,680
it's it's hitting critical mass like sriracha or you know cronut that sort of right um

251
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:50,200
is it like now new I don't know what your like maybe a decade ago of the egg was having

252
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,320
I do think the egg is not as recent as you think it is I guess so but that's like in

253
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,280
Los Angeles like I feel like I've got an egg on a burger at a pub like eight years ago

254
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,040
on Ventura somewhere yeah again but this is a major metropolitan center if you went to

255
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,760
the middle of the country would you see that I bet there's like diners are you more likely

256
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,400
to see it because it's like a big rich thing uh I think you're more likely to see it at

257
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,120
a boot at an LA bougie hamburger place it's not like it's kale even though kale's still

258
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,880
like a joke thing like for like the Midwest oh cool you're gonna put kale on it or something

259
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,080
like my dad also be like okay oh hummus like that's to me a little bit more even hummus

260
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,760
yeah yeah we're talking dads here this is dad stuff I guess my dad understands a big

261
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,040
fried egg on a big piece of beef he gets that that makes sense to him I don't know if he'd

262
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,160
have it but I don't think he's gonna go oh yuck but if I eat like pita chips with hummus

263
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,760
well what are you talking about what is this my dad doesn't I took him to a Thai restaurant

264
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,000
one time and ever since then it's been like you know if we want to go out to dinner like

265
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,760
well let's go get you know let's get some get some real food not no rat tail stew or

266
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,360
you know my dad is a pigeon-eye pie let's not do I like that they're all like witch

267
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:15,840
like witches foods he thinks that all Thai chefs are witches they've achieved this food

268
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,480
through voodoo yeah food you would put in a big cauldron my dad does not like the joke

269
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,720
when I go yeah let's just go somewhere so dad can get a grilled cheese sandwich he gets

270
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:34,160
very cranky about that joke I think if I could if I could kind of interpret in a therapist

271
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,180
manner and think one step ahead for you I think maybe what you're reacting to with these

272
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:45,880
menu items is that if you're taking wimpy's ideal of the perfect burger what it should

273
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,920
be is plain no cheese no sauce no lettuce the meat and the bun and there should be three

274
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,200
steam lines coming out of it and it should be unadorned well otherwise traditionally

275
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,120
yeah there'd probably be some horse meat in there too if we're talking real wimpy depression

276
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,680
error yeah the 30s okay but I actually think wimpy now a more progressive modern wimpy

277
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,880
would probably be open to experimental hamburgs my larger point wimpy into the 21st century

278
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,160
isn't he stuck sort of in his time there's been no like modern wimpy yeah that's like

279
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:25,560
making that's like a 2018 Austin Powers there's no such thing he's just a 60s guy I think

280
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,120
he would be interesting if we brought wimpy to the modern day and took him to like umami

281
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,080
burger or something he'd be like oh what interesting hamburger developments I think that's exactly

282
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,280
what you said when we went to umami for the first time I think that's right so I think

283
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,520
we're sitting here talking to the I would also like I if any of our wonderful uh artist

284
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:53,280
listeners uh which are all 2018 well wimpy dabbing that would be terrific choked on my

285
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,800
drink yeah I'd be curious how wimpy's clothing is changed does he just just still dress the

286
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,400
same or is it kind of maybe it's like skinny tie or I think yeah I don't think wimpy's

287
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:10,040
spending a lot on clothing yeah but he could be like a kind of a like a thrift store guy

288
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,000
who can find a nice can put a nice outfit together with cheap like with cheap clothes

289
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,960
oh I think that yeah that's probably accurate because like jughead like wimpy to me was

290
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,280
always like uh an older jughead it was a very similar character like oh just obsessed with

291
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:31,320
food pretty asexual but the cw they took jughead and jughead is sexy now and brooding and brooding

292
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:40,120
so oh so maybe what we want to see is a river daleified pop-eye universe oh just in general

293
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,960
I mean I don't want to make this assignment so so big that people put it off and don't

294
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,720
get it done let's just let's you know start with a wimpy and see where your brain goes

295
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,560
yeah that's that sounds smart and then if you want to move on to poop deck pappy poop

296
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:02,480
deck pappy sweepy and poppy poppies father yeah yeah yeah that's that's his name um jason

297
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,800
character favorite character in fiction poop deck pappy yeah uh but big picture view I

298
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:13,440
think uh when I was in universal last summer there was like a standover in lost continent

299
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:20,240
uh and the the combination there are combos one of the oddest things but I liked it that

300
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,360
I had ever had uh you got a euro you got a lamb and beef euro you got a side of hummus

301
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:33,080
and carrots and then you got a slice of apple pie so kind of strange or or a brookie that

302
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,200
was the one thing I noticed at universal last summer half uh cookie half brownie oh they

303
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,160
were pushing that everywhere at universal like last year uh last time I was there so

304
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,160
my bigger picture is I'm thinking ahead to this new universal park I think they need

305
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,920
to ramp up their food offerings okay like the thing I like about this menu is like there

306
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:01,560
is some variety in it more than just like basic hamburger basic hot dog veggie burger

307
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:07,880
like just throw it at you it tends to be the case at the Florida parks more than the California

308
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,240
parks although up until recently universal Hollywood's food offerings were pretty rough

309
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:21,320
yes so uh my my assignment to any universal creatives listening get amp on this food program

310
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,440
it's not for universal park but it's not universal creatives problem because we've talked about

311
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,400
this before what's gonna happen is they're gonna come up with some amazing dishes some

312
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:35,920
amazing cool stuff it's gonna be open for three weeks and none of it's gonna sell dads

313
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,480
are gonna go who's this hummus or what is this uh rat-tailed uh stew here like what

314
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,880
is it and then they're gonna go it's not selling we gotta just throw a chicken sandwich

315
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,920
on there right you say that but the harry potter menus are pretty much unchanged they

316
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:54,360
swap stuff in and out every now and then the avatar menus the avatar is the anomaly the

317
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,580
avatar you're right the avatar is the anomaly the new areas you know maybe give you license

318
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:05,780
to it's like part of the world's to do something a little more unusual what's um I mean presumably

319
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:11,840
it seems like the rumor is that Mario is gonna be saved for yes universal park super Nintendo

320
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:19,080
what do we get in what does Mario eat does he mushrooms of course certainly mushrooms

321
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,840
so you got some I mean obviously some like portobello mushroom burgers but then we want

322
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,360
to I want to see those bright and bold I want to see them red with white spots I think they

323
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,400
should have like tell you have giant turkey legs giant mushrooms that you can eat so they

324
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:39,040
have whatever antibiotics not or whatever growth hormone they put into the turkey leg

325
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,680
put into the mushroom fields and let's get some giant mushrooms going you order it just

326
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:49,440
at a counter but then to retrieve it you have to jump up hit a box with your head and then

327
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,480
catch it as it slides over to the right and they grease the bottom of the mushroom up

328
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,720
so it slides very easily so it's like slippery out of your hand so it takes a little while

329
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,800
to grab it don't catch it you don't eat doesn't matter that doesn't matter yeah yeah that's

330
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,720
your responsibility that's fun mm-hmm yeah so there's an idea get the figure out those

331
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,960
those launching boxes Star Trek would be Star Trek people eat oh my god fully whatever they

332
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,640
want they have a replicator that can replicate any dish that was ever made they just tell

333
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,840
the computer obviously there's gonna you're gonna have to get if if this is a rumor of

334
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,000
course more I think Nintendo land for sure is going in that third part okay Star Trek

335
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,840
is a rumor going in this I hadn't heard that third park huh I don't know if that would

336
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,960
be the case you'll have to be able to get Picard's tea order Earl Grey hot oh perfect

337
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,800
for your old grey hot is what Picard famously would always drink sure so you'll be able

338
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,840
to go up to a machine and get a hot tea in the middle of the summer you know what I saw

339
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,800
at the boardwalk in Jersey this summer a lot of Stan selling like stands stands oh no stay

340
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:04,880
away selling stuff with dry ice in it like drinks kind of bubbling with dry ice didn't

341
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,920
they Star Trek bar quarks I will quarks bar had some like dry ice they had it in Vegas

342
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,880
the quarks bar so yes you could do they could make like a Romulan ale or something which

343
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:21,840
is like the illegal alcohol drink in the universe it's so potent I guess is why Romulan ale

344
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,240
was illegal but other than that you know they all they all can eat what they want from any

345
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,160
time in the past because it's the 23rd or 24th century depending on what show you're

346
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:37,400
talking about hmm you think the new park will have an area devoted to Eminem and all of

347
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,760
the characters in his songs in the musical world you could you could visit the purple

348
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:50,800
hills oh yeah from the the D12 song picture with Stan get all his alter egos the little

349
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,720
all of G unit be present that's are they part of yeah I guess yeah they're related 50 cent

350
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,240
is sort of oh I'm sorry I'm yeah mixing it up he's the part of the expanded lineup like

351
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:07,080
the Disneyland big five or is that right it's big five they wouldn't be part of the but

352
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,440
on like bigger carrot photo opportunity days yeah you'd probably get G unit around big

353
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:20,240
plush headed Eminem D12 right I guess Dr. Dre yeah you have to because he's like the Walt

354
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:29,280
Disney of Eminem mm-hmm and all those characters does that make Eminem Mickey it knows well

355
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,980
wait what do you mean yeah he's Mickey well in this universe he's I'm thinking but though

356
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
in dr.

357
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:39,440
Dre's career the first person he produced are you thinking about opening it up to where

358
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,720
it's a Dre land well that's what now yes that's why I bristled at it initially and then the

359
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,840
Walt partners statue is dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine of course Jimmy Ivy is absolutely then on

360
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:58,000
the statue yeah but I mean like this some ride where you get to go around in giant beats

361
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,680
headphones and yeah well the everything beats stamped upon everything even though they sold

362
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,320
to Apple though so yeah so I guess Apple has to have a presence too yeah oh maybe this

363
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,040
will give Eminem a chance to finally have he could turn into a themed attraction he

364
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:20,120
was supposed to start a remake of have gun will travel that's true yeah he was attached

365
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:26,160
to that I forget whether it was a TV show or a movie and it just never happened hmm

366
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,880
it's too bad classic Western have gone will travel so Eminem's so Eminem's going into

367
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,360
the fourth park and then going into the fourth yep all right Mario Star Trek Eminem the world

368
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,080
of Eminem the world of Eminem you'll get to see Eminem's face in a planter like Mickey

369
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:50,000
yes flowers forming Eminem's head and there'll be like a phantasmag style show called the

378
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,520
is the opening shot of the next generation of Universal yeah yeah JK Rowling and the

379
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,280
visionaries like JK Rowling and Eminem will take universal into the next take a seat take

00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:10,040
sure sure okay well one more bit of news before we get into your question let's continue to

382
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,360
make this about us before we make it about the audience this has always been about us

383
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:21,960
oh yeah oh no no no certainly but what what podcast is very yeah exactly prerogative but

384
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,880
when it hey when it when it comes to the world of me something big news pretty big it happened

385
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,180
then if you follow us on on Twitter then you know about it already but in the wake of the

386
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:42,040
Tony Baxter live show interview and all of his encouragement I didn't want to let him

387
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:48,800
down I wanted to make good on the promise and I have now been on splash mountain wow

388
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:57,400
congratulations and I did it now in 18 years yeah or 17 18 something like that yeah I think

389
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:04,600
I went in high school one time I think didn't enjoy the experience and so I gave it a go

390
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:12,840
now I knew like I thought there's a couple ways to do this either I could make this podcast

391
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:20,120
content and then I'd be knee deep into Scott goes to splash mountain episode five right

392
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:25,800
which is what we wanted oh yeah yeah yeah and I and I I knew if I cut I could cut that

393
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:34,960
off at the pass with but because here's the genuinely I was freaked out enough to where

394
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,480
I don't think it would have been funny to record unless I'm just not aware I think I

395
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,840
was just like weird and sullen kind of like in the couple hours leading up to it did you

396
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,680
know like was it a day like you were like knew you were gonna do it or was it the day

397
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,920
of you were like I'm gonna do it and then you kind of got freaked out I I had a feeling

398
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,560
before I went down and then we had a plot look we were down at the Aaron and I were

399
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:07,320
down at the 94 7 the wave Sunday Sunday jazz brunch at Spaghetti Bar and Grill and Seal

400
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,040
Beach we'd spent the night in Orange County in order to catch some great live jazz and

401
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,400
eat some great to eat a great seafood buffet and we had a great time so I was riding high

402
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:24,920
on mimosas went to Disneyland renewed the pass I haven't been in six months and you

403
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,400
know so I was riding high having a nice little little morning buzz and it was you know easier

404
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,160
to say then than when it wears off and it because we got the max pass for the the end

405
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:43,960
of the day so as those hours are ticking up you know it the dread was forming for sure

406
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,840
right to where like I was enthusiastic about it at two but by seven rolling around like

407
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,440
oh am I actually and Aaron keeps trying to give me the outs you know you don't you don't

408
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,400
have to you don't know these people anything sure like no but I do this has to happen I

409
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:10,000
it just it it felt like that had to be the time post Tony right but I will I will say

410
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:18,960
it will like I truly what there there was more nervous bathroom time spent then probably

411
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,960
in in a day in a decade of me so more than more than like going out to perform a live

412
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,880
show more than any of that ever more than an audition of some kind yes that's what I'm

413
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,400
saying my like I feel very lucky I feel like my nerves kind of got worked out of me in

414
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,320
terms of like really being wrecked by stuff you know in the somewhere between 2010 and

415
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:49,040
2012 and truly I have not had this much like nervous body activity in I wasn't that nervous

416
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:56,680
to to meet Tony himself and to talk to him I was not like freaking out or nervous stomach

417
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,880
but to go on the fucking ride which I've been I've done it and it's not that bad right

418
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:10,600
but serious I've just built it up so I think just now the the just so much time has passed

419
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,720
and I do think something as we unlocked when we on our episode about it I think earnest

420
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,760
goes to Splash Mountain is really responsible yeah I made it more mentally terrifying which

421
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,600
you say you were as nervous as say like a freestyle rapper in Detroit about to take

422
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:33,000
the stage your arms are heavy palms sweaty arms are sweaty potentially sounds like yes

423
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,960
exactly right absolutely mom you were the white rabbit uh-huh rabbit rabbit his name

424
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:46,580
was rabbit oh his name was just right yeah the white rabbit his name was rabbit right

425
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,400
yeah is he called quite the white I mean he is white he's a white man yeah I'm assuming

426
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:58,880
they were that came from that nickname yeah you ever have just one moment to go on a log

427
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:06,480
flume ride to keep your arms and legs in the vehicle sir please hurry up a line is forming

428
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:14,120
you better flume yourself a little girl is clowning on your ass I'm seeing B rabbit rapper

429
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:21,200
B rabbit Eminem and eight mile mm-hmm okay anyway yeah this was my lose yourself moment

430
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,360
absolutely I mean the walk like walk it getting into the line was one thing to actually I

431
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:32,800
read I'm stepping in and doing it huh and then get at like being in the getting into

432
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,680
the vehicle and it taking off Aaron was very much like you did it you're in yours even

433
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:44,840
just getting in was it was a big deal and and I seriously do blame earnest because I

434
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:52,520
when I when you round a corner and you see that that loading zone I had all these like

435
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,880
these flashbacks to this was that the most stressful part of it it was like right before

436
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,700
you got on or was it right before the drop um no you know what by that because by then

437
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:09,120
there was no choice right obviously it's it's gonna happen you've been dropped and I and

438
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:15,180
I had fun you know what I was worried about is that if the first one would like affected

439
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:21,440
me bad if I was scared of the first little drop then I knew I was screwed but I but that's

440
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,320
that was a ton of fun the second one's a ton of fun and I remembered that going on that

441
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,840
whenever I went on it before the first one was a little much oh really weak little 15

442
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:37,520
year old me so I knew that I figured that the last one would be fine but getting in

443
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,200
the log is one big thing getting in the actually entering the line was one thing it was so

444
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,160
you you went in easily it wasn't like trying to put like a cat in a bathtub to watch like

445
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,040
you were like your feet were on the sides and they were trying to like two workers were

446
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:57,800
pushing you down forcing you into this log flume oh boy yeah that's too close to home

447
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,060
for me and Aaron has Aaron has a scar from that very oh sure that very situation bathing

448
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:08,880
Edwin the podcast ride show dog is very tough for me he doesn't have the legs with to do

449
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,360
that on the tub I do the same when you bathe me sure you that's just a joke you know when

450
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:21,360
I bathe you you go in very peacefully and you like it yeah I slowly lie down you actually

451
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,040
have to get me like my head out of the water because I'm lying down like I was like in

452
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,880
a coffin I just put your dish next to the tub and you have some water and you're fine

453
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,880
for it every time logically I know it's a trick but yeah you have enjoyed relaxing three

454
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,800
and a half hour tub nap mm-hmm no that it was all fine although you know this this also

455
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,440
another part of the reason I haven't been on it a long time is that Aaron Aaron had

456
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:54,400
not been on it in a decade either right because she she's fine with the drops but she is not

457
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,300
fine with theme park water dirty she does not go to water parks she's never been on

458
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,580
grizzly river rapids she is and she tries to avoid splash man although she likes the

459
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:13,680
ride a lot but she considers all these things giant Petri dishes sure and whereas I had

460
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,280
a fun experience and realized oh this is a great ride and I should have conquered my

461
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,400
fears long ago and made this part of my regular ride vernacular I don't think Aaron learned

462
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,840
anything I don't think going on the ride made her any more comfortable with being splashed

463
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:33,720
by dirty water so you know I don't know that I'm gonna be constantly going on but anyways

464
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,520
it was tense for both both of us were kind of grumbly right about it because she knew

465
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:47,240
what was and the first drop she got splashed so I just absolutely so so that was a real

466
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:54,760
evil okay which I did because we talked about it on the podcast I didn't get tricked by

467
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,800
that bear butt because that's kind of that's the idea is that you're looking up at that

468
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:06,720
and laughing going hey like Jason and then you look at that but caught off guard but

469
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,560
no by the time and the actual the drop was great it's fun it's fun as hell I was determined

470
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:19,680
that I'm gonna like because I was like laughing and enjoying it on the way down I went to

471
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,560
my laughing place and I thought well the photo will reflect that but the photo if you saw

472
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,920
it on her Twitter I look terrified as shit it's like me and dinosaur I thought I was

473
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,280
like I'm doing good and then I took a look at it and I was like cowering in fear I hate

474
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,060
it's so funny what's what can be in your head versus physical reality but I did I did enjoy

475
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:49,200
it a lot and I and the the feeling of euphoria after I was truly deeply excited and to get

476
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,080
what you had made a major step you had done nothing yeah that one that one loomed large

477
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:00,520
and it makes me think maybe there is some more room for me to try some other stuff and

478
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:09,680
to start going on rides that I did go on years ago but that you know but now I haven't been

479
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,200
on in a long time because of because my my wife is nice it doesn't make sure but you

480
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,960
know that's what's so funny about all this is like you know I should do in credit coaster

481
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,480
I'll do in credit coaster you've done screaming yeah I did you did I did it twice in the day

482
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:32,880
oh yeah that I did or 15 whenever my college girlfriend Jenna was you know held the bar

483
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,360
higher was a little more demanding sure so thus I did in that day the first time I ever

484
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:44,920
went to California venture I did do tower terror I did Malibu and I did California twice

485
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,440
yeah yeah I never did that was horrible that I would never I think I yeah look same as

486
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:56,320
Dr. Dooms Fearful same thing I'm not doing an ad what never done Dr. Dooms the story

487
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:04,440
about Dr. Doom needing your fear I know Dr. Dooms Fear Juice store now you're right look

488
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,360
now that I'm a theme park journalists maybe I got to go on these and you got to do stamp

489
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:15,960
because that is I mean that's a whole nother episode of universal needing to you know the

490
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,760
when they build this new park the express lines you got to make sure to get the story

491
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,120
in there because the kind of cut off some of the story to do a little better a little

492
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,600
better but not but not I'm sorry you lose a lot of the fun stuff if you go fast pass

493
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:34,280
so so yes well look I you know I'm not I'm not gonna start declaring that I'm going

494
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:41,440
on everything but I feel more open I feel I've I have not disproven no launch queen

495
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:48,960
no no I've but my own mental no splash queen I feel over I believe I am over it and next

496
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:55,800
time what I what I guess what I am right now still if you're quantifying things in queendom

497
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:02,040
I still am a no look queen because I I did close my eyes though time next time I will

498
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:07,680
look I will okay I will have a less embarrassing photograph right and I will go next time we're

499
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,440
all there together I will know all right I'll be excited to do it can I and this might be

500
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:18,660
putting the cart before the horse if you had a next ride to conquer we're gonna tease the

501
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:23,320
audience a little bit about that what do you think of all the rides you go well that one

502
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:30,080
less severe than the next one I'm thinking about doing a tower I'm thinking about doing

503
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:35,880
the California Screamin or I'm still not I don't know towers tough towers do you think

504
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,880
towers the biggest maybe could maybe that's the one to keep building although I did it

505
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:48,960
I did it one time right like I did I derive no pleasure from that which is but you know

506
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,160
part of the having Splash Mountain be off limits for so long was stupid because the

507
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,960
rest of it is such a blast I feel you can get over the one it's exactly what Tony said

508
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,480
it's your you're scared for 10 minutes but then you get three minutes of pure pleasure

509
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:11,120
and let me tell you he was right on I lived it that yeah I enjoyed that showboat sequence

510
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,840
more than any note with all of the build up now and that the man himself blessed this

511
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:21,760
journey and he was right it was great but tower terror I don't know I guess I do want

512
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,560
to experience guardians well because they did do at least they added like old pop songs

513
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,520
yes sure like they're trying to lure you a little bit like hey we got some old songs

514
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:38,800
on here we got Benatar if you want to hear some Benatar in a way besides on Jack FM there

515
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,320
is a way they play what they want they might not even hear it and they don't want it and

516
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:50,040
Guardians drops you how they want yeah we want how we want they I mean truly the universe

517
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:55,800
was like we'll add some pop songs and a robot mm-hmm it wasn't a robot before either in

518
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,240
the show I would like to see that guy you got to see that robot yeah I don't know maybe

519
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,560
we get to tower so boy but I'm just look we reset it no I know I'm just saying in the

520
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,640
future is it or is it rock and roller coaster is that the next oh I you know I think I could

521
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,160
do rock and roller cuz you think that might be the easiest next step yeah is this that

522
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,640
launch as opposed to screaming you know really this is a question for the next Florida visit

523
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:26,520
sure fair enough cuz I because there will be a lot we I should try to get more on the

524
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:31,800
table what else you know what I've never done Expedition Everest oh fantastic yeah great

525
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:38,000
no one does not seem how are the drops on that thing pretty I would like a slightly

526
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,520
heightened big Thunder Mountain yeah there's there's one you go backwards okay and it's

527
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,120
a little like you get a little in your stomach but it's not that bad and you really can't

528
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,520
tell it's backwards cuz it's all in the dark I though have never been I have not been in

529
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,240
Animal Kingdom while that's been open right so I'm not avoiding I love I'm not avoiding

530
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:05,120
expedition well I'll hit that but I don't know the I think whenever a Florida trip occurs

531
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,720
yeah let's try to rock and rollers is maybe a good one yeah cuz I need to I need to see

532
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:16,400
Steven Tyler's new hand first of all is his new hand and as on lewd hand and as the radio

533
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:23,040
DJ says check out his new hat check out Steven Tyler's new hat I do got to see the hat and

534
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,480
if enduring a roller coaster is what it takes then I will do it and that has many different

535
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:35,760
Aerosmith songs you can hear too so oh boy well now we are in Xanadu weren't but no jaded

536
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,000
the best there was a song we have established bummer on that I think maybe playing in the

537
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,920
gift shop but yeah okay thank you but not you know you know what's my bigger thing you're

538
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,880
I you know we I don't think we've we haven't recorded a ton since the live show with Tony

539
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,840
and he talks about that 12 year old self thing keeping your 12 year old self alive and I

540
00:53:53,840 --> 00:54:00,000
what I what is funny to me is that I felt like with this experience I did flash right

541
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:07,760
back to 12 year old self I am as scared as a 12 year old like how often in your 30s do

542
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,360
you get to be like like genuinely freaked by an experience often you get to go I did

543
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:21,280
it wow I crowbarred off layers and layers of irony built up like sediment to reveal

544
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,720
this 12 year old that's how it felt if it was on my Instagram but I don't think I I

545
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,680
don't know if I put it on the Twitter but I'll post along with this I have my the photo

546
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:36,160
of me right after and it looks like me I'm in the same pose that I was in like pictures

547
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,900
of me at 10 years old in an Indiana Jones Halloween costume if there is zero irony in

548
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,960
how I looked having conquered Splash Mountain it felt great and you know what I was doing

549
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,680
way better than earnest was sure he was acting like it wasn't a big deal on the way up he

550
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,160
was kicking back he said wish I'd run a book but then after the thing he was freaked and

551
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:04,120
he fell backwards into the log not me I did it with flying colors and so I'm way better

552
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:09,620
than earnest I was not scared stupid it's got yours hashtag better than earn better

553
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:14,300
than earnest yeah let's get that no launch Queen out of here and get a much cooler hatch

554
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:19,680
that could be both yeah it can be both it can be both but I also speak it tying it all

555
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:26,320
together I need to do the I need now to do the launch coaster with the voice of earnest

556
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,880
oh yeah I guess it's not what he does his voice is not on it but he originated right

557
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,400
link dog so that'll really be the test of if I'm better than earnest hmm maybe that

558
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:43,960
is the coaster for children you mean the ultimate test will be this this coaster that looks

559
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:51,200
like a child's toy all right congratulations thank you I feel great and now that we've

560
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,400
talked for an hour or so all right let's get to some of your questions if we have to hey

561
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:05,080
the pod podcast the ride post office is open is open all right well let's start it off

562
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:17,360
with a letter from was a letter huh was it a letter digital oh I see a mess friend of

563
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,760
the show Kia Burton writes in oh hey I'm an LA local and I go to Disneyland and Universal

564
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,760
Studios Hollywood a lot right now I am planning my first ever trip to Orlando scheduled for

565
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,480
early February I have six full days there total and I'm thinking in general that means

566
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,240
one day for each Disney park and one day for each Universal park excluding the water parks

567
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:42,680
hmm I know this is not enough time Scott is wrong but it's the most time I can get away

568
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:48,040
from work please help me figure out how to best allocate my limited time which ride should

569
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:53,120
I structure my day around which words are potentially skippable during a short trip

570
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,960
should I still buy or should I still buy park hopper tickets for Disney should I go back

571
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:03,900
and forth within a day which parks should I go to on the weekdays versus which parks

572
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,560
are most manageable yeah one question wow this is insane first of all Jason you had

573
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:17,560
to prep us for this because this is a project for me I know I know I still have advice restaurants

574
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,680
that are essential should I stay on property basic stuff I know we weren't gonna hit all

575
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,160
of this but other listeners have also written in with itineraries I think I thought some

576
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,440
basic suggestions about like marquee rides at each park maybe a restaurant sure sure

577
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,680
well here's here's what okay so she has six days six and a half days yeah and then she's

578
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:41,920
thinking hit them four main parks and the two universal parks so I'm gonna start off

579
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,440
by saying I think park hoppers would be a wise investment do you oh I completely agree

580
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,040
park hopping is the way to do it that's one of my favorite things to do you go somewhere

581
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,800
at night you go somewhere in the morning yeah I'm don't go nuts with it and go to like all

582
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,880
four parks in a day because then you're wasting so much travel times transit transit wise

583
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,960
but yeah like what I will say but what's good about park hopper and if you're staying I

584
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,640
don't know if she's staying on site at Disney the thing to do is check the extra magic hours

585
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,280
of course yeah because sometimes they have the park open if you're staying on site an

586
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,440
hour or two early hour too late so you figure out that's how I would that's my first recommendation

587
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:23,240
if you're doing that structure your day versus like if Epcot is now open like two extra hours

588
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,400
just for people that are at the hotels you do Epcot that night or and then you do if

589
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,560
there was a in the morning Magic Kingdom was open and you do it then so like that's how

590
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:36,880
I think you first start structuring your day is just looking at the basic hours for the

591
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,720
park and then addition seeing what the extra magic hours are let's do I want to get into

592
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:48,520
some like into some Sophie's choices yes yeah what with that limited time frame you try

593
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:54,840
to hit all of the parks and I think you can yeah what do you condense what doesn't get

594
00:58:54,840 --> 00:59:04,960
the full day in order to give time to other things I think at this point Hollywood studios

595
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:12,480
you could probably hit the marquee events and have a decent meal there and then go to

596
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:19,440
marquee rides you mean yeah marquee rides and then I eat it what do you decent meal

597
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:27,240
at mg I well they got the cafe that's okay well hold on hold on because there are a lot

598
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,280
of the restaurants have not closed at Hollywood Studios so like mom Melrose is like wood-fired

599
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:37,520
Italian my family always like that but also like for theme stuff you had the 50s primetime

600
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:45,760
diner you got the sci-fi dying so there's a lot of that but I think a lot of adults

601
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:51,160
really enjoy Epcot so I would give Epcot a little extra time that's why I'm saying you

602
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:58,000
try to do Hollywood Studios in half a day right down the way he a good friend of my

603
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,800
wife and I yeah she's she's got to do as much Epcot as possible no one her yeah it's got

604
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,400
to be a lot of it's here my honestly my recommendation you spend a lot of time in Epcot you spend

605
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,760
a lot of time in animal kingdom I think animal kingdom is great as an adult I was really

606
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,380
like this place is cool it's very themed it's like it's like two or three rides away from

607
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:22,160
being like killer but it's great it's fantastic and now I have a tar land is very cool those

608
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:28,040
rides are great so yeah I think you're your focus is Epcot and animal kingdom do you crunch

609
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,080
a magic kingdom a little bit because it's a lot of stuff you know that's yes that's

610
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:36,280
sort of that's a great point yeah you go on you go and see go on the old rickety space

611
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,960
mountain you go on pirate or no well yeah pirates you can but it's sort of better here

612
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,760
you go on jungle cruise for sure because jungle cruise is better in Florida than it is out

613
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,720
here there's an extra little scene and there's I like it so much more you're missing the

614
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:54,200
big two carousel of progress and people move her you don't have those if we're talking

615
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,640
big two country bears has to be in that the country bears is the greatest show in theme

616
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:04,440
park history you gotta see country bears I love the GD country bears and that's not

617
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,640
ironic at all it's fantastic I should leave a self censorship was not ironic at all no

618
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,840
because I was wanted to be so pure when I was making that comment so so magic kingdom

619
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:18,800
yeah there's a lot of stuff that is out here very similar yeah you know you skip for sure

620
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:24,360
you're like you know you're you're you're astro blasters yeah all that don't do even

621
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:31,940
out of you know morbid curiosity I'd say don't do a Stitch's great escape I would say train

622
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:36,800
don't do the topia but you got it yeah carousel of progress people mover country bears the

623
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,720
stuff we don't have any more yeah and you gotta see our president at the Hall of Presidents

624
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:46,520
oh for sure that's very and there's a great Muppet show a live Muppet show they do every

625
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:52,000
hour ish outside of that that I really think oh yeah people speak very highly of ten minutes

626
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,520
and you get to see real puppets and it's great mm-hmm yeah I would say I would say do you

627
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,520
need to eat at Magic Kingdom do you need to I mean if you're gonna eat a fast a crappy

628
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,800
fast service go to sunny eclipse go to cosmic oh yeah you gotta at least walk in and see

629
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:13,720
sunny and see a song or two oh you definitely do but that way can we do really quickly explain

630
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:19,720
not everybody she might not know sunny eclipse any clips a piano playing lounge lizard space

631
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:24,680
creature yes plays in this Tomorrowland restaurant it's not the restaurant isn't cosmic rays

632
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:31,760
is it cosmic rays star like okay okay stunning eclipse is the the act he's the man yeah yeah

633
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,520
just do a quick meal there and catch the Sony eclipse show you got to yeah or we had a drink

634
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,700
and just walk in and sit down in front because generally the place is not packed like I feel

635
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:45,920
it should be anytime I've been in there in the last couple years it's huge yes it is

636
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,880
and he's yeah so so anyway I'm saying you can get like a front row seat to see Sonny

637
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:55,720
yeah do you skip fantasy land do you skip it if you've never seen fill our magic that's

638
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:00,240
kind of fun but the screen is real blurry and like dark now but it is a fun show I think

639
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:05,920
these hours count I think seven dwarfs is great and of course if you're gonna eat a

640
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:12,040
nice meal try be our guest if you can get it or liberty tree tavern to see to do the

641
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:18,280
uh the olympic food do what I did and eat all you can eat meal um at liberty tree tavern

642
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:23,920
which is good a real solid like thanksgiving style meal so we can talk about this forever

643
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,120
I mean yeah but that may also be a day to investigate either a meal at the Polynesian

644
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:34,800
or the contemporary if you want a whole thing well that's so you get there needs to be a

645
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:41,040
little bit of hotel a little bit of which to which with six days you don't got a lot

646
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:47,880
of time for that but I but I think doing doing the the path and of grand floridian Polynesian

647
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:53,080
for sure contemporary walking around for six days that's the that's easily the one you

648
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,080
got to do because it's by magic kingdom it's on the route you know you stop in at least

649
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:02,000
trader sam's at Polynesian and you have a drink either outside or inside stopping contemporary

650
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,800
do something similar I would recommend since it's I mean this doesn't sound like a relaxing

651
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:11,000
vacation like you're gonna be no you're gonna be running and gunning that's okay so I would

652
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:19,160
say stay on site but like you know I am you probably do well at a mid-rate at your your

653
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,760
port Orleans Riverside maybe check out hard look this is a thing check out hotwire two

654
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,440
weeks before as long as you got your flight booked you can stay fairly cheaply if you

655
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:33,560
know where to look on hotwire tweet at me I will go into detail about this if you want

656
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:41,360
to know despite although also let me insert let me bring my wife and I's wine oriented

657
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:47,400
philosophy into this why must it be this way my why must it be a war I think that you can

658
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,880
like if you're willing to skip you know if you don't see a robot show you can have a

659
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,360
little more I was entering plenty of why I'm thinking of her husband I'm trying to give

660
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:04,760
him a little I don't want him to be exhausted and battered and now this now this now this

661
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:11,560
I'm all for that it's just that she said six days six parks uh-huh it's inevitable I'm

662
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:17,000
not saying you certainly have that Trader Sam's drink certainly stop in Epcot and drink

663
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,880
around the world for sure mm-hmm but it's gonna be a lot of running and gunning let's

664
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,040
be honest this is gonna have to pack a lot in yeah now the other question is what do

665
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:31,560
you just not do you just not do how about this what if you were to skip one of these

666
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:41,800
parks of all the universal don't back out do it all six what do you skip you don't you

667
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:51,520
sure you said you're wrong Jason has decided that he's gonna beat the Kobayashi Maru test

668
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:56,200
by just ignoring your question not acknowledging the rules of the game I don't know that you

669
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:02,640
I mean it seems like she's angling for like a blitz kind of I think because we poisoned

670
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:08,120
her mind and now she might have gone and had a relaxing time it's seen a couple things

671
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:12,960
but now this will be all-out war well she's been micro dosing arsenic by listening to

672
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,960
the show and once you walk off the plane at MCO that's when you drink the full thimble

673
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:25,360
of it I don't even know what to say to that I will say I will answer your question mm-hmm

674
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:31,600
and I think the answer is Universal Studios I think it is too because they have Harry

675
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:37,160
Potter out here and the new coaster is not open yet do you sing island's adventure or

676
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:47,560
main universal universal oh shoot you forgot about I got Alec yeah I mean a normal person

677
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:53,200
would probably say islands of adventure it's it's probably yeah but spider-man is there

678
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:58,040
but spider-man is there the Incredible Hulk coaster I guess it's I guess it's islands

679
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:03,520
of adventure because Diagon is so good yeah if you had to yeah skip islands of venture

680
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:09,300
even though it's a superior park to universal but Diagon is so good yeah that's the thing

681
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:14,000
you got you gotta see you gotta see you have to go to Diagon that being said it sounds

682
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,200
like she's doing everything so yeah I would say okay how about this you condense universal

683
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:25,040
into one day you rope drop universal you could do that original that's true you just see

684
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:30,480
ET and Diagon this is right train and then you do all the best thing you've ever said

685
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:36,560
on this podcast I totally agree with you if you I'm totally agree with you if that day

686
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:41,240
will be truly a running gun day because even your up cut day there's a few things to do

687
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,080
in future world and then you can have a nice leisurely stroll through world showcase by

688
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:50,040
its nature is leisurely very clearly there's not a lot yeah so just structure your day

689
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:56,520
so that you have a leisurely day stop drinking around like seven or eight don't go nuts and

690
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,400
then go well we're getting up early we're doing universal we're doing all of it because

691
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,960
you're right you can do ET don't even worry about fast and furious don't worry about the

692
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,840
rip ride rocket unless it's a very short wait and do Diagon and do you can do all of it

693
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:14,840
saying don't worry about a race through New York with Jimmy Fallon I didn't when do you

694
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:21,520
get the opportunity to smell pizza that's that's true the pizza smells are very realistic

695
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,680
all right and I'm not saying skip if you have time because maybe eating don't buy a pizza

696
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:32,520
smell the fake pizza here's how you do that when the park closes you go eat at Margaritaville

697
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:37,320
well of course and enjoy that was an I was we were assuming walk down there so but like

698
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:42,520
to weigh up it's open very late and you get to see Jimmy Buffett's plane the hemisphere

699
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:46,800
dancer which was of course famously shot up by the Jamaican government normally why he

700
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:51,320
wrote the song Jamaica mistake he was not aboard the plane at the time I believe Bono

701
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:58,320
was with some other people probably some horrible capitalist man I think Clinton had been on

702
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,960
the plane at the time Clinton's been on the hemisphere dancer are you thinking of Jeff

703
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:07,560
or maybe I think you Bono I think it was Bono sorry Jeffrey Epstein's plane also on display

704
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,760
in first floor and he's we don't know that it's not a co-ownership we don't know that

705
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:17,120
that's true that the plane is not also that's true the Epstein plane so okay so we yeah

706
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:24,000
so I think we got it I would say build in whatever in for Scott's consideration build

707
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,600
a swing day yeah halfway through the six days yeah just pace yourself is a good so that

708
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,320
way if you crash you can sleep in a little and then still hit stuff I would say have

709
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:41,400
a one meal reservation a day at a decent restaurant sure that's something that that'll help you

710
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:47,640
like slow down a little structure the day as well yeah structure the day use the max

711
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:53,000
book your fast passes ahead of time I wouldn't concern yourself too much with like weekdays

712
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:59,800
versus weekends because there's in February February is what's left of slower seasons

713
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,640
in Florida I don't know how much lower seasons there are I don't think it's particularly

714
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:14,180
busy no so I in the food area Kia is a big cheese aficionado runs the story at cheese

715
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:21,600
mongers of Sherman Oaks go check that out in the LA area Tom podcast the ride sent you

716
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,840
or do you think you're getting some quality cheese plates any at any of these properties

717
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:34,200
well I would say not universal no no Le Selye in Canada although I heard showcases probably

718
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:40,680
world showcase had some great like Canadian cheddar cheese stuff and the appetizers and

719
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:47,480
on top of a steak very delicious cheddar steak I think it was just a little where that there's

720
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:52,960
that she's soup the Canadian oh yeah it's wonderful that sounds good and France of course

721
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,400
in the French Pavilion there's gonna be cheese gotta be cheese probably California grill

722
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:04,080
you think you're gonna decent oh interesting oh I like that well that you can you can watch

723
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,400
they stop dinner service pretty much and let people out on the balcony to watch the fireworks

724
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:14,800
then you can return to your table sure so that's a nice experience yeah yeah that's

725
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:20,080
what I'm a big I'd like to vouch for the California grill atop the contemporary yeah in general

726
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:24,200
there's too much to talk about there is yeah there is a lot so but I thought this would

727
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:28,440
be a fun question talk about on the show that we have blitz through just like she's gonna

728
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:34,880
blitz through Orlando mm-hmm Kia feel free to email us follow-up question yeah true clarification

729
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:40,440
but just you know remember to breathe it's a vacation it should be fun it should be fun

730
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:45,560
and it will be fun yeah it'll be fun it'll be so fun you might need a day or so to recover

731
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:51,160
it'll be relentless though all right well that was a there was a lot for that one yeah

732
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:58,560
what else we go okay two emails Jeremiah McGuire writes specific to Disneyland what attraction

733
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,080
that has been reduced or eliminated do you miss the most or was the most poorly done

734
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:12,000
what or what current attraction do you know the question deserves to be eliminated everyone

735
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,360
said multiple questions pick one of these questions so we can get through a couple more

736
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:22,760
emails what's the most the first one what attraction has been either reduced or eliminated

737
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:28,320
that you miss the most it's country bears in Disneyland it's crazy I want that show

738
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,160
it would be perfect over there in critter country I the poo right I go on once in a

739
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:36,120
while and I've you know going to Tokyo and it's gonna we're gonna see the better version

740
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,680
of it and I'm gonna be jealous of that but country bears over there critter country I

741
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:46,000
can imagine now us going so often and just that being such a great little thing to sit

742
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,640
down in the middle of the day after you did hungry bears something that being like because

743
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:54,320
splash mountain is really you have to be in the mood for it has to be the right temperature

744
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,440
so we don't often go over to critter country unless we're sort of feeling that but if country

745
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:03,240
bears is over there we'd be over there constantly and it would be a really nice air condition

746
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:08,640
as you was it was we often talk about these shows a great place to be and I'm very sad

747
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:15,720
that it's gone people mover yeah because not that well I don't know I did I did like

748
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:22,280
the ride and with all of the 70s 80s smooth jazz that I listen to really I am chasing

749
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:29,080
the kind of music that you would hear if you were on the people mover it's just this kind

750
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:37,880
of like you know chill jet age you know zipping around a nice relaxing mod future so I did

751
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,360
like the word the people mover as a ride I liked the width that you could you know get

752
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:49,080
little tastes of the other rides going into other rides that's kind of disappearing and

753
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:53,840
it led a scaredy cat like me get a little taste of splash mountain good when you go

754
01:13:53,840 --> 01:14:00,240
through it on the train you take a little quick trip into space mountain and star tours

755
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:09,000
before you're ready on the people mover and also just pure kinetic energy that there used

756
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:16,480
to be a time where you in your same plane of view the submarines a monorail might go

757
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:22,840
by and the skyway and the people mover and the utopia cars you could get all of and a

758
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:29,960
train potentially all of these different types very different types of transportation all

759
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:35,640
running and in your same field of view so it at you know it added to the made it this

760
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:44,360
exciting hopeful future and it was full of life and what's my other oh also just pure

761
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:50,120
capacity that the people mover would eat up you know I think internally they call it the

762
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:55,660
people eater because people are you know out on that thing for 20 minutes which reduces

763
01:14:55,660 --> 01:15:00,640
the bottleneck of how many people are in tomorrowland because tomorrowland is just stroller central

764
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:06,760
now it is so awful getting in and out of there so yeah really missed that people mover and

765
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:12,200
just in anything on that track would be so wonderful to get back the one in Orlando I

766
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:18,760
was writing and I wrote it during the fireworks and I was like man this why I was I was sad

767
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:23,520
about that too and you can usually just walk right on oh yeah although the lines are getting

768
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,280
worse the lines are just line and Jim just talked about how the line there's now a line

769
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,160
for it yeah there's love for the first time in like many years now there's a regularly

770
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:37,080
a line it's not crazy but it's a line and we're gonna say oh so I was gonna say I'll

771
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:42,480
answer the current attractions you think most deserves to be eliminated and I I don't like

772
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:49,240
oh hate this hate no no this is pretty tamed but I think the Monsters Inc. ride in all

773
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:54,200
sure in California Adventure like I it will be we know it will be it will be but it's

774
01:15:54,200 --> 01:16:00,640
still go every every time we say oh it's gone it's gone like that is such a huge footprint

775
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:07,760
that ride and the sound stages around it and it's just like it's fine but there's a reason

776
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,680
they keep using that area for like temporary pop-up stuff yeah you're saying you just want

777
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:18,040
it to go away so we can get our Marvel rides yeah get get something because also too it's

778
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:24,600
like a redress of like superstar limo like oh yeah I think it was only recently I learned

779
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:30,560
like oh all the scenes are the same they just re did everything they just put a has man

780
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:36,120
suit on Drew Carey or whatever yeah it's so funny it is funny though that it's there I

781
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,000
do like that about it it's funny that it's there I don't disagree with what you're saying

782
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,080
but it is funny that that's what it is that they just were like let's put stuff over the

783
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:48,520
bad ride yeah let's just put clothes well we'll get we'll dive into it big time for sure but

784
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:53,400
I don't think that it's not egregious to me because it creates this corner that you just

785
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,680
don't go to like you write sometimes happens with you and critter country if you're in

786
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:04,160
the mood for splash mountain which I now always yeah of course I now lighter day I'm not scared

787
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:10,520
of it at all but anyway candy store back there oh yeah sure yeah sure skip that but but I

788
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,800
think in terms of egregious get it out of here in inventions have the amount of been

789
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:22,840
in the history launch bay is it open again start launch bay yeah it's a little they closed

790
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:27,360
it for a while no no still open but that's just that whole place saying it's just been

791
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:33,160
junk for so long and fun to me Chewbacca and it's fun like it doesn't but it doesn't need

792
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:42,960
a little shed when your school needed an extra classroom they would have one of those temporary

793
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:50,400
trailers yeah wait you could have one of those for Chewbacca a little bungalow yeah little

794
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:55,320
temporary star wars and the falcon or something in the future so no you're right of course

795
01:17:55,320 --> 01:18:00,080
that don't they don't need the entire entirety of interventions to meet Chewbacca I just

796
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:05,460
when I think in terms of like wasted space oh it's brutal and then that's that's kind

797
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:10,320
of all of tomorrow and but it's also you're not wrong it's not bad to have or I don't

798
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,720
like that there is this giant corner of what is increasingly one of the best theme parks

799
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:19,720
in the world that is kind of nothing but I think it's gonna get solved yeah I hope really

800
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:26,440
soon yes yeah spider-man soon hopefully okay one last question this this is a little long

801
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:33,720
but I think it's very funny so all right okay Sean Urie writes hey guys I'm a fellow childless

802
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:40,000
adult male who loves them who loves theming but hates big drops hashtag no launch queen

803
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,640
I was just good I was just recently watching a goofy movie and at two points during the

804
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:52,080
movie they are playing 20 questions both times the subject is man and the answer after only

805
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:57,720
one guess is Walt Disney this kind of metaphor for a break got me thinking about the internal

806
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:04,180
logic of a goofy movie who is Walt Disney to goofy and max do you think they recognize

807
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:09,880
him as their god and creator he must be very important to these characters if he is the

808
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:15,480
first thing that they think of every time in a game of 20 questions in one scene you

809
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:21,000
see that goofy's keychain is the Disney D logo could this be an analog for a crucifix

810
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,680
or something of that nature it seems it seems in the universe we only see different animal

811
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:33,500
characters and not any human characters which further points to Walt as being some sort

812
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:39,760
of entity that is outside of their known world my girlfriend thinks I am insane but I am

813
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:45,440
curious what your thoughts are on this theory thank you for your time wow I love that I

814
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:52,360
love that I just watched a goofy movie partially because we had Nick Mundy here and we were

815
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:57,360
talking about he crapped all over and I might veer on the side of crapping on it I haven't

816
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:01,420
seen it in a long time I found it to be a little rough and that was one of the things

817
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:09,960
that jumped out at me is the Walt Disney and also similarly I think maybe Max hits a Mickey

818
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:17,120
Mouse alarm clock oh yeah that's familiar that's his that's his dad's friend he's probably

819
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:23,800
like his godfather or something you would yeah if goofy paid the proper respect and

820
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:31,560
but here I just walked into godfather is that is he is Mickey like a godfather but in God

821
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:37,960
in this case being Walt Disney and are the characters baptized do they all have to enter

822
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:45,440
and commit to the faith and it's which is which it is I think it's easier for them to

823
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:52,320
do so you know I think it was easier for for people to believe in God you know closer to

824
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,880
the age of Christ and if Christ was a real man then there's only several generations

825
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:02,960
of people telling the story and I bet it's easier for Disney characters to believe in

826
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:09,080
the almighty Walt because some of them knew him Mickey walked with him right and when

827
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,880
there was only one set of footprints that's when Walt carrying him yeah and then when

828
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:23,720
it was down so they could pose for the partner statue I think that's I think he's correct

829
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:28,960
yeah I think he's a little something here yeah I think Sean is correct and I think

830
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:34,640
it's the only way to make heads or tails of that moment D being the crucifix I think it's

831
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:39,240
a pretty brilliant theory but it there's a whole other thing that this opens up to which

832
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:44,340
is was this a question we got or did I see people talking about this on Twitter once

833
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:53,080
with like what is Disneyland to the characters because there was Matt Mazzotti talking about

834
01:21:53,080 --> 01:22:01,400
this like the that in some like in a goofy movie goofy lives in suburbia with his son

835
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:08,320
but in other planes of reality goofy lives at Disneyland so is it that is it that thing

836
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:15,040
that Looney Tunes gets into sometimes as well where are the are these actors playing parts

837
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:20,840
but really they live really Disneyland is their Bel Air and goofy's acting in a movie

838
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:27,520
where he lives in suburbia with his son no I see the Looney Tunes it makes more sense

839
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,000
other actors because like then Wiley coyote coyote would talk in a very like professorial

840
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:38,200
way and then in his in his shorts he would be like not talking at all and I feel like

841
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:43,280
it's you in different universes with the Disney I feel like goofy movie and goof troop take

842
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:49,340
place in a different universe one where goofy and Max are not part of this Disney family

843
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:53,480
because Mickey is in the alarm clock because that doesn't make any sense I don't have an

844
01:22:53,480 --> 01:23:01,160
alarm clock of my dad's friend that would be insane that is my dad's friend Kent I don't

845
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:07,280
have that morning his big arms bizarre and like but I will say you know when there's

846
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:11,200
different universe there's you know people have theories about how there's you know infinite

847
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:17,640
number of different universes stuff starts to bleed over and kind of you know infect

848
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:22,440
other universes and it's it's all repurposed in different ways so maybe Disneyland just

849
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:27,560
exists in the goofy movie universe and Walt Disney exists but they weren't created by

850
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:34,280
him they're just people that enjoy his products like anyone but in the context of Disneyland

851
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:38,080
is a different universe and yes Walt Disney's there and they're all living in sort of the

852
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,800
Magic Kingdom and it's totally different universe I think it's different universes it's a multiverse

853
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:48,720
essentially of Disney that's what I'm saying but I think yeah in comic book terms like

854
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:54,320
goofy movie is like an else world or a what-if story yes it's like off the track of the main

855
01:23:54,320 --> 01:24:03,720
continuity but then sometimes they that reality will bleed into in Marvel speak the 616 earth

856
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:09,440
yes 616 is a Marvel universe that's proper the main one there's many different ones DC

857
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:14,720
has a much even more expansive multiverse yeah okay well this is and this has its precedent

858
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:20,000
and things like Mickey's Christmas Carol yes or the Prince and the popper yes characters

859
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:25,720
are do different yeah yeah and you know obviously Mickey doesn't all unless that is the one

860
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:31,740
true world is that Mickey is Bob Cratchit that's the 616 of the Disney universe really

861
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:37,440
is that Mickey is truly Bob Cratchit yeah I mean the real wild card in this is who framed

862
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:42,200
Roger Rabbit which combines all which is our ink combines the Warner Brothers universe

863
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:49,000
the Disney universe and our reality in theory in 40s Los Angeles and whatever the hell droopy

864
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:57,400
is from just the droopy verse yeah who owns is droopy a Harvey droopy feels like Harvey

865
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:03,520
to me but let me look it up yeah where's wimpy in all this well wimpy would be the EC Seeger

866
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:09,800
is the Seeger verse yeah the Seeger verse I don't know this one that EC Seeger was creator

867
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:16,720
of Popeye Popeye years and years a popular comic strip even well before the cartoons

868
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:23,840
and so it's a very vast mythology if you're not willing to declare that Disney is Mickey's

869
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:30,480
God will you declare that EC Seeger is wimpy's God 100% great that one is unquestioned yeah

870
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:41,400
and hamburgers are his son or his son hamburgers are the sacrament of EC Seeger's son and that's

871
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:47,600
why it's that's why they're so important right wimpy is it is him receiving the body of EC

872
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:56,040
Seeger yes and that's why EC Seeger is wimpy would be a prophet but then that means everyone

873
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:01,640
who like are trying to charge him for hamburgers that are sinners like if they're pushing that

874
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:07,480
I need the money now for the hamburger and then it's him that's so him he's being defiant

875
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:15,240
by saying I will gladly pay you Tuesday right yeah but Tuesday he means like the future

876
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:23,080
he means he means the afterlife Tuesday is I will pay you when we are when we are off

877
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:29,000
of this plane because the because you should not be worth and we should not bestow worth

878
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:35,560
on these burgers they are the body yes yeah wimpy is constantly and and the the fellowed

879
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,920
people have who have been saved are the people who give him the hammer and say you know what

880
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:44,680
don't worry about it but often wimpy's overturning the counters like Jesus turning over the tables

881
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:48,920
and the money lenders over the shop keep right of course yeah yeah yeah absolutely of Christ

882
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:54,560
because we will all meet our reward and all of them all of the hamburger money will be

883
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:02,720
paid back when we are in Seeger's heaven when we are seated at the right hand of Seeger

884
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:08,840
so that one's wrapped up Disney I'm not sure yeah I mean that's my theory because there's

885
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:14,400
no way to know for sure I will I we do know droopy is actually Hanna Barbera Tex Avery

886
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:21,480
oh juppy dog oh yeah how about that um and yet I've never had a weird general meeting

887
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:25,800
where somebody's tried to say you know with you know what's on the table is droopy droopy

888
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:33,280
we're trying to reboot droopy oh man that's a dream meeting for Jason too droopy reboot

889
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:42,360
droopy baby Huey oh baby Huey that's Harvey yeah any of them I mean we're due for a Harvey

890
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:46,720
resurgence well the whole Harvey Harvey universe that's another podcast that weird cheap Netflix

891
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:52,160
Richie Rich hot stuff the little devil yeah little dot there's little little Audrey is

892
01:27:52,160 --> 01:28:00,480
a Harvey character yeah there's a little Lada as a character as well I don't like I don't

893
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:05,560
like these characters names if I don't like the names I know I'm not gonna like the cartoons

894
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:10,240
uh well these all feel like competition for little Lulu right yeah I mean there's a lot

895
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:16,840
little yeah there were a lot of little characters in the old days so well I don't know I saw

896
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:21,080
that didn't we all right we solved it I could keep naming other Harvey characters like Jackie

897
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:28,700
Jokers or spy man or bee man or the ghostly trio or spooky the tough little ghost or Wendy

898
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:34,480
the good little witch but I don't need to do that we've said it all today I think yeah

899
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:40,440
well I mean the answer I think the I think that what I'm saying is that the Disney situation

900
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:45,600
is so much more complicated because it's such a it's such a vast and complex universe but

901
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,640
Sean you're on this on there and that is the precedent the other there might be something

902
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:55,680
there yeah thank you Sean and thank you in general for sending your your questions in

911
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:47,800
