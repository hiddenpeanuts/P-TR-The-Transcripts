1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Forever.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,540
Dog.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,660
When your town has made you frown.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,380
When your square has made you swear.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,980
When life gives you one more punch.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,060
You need a dough that's soaked in Captain Grunge.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,720
You need a place, a place to stroll.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,720
With alcohol, a place that features part of the Berlin Wall.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,700
Where seam-punk robots sell chocolate snacks.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,700
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,720
So let's go take a walk.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,780
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,700
Tonight, tonight.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,460
A daily, extremely necessary series.

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,200
Exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder.

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,400
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando.

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,100
Welcome to Podcast the Ride presents the City Walk Saga Orlando.

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,780
Multiverse of madness.

19
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,500
My name is Mike Carlson.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,000
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

21
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,500
Hi.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,700
And Scott Gardner.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,900
Happy Sunday.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,200
Happy Sunday.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,960
It's just a, it's a podcast that comes out on a Sunday when you've already,

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,200
it has already been one, the two previous days, a full week.

27
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,540
And it's not the only full weekend of podcasts coming your way.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,860
I assume you're in church right now, quietly listening to this,

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,460
hoping that like your wife or husband don't notice that you have the headphones in or the earphone,

30
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,040
like a little like Bluetooth earpiece in.

31
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,020
Just one AirPod, which I, I got AirPods a few months ago.

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,300
I have lost my left AirPod somewhere in my apartment and it's driving me crazy.

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:54,940
Have you gone?

34
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,640
Post move.

35
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,420
So it's, you know, it came with you.

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,640
And also the fine by was telling me like it is in this place,

37
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,880
but there's not enough battery to make a sound to ping it.

38
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,540
So, yeah.

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
Have you gone to church with it though recently?

40
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,720
Well, that's usually my right one.

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,860
Oh, you only bring one to church.

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,860
I bring one.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,420
So I hold the Bible with the left or the hymnal book,

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,360
hold that with the left hand.

45
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,240
And then I've got like, you know,

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,740
you insist on Isle so that nobody you're with can look down, you know, you like,

47
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,400
I'll take the, you know, I kind of like, you know,

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,020
so I can get up to the bathroom if I need to.

49
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,980
And then nobody sees that.

50
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,620
Yeah, no one sees except the offering collectors.

51
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,220
Those I got to pay them off for the rat on me.

52
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:42,440
Yeah.

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,020
I try to pull it out really quick, then give them the money, but do not give them.

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,680
You're sure you didn't know it's in the apartments.

55
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,140
You did not give it to.

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,560
I did not give it to them this time.

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:51,940
Okay.

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,320
And what are you what are you usually listening to?

59
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:54,920
Huh?

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,240
What are you usually listening to?

61
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,740
Oh, the game.

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,480
The big game.

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,540
Okay.

64
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,580
Whatever the biggest game is on.

65
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
The biggest game that's on.

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,480
Yeah.

67
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:02,740
Yeah.

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,580
We're recording this before the biggest game.

69
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,100
It hasn't happened yet.

70
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,880
And I only say that I don't say the real name of it because as with commercials,

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,180
you're not allowed to say I don't want I don't know how that applies on podcasts,

72
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,140
but I don't want any trouble.

73
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,920
Well, every game.

74
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,220
So I call it the biggest game.

75
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,860
Every game is a big game when good sportsmanship is involved.

76
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,960
That's the spirit.

77
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,100
Yeah, that is.

78
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
Yeah, that's the spirit.

79
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,300
Speaking of spirit, though, you know, we do have we're being joined by one of our favorite

80
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,520
spirits, maybe our favorites next to well, Casamigos is my favorite spirit, I would say.

81
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,840
But second is the sector keeper who is returning.

82
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,940
Boys, boys, thank you for having me back.

83
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Good to see you.

84
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,260
And the Holy Spirit.

85
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,780
Don't forget.

86
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,280
Sector keeper.

87
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
Are you with Jason and Church sort of just like in the background?

88
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:49,900
Always.

89
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,260
Yes, I go to church on Sundays with Jason.

90
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,260
We do the 10 a.

91
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,460
m.

92
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,800
Mass, sometimes the five p.

93
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:55,980
m.

94
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,060
Mass if he's sleepy.

95
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,680
Sure.

96
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,420
And then a show is in between.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,540
Oh, well, you go to both of them.

98
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:02,940
Huh?

99
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,520
Oh, wow.

100
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,780
With a long show.

101
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,280
He's break.

102
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,720
Jason calls it the double holy header.

103
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,380
Oh, wow.

104
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,880
There's two places of worship.

105
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,940
Yeah, that's nice.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,900
I didn't realize you guys were so religious.

107
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,920
Well, you know, it's good to keep in touch.

108
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,860
Something to do.

109
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,220
Keep in touch with my old pal, God.

110
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,680
Yeah, that is.

111
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,220
Have we talked about this that the sector keeper existing is proof that God exists?

112
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,440
I don't think we have.

113
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,080
We have.

114
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,820
We actually.

115
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,400
Well, wait, wait, wait.

116
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,800
Yeah, because you've been to hell and everything.

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,300
He doesn't want to go to hell.

118
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,260
That's one of the first things he told us that if we didn't complete the first city

119
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,160
walk, that his soul would burn in hell.

120
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,840
It's well, you know, it's a little more complicated that you guys have written it out here on Earth.

121
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,860
But, you know, heaven, hell, jump portals.

122
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,840
Oh, OK.

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,420
This is this is all.

124
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,240
I'm glad you're this is why I'm glad you're filling us in because the Bible left all that stuff out.

125
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,780
They like the Bible, very clean, very precise.

126
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,180
Right.

127
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,200
You're to fill us in on how the universe really works.

128
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:05,920
It came close.

129
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,740
Matthew came close to keeping it in his Bible, but he opted out.

130
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,000
So he had an editor that took it out because it was too convoluted.

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,560
And the book was Matthew's editor.

132
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,780
Oh, I know the writers of the book.

133
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,860
You've met the people who wrote the Bible.

134
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,120
It's more of a collaboration.

135
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,500
It's like a writer's room.

136
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,880
Oh, interesting.

137
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,540
So it's like a mini room or something like they have in Hollywood these days.

138
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,220
All of Jesus's work.

139
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,400
Oh, a lot of consult of the disciples were consultants, producers.

140
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,120
Right.

141
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,800
Right.

142
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,460
Yeah.

143
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,500
So they didn't get their credit.

144
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,400
They deserved no, no residuals on any of the Bibles you've read.

145
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,620
Luke and Matthew haven't seen a sin.

146
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,140
Really?

147
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,100
Oh, that's Luke's family and descendants are not profited on recent sales of the Bible.

148
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,120
No, no.

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,760
And they had a chance to renegotiate with the new when they wrote the new test.

150
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,600
Right.

151
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:04,900
Right.

152
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,620
That makes sense.

153
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,760
Unlike David Schwimmer and friends holding out for favored nations.

154
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Right.

155
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,460
Right.

156
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,200
Disciples couldn't get it together.

157
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,100
Oh, that's a bummer.

158
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,000
This is a different time too.

159
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,900
Lately, it's been kind of a more pro strike era.

160
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,100
But, you know, this is a different time.

161
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,020
This was the year 1200.

162
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,540
Those things are not friendly.

163
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,200
Right.

164
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,480
Yeah, that makes sense.

165
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,940
Well, that's that's too bad.

166
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,760
Pontius Pilate was the Zaslav of his time.

167
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,940
So we did wear like a vest, one of those big wool like kind of vest things.

168
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,540
Sunglasses.

169
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,620
He had a puffy vest.

170
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,500
Oh, he did.

171
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,940
He would wear a puffy vest.

172
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,800
Patagonia puffy vest.

173
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,240
That's what made him relatable, though.

174
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,120
He's just a regular guy.

175
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,540
Just wears a Patagonia.

176
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,340
Yeah.

177
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,600
Jason, I have to apologize.

178
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,180
Yeah.

179
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,900
You're missing AirPod.

180
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,420
Yeah.

181
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,200
I ate it.

182
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:56,980
Oh.

183
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,060
When you were watching me this weekend.

184
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,420
Yeah.

185
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,560
Wait, I was going to say I wasn't sure where things landed.

186
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,080
You ended up because you were shifting.

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,060
You maybe wanted to stay at Mike's because of his toys.

188
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,960
You ended up going home with Jason.

189
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,480
Yeah.

190
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,980
I stay with Jason most of the time.

191
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,300
Me and Garfield are tight.

192
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,500
Jason's got the best snacks.

193
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,120
Oh, yeah, that's true.

194
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,460
Because he found all those different gold like those like cookie goldfish crackers that exist.

195
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,700
Have you heard about you saw?

196
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,200
I mean, obviously you saw them, but I hadn't heard about.

197
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,540
Yeah.

198
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,240
Goldfish makes a bunch of cookies now.

199
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,740
Damn.

200
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,780
Talk about playing God.

201
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,640
Yeah, no, they're they're getting crazy with their experiments.

202
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,320
Yeah.

203
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,640
And you've had them?

204
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,740
Oh, yeah, I had a few kinds.

205
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,140
Still make my way through the elf maple flavored ones.

206
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,680
You call them.

207
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,180
Yeah, that's why the church just smells forever like maple.

208
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,900
Yeah.

209
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,940
Artifit like a real artificial maple, too.

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,260
Yeah.

211
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,920
If you get it on your hands, you're going to smell it for a while.

212
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,980
Yeah, we tried them in December and they really the smell doesn't come off your hands easy.

213
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,840
Oh, yeah.

214
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,120
Which is why which is why we found Jason licking his little fingers.

215
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:11,740
Yeah.

216
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,340
Yeah.

217
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,920
I was like what you said is purely to get the stickiness off.

218
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,600
It was not the reason.

219
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,860
Sweet maple.

220
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,520
Of course.

221
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,720
Utilitarian.

222
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,240
Yeah.

223
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,240
Father, son and Holy Spirit.

224
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,740
James Khan, Will Ferrell, so he did Chanel, you know, trying to get the beginning of that.

225
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,420
Well, James Khan is buddy.

226
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,620
The father.

227
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Father.

228
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,500
Right.

229
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,200
No, you're right.

230
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,460
Where I guess is Bob Newhart.

231
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,540
Well, no, but he's the head elf.

232
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,660
Yeah.

233
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,080
Yeah.

234
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,120
He's not in the family.

235
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,700
He's kind of the adopted father, though.

236
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,360
That's true.

237
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:46,780
Yeah.

238
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,060
Yeah.

239
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,620
Where's Scott confidence?

240
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,300
Jason, real world linear Jason's Hawaii five goldfish cookies.

241
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,460
They're in like they're fish, but they're the fish that like the boat would find.

242
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,020
Yes.

243
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,300
Yeah.

244
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,760
Scott, I assume they have like a boat.

245
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,080
Yeah, they probably have boat.

246
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,480
Hey, where's Scott confident?

247
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,440
Probably where there's a DJ booth.

248
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,100
You can get in there spinning the ones and twos.

249
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,740
You know, it's got kind of DJ.

250
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,120
I'm assuming if he's a famous guy's son, probably a DJ.

251
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
I think it's got a leap that he's got.

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,540
Scott, are you looking up if Scott Khan is a DJ?

253
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,780
Oh, wait, I'm seeing that somebody there's a rap group called the Hooligans, consisting of Scott Khan and Alan.

254
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,340
Yeah, it is.

255
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,660
That's oh, my God.

256
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,120
Wait.

257
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,520
Yes.

258
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,000
He was a rapper and a DJ.

259
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,880
He I don't know which is which.

260
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,080
It was Scott Khan and Alan Mammon.

261
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,060
And they went by Mad Skills and Mudfoot.

262
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,560
What?

263
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,800
So, yes, before even his acting fame.

264
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,340
Wow.

265
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,720
Did you have any idea about that?

266
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,500
Jason, I fully guessed.

267
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,840
He's kind of rolling the dice and open for lucky number seven.

268
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,840
They were on Tommy Boy Records.

269
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,780
They really caught the attention of Be Real from Cypress Hill.

270
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,520
Wow.

271
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,600
He's wow.

272
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,020
Geez.

273
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,920
And then he followed his father, James Khan, into a successful acting career.

274
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,960
I, geez, actually, now I'm like, maybe he's more rapper than actor.

275
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,500
Wow.

276
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,220
Look, Jason's got the glow like he just hit a grand slam, like playing a big game or something.

277
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,200
Sure.

278
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,420
Knowing that.

279
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,880
You pointed before you hit it.

280
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,480
I did.

281
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,120
Scott Khan, DJ.

282
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:21,840
Boom.

283
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,520
Right out of the park.

284
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,860
I pointed that Scott's like big head like decal of Scott Khan that he keeps on the wall.

285
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,600
Oh, yeah.

286
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,400
Fat head.

287
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,080
Yeah.

288
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,540
Fat head.

289
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,160
Fat head.

290
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,020
Excuse me.

291
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,400
Scott Khan.

292
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,180
Well, look, I'm tempted to keep looking up all this.

293
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,260
I'm seeing that maybe Scott Khan killed Action Bronson on a verse.

294
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,160
Really?

295
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,520
Maybe.

296
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,020
Yeah.

297
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,380
So now you know Scott Khan from Hawaii Five-O is a better rapper than Action Bronson.

298
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,040
But we can't get caught in all this.

299
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,440
We need to keep moving forward, figure out what the plan is.

300
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:55,960
Set your keeper.

301
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,760
Where are we going today?

302
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,580
Boys, boys, today is a very special.

303
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,360
You all right?

304
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,960
Are you okay?

305
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:03,800
Sorry.

306
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,340
My spirit phone locked and I had to open up.

307
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, I get it.

308
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,280
I get it.

309
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,340
I understand.

310
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,320
I had to reopen the time.

311
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:18,800
Boys, boys, today's phase one, sector three, waterfront kiosks south, a.

312
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:20,360
a.

313
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,300
k.

314
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,360
Emerald.

315
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,380
Oh, okay.

316
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,040
And don't get it confused with Lagasse.

317
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,300
We're all right.

318
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,400
Well, you know what?

319
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,980
Actually, that's kind of applicable here.

320
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,920
So yeah, we'll get into that.

321
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,420
Yes, yes, of course.

322
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,320
Water taxis, dancing fountains.

323
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,560
Oh, God.

324
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,120
Wait, that's a mess.

325
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,920
We should have cut that.

326
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,900
We should have cut that from the list.

327
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:45,840
Oh, NBC Sports Grill and Brew Alpha, NBC Sports Grill and Brew Omega.

328
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,380
Good luck, boys.

329
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,580
Sorry, can I back you up there?

330
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,340
Okay, so NBC Sports Grill and Brew apparently, and that's like a restaurant that's a bit

331
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,640
a couple of the city walks now.

332
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,940
But you said it twice.

333
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,600
You said, but with what were those again?

334
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,220
Oh, Alpha and Omega.

335
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,760
Okay.

336
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,980
So there's two different ones.

337
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,740
They're two different.

338
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,160
Yes.

339
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
Yes, boys, boys.

340
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,960
Don't you see this rift in the space time continuum?

341
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:20,120
These many wormholes, portals, these gates, these jump points.

342
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,880
Yes.

343
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,980
This is your first jump point, boys.

344
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,840
This is the first.

345
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,080
We're at the first jump point.

346
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:33,500
Because you see, Alpha is Orlando and Omega is City Walk Hollywood.

347
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,900
Welcome back to Tinseltown, boys.

348
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,200
Scott Cunn's waiting with the beer.

349
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,560
Well, that sounds good.

350
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,280
He's sitting in the booth at NBC Sports Grill with Al Michaels.

351
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,860
I mean, I'd be happy to walk in anywhere and see one of the hooligans with a Z.

352
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,360
But okay, wait.

353
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,300
But the, all right.

354
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,900
Look, there's locations that are, like there's an NBC Sports Grill at both of them.

355
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,280
I know, but I kind of thought maybe like, okay, so if you do one, it kind of covers both.

356
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,060
You're saying that.

357
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,860
No, no, but there's two.

358
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,020
So Alpha is the first one in Orlando and Omega, boys.

359
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,360
Oh, no, you're getting sick.

360
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,680
Oh, I'm feeling it.

361
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,120
Because we're asking.

362
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,600
Oh, oh.

363
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,540
I need a Carlton 100 menthol.

364
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,060
We're stressing him out.

365
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,060
I don't want him to keep smoking because we're asking too many questions.

366
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,000
They cost so much.

367
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,820
Jason lent me $12 just to get a peg.

368
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,440
Oh, man.

369
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,720
They are pretty expensive now.

370
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,300
Jason can't be happy about the price of cigarettes.

371
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,920
That seems like the kind of thing he'd be mad about.

372
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,040
That's right, boys.

373
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,560
But like.

374
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,540
You're starting to put it together, the puzzle.

375
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,340
You see that these are connected.

376
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,640
What ends begins, what begins ends.

377
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,600
The Alpha in Orlando, the Omega in City Walk Hollywood.

378
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,820
Right.

379
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,420
Perfect.

380
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,100
You see, there's portals, boys.

381
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,200
There's gates.

382
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,160
There's unlatched galactic fences, if you will, Scott.

383
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,980
Unlatched galactic fences.

384
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,660
Wait a minute.

385
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,100
Front doors, back doors, screen doors, boys.

386
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,360
Trap doors.

387
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,940
Oh, no.

388
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,740
Okay, okay.

389
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,700
So there's, I get it.

390
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,260
There's this bevy of all of these things that connect all of the malls and the multiverse.

391
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,640
at City Walk Hollywood again.

392
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,380
I couldn't have put it better, boys.

393
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,220
So it sounds like we have to, all the new stuff that's happened since the last saga,

394
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,900
we have to now go and rate and review.

395
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,500
You're up against dark forces grander than you could ever imagine.

396
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:36,980
Oh, man.

397
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,100
No, I know, I know.

398
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,640
But there's a lot already.

399
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,180
We also now have to go do the things in Hollywood that are, that's been a lot of years too.

400
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,460
I mean, there's not, at the same time, there's a lot.

401
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,640
Enough to add, I'm scared of how many days to this.

402
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
But then also.

403
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,180
That's adding a lot, yeah.

404
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,500
That's adding some days.

405
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,880
It's adding some days.

406
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,500
Okay.

407
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,160
Well, you know, take comfort.

408
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,480
Some behind a paywall, some not behind a paywall.

409
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Okay, well, this part I can get on board with.

410
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,940
Maybe you can make a mall in front of the paywall.

411
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,740
I don't know, Jason, what were you going to say?

412
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,560
Let's just shift over to whatever Jason's point.

413
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,800
Interesting thought, Sector Keeper, but Jason, you were saying.

414
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,760
Well, I was just up at City Walk Hollywood recently, and I was excited to see that nature was healing

415
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,780
in the sense that while the Skechers shoe store is gone,

416
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,840
there is a store selling celebrity autographed knickknacks.

417
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,480
Yes.

418
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,560
Like big gaudy frame things.

419
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
Jason's locked in, he's getting in.

420
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,520
An autographed Robert Pattinson Funko box.

421
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,980
Yes, what else, Jason?

422
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,240
Oh, there's a big Harley Quinn poster right when you're walking out of the parking garage.

423
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,860
Oh no, steam is coming out of Jason's ears when he said that.

424
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:58,620
I mean, she's outrageous in that there's a Margot Robbie and a Lady Gaga version coming.

425
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,440
I don't know if we're going to be able to handle that as a country.

426
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,720
Jason, add a third mass to Sundays because you've been bad.

427
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,860
Father, father, for Jason has sinned.

428
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:18,040
He went to Celebrity Authentics too many times to check out the Harley Quinn posters.

429
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,080
Getting a personal line of credit to buy that big poster.

430
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,780
Jason calling his credit card company.

431
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,300
I need $10,000 freed up on my credit cards.

432
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,120
You don't understand.

433
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,320
This one signed by Margot Robbie and Jared Leto.

434
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,920
Okay, sir, you have horny protection set up on your account.

435
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,260
Disable it.

436
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:54,800
No, it's just to make sure that you don't, if in case something happens, in case you ejaculate all over your new belongings, that those would be protected and replaced.

437
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,840
Very well.

438
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,040
It just makes sense.

439
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,380
Well, look at that.

440
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,800
It seems like that one we kind of covered already, right?

441
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,780
Celebrity Authentics.

442
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,820
I think we took care of it.

443
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
Kind of, sort of.

444
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,180
We'll get back to it.

445
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,200
We'll figure that out.

446
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,860
Okay, all right.

447
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,360
Well, you know what?

448
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,620
I guess the longer I complain, the longer this will take.

449
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,720
So why don't we get into the things that we know.

450
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,200
Okay, the first one was, sorry, waterfront kiosks.

451
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,200
Okay, because last time we did waterfront kiosks, North, which was Sapphire.

452
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,770
And now we are doing waterfront kiosks.

453
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,500
No way.

454
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,980
That was, yeah, okay, this is South.

455
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,560
Yeah, yeah.

456
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,100
Confusingly not an S.

457
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,580
South is Emerald?

458
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,020
Emerald.

459
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,640
Okay.

460
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,780
You know what you said at the beginning was interesting because actually not only did Emerald have a restaurant at CityWalk Orlando, Fallen Brother, but also Emerald did a week of shows.

461
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,780
Not far from where these particular waterfront kiosks are in Sector Emerald.

462
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,880
His sitcom or?

463
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,900
No, I wish.

464
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:58,480
Oh, if it was the sitcom, and let me just encourage any, like Future Club 3's, I would love to cover the Emerald sitcom very much.

465
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,740
This is just his regular cooking show, but he, you know, what was his thing?

466
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,200
Bam.

467
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,740
Bam, yeah.

468
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,740
What was Blank It Up, though?

469
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,620
Kick It Up?

470
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,520
Kick It Up a notch.

471
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,360
Kick It Up a notch.

472
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,700
Yeah.

473
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,700
He kicked it up a notch right at the beautiful CityWalk Bayfront or Lagoonfront or whatever you want to call it.

474
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,200
So that's serendipitous that you said it.

475
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,160
Yes, yes.

476
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,780
There was something in the air, a waft of spice.

477
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,620
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,120
Emerald spammy spice.

479
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,820
His trademark spice.

480
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Creole spices.

481
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,720
Yes, please, this one.

482
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,860
Just tell me about this.

483
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,720
You know, I don't have much about these.

484
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,440
I feel like I might have to kick it to you guys.

485
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,080
Do you guys have any experiences?

486
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,660
Well, I did.

487
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,880
I will say somebody stole a shirt I had made that I had a shirt made at one of the kiosks.

488
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:53,960
Stole?

489
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,040
Stole, yeah.

490
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,300
It says, I love CityWalk on it, and I just don't, I don't know where it went, but I got a shirt made.

491
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,520
It was like 20 bucks.

492
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,100
It was a very kind of graffiti style shirt.

493
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,040
What's that?

494
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,460
When?

495
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,300
When did you have it made?

496
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,880
Oh, when I was in Orlando.

497
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,080
Just, oh.

498
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,980
Recently, yeah.

499
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,580
So I just said, excuse me, can I get a shirt and like a graffiti style that says, I love CityWalk.

500
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,260
And someone stole it?

501
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,620
Yeah, somebody stole it.

502
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,400
I'm not sure who.

503
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,880
I hope we find it during the saga.

504
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,760
Hmm, okay.

505
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,780
Yeah, that's all.

506
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,880
Very curious.

507
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,500
Yeah.

508
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,240
Yeah, yeah.

509
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,780
Very curious.

510
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,640
I was going to go over and get one of those made too.

511
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,160
They're very, like, they, it's not expensive.

512
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,800
It is not, I didn't realize.

513
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,040
And the guy was really nice.

514
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,640
He seemed a little like not busy, not nothing against him.

515
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,180
It just didn't seem like this was the highest trafficked booth.

516
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,360
No voodoo donuts.

517
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,880
It was not like voodoo donuts, but they had a lot of different styles of things.

518
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,180
What were you going to get?

519
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,220
I was going to get one that said a phrase that I saw all the time at TVs at the hotel.

520
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,040
I was going to get one with blue and one it said water theme park.

521
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,280
What?

522
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,260
What does that mean?

523
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,420
Like volcano bay is the third gate at universal Orlando.

524
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,220
It's a water theme park.

525
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,480
Oh, is that what they say?

526
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,580
That's what they say.

527
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,940
I know they say it's a third gate.

528
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,560
I understand.

529
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,560
One with blue, the velociraptor or one that's in the color blue?

530
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,060
The color blue because water often looks to be the color blue.

531
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,460
I was thinking of my friend David's friend blue.

532
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,640
Yeah, I thought you might be talking about blue 32.

533
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,320
Well, yeah, we don't really want to talk about him right now.

534
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,340
There's a lot going on with it.

535
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,540
I don't know.

536
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,860
I don't know how much you've been paying attention to the news.

537
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,160
Oh, not blue blues.

538
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,560
Fine.

539
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,700
But as far as I know, blue was not on any recent list.

540
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,120
Good.

541
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,360
Good.

542
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,900
I've only been watching TV land.

543
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,560
It's the only channel on adjacent.

544
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,800
He pays for TV land only.

545
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
I don't have cable.

546
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,420
He pays for the TV land package.

547
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,180
And I'm pissed.

548
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,560
It's like up to 90 shows.

549
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:04,000
I was like, come on, I want like a Beretta or, you know, I think there's a cheaper channel.

550
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,920
You could buy.

551
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,480
Yeah, I think this is where this is where what you need is an antenna and antenna to get antenna TV.

552
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,080
Yeah.

553
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,440
Rewind TV.

554
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,720
I don't remember what those are all called.

555
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,740
Like just like mom likes it.

556
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,220
TV.

557
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,980
That's right.

558
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,860
I don't think that's one, but it should be.

559
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,400
Laugh.

560
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,620
Oh, yes.

561
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,580
I've seen L.

562
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,920
F.

563
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:21,800
A.

564
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:21,920
F.

565
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,720
Laugh is the place to be.

566
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,980
So well, there's more kiosk stuff.

567
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,820
That's where we're going.

568
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,260
Oh, did you cover other kiosks?

569
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,280
Oh, of course I did.

570
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:42,680
Yes.

571
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:50,380
So they don't have a sock market in Orlando like they do out here, which is a full sock store, but they have a sock kiosk sock and sandals.

572
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,060
Now, we looked at the, you know, the website last time and there's some aggressive socks, if you recall last time.

573
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,520
But these are much these are much nicer.

574
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,700
They're not as naughty.

575
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,780
But, you know, there are like there are some things for like mom and dad.

576
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,820
Like you can buy something called wine socks and it's socks crammed in a package that looks like it's a glass of wine.

577
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,400
But I think it's just sort of the plastic is molded to look like that.

578
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,280
Then once they're out, then it's not like socks.

579
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,380
Yeah, they look like regular socks.

580
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,520
You just get you open the socks from a not very realistic looking wine glass.

581
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,040
Yes.

582
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:30,480
And there's also beer socks in a similar way to make it look like you got a little pint there of beer.

583
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,560
And again, yeah, they're just the regular socks.

584
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,300
Is there a straw?

585
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,860
There is not a straw.

586
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
No, not that I see.

587
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,180
I thought I saw a straw.

588
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,440
Yeah, I thought I saw a straw.

589
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,060
You know, just the way you like a straw and a beer.

590
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,620
I would have never had beer, but I would have a straw.

591
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,880
Some of the cigarettes.

592
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,840
There's some more.

593
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,080
There's like there's socks that say life happens.

594
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,240
Vodka helps.

595
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,920
So that's just a little like another mom and dad sock.

596
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,740
You'd wear that on your sock.

597
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,500
On your socks.

598
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:06,580
And you have to put your feet together to make the whole sentence legible or to make it make sense.

599
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,680
There's one next to it that says this.

600
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,080
Maybe like the way you like put your legs together if somebody's trying to cuff them.

601
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:12,900
Yes.

602
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,300
If you had leg restraints that were being placed on you.

603
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,060
Yeah, if you're being held down.

604
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:27,660
Like in your like in a prison yard and they got the big ball, the big weighted ball like you're like an old time like Joker was in jail in the 60s Batman or something.

605
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,920
And they don't want him to like be able to go very far.

606
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,400
So if vodka helped you a little too much.

607
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,700
That it says there's one that says this seniorita needs a margarita.

608
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,700
Pretty similar.

609
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,200
To be that seniorita.

610
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,440
And this is not this is close to the margarita but it is not at Margaritaville.

611
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,520
So it's different.

612
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,740
I don't know if they know about it.

613
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:58,460
I should send Margaritaville like a little bit of like a letter or something to let them know that somebody's infringing on their brand.

614
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,200
Not far from the door.

615
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:00,740
Yeah.

616
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,440
And then there's a couple there was one just says dog walking socks.

617
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,300
And that's not you don't have to.

618
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,140
I'm not really sure what the point of that one is.

619
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,340
And then one says peace, love and therapy.

620
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,220
Oh, I'm not afraid I've ever heard before.

621
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,600
I like that one.

622
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,600
Me a man in touch with his emotions in 2024.

623
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,500
Those socks are for me.

624
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,100
Yes.

625
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,620
So I should have gotten them for you.

626
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:27,940
I'm sorry.

627
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,980
Now that I know you are yourself.

628
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,600
You know what?

629
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,240
Do it for yourself, Michael.

630
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,500
And then what I think I like the best is one that just says damn I love this town.

631
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,760
So it doesn't say a specific town on it.

632
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,960
It's just you know where you're supposed to wear them.

633
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,020
You don't want to wear those around here.

634
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:57,800
Do it in a town you love like Orlando, like Orlando, like City Beautiful or like Nona maybe to Jason's favorite place like Nona.

635
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,140
Can anything be a business?

636
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,020
What is that?

637
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,140
Those socks?

638
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,240
Yeah, I guess.

639
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,440
Yeah.

640
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,940
Do you want to like brains?

641
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,340
You probably could start your own like novelty sock company right now.

642
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,200
You could fire off 10 things.

643
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,000
I don't know if I force you to do it, but maybe I would.

644
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,160
No, no, no.

645
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,120
Just give me a couple.

646
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,560
Sure, sure.

647
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,920
In God we trust.

648
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,800
That's great.

649
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,600
Oh, yeah.

650
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,620
That's good for Americans and religious people.

651
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,040
What if God was one of us?

652
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,280
Okay, yeah.

653
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,400
Oh, goodness.

654
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,580
This is harder than I thought.

655
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,460
Got a lot of respect for Ryan Styles right now.

656
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,900
Oh, what if one sock says, Peace be with you, and the other one says, and also with you.

657
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,260
That's good.

658
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,800
Yeah, that's good.

659
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,880
Oh, the body of Christ on one foot and then Amen on the other foot.

660
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,820
Okay, yeah, that's good.

661
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,740
Oh, oh, or the blood of Christ and it comes in a chalice like a plastic chalice.

662
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,620
Once you open it like the wine glass, you're done with it.

663
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,580
But then one of the socks is the wine, and then the other sock in the package is the

664
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,460
dirty cloth the priest uses to wipe the chalice with.

665
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,100
It's a good other use of these socks as a church wine cleaner.

666
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:21,900
Wow, yeah.

667
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,780
Never mind, it is a good idea.

668
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Yeah, I'm looking.

669
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,840
I mean, there are a few religious sock companies already, but I think you have a good handle

670
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,440
on what the public might want.

671
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,760
Oh, or some of them can come with like pre torn and you can say these are my holy socks.

672
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,460
Oh, that's a good maybe that trend like how actually Ryan's thousand.

673
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,140
I have a lot of that is like, you know, jeans are pre ripped now just for the style.

674
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,340
So you're selling pre hold.

675
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,260
You know, it's a thing the kids are doing.

676
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,900
I read have you heard ripped like they want the holes in it.

677
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,420
Have you heard?

678
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,160
Affliction sucks.

679
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:00,820
Yeah.

680
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,600
But that that impression remind me of maybe denim socks.

681
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,040
Oh, yeah.

682
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,380
Yeah, I like that.

683
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:07,620
Yeah.

684
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,460
If you could do it.

685
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,420
I mean, socks are really particular texture.

686
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,000
But yeah, if you could give that a denim feel, we know at least one customer.

687
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,040
He lives in Burbank.

688
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:20,460
We don't have to say we're allowed car driving around and toss them his way.

689
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,100
Maybe we can put some socks in the tea public store.

690
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,580
Oh, I don't think we do offer any socks right now.

691
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,820
Oh, that's not a bad.

692
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,040
I don't know if they offer any.

693
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,980
Maybe we just need to start a separate sock company.

694
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,980
I don't know if that should be podcast, the right affiliated or we shouldn't sully it with it.

695
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,920
It just should be a fully.

696
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,460
We just should all start a religious sock company.

697
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:38,520
Yeah.

698
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,600
You're willing to end.

699
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,080
You know what?

700
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,580
I know somebody who's got some seed money.

701
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,680
Sector keeper.

702
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,160
I don't want to start edging in on your cousin's territory and asking you for money, but they ask you money for money for bad stuff.

703
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,740
We want this.

704
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,320
This is a can't miss idea.

705
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,780
This is a slam dunk, man.

706
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,180
This is spend money to make money.

707
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,080
Oh, that's good.

708
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,260
Spend money on one sock.

709
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,540
Make money on the other.

710
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,800
Oh, yeah.

711
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,660
So like just to start it like I don't know how much you got like I don't know like 100 K lying around.

712
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,460
I want to be gross.

713
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:06,920
We can cut.

714
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
Let's cut this because it's gross.

715
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,820
I don't mind talking money, man.

716
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,860
It's twenty twenty four.

717
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,620
You got to be open about this stuff.

718
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,100
Sure.

719
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,720
Yeah.

720
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,480
With like some of my V.

721
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:15,660
C.

722
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,900
contacts up in as the yeah, I could probably get us a hundred K by next weekend.

723
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,780
Oh, wow.

724
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,300
OK.

725
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,720
OK.

726
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,700
We're going to have to check in with you on this then.

727
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,420
Mm hmm.

728
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:32,320
Maybe as this thing goes, because we're going to have a lot of time and you're like crashing with different ones of us, I guess.

729
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:32,780
Yeah.

730
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,980
Why not start a business?

731
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:34,980
Yeah.

732
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,000
Maybe Scottie Khan will get involved.

733
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,860
I can only hope.

734
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,940
If you're lucky.

735
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,400
But now I've straightened up fire and I only wear religious socks.

736
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:50,920
Wow.

737
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,360
Yeah.

738
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,480
One sock says I killed and the other says action Bronson.

739
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,180
Great.

740
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:01,580
OK.

741
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,140
Well, this is great.

742
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,860
We might as well entrepreneur your eyes, being realized while we're all hanging out.

743
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,840
But what else is going on?

744
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,400
Kiosk wise.

745
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,620
There's an M.

746
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:10,880
A.

747
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,660
some Dragon Ball.

748
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,840
You stop floating around.

749
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,760
That was in the other.

750
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,080
There's more.

751
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,840
We can't cross Sapphire and Emerald.

752
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,420
But then there's like a jewelry kiosk.

753
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,680
Well, and you can just get like glassware, much like the Six Flags kiosk that Anthony

754
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,180
Geo and I came upon during Fright Fest last year.

755
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,820
You can get like kind of like jewelry in a kiosk, which again, that's another one that

756
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:39,840
didn't seem like it was very well attended or well, I don't know, bought from.

757
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,160
So, yeah, I didn't buy anything from there.

758
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,820
But we've talked about how they cycle through different businesses here.

759
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,100
And this one felt like this can't last.

760
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,080
For too long.

761
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,660
But maybe I'm wrong.

762
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,640
Maybe somebody from Orlando.

763
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:58,560
Tell me, do they always have this like jewelry, like seemingly not super expensive, but like

764
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,220
not cheap?

765
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,580
It's not just like cheap.

766
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:07,380
By your special lady and necklace with a little like cubic zirconia minion on it.

767
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,440
Did you think about doing that?

768
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:09,840
No.

769
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,360
OK.

770
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,000
You got to watch out for some of that cheap stuff.

771
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,460
Like it might give someone a rash or it might start to tarnish and get green.

772
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,600
Have you?

773
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,680
If you.

774
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,040
So you're saying if you buy cheap jewelry.

775
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,020
My neck got torn up by a crystal zirconia minion.

776
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,760
Why are you all bruised?

777
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,720
Did someone hurt you?

778
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,800
Well, yes, but just with a necklace.

779
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,880
Well, love hurts sometimes, you know.

780
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,400
Jason bought his prom date a cubic zirconia and she had like a huge rash by the end of

781
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,460
the night from it.

782
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,480
It's a big it said my special girl.

783
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,600
And by the end of the night, those words were they were going to be stuck in her body for

784
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,360
two years.

785
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
They were in the hospital that night.

786
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,340
Yeah, you know, cheap, cheap jewelry can do that.

787
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,400
That's true, I think.

788
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,120
But I don't know.

789
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,620
We're saying that about this business.

790
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,900
I don't know that they're selling stuff that's going to like make your skin puff up.

791
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,940
I'm not sure.

792
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,920
I'm not using them of that.

793
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,080
No, this might be the finest jewelry on Earth.

794
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,400
Right.

795
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:08,660
Right.

796
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,720
So I wouldn't.

797
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:09,900
Yes.

798
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,800
Since I didn't purchase from there.

799
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,100
Yeah, you're right.

800
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,740
What am I saying?

801
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:14,640
Charms.

802
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,420
Charms.

803
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:15,920
Charms.

804
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,660
Well, we covered charms in downtown Disney.

805
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,340
Yeah.

806
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,500
But yeah.

807
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:25,340
So so they have this here and it's an interesting selection of things that they've got in these

808
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:25,820
kiosks.

809
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,440
And was it Sapphire Sapphire?

810
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,780
This one?

811
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,120
No.

812
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,940
Emerald Emerald.

813
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,980
Damn it.

814
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,660
Hey, OK.

815
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,140
I'm sorry.

816
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,940
I'm so sorry.

817
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,180
I'm sorry.

818
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,280
All right.

819
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,140
Well, interesting, I guess, is the vert.

820
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,080
I mean, we can move on to things.

821
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,840
I don't know.

822
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,640
I think so.

823
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,900
Water taxis is the next one.

824
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,440
Water taxis.

825
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,340
And you know what?

826
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,480
OK, here's where when you compare the two, think about all the trips we've made up to

827
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,000
Hollywood.

828
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,580
Yeah.

829
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,260
We like sequestered ourselves in this kind of like ultimately a little bit.

830
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,580
Sorry to say, like depressing, narrow strip of stores.

831
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,580
It's, you know, like you can feel a little claustrophobic.

832
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,020
Right.

833
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:12,960
But the fact that CityWalk Orlando is on this lagoon, that there are these waterways and

834
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,960
this is my first experience with them because I hadn't stayed on that property before.

835
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,100
Right.

836
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,000
So I hadn't taken these water taxis, boats, you might call them, but properly water taxis.

837
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,300
Yeah.

838
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,520
Seems to be the term.

839
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,160
That just has not been part of my Orlando vacation experience.

840
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:26,760
You know what?

841
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,160
This is it for me.

842
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,080
I don't think I'm staying at Disney World anymore.

843
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,100
I love these.

844
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,520
Yeah.

845
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,980
And it's such a triumph.

846
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,940
It's like no matter how sick.

847
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,240
I don't know if you guys felt the same.

848
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,860
No matter how sick we were getting of CityWalk and the things to do there and the things

849
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:46,500
to eat there, you still, you would like get this genuinely kind of stunning view out onto

850
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,420
the waterfront.

851
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:47,920
Yeah.

852
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,100
That was, I don't know.

853
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,720
This is, I think this is the whole thing is like a triumph.

854
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,280
The water taxis included.

855
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,680
Yeah.

856
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,120
It's just a great system.

857
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,800
Very relaxing, very convenient.

858
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,580
The view is, I would even call it refreshing.

859
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,220
Very refreshing.

860
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,260
I would say it's refreshing.

861
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,600
There's so much water there.

862
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,480
I actually didn't.

863
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,960
I've been on these water taxis before.

864
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,020
I didn't do it on this trip.

865
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,500
I was staying by bus ride away.

866
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,620
Not as good as these, I don't think.

867
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,720
Pavement taxi?

868
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,520
What's that?

869
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:14,920
Oh yeah.

870
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,660
Pavement taxi.

871
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,140
Yeah.

872
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:16,860
So.

873
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,120
That's not what we're talking about.

874
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah.

875
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,520
I got on the wrong pavement taxi as well.

876
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,360
And I got, I went to the third, the third gate accidentally.

877
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,280
The water theme park.

878
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:27,540
Yeah.

879
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:27,660
Yeah.

880
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,520
The water theme park.

881
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,240
I kept saying like, this isn't where I'm, yeah it is.

882
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,620
Yeah, it's where it's supposed to be.

883
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,340
I was told the wrong things by two people over and over again.

884
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,780
I go, well I'm not supposed to be here.

885
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,580
Can I just get on this bus?

886
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,280
No, you can't get on that bus back.

887
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,740
I go, but doesn't it take you back to City Walk?

888
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:43,820
No.

889
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,700
It's just going to, you have to go back to your hotel.

890
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,600
And I go, but it says it goes to Hard Rock, which is right on City Walk.

891
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,100
No, there's no way you can take that.

892
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,800
And I go, well what if I did take it?

893
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,880
And I go, all right.

894
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,540
And then the bus driver who told me the wrong things.

895
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,100
The bus driver told me the wrong things.

896
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,260
Took the whole bus of people to the wrong hotel.

897
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,540
And then he goes, hey you, off here.

898
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,500
I go, this isn't Hard Rock.

899
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,180
And he goes, yeah, no, this is where City Walk, you wanted to go to City Walk, right?

900
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,260
I go, it's at the hotel across the street.

901
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,180
He goes, you're right.

902
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,480
And I was like, oh man.

903
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,920
A lot of attitude from the…

904
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,720
He gave me a lot of attitude, yes.

905
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,620
It feels like everyone did along the way.

906
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,340
This was the only part of the trip where I feel like I was getting attitude from people.

907
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,760
And I knew I was right.

908
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,480
Everybody else seemed nice.

909
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,180
They worked everywhere.

910
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,680
He wasn't even not nice.

911
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,380
He was just like sure he was right.

912
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,260
Until it all crystallized him.

913
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,020
Oh yeah.

914
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,520
Yeah.

915
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,740
Well we got a little bit of attitude the one night.

916
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,980
Because we went to Hard Rock just to walk around and get some ice cream.

917
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,900
And then we came back out and we went to go through the gate.

918
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,460
And the tents were closed.

919
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,740
And we're like, hello, is anyone there?

920
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,520
And they're like, oh yeah, we're closed.

921
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,980
And we're like, we need to get to a water taxi.

922
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,520
This water taxi was running for another hour and 90 minutes or something.

923
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:17,620
And they're like, well if you take a bus and he couldn't even finish it.

924
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,180
I was like, come on, it's right there.

925
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,920
And he's like, okay, just come through the metal detector.

926
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,040
And I'm like, I'm in a scooter, man.

927
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,280
You want me to take a bus to go longer?

928
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,960
Like what are you talking about?

929
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,860
Was it that quick where you were just like, can I?

930
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,800
And they were like, all right.

931
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,620
Yeah, basically.

932
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,600
Slight pressure.

933
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,440
I mean it was later.

934
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,760
It was like pushing midnight.

935
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,960
But we had been assured that the water taxis were running until like 1 or 1.

936
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,300
30.

937
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:44,860
I see.

938
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,600
So somebody maybe didn't know?

939
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,380
I think we were just getting mixed messages.

940
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,600
I think people were on different pages.

941
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,680
It's possible that person got fired for letting you through though.

942
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,060
I mean, you never know.

943
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,960
We got one.

944
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,180
You're remorseless about that.

945
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,680
I am remorseless.

946
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,460
You're been assured.

947
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,000
CityWalk's not closed yet.

948
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,180
You shouldn't be closing one of the main entrances.

949
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:06,360
I agree.

950
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:06,940
No, no.

951
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,740
This is why we're on this journey.

952
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,940
Everyone's a little galactically shaken up.

953
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,340
Yeah.

954
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,640
You can be employees.

955
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,220
Yeah, you're right.

956
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,260
The tides, the moon, the cosmos.

957
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,780
You can feel the rift.

958
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,400
Yes, guys.

959
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,280
Everybody can feel the rift.

960
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,420
Everyone can feel it.

961
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,700
Pavement taxis going to the wrong places.

962
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,680
The pavement taxi man might have been from a different part of the multiverse.

963
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,540
Now you're understanding, Michael.

964
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,860
Oh, OK.

965
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Pavement taxis are buses, but taxis are still taxis.

966
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,100
He could have traveled through the timeline.

967
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,140
He could have been driving in his timeline.

968
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,860
He was driving to the new Stella Nova and Daruluna resorts.

969
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,820
They're not even open yet in our timeline.

970
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,660
We don't have to cover those yet, do we?

971
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,820
Unfamiliar, but I know all about it.

972
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,440
Yeah.

973
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:52,760
Wow.

974
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,240
No, we don't because they're not open, but reservations are available.

975
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,100
But they're open in a different part of the multiverse.

976
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:05,080
I can see that they're open and they're flourishing.

977
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,680
Oh, wow.

978
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,460
They've got those reflective tiles.

979
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,740
It's very soothing.

980
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,740
That's all everyone's talking about.

981
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,000
Beautiful colors of the rainbow.

982
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
Secretary Keefer knows all about the tiles.

983
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,880
But boys, please, please stay in this timeline.

984
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,820
Oh, we better.

985
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,940
Yes, thank you, Secretary Keefer.

986
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,420
Of course.

987
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,620
We were riding the multi-taxi Scott and I are the water taxi.

988
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,540
The multi-taxi.

989
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,680
No, that's right.

990
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,240
Jason's getting it.

991
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,120
Your brain leveled up as well.

992
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,860
My brain leveled up by playing 12 dimensional chess like the world's politicians.

993
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,180
So Scott and I, we were utilizing the water taxis.

994
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:49,720
But Mike, every time I talk to you when we were out and about, you were writing down another water taxi name, I feel like.

995
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,040
Yeah, so they have names.

996
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,920
I mean, you guys probably caught a couple of them.

997
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,580
I don't know.

998
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,880
Please talk about that.

999
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,120
But the first one I saw in the back.

1000
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,660
So on the back of the water taxis, they have a name.

1001
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,280
They each are specifically named like a Mr.

1002
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,680
Toad's Wild Ride or something, which has different characters.

1003
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,340
That has characters, but this has a different name.

1004
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,320
The first one I saw here is says movie magic on the back.

1005
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,800
Wow.

1006
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,940
So that's one of them.

1007
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,280
I'm loving it.

1008
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,780
That's what you go there for.

1009
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,560
Right.

1010
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,560
Learn how they make it.

1011
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,780
One of them says Chow.

1012
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,380
Oh, I like that.

1013
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,640
Very, very Hollywood.

1014
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,020
Very Scott Khan.

1015
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,360
Yeah, Chow.

1016
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,160
C.

1017
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,880
O.

1018
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,560
I.

1019
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:26,880
A.

1020
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,460
Is that right?

1021
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,100
C.

1022
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,780
O.

1023
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,520
I.

1024
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:28,780
A.

1025
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,820
Yeah, okay.

1026
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah, hold on.

1027
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,860
And now I got to find the rest of them.

1028
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,180
You were thinking like eat like Chow down.

1029
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,460
Well, you certainly could do that plenty at CityWalk.

1030
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,620
One of them.

1031
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,980
This is the back of the years when it says Chow.

1032
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,460
One of them just says Hard Rock.

1033
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:45,900
Okay.

1034
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,900
Yeah, something you hear at CityWalk with the Rolling Stones song.

1035
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,060
I heard them the first night.

1036
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,460
Yes, of course.

1037
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,100
And then hold on.

1038
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,520
I got to find the…

1039
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,780
I don't know why my pictures are out of order.

1040
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,300
Hold on.

1041
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:58,620
Hold on.

1042
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:58,980
Here we go.

1043
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,040
It's all part of the rift.

1044
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,600
Oh, when we fix it, your pictures will all be in order.

1045
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,040
Okay.

1046
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,500
And then this is the last one I have for unless I'm missing some.

1047
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,560
Silver Screen.

1048
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,640
Wow.

1049
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,960
Silver Screen.

1050
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:11,880
Silver Screen.

1051
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,380
Yeah.

1052
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,220
That's what we love as creators and dreamers is that we love the blank page and we love

1053
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,280
the Silver Screen.

1054
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:18,800
Wow.

1055
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,360
Because it's meant to be filled up with the movie magic.

1056
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,380
That's right.

1057
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,360
That's for the memories.

1058
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,520
These seem like definitely named early on in the creation of CityWalk.

1059
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:33,880
Sure.

1060
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,100
Much more when the ride the movies was the tagline for all of Universal.

1061
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,260
I'm guessing.

1062
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,060
It was just movie?

1063
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,040
Well, it's a movie terms and this is like movie terms or grandparents.

1064
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,300
Universal movie.

1065
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,860
Well, they was ride the movies for a while, but it was very much that's the the genesis

1066
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,260
of Universal because it obviously was from the actual studio.

1067
00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:00,060
And even when Universal Orlando opened, it was still like learn about movies and that's

1068
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,460
the whole thing.

1069
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,400
And now it's it's away from that.

1070
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,160
It's much more like a Disney or whatever.

1071
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,080
There's still the movie like DNA in there making movies DNA.

1072
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,780
But now that's why I'm assuming these were named 20 years ago.

1073
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,780
Well, so they've they've decommissioned some of the boats like Let's Do Lunch.

1074
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,840
Right.

1075
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,880
Bofo.

1076
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,340
You look marvelous, darling or something like one of the Gabor.

1077
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,280
I know that's also Billy Crystal's character.

1078
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,380
Another cappuccino, please.

1079
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:29,980
Right.

1080
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,120
The water taxis, too.

1081
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,320
A lot of them were running like I don't think we ever waited longer than like 10, 50 minutes.

1082
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,040
And they were really communicative of like if one fills up, they're like, one will be

1083
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,940
here in five minutes.

1084
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:49,280
And like if you take it all the way to Sapphire Falls, you pass Roe Pacific and you also pass

1085
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,880
the boat dock with all the drop like ones that are docked, not running that day.

1086
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,940
How many did you see there?

1087
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,260
Do you think I think there was like five or six docked?

1088
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,560
So they could really have a full fleet.

1089
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,120
Yes, because then they were on the other end.

1090
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,940
They go to Hard Rock and Portofino as well.

1091
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,700
Right.

1092
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,360
So I only went the other way.

1093
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:09,880
But you know what?

1094
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,740
Really, like the way that it pumps you up in the morning or chills you out in the evening.

1095
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,200
Yeah.

1096
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,000
And I thought they're playing good like music for everybody.

1097
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:25,940
You know, I was on one with some bye bye bye plan and oh, everybody's grooving on Y2K

1098
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,420
vibes and memories.

1099
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,200
And it's good.

1100
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,040
Just good feelings.

1101
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,920
I feel like.

1102
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,820
I think notches CityWalk Orlando above Hollywood in quality.

1103
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,400
Yeah.

1104
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,960
Well, Hollywood, any really I'm trying to think Disney.

1105
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,460
There's anything where you can take like a boat from a mall to a hotel because you can

1106
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,540
do that in Disney.

1107
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,340
Go to Port Orleans down to Disney Springs.

1108
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:53,800
Yes.

1109
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,320
And that's delightful.

1110
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,120
Anytime a mall has a waterway leading to a hotel, it's great.

1111
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,620
And they don't think they can do that.

1112
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:06,380
There's probably no way to build a lake in Anaheim right now that makes sense for Disney,

1113
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,540
nor is there a spot in Universal Hollywood for it.

1114
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,880
But so that's Orlando is always going to have a leg up in general because of water and waterways.

1115
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:15,620
Yeah.

1116
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,220
Just from yeah, just the transportation aspect and just from a beautiful view aspect.

1117
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,680
There's a little trough of water outside the billabong.

1118
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,720
Oh, yeah.

1119
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,260
It's a little wave.

1120
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,220
Yeah, that's true.

1121
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:27,840
You're right.

1122
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,080
I shouldn't discount that.

1123
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,580
Yeah.

1124
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,320
Well, and of course, the dancing fountains.

1125
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,240
Well, right.

1126
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:33,460
Right.

1127
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,480
Also have here.

1128
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:34,940
Yes.

1129
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,000
I mean, it's not nearly what it is.

1130
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,580
You got no color.

1131
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,280
Yeah.

1132
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,500
Yeah.

1133
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,040
Call them like shows.

1134
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,620
Yeah.

1135
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,400
Per se.

1136
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,820
I mean, and I for one think it's egregious that they would build one.

1137
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,340
They'd build a new city walk and do this.

1138
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,580
But triggering what it is.

1139
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,480
Yeah, it's well, you know what?

1140
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,540
You actually describe what it is.

1141
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:12,580
OK.

1142
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,440
So.

1143
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,120
All right.

1144
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,140
So.

1145
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,320
Oh, OK.

1146
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:24,940
So the fountains are going in and Scott is Scott is juking in and out of it like a like a like a child.

1147
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,180
You ran through the fountain.

1148
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,820
Sky ran through the fat and he made it.

1149
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,460
Oh, I made it through the fat.

1150
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:31,500
You ran through.

1151
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,200
I made it.

1152
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,540
I was feeling lucky that night.

1153
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,200
You know what?

1154
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,900
I was holding a drink while holding a drink.

1155
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,880
Was it open?

1156
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,080
I don't remember that part.

1157
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,620
What am I?

1158
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:41,880
Covered.

1159
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,760
Can you tell what I'm holding?

1160
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,260
You I think you're actually just holding like a Coca Cola cup of some kind.

1161
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,900
You're also just be a water.

1162
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,760
You're also holding a box of kind bars that I bought at Target for you.

1163
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,500
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1164
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,300
Yes, you dropped off my supplies.

1165
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,360
Thank you.

1166
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,600
So, yeah, you may you may just have a cup of water in a six kind bars in a box.

1167
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,540
Look at that kind bars undamaged.

1168
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,340
You know what?

1169
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,740
I was just sucking up to you saying I didn't like the fountains.

1170
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,620
I loved running through these fountains.

1171
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,780
I don't you know what?

1172
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,440
It's the we can't blame.

1173
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,380
Yeah, you're right.

1174
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,720
What am I saying?

1175
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,040
What am I saying?

1176
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,340
Yeah, and it could have been me.

1177
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,300
It could have been me just as easily as you.

1178
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:18,720
Of course.

1179
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,140
I didn't mean to blame you or say I was feeling like a daredevil that night.

1180
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,080
If you're just listening to this side and you haven't heard any of the other

1181
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,820
sagas, I just I apologize.

1182
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,300
I have to explain what happened.

1183
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,660
The sector keeper was playing in the fountains when he was a human and he caught

1184
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,340
staff from the water in the fountains here at City Walk Hollywood.

1185
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,780
And then he knows to Scott's credits.

1186
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,500
He wasn't eight years old and wasn't left unattended by his parents for.

1187
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,180
Yeah, that's true.

1188
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,020
He was an adult man for a while.

1189
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:48,560
Right.

1190
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,500
I forgot this that they weren't around.

1191
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,560
They weren't watching.

1192
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,140
No, they weren't watching.

1193
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,300
Do we remember?

1194
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,820
We probably talked about this forever ago, but they were there in another store or

1195
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,420
they were just like, here, knock yourself out.

1196
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,260
And I think that they were at the Raiders.

1197
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,440
I can't remember.

1198
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,020
It's a little it's a little fuzzy.

1199
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,280
But I'm sure we explored it thoroughly, though.

1200
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,100
I just forgot these.

1201
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,160
I shouldn't speak ill of your parents.

1202
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,220
And I'm sure they've had it very hard because where have they I mean, did they just

1203
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,760
they just don't know what happened to you.

1204
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,600
They don't know that you've been having all these adventures.

1205
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,400
And I don't know what happened to them.

1206
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:22,880
Yeah.

1207
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,720
You haven't even it's like it's probably too painful to go visit your parents again.

1208
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:27,160
Right.

1209
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,700
Yeah.

1210
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,340
So but seeing you have a delightful time and really, I think getting a box of kind bars,

1211
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,480
that was a good night.

1212
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,240
Yeah.

1213
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,560
Yeah.

1214
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,920
You know, it was good and it kind of brings me happy memories.

1215
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,880
And I don't mean to now bum you out, but like, do you think they had a funeral for you?

1216
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,040
I mean, you got to say goodbye to your.

1217
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,000
I would hope so.

1218
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,360
Damn, I never really consider you can't really go to your own.

1219
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,680
It's not like Huck Finn rules where you can go to your own.

1220
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,480
Anyway, I just it's just represents a lot of fans.

1221
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,200
You know, did they have another child?

1222
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,280
Do they adopt another child?

1223
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,060
I know we don't know.

1224
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,040
You haven't.

1225
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,660
It's all blocked out, boys.

1226
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,460
But maybe you can help me.

1227
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,080
Maybe you can help me discover that eventually.

1228
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:19,640
All we can help you with is we can go into stores and point out stuff on the walls and say if we like the store or not.

1229
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,560
Hey, that's all I can ask.

1230
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,440
OK.

1231
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,900
And that's that is and I mean this, that is all we are capable of doing.

1232
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,980
Like not for you in the world.

1233
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,740
That's that's this is what we do.

1234
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,060
Of course, of course.

1235
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:40,780
Well, again, I hate to like, you know, bring parental emotion into it, but this is kind of what we're what we're dealing with.

1236
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:48,480
But like, you know, this this waterfront area, I spoke broadly about this in like a trip report episode.

1237
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:53,400
But one thing that I thought was funny is that we went down here to do a bunch of city walk Orlando stuff.

1238
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,700
This like silly mission.

1239
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:04,020
And then where it leaves me is Jason and Jane and I hung out for a little bit doing one of the things we had to do.

1240
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,160
And you guys left.

1241
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:14,500
And then I stood at the waterfront and I had my first ever phone conversation with my son because we're never apart.

1242
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,860
We don't talk on the phone.

1243
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,640
And the last time I've been I was away from him.

1244
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,260
He wasn't capable of that.

1245
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:26,400
So now this is the first time we can like actually talk and I could find out how his day was and I could tell him about being on the airplane.

1246
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,100
He could say, I miss you and I love you.

1247
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:38,320
And this happened overlooking the shimmering waters with tooth some and hard rock live in the background.

1248
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,100
Chow streaming down my face.

1249
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,780
Genuinely, I love you too, dad.

1250
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,500
It was like incredibly emotional.

1251
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:50,180
And I'm staring at tooth some chocolate and pouring a chow boat rolls right by.

1252
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,520
It's pumping sugar every morning.

1253
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,240
Give me a mini necklace.

1254
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,420
Just bring me back Minions or Coney.

1255
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,360
I hope it doesn't make me break out.

1256
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:11,020
Yeah, but if it does, then you'll know that I love you for longer than if you just wore it just for a day.

1257
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:16,020
You'll know that you'll know that I love you for six to eight weeks until the rash.

1258
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:23,920
I'll give you the necklace and the rash and drive you to one of Burbank's many urgent care locations.

1259
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,880
Wow, that's beautiful.

1260
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,440
That's nice.

1261
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:33,420
It was really something like a genuine touching thing that happened because of this and because we did this trip.

1262
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,740
And I find it kind of funny also that like that happened to say, you know, we didn't talk about this.

1263
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,600
It wasn't in the sector list.

1264
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,600
But like if you're incorporating the whole like water complex into our discussion here, you know,

1265
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,760
it's like a big open area with terrorist steps.

1266
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,300
And I think you technically call that the waterfront plaza.

1267
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,520
And that's where they did the emerald taping.

1268
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,500
I think Ellen did a week of shows there as well.

1269
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,860
And the so that's that's where I was basically.

1270
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:05,120
And I discovered another great father son family kind of moment that happened right in that spot,

1271
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:11,060
which was the shooting of a movie that involves family legacy and lineage.

1272
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:14,880
And that is a movie called Ace Ventura, Junior Pet Detective.

1273
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,480
Oh, yeah.

1274
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,960
Filmed partially around the the Universal Orlando Resort.

1275
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,340
It's not Ace Ventura, Junior Pet Detective.

1276
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,360
So it's not a prequel.

1277
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,400
He's not a junior.

1278
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:33,040
He is Ace Ventura, Junior, colon, period colon, Pet Detective.

1279
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,240
This is a straight to video masterpiece.

1280
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,180
So Ace Ventura's son.

1281
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,000
It is about Ace Ventura's son.

1282
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,200
And there's a part where I didn't get to watch this entire film, regrettably.

1283
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,420
But there's a part where he says, I love you, Mom.

1284
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,780
And his mom says, I love you, too, Ace.

1285
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,560
And then you I'm like, wait, so who is she?

1286
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,480
And she is her character's name is Melissa Robinson Ventura.

1287
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,640
And she is supposed to be Courtney Cox from Ace Ventura one.

1288
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,180
Wow.

1289
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:11,980
And though she is now played by Anne Cusack, who is a great actress, who was Chuck's ex wife on Better Call Saul.

1290
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:12,900
Oh, yeah.

1291
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,920
Now you're supposed to believe that this is the fun Courtney Cox character from the first.

1292
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:25,460
And so the so next time you watch this Ventura, just keep in mind that after the events of the film, they got married.

1293
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:33,620
They had a child and then Ace disappeared forever, leaving his son to many years, having never met him or spent any serious time.

1294
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,220
With him.

1295
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:40,120
He went and adopted not only his profession, but also his hair and penchant for Hawaiian shirts.

1296
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:40,940
Oh, wow.

1297
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,140
It's kind of dark.

1298
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,520
Like stepping into your father's corpse.

1299
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:52,140
Son of the masks should meet son of Ace Ventura.

1300
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,780
Oh, yes.

1301
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,660
Like an aliens versus predators.

1302
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,540
Oh, boy.

1303
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,080
Yeah.

1304
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,780
You know what?

1305
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:01,460
I don't like either individual film, but if they teamed up, that's enough for me.

1306
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,040
What about that?

1307
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,800
That's a blockbuster.

1308
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,580
What about the young dumb and dumbers?

1309
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,860
Well, that's tricky because that is still always them.

1310
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,240
Oh, yeah.

1311
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:08,920
They're not the kids.

1312
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,740
Yeah, you're right.

1313
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,220
Yeah.

1314
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:10,440
Yeah.

1315
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:10,740
Yeah.

1316
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,560
Son of Mask, the Mask son, Mask Jr.

1317
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,440
No, actually, that is the man.

1318
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:25,500
I believe that the mask itself floated elsewhere and was picked up by Jamie Kennedy, who gave it to his son.

1319
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,880
And he's not related to any of the events of the first film.

1320
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,160
Okay, so they would do anything to do a Jim Carrey sequel.

1321
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:39,880
Any crazy loops and wormholes they had to go through to make one.

1322
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,060
Is there anything past those firsts?

1323
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,880
Is there like a majestic junior or Simon Birch?

1324
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,420
Simon Birch.

1325
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,380
Little old Truman show.

1326
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,080
Little Truman.

1327
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,040
Like Truman.

1328
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,340
Yeah, something.

1329
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,200
If that's fun.

1330
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:06,820
If after the, you know, like the very uplifting ending of Truman show where he gets a fresh beginning, if Truman had a son who was once again trapped and ensnared in a giant sound.

1331
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,800
Oh, it's the guy gets his revenge.

1332
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,580
Is Christoph the name of it?

1333
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:10,780
Christoph.

1334
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,520
Yeah, Harris.

1335
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,880
Christoph gets his revenge.

1336
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,120
Kidnaps Truman Jr.

1337
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:22,320
Oh, yeah.

1338
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,120
But then he would say, well, how have I've given him an amazing life better than you ever could.

1339
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,600
You couldn't give him a multimillion dollar world to explore the real world.

1340
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,620
It's not safe for Truman Burbank Jr.

1341
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,560
And it's all over the phone because Jim Carrey doesn't do the movie.

1342
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,580
Yeah, yeah.

1343
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,920
Stop yelling at me, Truman.

1344
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,560
Why don't you come here and say that to me in person?

1345
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,580
Oh, yeah.

1346
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,600
Too much of a coward.

1347
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,060
Everyone's doing returns and reboots and stuff nowadays.

1348
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,020
So we should come back.

1349
00:52:52,020 --> 00:53:00,880
Honestly, you should make a super movie where like the super movie like where the mask fights a spandora and he plays both.

1350
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:01,520
Yeah.

1351
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:07,880
And they stand and they crash through a wall and they land in the soundstage of Truman Jr.

1352
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,100
The Truman Jr.

1353
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:09,440
show.

1354
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,720
Bruce Almighty's there.

1355
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:11,680
Well, interesting.

1356
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,740
OK, so you definitely Bruce.

1357
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,760
Little Bruce is good.

1358
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,440
Young Bruce.

1359
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:22,960
So Jason's definition of a super movie is an actor's entire filmography in play in one movie.

1360
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,500
Well, I mostly meant to.

1361
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,220
I mostly meant like two of the most successful.

1362
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,220
But I was really starts wandering into fray.

1363
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,220
So like a Tom Hanks super movie, it's Forrest Gump.

1364
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,120
It's the Cloud Atlas characters.

1365
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,500
It's the terminal Express.

1366
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,580
Anything is in game.

1367
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,880
But not necessarily Tom Hanks.

1368
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:45,820
The him.

1369
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,340
So he himself.

1370
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,720
It's like how much can we parse off its force?

1371
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,380
It doesn't have to be Tom Hanks.

1372
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:50,740
Right.

1373
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,200
Yes.

1374
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:51,700
Uh huh.

1375
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,000
But it could be all his characters.

1376
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:53,840
David S.

1377
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:54,760
Pumpkins.

1378
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:55,440
Yes.

1379
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,140
And they all get caught on the bridge of spies.

1380
00:53:59,400 --> 00:53:59,880
Yes.

1381
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,400
Big showdown between over here.

1382
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,460
16 relatives of Tom Hanks characters over here.

1383
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:06,560
Another over here.

1384
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,440
The wall has risen again.

1385
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,520
What do you think?

1386
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,100
What do you think?

1387
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,180
Jerry Crown.

1388
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,940
Let's get him.

1389
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,400
Get him.

1390
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,240
It's on the moped.

1391
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:14,760
Yeah.

1392
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:15,780
Yeah.

1393
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,200
And Booty's riding on back and they're flying down the road to Perdition.

1394
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,700
You know, wow, it's the movie that teaches you that the road of Perdition hooks up to the bridge of spies.

1395
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,340
How did you know?

1396
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,400
Forrest Gump ran across all of it.

1397
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,920
How did you know I would be here?

1398
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,160
I checked your location on the circle app.

1399
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,520
Wow.

1400
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,980
Why perhaps an actor who appears briefly in the circle or some shit could be terrific.

1401
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:44,540
That counts.

1402
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,640
Jason, whatever the hell that is in the circle.

1403
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,540
I don't quite remember.

1404
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,820
Aren't you doing improv in the circle?

1405
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,580
Me and Drew Droga are doing fake improv.

1406
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,160
Yes.

1407
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,680
Well, fake in not in the fake in when you were performing.

1408
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,140
I initially started improvising and then I felt bad.

1409
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:04,200
There was a line of extras who could not talk or tag in because they were not paid for that.

1410
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Right.

1411
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,280
All right.

1412
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,080
So you could be in that.

1413
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:07,780
You count for that.

1414
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,400
Have listeners ever found you in the circle?

1415
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,960
Because there was that and then there's the thing.

1416
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,140
What's the thing where you're in a soccer audience?

1417
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,720
I'm in the squeakle.

1418
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,240
They didn't find me in the squeakle.

1419
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,840
You were found in the squeakle.

1420
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:20,340
Yes.

1421
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:30,600
I while the circle while a bestselling Dave Eggers novel, I don't know if enough people have seen the movie adaptation to find me.

1422
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,820
Now watch the circle.

1423
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,700
Yeah, we issue you the circle challenge.

1424
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,080
Please.

1425
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,000
What was the modern?

1426
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,180
Oh, that's part of the mission.

1427
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,960
Oh, OK.

1428
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:39,840
Please.

1429
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,560
I need this listeners.

1430
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,440
Wow.

1431
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:42,660
Wow.

1432
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:42,940
OK.

1433
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,340
So not only we know.

1434
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,560
It's not just that you should make your X.

1435
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,680
Please find Jason in the circle.

1436
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,420
OK, so we'll work on that.

1437
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:00,560
Anything that we should probably start making it to since we got two NBC sports girls.

1438
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,440
I'll find Omega and bruised him.

1439
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,300
That's four places to get through.

1440
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:04,920
Yeah.

1441
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,640
I'm sorry.

1442
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:06,380
Alpha.

1443
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,980
Do we go over this?

1444
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,140
Alpha and Omega.

1445
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,500
What's the difference?

1446
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,780
Alpha is in Orlando.

1447
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:12,680
OK.

1448
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,260
Alpha is in Orlando in this case.

1449
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,520
But is that because is Alpha always Orlando or?

1450
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,280
No, it might switch up here and there.

1451
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,840
Oh, Alpha is like it's the first.

1452
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:24,220
First.

1453
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,120
Yeah.

1454
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:25,780
Yeah.

1455
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,160
OK.

1456
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:31,080
That NBC sports grill and brew open much earlier.

1457
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,160
OK.

1458
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:38,780
So if there's another one that we encounter where CityWalk Hollywood open first, that will be Alpha.

1459
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,320
That would be Alpha.

1460
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:41,040
OK.

1461
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,300
Very clear.

1462
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:43,040
Great.

1463
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,520
Well, I know Omega, the creator and the end.

1464
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,160
That's right.

1465
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,260
The creator and the end.

1466
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,240
As I've been saying, all beginning, you learn about in the circle.

1467
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,060
This really this whole series is kind of like a big circle.

1468
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,040
All a big circle.

1469
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:56,500
Yeah.

1470
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,060
In fact, if you watch the Dave Eggers, the circle.

1471
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:00,880
What is it?

1472
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,840
Well, Dave Eggers wrote the novel.

1473
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,500
A heartbreaking work of staggering genius.

1474
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,880
And then he's written.

1475
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:18,620
If you watch this and you sync it up to Margaritaville, all of your all of your answer questions will be answered.

1476
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:19,700
Yeah.

1477
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,760
The song on a loop.

1478
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,700
Yes, that's right.

1479
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,180
It's just that's just that.

1480
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,340
Yeah.

1481
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,240
John Boyega enters that looking for my life.

1482
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:27,940
That's where you hit play.

1483
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,560
That's where you hit play.

1484
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:28,700
That's where you hit play.

1485
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:29,060
Yeah.

1486
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:29,620
That's where you hit play.

1487
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:29,620
That's where you hit play.

1488
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:29,640
That's where you hit play.

1489
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:29,640
Yeah.

1490
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,240
Can I get is your character in the book, your improv character?

1491
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:33,880
I don't know.

1492
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,620
I that is I've read a few Dave Eggers books, but I don't think I've read the circle.

1493
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:42,140
Two ruggedly handsome men have the room and stitches.

1494
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,660
How could this be made up off the top of their head?

1495
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,940
The audience thinks.

1496
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,440
All of them at once in unison having the same collective thought.

1497
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,600
It is as if they were touched by the hand of God.

1498
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,300
One word.

1499
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,920
It's all they asked for.

1500
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,940
One word.

1501
00:57:54,940 --> 00:58:03,040
It certainly couldn't be that the one of the actors was the director's improv teacher and then he asked,

1502
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,480
We need another guy.

1503
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,820
Do you know anyone from this list?

1504
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,980
It's like, I know Jason.

1505
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:09,820
Wow.

1506
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:10,200
Wow.

1507
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,020
That's how he got the gig.

1508
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:11,620
Yeah.

1509
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,980
That's how the scenes info.

1510
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,120
So, wow, Hollywood stuff.

1511
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,260
That's how magic.

1512
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,460
And then Charlie.

1513
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,240
Yeah.

1514
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,160
Let's do lunch.

1515
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,700
Let's do lunch at the silver screen.

1516
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,720
Let's do lunch at the silver screen.

1517
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,140
Is here.

1518
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,940
Let's do lunch at NBC Sports Grill and Brew Alpha Alpha.

1519
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:31,860
That is OK.

1520
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,680
So it opened in Orlando in 2015.

1521
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
That makes it alpha.

1522
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:36,540
That's right.

1523
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,880
You know, I think we've got a lot of experience with both.

1524
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,900
We could probably go back and forth here.

1525
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:42,400
You know what?

1526
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,460
A little like again, a little little peek behind the scenes.

1527
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,980
You know, we were talking about the city walk saga Orlando a long time ago, and we thought,

1528
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,680
Oh, maybe some of these locations that are both would be good to visit.

1529
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,100
So we went up to NBC Sports Grill and Brew Omega in L.

1530
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,480
A.

1531
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,020
with Griffin Newman with this in mind.

1532
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,340
And that was in December twenty twenty one.

1533
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,340
That is how long we have been trying to do this.

1534
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:09,800
That's right.

1535
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,220
There is a photo of us, which we can post.

1536
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,260
You could tell when it was taken because we're there are masks on all of our chins.

1537
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:16,840
That's right.

1538
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:26,200
My memory from that is that Griffin, I think Griffin had a really runny broccoli and cheddar mac and cheese.

1539
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,600
Like it was just pure liquid at the end.

1540
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,860
I don't think it left a good taste in his mouth.

1541
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,640
The whole thing about city walker.

1542
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,620
Now I don't know if Griffin will be in the saga.

1543
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,600
They would never let that happen at Alpha.

1544
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,340
They're in a tight ship at Alpha.

1545
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,220
It's an Omega problem.

1546
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:52,220
Well, you know, because there's differences like in at Alpha, they have grip at sandwiches, but Omega, they have home run handhelds.

1547
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,120
So there is a difference.

1548
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,540
They are different.

1549
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,120
Yeah.

1550
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:58,940
Oh, my God.

1551
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,880
You said that was so much base in your voice.

1552
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,640
What was it?

1553
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:03,620
Handhelds.

1554
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,540
Home run handheld.

1555
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,420
Home run handhelds.

1556
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,160
Like a like a Scott Kahn DJ sample.

1557
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:08,620
Yeah.

1558
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,120
Yeah.

1559
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,500
I like it.

1560
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,540
Where'd you find this handheld?

1561
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,620
Handheld is really weird to call your sandwich a handheld.

1562
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,820
That is a thing.

1563
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,400
That is a thing now that restaurants.

1564
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,040
Where?

1565
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,500
I know what he's saying.

1566
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:32,000
Yeah, no, this is like on restaurants or if you watch food reviewers online, they'll talk about mains and handhelds.

1567
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,100
I hate mains.

1568
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,400
I hate mains.

1569
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,840
I also really hate when people like you hate the term mains.

1570
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,680
You love main.

1571
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,680
Yeah, I like an entree.

1572
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:51,740
But when when someone like someone online refers to something as very delicious or so delicious, it's like nails on a chalkboard to me.

1573
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,300
Like, I don't know why.

1574
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:53,920
Very delicious.

1575
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:54,760
Very delicious.

1576
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,380
Someone saying, oh, it's so delicious or it's very delicious.

1577
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,420
I like I don't know why.

1578
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,820
It just gives me the willies.

1579
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,040
The word delicious.

1580
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,200
No, no, it's the modifier.

1581
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,420
Like delicious should be enough.

1582
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,480
What about what about so delicious?

1583
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,240
No, you just that's why I'm saying very delicious or so delicious.

1584
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:15,880
I've got one.

1585
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,240
What about so delicious?

1586
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,000
Jason, Steve is steaming again.

1587
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,320
I hate.

1588
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:23,880
I'm just bad.

1589
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,120
I'm just what about ultra ultra ultra delicious?

1590
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,800
I actually don't mind ultra delicious.

1591
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,220
OK, I think it's kind of that's that might be the plus.

1592
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,760
So wait, like a super movie, super delicious, super.

1593
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,760
Yeah, I think I'm OK with that.

1594
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,020
Maybe it's just more oomph in ultra and super.

1595
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:46,860
Huh?

1596
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,220
So so and very aren't enough, but super and ultra are just right.

1597
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:56,380
Yeah, that that first off, it better be really good if you're using those.

1598
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,480
What about Alpha Delicious?

1599
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,840
Well, that's OK.

1600
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,480
Yeah, because I respect the multiverse.

1601
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:07,440
Listen up, vloggers, get creative, bloggers and vloggers.

1602
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,900
Get creative with your words or Jason's got a paddle coming for you.

1603
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,880
I don't care how many seconds you got on Tic Tac.

1604
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,120
You know, you don't need to waste it.

1605
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,260
So delicious and very delicious.

1606
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,820
I was you know what I was looking through and that's why I didn't hear him say so.

1607
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:30,000
I was trying to find my meal from twenty twenty one and I found it.

1608
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,460
I had a chicken like salad of some kind.

1609
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,160
Well, you had the hot chicken salad.

1610
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:40,600
I had a hot chicken sandwich and mine was noticeably better.

1611
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,900
Yeah, mine was very good, but I did get a Manhattan with it.

1612
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,420
Wow.

1613
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,560
So I remember that and then get it.

1614
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,860
And I looked at this foosball table that they have at the Hollywood location.

1615
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:57,040
And having just seen this foosball table a few days ago, it is so much cleaner and nice.

1616
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,120
Oh, that's a photo from twenty twenty one.

1617
01:02:59,200 --> 01:02:59,380
Yes.

1618
01:02:59,500 --> 01:02:59,920
And that.

1619
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:00,440
Wow.

1620
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,000
You're right.

1621
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,920
Because yes, we ended up doing this just a few days ago.

1622
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,840
Mike and I were up there with friend of the show, Kevin Tully from the band, Telethon.

1623
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:14,480
And that we I requested to sit at the oh, there you were at it with masks.

1624
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,200
Wow.

1625
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:15,860
Oh, wild.

1626
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:24,280
Well, anyway, this time we went up there and it was pretty slow and slow enough that I was like, I'm going to get greedy here.

1627
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:24,540
Yeah.

1628
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,900
Can we can we sit at one of the foosball tables?

1629
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:33,840
Because if you don't know, they have long tables that are foosball tables as well as dining tables.

1630
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,180
Yes.

1631
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,140
This is, you know, because it's like that we haven't said really what the restaurant is.

1632
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:47,800
This is the ultimate sports bar sports fan location where the prize are called Bases Loaded and his TV is playing all the games you can imagine.

1633
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,380
And then you've got you can sit at a foosball table.

1634
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:57,820
And I've never gotten to do it because I've only been there in, you know, stupid, dumb groups of five or less.

1635
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,120
And we were only three.

1636
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,640
But there was nobody at the table.

1637
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,800
And I was like, I'm going to take a swing.

1638
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,140
Let me see if I can load these bases.

1639
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,840
We're in sports Xanadu after all.

1640
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,100
And she kind of grimaced.

1641
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,180
I was like, oh, it's OK if you get the hostess.

1642
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,300
And then she's like, you know what?

1643
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:13,620
It's slow.

1644
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,300
You can do it.

1645
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:14,860
Yes.

1646
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:15,440
Yeah.

1647
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:21,340
The victory of even though we are only a little corner that we got the foosball table felt so great.

1648
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,860
So there's like, you know, there's a couple of layers of glass up on top, but you can use cans.

1649
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:30,140
You do still have access to the top to like put the ball in and play.

1650
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:47,460
And the only issue becomes that if you're going to eat some handhelds and you've been touching, you know, really markedly dirty balls, much the dirtiest balls, visibly dirty, not just you know, people have dirty balls.

1651
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,380
I'm just saying it looks like it's decaying.

1652
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,580
It looks like you can see the germs that have grown on it.

1653
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,300
Yeah, there's food.

1654
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,290
There's greasy hands.

1655
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,030
It's just very scratched up.

1656
01:04:56,090 --> 01:05:00,130
I mean, a foosball is going to get lots of wear and tear regardless of where.

1657
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,610
But then the handles, it's such a touchy game.

1658
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:02,930
Yeah.

1659
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:09,590
And that kind of hadn't occurred to me till we were sitting down and then we had the dance the entire time of like, well, do you want to wash your hands now?

1660
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,230
Yeah, I'll wash your hands.

1661
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:11,090
Well, you know, why don't we?

1662
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,070
OK, let's play a little foosball.

1663
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:13,030
Then we'll wash our hands.

1664
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:15,530
It was like when we went bowling at downtown Disney.

1665
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:16,230
Oh, yeah.

1666
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:17,050
You're right.

1667
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:17,910
You were there for that.

1668
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:18,590
Yeah.

1669
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:20,910
These things are maybe not.

1670
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,970
That was very handled to like sushi.

1671
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:28,530
Buffalo sauce on the lane pepperoni grease on the.

1672
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:31,590
Yeah, but that pepperoni grease added to you getting all those strikes.

1673
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:32,250
That's right.

1674
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:33,190
Yeah, sure.

1675
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:35,610
Jason bowled a turkey, then ate a turkey.

1676
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:38,070
Your full turkey.

1677
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:48,430
I only just learned that the what I ordered when we went out there all those years ago seems to have been removed from the menu.

1678
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:51,450
The drink I ordered, which was a float.

1679
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:53,710
It was a black cherry soda float.

1680
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:54,410
Oh, yeah.

1681
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:56,410
So it was a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.

1682
01:05:56,450 --> 01:06:00,650
And then they poured like IBC or Hanks black cherry in it.

1683
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:05,970
I was wondering because I wrote down I guessed off of the current menu what you got.

1684
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:09,190
My guess was a chocolate cherry cordial float.

1685
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,370
We're seeing you order that with dinner.

1686
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:13,310
I believe not alcohol.

1687
01:06:14,090 --> 01:06:15,370
Unless it's spiked.

1688
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:16,970
Is that on the current menu?

1689
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:18,330
That is on the current menu.

1690
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,690
Is that possibly what you got?

1691
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:21,770
That is I believe what I got.

1692
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:23,430
Or maybe that was the you know what?

1693
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:24,270
Maybe that was the menu.

1694
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:26,410
Maybe I took a picture of the menu in twenty twenty one.

1695
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:27,330
I'm all confused.

1696
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,450
Alpha Omega twenty twenty one twenty twenty four.

1697
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:29,850
I don't know.

1698
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:31,210
You're learning, Scott.

1699
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:32,050
You're learning.

1700
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,430
Embrace the confusion.

1701
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,870
It might have had a hint.

1702
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:36,350
Yeah.

1703
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:37,390
Little chocolate syrup.

1704
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,670
It was delicious.

1705
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:42,930
But it was also a little chilly out to be drinking.

1706
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:43,510
It was a cold night.

1707
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:43,970
Yeah.

1708
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:46,570
Can you what is a cherry cordial?

1709
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:50,870
Well, like a cherry cordial is like, you know, like a sweet cherry.

1710
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:52,850
It's a cherry covered in chocolate.

1711
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:56,110
You would get it in like a Russell Stover's or a Whitman sampler.

1712
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:57,010
Got it.

1713
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:58,030
So what is cordial?

1714
01:06:58,110 --> 01:06:59,590
What is the actual word mean?

1715
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:03,230
Before Jason eats it, he says, please and thank you.

1716
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,150
It's a polite thing.

1717
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:10,930
Sort of an old formality kind of a thing.

1718
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:11,990
I'm not a chocolate.

1719
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,350
All right.

1720
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:16,590
Because like, could you have like a strawberry cordial?

1721
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:20,170
Would that just be a chocolate covered strawberry or anything?

1722
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:20,630
Yeah.

1723
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,310
What is the cordialing process?

1724
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:24,450
It is not.

1725
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:26,910
It says warm and friendly.

1726
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,070
Well, that's true.

1727
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,790
You're looking up the definition.

1728
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:31,250
Yeah.

1729
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:31,670
Yes.

1730
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:35,190
No, dessert definition, dessert cordial definition.

1731
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:37,530
Define chocolate cordial.

1732
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:39,690
Liquid filling is placed within a chocolate shell.

1733
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:45,750
So it needs yes, because the cross sections I'm looking at, there's like a little goo that comes out.

1734
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:46,350
Yes.

1735
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:48,970
That little goo makes all the difference.

1736
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:50,850
I love cherry cordials.

1737
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,490
I love.

1738
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:54,230
So when I saw that on the menu, I got very excited.

1739
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:56,330
Is it milk chocolate generally?

1740
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:56,790
Do we know?

1741
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:58,630
I think it can vary.

1742
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:03,430
But usually it's milk chocolate goo that's injected probably with a syringe.

1743
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:08,330
Well, I think it's like a variation of like a maraschino cherry.

1744
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:08,930
Right.

1745
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:10,630
But it would have to be injected.

1746
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:14,810
It would have to be administered by some sort of professional.

1747
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:16,770
Yeah, it could be injected by a machine.

1748
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:18,250
Well, what else would it be?

1749
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:18,930
Like a tooth sum?

1750
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:19,850
Yeah, sure.

1751
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:21,270
Like a doctor's tooth sum.

1752
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:23,050
By Professor Dr.

1753
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:23,770
Tooth Sum.

1754
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:24,690
Yeah.

1755
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:27,410
I went in Philadelphia.

1756
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:33,130
There used to be a soda company that had a black cherry Wishniac soda.

1757
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:35,670
And for years, I didn't know what that was.

1758
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:36,730
Wishniac specifically?

1759
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:37,290
Wishniac.

1760
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:41,610
I believe it's an Eastern European like dessert or treat.

1761
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:49,110
And when this company was trying different flavors, the immigrant owner was like, oh, it tastes like a Wishniac.

1762
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:51,790
So that is how that soda got its name.

1763
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:52,470
But I think.

1764
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:52,830
Oh, OK.

1765
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:53,650
Wishniac.

1766
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:54,370
Wishniac.

1767
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:55,010
Well, here it is.

1768
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:55,570
This must be a.

1769
01:08:55,650 --> 01:09:01,790
Because here it is in one of the top Google results, Philadelphia magazine, and they call it the cheesesteak of beverages.

1770
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:02,750
Yeah, yeah.

1771
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:06,490
So I think Frank's was the original soda company.

1772
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:08,050
I think they're out of business.

1773
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:09,990
You know who wrote the article.

1774
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:10,890
Yeah.

1775
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,470
The Car Cub reporter wrote it.

1776
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,690
He wrote it on.

1777
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:15,750
He wrote it at great expense to himself.

1778
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:18,070
He brought ten Wishniacs to write it.

1779
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:24,490
Chopping on some Wishniacs and a big cheesesteak in an Amarosa's roll, you know.

1780
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:27,950
One Wishniac equals one cheesesteak.

1781
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:30,370
That's the Philadelphia exchange rate.

1782
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:41,990
Just to make sure that we are covering Alpha and Omega, we've been talking about a lot of a lot of Omega, which I've you know what?

1783
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:44,070
Actually, just to say a little more about that really quick.

1784
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:53,170
I this has become for me the place that at CityWalk Hollywood that is not awful because we had a big debate with Kevin.

1785
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:53,530
Yeah.

1786
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:55,170
Where do we go that isn't terrible?

1787
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:58,810
And we were running through things on list things we're going to have to face in this saga later.

1788
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:00,110
And we kept going.

1789
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,770
Tad it didn't like it.

1790
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:03,210
Gave me food poisoning.

1791
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:09,450
And I think now and actually somebody did just ask me where should where do I get a drink after a movie at CityWalk Hollywood?

1792
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:13,430
And I said, well, you know, I don't want to give it away.

1793
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:17,950
There was another place where I was like, don't get food there, but just a drink might be fine.

1794
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,310
Right.

1795
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,190
This has become my like this is OK.

1796
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:23,110
I'm not going to give it higher than OK.

1797
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:23,490
Yeah.

1798
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:26,090
I'm no Nashville hot chicken sandwich experts.

1799
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:28,510
You might like you might bristle at my opinions.

1800
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:30,370
They have been fine when I've had them.

1801
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:34,450
Jason, I think I did it at Omega or no.

1802
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:34,650
Sorry.

1803
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:35,170
Alpha.

1804
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:36,130
I did.

1805
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:39,390
I think like a slider equivalent, right, which was not nearly as good.

1806
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:41,250
But also I tend to like their beers.

1807
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:43,930
I tend to like a good IPA, a good old fashioned.

1808
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:44,990
That's all I need.

1809
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:51,350
And this place offers that and is so far not offered me a horrible night's sleep because of indigestion.

1810
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,230
So that's my general review of the franchise.

1811
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:55,170
High praise.

1812
01:10:56,330 --> 01:11:00,270
This place feels like and I it's not taking any swings.

1813
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,750
A sport reference there.

1814
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:02,590
Thank you.

1815
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:04,490
It's not taking any big swings.

1816
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,770
Yes, Mike, you give me.

1817
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:08,110
It's not taking any big swings.

1818
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:12,190
It's very much food that your dad won't bat an eyelash at.

1819
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,250
Dad is going to be comfortable there.

1820
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:14,810
No dad.

1821
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:18,910
And I think like even because I like Antequitos and I won't talk about it yet.

1822
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:23,230
But like there's you're going to find a couple weirder things on that menu here.

1823
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:26,410
I feel like they were they made a very conscious choice.

1824
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,410
Simple stuff on the menu.

1825
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:29,550
The basics.

1826
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:32,310
They don't try to do anything fancy.

1827
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:33,330
Potato skin.

1828
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:34,410
It's consistent.

1829
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:37,030
It's a very consistent place.

1830
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:44,290
I don't know if I would say it's my favorite, but I do know where you're coming from because I would reliably suggest.

1831
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,550
Well, that you won't be upset probably going there.

1832
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:49,590
That would be what I would say.

1833
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,270
Where we're at.

1834
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:50,950
High praise.

1835
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,390
Wall of TVs.

1836
01:11:52,390 --> 01:12:02,410
This is really you guys ever stop and think about when in if if any of us ever go to like an actually good restaurant and you're having an actually good meal and then you think about how much time we've spent.

1837
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,110
And it's not all because of the podcast.

1838
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:06,430
I can't blame the audience of the sector keeper.

1839
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:07,690
That one with Kevin.

1840
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,730
That was just like let's go to city walk.

1841
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:11,290
We do it on purpose.

1842
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,230
Yeah, it was not for the show.

1843
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:18,730
And this is and our highest praise to offer any restaurant is won't make you unhappy.

1844
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:19,330
You won't be upset.

1845
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:20,850
Dad would be fine with it.

1846
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,070
Won't make you ill.

1847
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:25,310
That's all you can ask for from these places.

1848
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:26,950
It's really insane.

1849
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:28,950
Another thing about Alpha.

1850
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:35,270
I ended up there with you, Mike, just kind of for a drink and a little bit of food there.

1851
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:36,050
I went upstate.

1852
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:37,930
It is a massive footprint.

1853
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:39,290
This huge two stories.

1854
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:40,530
It's a little here in Hollywood.

1855
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:44,930
It replaced fallen brother Tony Roma's and fit into that space.

1856
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:47,310
But it's two stories in Alpha.

1857
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:50,670
It's it could fit 900 people.

1858
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,110
It's so massive.

1859
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:53,310
How big it is.

1860
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:54,710
Why?

1861
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:56,410
It's an arena.

1862
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:58,050
Yes.

1863
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:59,350
High school gym.

1864
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:04,250
I remember an amount of people where you might require like a special ops to feed all of them.

1865
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:06,150
Like a disaster has happened.

1866
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:13,750
It's the first place I went getting off the plane after I got went to the hotel and I was like, oh, where's the bathroom?

1867
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:16,650
And then somebody told me and the bathroom was so far.

1868
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:19,390
I remember walking and walking upstairs and walking over.

1869
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:20,990
I mean, it's not that far.

1870
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:22,490
You take that.

1871
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,550
No, this doesn't get you to the bathroom.

1872
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:28,410
And I was like, I couldn't believe when I got used to it, it was fine.

1873
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,790
But one the first trip, I went, oh, my God, this place.

1874
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,010
This is huge.

1875
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:32,410
I know.

1876
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:35,770
And I had just seen you after a day of plane debacle.

1877
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:36,870
After you missing your flight.

1878
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,930
I just seen you as excited to see you.

1879
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:41,330
And then like, I'm going to go to the bathroom and you're gone for a while.

1880
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:43,490
And then I had to go.

1881
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:48,470
And I remember nearly broke my foot, very nearly broke my foot.

1882
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,230
So I'm hot.

1883
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,170
And this is the worst that it was of the trip.

1884
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:54,050
So I'm hobbling up many, many flights of stairs.

1885
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:54,670
Right.

1886
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:57,210
I would say it like it keeps getting longer and longer.

1887
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:00,390
I look, I'm going to make this very brief.

1888
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:03,130
When I'm on a plane, I don't want to go to the bathroom.

1889
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:05,470
And when I say go, I mean, go to the bathroom.

1890
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:10,750
So I think this was the first time my body relaxed was at the NBC sports bar and grill.

1891
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:13,990
So I had to go to the bathroom there.

1892
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:16,250
Oh, the longer go means.

1893
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:17,110
And I didn't come back.

1894
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:17,990
I'm not crass.

1895
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:22,230
I would be crass on this mic for shock value sometimes like I'm going to be right now.

1896
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,490
But I'm not going to tell Scott.

1897
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,310
Oh, by the way, I got to go take a shit.

1898
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,910
Like we're at a Six Flags or something.

1899
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:28,530
I'm not going to say that.

1900
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:28,750
Yeah.

1901
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,910
You're not going to say you will not say take a shit on this show.

1902
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,810
No, no, I won't do.

1903
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,650
I said I'll say it on the show, but I was going to say it in person.

1904
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:37,130
I wasn't going to build when we were sitting there.

1905
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:42,430
You didn't tell me at the time that this is my show persona and I would not bring that into the real world.

1906
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:47,830
Wait, so you're more uptight in person is what you're saying.

1907
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,010
A lot more uptight in person.

1908
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:49,490
Yeah.

1909
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:51,630
You thought I was my character on the show is uptight.

1910
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:52,250
Mm hmm.

1911
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:54,750
Haven't seen anything until you've hung out with me.

1912
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,090
I have to go.

1913
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:58,530
And then you write down on a napkin asterisk.

1914
01:14:58,890 --> 01:14:59,430
Oh, asterisk.

1915
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,930
Oh, I couldn't even say the word fill in.

1916
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:07,350
I couldn't even say the words bathroom to the person working there to ask.

1917
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:09,270
Where are the rooms?

1918
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:11,390
This the special room.

1919
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:12,670
The watcher closets.

1920
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:13,590
The rooms with sinks.

1921
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:14,130
Could we know?

1922
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:16,430
I need to powder my nose.

1923
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:18,030
If you know what I'm saying.

1924
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:18,610
You want a bump?

1925
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:19,230
I got that.

1926
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:35,490
When I went up there, my bathroom experience once I got there is that after, again, foot as bad as it could be, then I almost slipped.

1927
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:38,010
There was like as there was a spill up there and I'm not.

1928
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:42,090
I think it's maybe something that just happened from a sink or a urinal.

1929
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:44,630
I don't think I'm not saying that the bathrooms are particularly dirty.

1930
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:46,210
Foosball rolled off the table.

1931
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:51,650
Waiter went flying into the bath.

1932
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:53,230
All his drinks spilled.

1933
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:57,490
No, you know, just, you know, a spill that could happen.

1934
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:58,070
It did happen.

1935
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:01,010
But I slipped a little bit and like, oh, that's the last thing I need.

1936
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:06,690
And it was bad enough that I was like, maybe I should warn the guy next to me at the urinal.

1937
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:07,770
Next to me.

1938
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:19,870
And I and like, you know, I should be nice and just make sure he and then I turn and look and he is the kind of teetery drunk where he might just like collapse against the wall and be there for.

1939
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,710
He doesn't need a spill to slip.

1940
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:22,910
No, anything.

1941
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,790
Anything could do it.

1942
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:25,050
You might need my help more than anybody.

1943
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:31,840
But so I'm weighing that versus like I might maybe I don't want to talk to this person eventually like should be should do the right thing here.

1944
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:38,800
And I'm tired now and I've had a couple of drinks, so I kind of like not gracefully like there's just about didn't want to bother.

1945
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:43,280
There's like a spill there and I almost I also I just want to make sure you don't.

1946
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,480
So I'm just letting you know, there's just slip there.

1947
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:51,020
And then he gruffed at me like a horse and turned and stared at the wall again.

1948
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:58,940
Truly should like like I'm in a like I'm in an old saloon in a Western.

1949
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,300
I've been happier to see that menu.

1950
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,260
Let me ask you this.

1951
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,240
Were there screens or anything above the urinals?

1952
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:07,300
I don't remember.

1953
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,200
Don't you might have been trying to watch the big game?

1954
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,720
Maybe it was 10 p.

1955
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:13,920
m.

1956
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,280
Or whatever was on something.

1957
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,440
I mean, we're racing or the horse racing with the cart.

1958
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:24,040
There were people in there watching various big games.

1959
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,320
Tell me more about the theming boys.

1960
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:32,900
It's kind of a boring theme wall of general yellow stories of not a lot.

1961
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:38,460
It's like black with white text and the white text will say like a year when NBC did something important.

1962
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:44,160
And they'll be like these like kind of like art pieces on the wall.

1963
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,720
I don't even know.

1964
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:50,180
This seems like it's like some scribbly like scribbly.

1965
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:52,920
I'm not sure if that's like a sock to soccer players.

1966
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,480
I think it's like kind of a yellow background.

1967
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:00,240
And the style is very like sketchy and it's like they're not hard lines that just outline.

1968
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,720
It's like almost like you were just doing a rough sketch.

1969
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:04,800
It's a gastropug.

1970
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:05,840
It's a gastropug.

1971
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,500
Just get it up.

1972
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,320
We got people in here and drinking.

1973
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,160
They don't care about cool art.

1974
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:10,780
Yeah.

1975
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,940
They didn't commemorate the trade of Al Michaels with Oswald.

1976
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,680
Not that we saw, but you talked about that before on the show.

1977
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:21,620
Yeah.

1978
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,240
Yes.

1979
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,680
In order to get the rights back to Walt's original character.

1980
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,040
Yeah.

1981
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,780
They had to give up Al Michaels football announcer.

1982
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:33,620
But I think that's the only that's the only shake of hands between Mickey's glove and Woody Woodpecker's.

1983
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,640
I'll say love again.

1984
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,660
It'll never happen again.

1985
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,620
One thing that they have something that Mike and I noticed there.

1986
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,020
This is only in Alpha, not Omega.

1987
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:54,480
There's a big sign next to a booth and it says, Do you have a sports topic you feel passionate about?

1988
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:59,120
Pick up this phone and get ready to share your thoughts on the radio.

1989
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,020
Our producers will get you ready and our hosts will bring you on the air.

1990
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:05,460
And it's in quotes.

1991
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,360
So that that implies like a backtracking.

1992
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,620
This this seemed it was locked, right?

1993
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,620
Well, it was it was not locked.

1994
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:20,120
What it what it was is they put two like children's booster seats in the way to block you from getting into the actual booth.

1995
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:27,260
So no one could actually get in there because they're they're just or whatever you would call them like the high chairs for children.

1996
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:35,440
I need to tell everyone Aaron Rogers is a true teller and he's got the real scoop.

1997
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,800
He's the only guy brave enough to tell the truth.

1998
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,860
That's almost like the way Six Flags would say this riot is down.

1999
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,420
Yeah, they just put like a folding chair, like lean it up against the entrance.

2000
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,960
Say it without saying it.

2001
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,620
It was still lit up and it said on air, though.

2002
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,240
I think maybe they couldn't turn it off.

2003
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,360
Maybe there's no way to do it.

2004
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:58,200
The house lights.

2005
01:19:58,540 --> 01:19:58,800
They can't.

2006
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,360
They lost the remote.

2007
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,860
Turn that off if we wanted to.

2008
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,040
Yep.

2009
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,880
And that's that's really what ultimately if we're comparing them, that wasn't part of the mission.

2010
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:16,980
But I do got to give it up to Alpha bigger, more inexplicable stranger.

2011
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:18,660
I don't know.

2012
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,120
I had a good time there.

2013
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:29,000
Yeah, I think it's and again, it's like I really felt like this is a hangout for people in a way that and that's in general with with Orlando versus Hollywood.

2014
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:33,420
That was my feeling that people had just come to watch a game.

2015
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:36,700
And so the bar was very active even as the place was closing.

2016
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:42,360
So I was like, oh, this is just I was like that was the first night even be I was just like this place alive.

2017
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,380
I felt like this place so much more alive than Hollywood is.

2018
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:53,420
And you said that about a place with a booth that had booster chairs inside where I encountered a horse man peeing.

2019
01:20:54,440 --> 01:21:02,740
And that was I think there were probably like 20 people in there after what they've done to our beloved city walk Hollywood taken out how the moon taken out saddle ranch.

2020
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,740
There's no nightlife there anymore.

2021
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:06,420
They've gotten rid of all the bars we hated.

2022
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,700
It's not alive.

2023
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:08,920
It's dead.

2024
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,660
You know, so so I was like, oh, this is where the energy still is.

2025
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,720
This is where the action is.

2026
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:14,660
It's Orlando.

2027
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:19,740
OK, so if we have to make the ruling, I think that I think Alpha is better.

2028
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,780
I would like to get that booth open again.

2029
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,740
So maybe that gruff urinating man gruff gruff on the radio.

2030
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,140
Yeah.

2031
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,020
What do you see?

2032
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:28,920
Just said, I don't know.

2033
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,680
It was like a bunch of it was just a bunch of guttural noises.

2034
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,780
And I'm worried that 20 percent of it was racist.

2035
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:35,740
Oh, OK.

2036
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:38,060
And then he beat the shit out of that urinal.

2037
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,080
I pretended you're the world.

2038
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,560
This is what I want to do to you.

2039
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:48,900
Well, I think I feel like that's that's getting us there.

2040
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:49,480
I think.

2041
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,020
Do we do good?

2042
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,960
Boys, boys, you did it.

2043
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,580
You completed phase one, sector three.

2044
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:56,060
Yay.

2045
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:56,700
Wow.

2046
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:57,700
Well, you know what?

2047
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,080
I think I see the I see the stone.

2048
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:01,560
Yes.

2049
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,940
And it looks like.

2050
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:06,820
Wait, it's it's a circle, but it's blank.

2051
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,200
It's blank.

2052
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,100
You know what?

2053
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:12,080
I bet this means I'm just going to take a wild stab here.

2054
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:17,980
I think that this is only half of a sector stone and that you, the listeners, have to

2055
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:18,760
complete it.

2056
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:27,580
We can't truly change the rift in the multiverse unless you fill a circle with Jason Sheridan

2057
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:28,680
in the circle.

2058
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:33,260
You have to go into the movie and find Jason and then cut it out, put a circle, put it

2059
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:34,180
in a circle shape.

2060
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:37,880
And only then will we have the stone for phase one, sector three.

2061
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:43,680
And if you happen to be in Europe and you watch it, maybe this year I'll get another

2062
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,760
eleven dollar check in the mail.

2063
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,260
Who knows?

2064
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,860
OK, so do it in Europe if you can.

2065
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:55,000
Be sure to note that you are in Europe and prove it like a red.

2066
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,520
Angela Merkel, I know you're listening.

2067
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:02,360
Show us your screen name and then like you in front of a European landmark or just a

2068
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,920
sign with a different language on it.

2069
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:04,100
Sure.

2070
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:05,780
And that should work.

2071
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:11,820
Well, OK, so, you know, our mission is not fully complete, but the phase is complete.

2072
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,540
This is our first phase.

2073
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:13,940
Yeah.

2074
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:14,520
Wow.

2075
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,660
It feels so much different than than the other than just a regular sector happens.

2076
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:19,720
Right.

2077
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:20,460
Yeah.

2078
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:23,520
Is there anything else different we should know about one of phase ends?

2079
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,740
Well, yeah.

2080
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:31,380
OK, so, boys, you should you should know that tomorrow begins phase two, obviously.

2081
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,060
OK, OK.

2082
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:33,160
We got to like kick it into gear.

2083
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,940
This is going to we got to step it up somehow.

2084
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:35,940
You're sensing right.

2085
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:39,160
Everyone's brain is on a multi-level plane at this point.

2086
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:39,680
OK.

2087
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:45,020
Boys, this phase requires a very special mission for this phase.

2088
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:48,080
You must not just talk about Orlando.

2089
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,560
You must go to Orlando.

2090
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,640
Yeah, but we like I feel like we did it already.

2091
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:58,000
I mean, we we went to Orlando and we talked about all this stuff and we came back.

2092
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:02,600
Yes, you know, you've talked about it, but this this one must be recorded in Orlando

2093
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,100
before a live audience.

2094
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:06,720
Oh, OK.

2095
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:07,340
Wow.

2096
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,100
OK.

2097
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,000
Well, that's it.

2098
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,280
Whoa.

2099
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,560
We've never we haven't brought an audience in.

2100
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,940
Never on the on a on a on a saga before.

2101
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,100
This is a big challenge.

2102
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,040
This is a big step up for phase two.

2103
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:22,720
And I'm just you know, I'm just glad I got you guys to to to back me up.

2104
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,280
I think we're going to I think we can do this thing.

2105
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:24,780
We can do great.

2106
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,780
And Secretary Kuper, I'm so glad you'll be there with us, too.

2107
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,320
Oh, yeah.

2108
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:34,700
So about that, I mean, you know, like the multiverse is vast and mysterious.

2109
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:37,460
And I can't be at all parts of it at once.

2110
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:38,340
All right.

2111
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,020
So you're not OK.

2112
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,000
So you're not going to be fine.

2113
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:40,240
All right.

2114
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,860
That's a fancy way of saying you're not going to be there.

2115
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,480
That is it.

2116
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:50,060
But that's a fancier way of saying you might need a little help from some different keepers.

2117
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,240
Oh, interesting.

2118
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:52,860
Whoa.

2119
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:53,620
There's other.

2120
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,420
I mean, we've met.

2121
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,300
We know we've met keepers.

2122
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,620
But we wow, we might have to encounter one there.

2123
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,960
Yes, there'll be one there and he'll guide you.

2124
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:06,340
OK, one that I actually have a good relationship with and has not taken money from me since I won the power.

2125
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:07,900
Oh, wow.

2126
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:09,920
One of the good ones.

2127
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,740
Yes, one of the good keepers.

2128
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,820
One of the good ones.

2129
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,000
Oh, this.

2130
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,660
Oh, blessed today, there will be one of the good keepers waiting for us in Orlando.

2131
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:21,200
And I guess waiting waiting for you tomorrow.

2132
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:22,800
Listeners to hear this.

2133
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:23,700
OK, great.

2134
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,660
Well, thank you for thank you for preparing us.

2135
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,100
Thank you for getting another keeper ready.

2136
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:28,800
You got it.

2137
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:29,620
Thank you, boys.

2138
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:31,440
Jason, I just have one question.

2139
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,300
Jason, can I get a ride to church?

2140
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,320
You know it, buddy.

2141
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:37,380
You know it.

2142
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,560
You did the morning.

2143
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,660
You're going to go to another.

2144
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:40,360
We're going back.

2145
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,100
Shonies on the way.

2146
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:46,200
Yeah, we got to hit one of the less than 20 Shonies remaining.

2147
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,100
One of them is in California.

2148
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:49,820
Oh, God.

2149
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:50,960
I don't know if they are.

2150
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:56,200
Well, again, that's probably where some of these like gates and the doors and everything.

2151
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,720
Shonies plays heavily in all of this.

2152
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,620
Oh, maybe in the toilet at Sizzler, there's a gateway to Shonies.

2153
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:03,800
You're learning.

2154
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,480
Now you're thinking multiversal.

2155
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,200
Yes.

2156
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:09,300
OK, great.

2165
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,500
Jason and sector keeper.

2166
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,880
But not he'll be.

2167
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:41,660
He stays at home.

2168
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,280
A different keeper in Orlando.

2169
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:45,260
Wow.
