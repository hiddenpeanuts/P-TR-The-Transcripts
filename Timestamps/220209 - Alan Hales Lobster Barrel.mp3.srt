1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,920
Well folks, you asked for it.

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,080
It's Alan Hales Lobster Barrel at last

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,080
on podcast The Ride the Second Gate

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,440
thanks to Celebruary,

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,560
our ongoing celebration of celebrity owned restaurants.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,920
I'm Scott Gardiner, Jason Sheridan joins us.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,560
Scott, I'm thrilled to talk about the various preparations

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,780
of seafood today.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,120
Bakes and broils and weird last names

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,160
after names of food that you know.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,520
Featuring cream, lemon, paprika.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,480
That's kind of it.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,440
That's all you need.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,680
Mike Carlson, hi.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm here and I was thinking about this.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,920
There's probably a better example in fiction,

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,320
but this is something Jason knows.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,600
So there's a run of X-Men comics

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,480
written by our favorite guy, Grant Morrison.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,280
And they introduce a character at the start of his run

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,840
called Zorn.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,560
And Zorn is like a very gentle character.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,660
He's a healer.

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,720
The students love him.

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,840
He's a teacher.

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,320
Well, spoiler alert, cut to the end of like a multi-year run.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
Zorn is unmasked as Magneto, okay?

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,160
I feel like now we've finally sort of unmasked

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,840
what's happened here with our podcast.

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,640
Yes, Disney World, Disneyland.

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,440
F off, no.

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,480
Really what we wanna talk about is a guy on a shitty show

34
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,480
from the 60s who had a restaurant

35
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,400
because it's kitschy and it's not like,

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,680
this is our unmasking is what I'm saying.

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,640
This is finally a multi-year con

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
we've been pulling on you listeners

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,760
to suck you in with just like rides you like.

40
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,040
We're three Zorns.

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,600
That's right, we're three Zorns.

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,520
Three Zorns, yeah.

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
And even this episode is a Zorn

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
because some of the appeal,

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,520
I mean, when we started talking about doing this series,

46
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,240
obviously the big names that you know came up.

47
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,280
Yes, of course.

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,640
Very quickly, Alan Hale Jr., Lobster Barrel

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,000
and some of the newspaper print ads

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,440
that advertise some of the other celebrity restaurants

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,680
in the neck of the woods.

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
Yes.

53
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,640
I can't remember what really pushed us over the edge

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,880
to do this month, but this was one of them, right?

55
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,120
This is one of the first things we,

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,360
oh, we gotta, we gotta do Alan Hale's Lobster Barrel.

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
It's a show I don't even like that he was on.

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,960
Well, this is where,

60
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,120
you just revealed something in that intro.

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,800
This is very Aaron Sorkin of you.

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,640
Oh, yes.

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,460
Sounds like you think this is a show

64
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,360
that if we looked at it today,

65
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,800
we would say that's not very funny.

66
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,440
That's a good point.

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,800
Now, I don't know either way.

68
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,560
Now, actually, Sorkin's description of I Love Lucy

69
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,080
where it's like, I don't know, it was on

70
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,120
if I was home with a toothache or whatever,

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,040
that's kind of like Gilligan's Island for me.

72
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,720
I would say like it's on.

73
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,680
Like I have never had an opinion about it.

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
That's like have an opinion about the tree

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
outside of my house, it's there.

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,160
It's just, it's there.

77
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,360
Okay, I mean, maybe I was being a little,

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,280
I was exaggerating a little bit.

79
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,600
I have not watched a ton of Gilligan's Island,

80
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,120
but it never really grabbed me.

81
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,640
I appreciate the kitsch of it.

82
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,880
I appreciate the time in which it was created

83
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,620
and that it was a success.

84
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,560
But anytime I've ever watched it,

85
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,200
I just like it if like it's the movie version

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
with the Harlem Globetrotters on the island.

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,480
I appreciate that aspect of it

88
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,660
and like the making a radio out of a coconut.

89
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,640
I do like that.

90
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,920
It's given us a lot of good cultural references,

91
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,720
I feel like, and it's given, I don't know,

92
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,840
it's a very funny idea for a show

93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,480
and a show that ran for so long

94
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,480
and made such a big imprint.

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,360
Well, yes, I mean, it keeps coming back.

96
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,480
There was a cartoon, which I have a video of.

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
The Gilligan's Planet, Hanna-Barbera spin-off where.

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,880
Oh, right.

99
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,360
Which has a terrible theme song,

100
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,200
which maybe I'll just play right now.

101
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't know this offhand.

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,480
Gilligan's Planet, which we one day also should do.

103
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,240
There were so many garbage Hanna-Barbera,

104
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,240
just cheap shit, Partridge Family, like future.

105
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,080
The Partridge Family was a future one.

106
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,920
It was like a year.

107
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
It was the Jetsons.

108
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,800
Yes, it was like a 25, 23.

109
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,240
It was like a Jetsons Partridge Family show.

110
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,080
Wow, wow.

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,200
And it was like, it looks exactly like the Jetsons,

112
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,080
but they just plugged the Partridge Family in it.

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,920
It's just.

114
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,560
Partridge Family 2200 AD.

115
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,520
Put AD in there.

116
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,680
So there's just so, if you go through the list

117
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,400
of everything that Hanna-Barbera ever produced,

118
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,560
there's so much crap, there's so much shit.

119
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,880
Yeah.

120
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,160
But I would say like, just real quick,

121
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,960
to sum up my thought is like,

122
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,400
I would put Gilligan's Island, even in the stuff,

123
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,720
the old shows that I like.

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
There's shows that are like,

125
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,400
Lucy is actually like pretty good and holds up.

126
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,200
I think much better than a lot of this stuff.

127
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,800
Lucy held my attention.

128
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,440
I feel like it was given a prime time spot

129
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,280
at Nick and I, but yeah, Gilligan's Island

130
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,200
was on the other broadcast channels

131
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,240
in the middle of the day.

132
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Dick Van Dyke is a better show than a lot of these shows.

133
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,640
Dick Van Dyke's show.

134
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,760
Yeah, yeah, of course.

135
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,040
And then there's these kitschy shows,

136
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
and I think that your mileage may vary.

137
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,560
Did you like I Dream of Jeannie better?

138
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,600
Did you like Bewitched better?

139
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,760
Because it just may be more, which thing do you like?

140
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,360
Do you think a witch is interesting?

141
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
Yeah.

142
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,040
Or that a Jeannie's interesting?

143
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,400
Now Samantha's not showing her midriff on Bewitched.

144
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,640
So is that a thing for I Dream of Jeannie?

145
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,440
You can see Barbara Eden's stomach.

146
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,520
Well, this is also like, I feel like the canary

147
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,240
in the coal mine of what was coming

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,360
of your fantasy islands or your love boats,

149
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,680
which are just like, guest star palooza,

150
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,680
like very chintzy story of the week.

151
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,760
So when I say shitty, I really,

152
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,720
I don't necessarily mean this is that much worse

153
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,520
than any of these other garbage that I like.

154
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,920
Have we explained that Alan Hale is the person

155
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,760
who played the skipper on the show?

156
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,560
I assume people know that, but I should not assume that.

157
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,800
Yeah, probably some basics need to be said.

158
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,960
Are you not playing the theme song?

159
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,600
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, but I have it here.

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,440
So this was a-

161
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,040
So now that you know that Alan Hale was the skipper

162
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,120
and he drove the boat, and the boat went on a three hour tour

163
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,200
and it crashed, and then they all had to live on the island,

164
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,400
and they kept going back to the island,

165
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,360
and I'm not sure why.

166
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,280
Now know that there is a space one, that was cartoon.

167
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,120
Good stuff.

168
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,120
We've got a brand new story about the castaways.

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,520
We left our tiny island after years and months and days.

170
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,520
We built a little spaceship.

171
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,200
It's crude, but it could fly.

172
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,040
The wooden spaceship.

173
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,080
We left the room and it was star way

174
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,880
between the stars and sky.

175
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,000
We went from an island to a star, lost on Gilligan's planet.

176
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,200
Gilligan and Skipper, the millionaire-

177
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,840
Just a tune-less minute long slog.

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,880
The star Mary Anne began a brand new life.

179
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,640
What creatures we encounter.

180
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,440
What riddles do we face?

181
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,680
Why don't they do a song?

182
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,840
Everybody's the main thing you don't even know.

183
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,840
It is strange, enchanting place.

184
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,720
Our adventures are the best by far.

185
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,560
We're on Gilligan's star planet.

186
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,480
They sounded annoyed that they had to do that.

187
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,320
Oh, I'm sure they were annoyed.

188
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,240
Like you could have so easily just taken

189
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
the regular Gilligan's Island theme,

190
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,680
which I think they were trying to do and update the lyrics.

191
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,560
What they did with the original Gilligan's Island,

192
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
they took it and they slowed it down

193
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,360
and they didn't sing it, they spoke it.

194
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,240
Yeah.

195
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,400
And added lines.

196
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,480
But it's them though.

197
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,320
It is them, yes.

198
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,160
It's all of them.

199
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,760
It's Don Wells, it's Bob Denver.

200
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,600
Wow, wow.

201
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,840
And not Hanna-Barbera, but Phil Mason.

202
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,680
Oh, is it right?

203
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,080
Similarly crappy.

204
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,920
All right.

205
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,740
I mean at times.

206
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,920
Hanna-Barbera was Partridge Family though.

207
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,760
Was it not?

208
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,600
I think so, yeah.

209
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,440
Okay.

210
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,320
Well, it's Sherwood Schwartz of Brady Bunch fame.

211
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,960
Like the Brady Bunch variety hour we discussed,

212
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,680
he had a hold on these people.

213
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,520
That's right.

214
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,360
He could get them to come back

215
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,760
and do whatever crappy iteration, all these dumb movies.

216
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,120
So many dumb movies.

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,960
Yeah, yeah.

218
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,920
Thank God though.

219
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,640
Thank God these people were dying to come back.

220
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,160
Dragging old people out

221
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,040
and forcing them to wear the costume.

222
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,000
Put on the thing.

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,560
It's what they know you for.

224
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,120
It'll make people smile.

225
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,560
But from what I could tell

226
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,060
about looking into the subject today, Alan Hale,

227
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,600
there was no dragging involved.

228
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,440
No, nope.

229
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,320
This guy loved being the skipper.

230
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,520
He would be the skipper for you

231
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,160
wherever you wanted him to be.

232
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,880
And that's kind of why seemingly he started

233
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,000
or at least lent his name to this restaurant.

234
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,200
Yeah, and also happy to be there,

235
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,480
shaking hands, signing autographs,

236
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,080
kind of just generally being the color in this restaurant.

237
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,840
I could not find a single bad thing about Alan Hale

238
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,160
as far as people talking about the restaurant.

239
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,360
Cause I found a long post

240
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,760
on Vintage LA's Facebook group.

241
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
It was just mountain of people going,

242
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,360
he was the greatest.

243
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,120
We ate there when I was a child

244
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,920
and he came by the table and he was wonderful.

245
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,840
It's just over and over and over again,

246
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,320
you have these praise worthy comments

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,840
about Alan Hale himself

248
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,520
and his presence in his lobster barrel.

249
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,840
I found one negative thing

250
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,280
on the website, old LA restaurants,

251
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,280
which is apparently run by Mark Evanier,

252
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,800
the co-writer on a lot of the Gru comics,

253
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,520
the Sergio Aragonis Gru comics.

254
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,960
Also a historian,

255
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,960
wrote a big book about the history of Jack Kirby.

256
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,720
He has a story about eating at the lobster barrel runs

257
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,080
and was quote, a bit overpowered

258
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,880
by Mr. Hale's teddy bear friendliness.

259
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,240
So the problem is that he's too friendly?

260
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,080
He's too friendly.

261
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,920
He's too nice.

262
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,520
He called everyone little buddy, which is cute.

263
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,360
Yeah, wow.

264
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
That was cute.

265
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,020
Yes, and he would like,

266
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,280
I think he would mess up like a kid's,

267
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,600
he would, okay, folks,

268
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,000
famously on Gilligan's Island,

269
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,760
he used to hit Gilligan with his hat or Gilligan's hat.

270
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,720
Someone's hat.

271
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,880
Forget, he'd hit him with a hat.

272
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,920
Whichever hat was available.

273
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,760
He'd hit him with a hat,

274
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,200
but then Alan Hale also always got hit by a coconut.

275
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
Right, yes.

276
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Which I don't think he would do at the restaurant.

277
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,880
No.

278
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,400
He might be good natured about it.

279
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,840
They tried it for a few weeks, I think, but.

280
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Guys, I hate to say,

281
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
I know you're all trying your best,

282
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,000
but I gotta tell you,

283
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,040
it's just not doing a number on the old noggin,

284
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,120
but hey, I love ya.

285
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,640
Really, let me give hugs to everybody.

286
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,560
Thanks for trying.

287
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,400
Little buddy.

288
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
Little buddy.

289
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,360
Oh, you're all my little buddies.

290
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,400
Let's grab the coconut

291
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,760
and work on the lobster thermidor recipe.

292
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,640
Yeah, so I read,

293
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,480
a couple of people are like,

294
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,760
yeah, he must my hair up and called me little buddy.

295
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,520
Yeah, I saw a YouTube comment that was like,

296
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,240
I went here on a vacation with Mike.

297
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,720
I saw several YouTube comments that were like,

298
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,240
I went on a vacation to LA in the 70s,

299
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,760
and we went to Disneyland,

300
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,160
but the highlight might have been my trip

301
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,960
to Alan Hales lobster parrots.

302
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,920
It was competitive with Disneyland,

303
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,040
because he's around, he's there talking to you,

304
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,440
and in one case, it was like,

305
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
my grandfather was there,

306
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,040
and he told Alan, I loved your father, Alan Hales Sr.

307
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,560
I loved him in movies or whatever the hell he was in.

308
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,480
I don't know Alan Hales Sr.

309
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,320
Oh, he was a movie,

310
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,520
oh, well, I have something about him too.

311
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,360
Oh, okay.

312
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,200
Okay, go ahead, yeah.

313
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,360
But it was, just the, then it's like,

314
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,120
well, and then Alan sat down for an hour.

315
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,120
He spent the whole dinner with us,

316
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,720
talking to my grandfather, saying how much he appreciated it.

317
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,040
Like, this is beyond,

318
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,480
I mean, that's, I think what's special

319
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,480
about this restaurant situation.

320
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,920
We're gonna come across other things

321
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,240
where it's in name only,

322
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,320
maybe the person was never even there.

323
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,520
This is the definition of celebrity.

324
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,000
It is theirs, they're there, they own it.

325
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,440
They're part of it, they're in the blood of it.

326
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,040
You know, I think what's funny about unearthing this

327
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
is that not a lot of people know this,

328
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,240
not that they should know this,

329
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,760
that the Skipper had a place on La Cienega,

330
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,960
unless you lived here.

331
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,720
But it is funny to like go back in time and see examples of,

332
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,040
cause you know, we talk a little bit about Casamigos

333
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,880
on this podcast.

334
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,360
We talk about celebrity liquor.

335
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,000
It is funny to go see a character actor from the 60s

336
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,360
with something that looks on the surface like a cash grab,

337
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,400
which I think for many of these celebrity restaurants it was.

338
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,520
And this was a money-making thing for the Skipper,

339
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,720
but also it seemed like legit.

340
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,920
He loved it.

341
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,720
He was all in on this idea.

342
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,320
Like now everybody like, I have a cell phone plan.

343
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,040
That's what I do now.

344
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,040
I am of course very involved in my cell phone plan.

345
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,720
Well, I have an ugly, I have an ape.

346
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,560
I have an ugly cartoon ape.

347
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,480
Here's what I am hawking on TV.

348
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,040
I have purchased the ugliest piece of art you've ever seen.

349
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,120
And I can't even muster a smile for the three minutes

350
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,080
that I'm supposed to talk about it.

351
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,000
I can't convey to you at home that I even know

352
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,040
why I'm talking about it.

353
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,680
That's celebrity endorsements today.

354
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,920
We've gotten so far away from Alan Hale.

355
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,320
Exactly.

356
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,040
Who is the gold standard I think now.

357
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,800
What we will find by the end of this podcast

358
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,600
of celebrity endorsed anything.

359
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,440
Well, it's close.

360
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,640
I mean, I think we got one more with its competitive

361
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,600
in terms of really being in there

362
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,840
and rolling up their sleeves.

363
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,480
But we'll have to compare contrast when we get there.

364
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,280
I shouldn't, I got too excited.

365
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,480
But it is, I think we've talked about this before

366
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,800
on the show is that at least for myself,

367
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,000
speak for myself, it's so much more full.

368
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,600
Like there's very famous people that I would like,

369
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,920
oh, that would be fun to say hello to that person.

370
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,160
But nothing would excite me like going back in time

371
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,960
or meeting like a Bernie Cappell who was on Get Smart

372
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
and the Love Boat who is still alive.

373
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
I bring him up cause he's still alive.

374
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,800
Cause there's an extra generation removed.

375
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,320
So those people feel almost mythical to me.

376
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
And like, you know, there's very famous people

377
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,520
I looked up to or like I liked as a kid,

378
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,000
but if they were on Nick at night, that feels extra weird.

379
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,480
It feels like an extra, a different universe perhaps.

380
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,320
Yeah.

381
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,960
Most of the celebrities I've met in my life

382
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,600
was during my time at Funny or Die

383
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,480
where there were so many like needed a security guard

384
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,640
to push them away.

385
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,280
There were like four meetings every day.

386
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,560
And often with somebody who you've never heard of,

387
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,480
but if you're a different kind of person than me,

388
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,960
they're like, you met them?

389
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,040
I don't know, I've never heard their name

390
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,520
until that moment.

391
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,480
Now, if Alan Hale had come in for a meeting,

392
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,520
were he still alive in the days of, oh my God,

393
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,600
I would have come in with such a boatload of ideas,

394
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,080
would have been dropping them on him like coconuts.

395
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,040
You have a couple of good celebrity stories.

396
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,360
And the one I always think about though,

397
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,440
if somebody were to shake me awake

398
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,000
in the middle of the night and go,

399
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,640
Scott Garner's best celebrity story,

400
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,280
I'd go, Rip Taylor.

401
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,760
I told that, right?

402
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,600
Yes, yes.

403
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, him calling me.

404
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,220
I was at Disney World and he's,

405
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,040
Scott, it's Rippy.

406
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,200
He was mad at me because of a gift basket

407
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,440
he didn't understand.

408
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,400
That's better than any of the very famous people

409
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,600
who said something about it.

410
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
He used me up, Scotty.

411
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,640
Poor Rip.

412
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,360
I drove him.

413
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,760
Yeah, I mean, that was close.

414
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,200
Like, once I realized that that job could be a vehicle

415
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
to meet those kind of people.

416
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,440
Yes, Charro's still alive?

417
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,040
Yeah, yeah, if only.

418
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,040
I met Charro in some weird forum in the valley.

419
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,880
There was my family friend who's working

420
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,840
at a deep valley theater where she was doing a show.

421
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,720
And I have a photo of my dad and sister with Charro.

422
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,560
That's fantastic.

423
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,380
I guess it was cool.

424
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,220
I don't remember anything about the internet.

425
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,000
Did she play the guitar?

426
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,840
Not in front of us.

427
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,440
She might've been preparing for a show

428
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,480
where she was going to play.

429
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,320
She's a fantastic flamenco guitarist.

430
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,240
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

431
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,320
And will play, I think still was playing casinos

432
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,520
before the pandemic.

433
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,360
Now.

434
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,760
I was like, oh, we gotta go out and see her.

435
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,600
That's a show.

436
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,420
Where does she do it?

437
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,260
I guess the valley.

438
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,160
Maybe the valley, but I feel like-

439
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,840
Some place on Sherman Way.

440
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,440
Mahegan Sun or something.

441
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,840
She played pretty decent-

442
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,680
Oh, Marongo.

443
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,500
Marongo or something.

444
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,720
Or some level.

445
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,840
Yeah, I think she can-

446
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,680
There's a whole chain.

447
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,600
I mean, there's tons of casinos in Vegas

448
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,600
that are the locals' casinos or smaller chains.

449
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,680
There's a chain that Samstown is in

450
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,140
that the killers named their album after,

451
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,120
where there's like, oh, there's a dozen other casinos.

452
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,960
Mm-hmm.

453
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,780
Right, right, right.

454
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,620
And they have rooms.

455
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,080
They have venues.

456
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,080
They can book, yeah, Charo for sure.

457
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,920
Yeah.

458
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,520
I don't think it's an impossible dream to see Charo

459
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,800
unless, of course, with this whole run,

460
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
we gotta be careful with the PTR curse.

461
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,880
Oh, God, you're right.

462
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,720
It's proven so strong.

463
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Oh, no, I talked about Bernie Cappell.

464
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,560
Oh, shit.

465
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,080
This is not exclusive to us.

466
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,880
Lots of podcasts end up talking about someone off the cuff

467
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,800
and then they die.

468
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,560
Well, and again, we figured out why.

469
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,960
And, Grissom, figured out why.

470
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,000
We were very interested in-

471
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,820
Old-

472
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,660
Very old people.

473
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,500
Yeah.

474
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,520
Andrew Grissom, I will say, for Christmas,

475
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,980
bought me a photo of Rip Taylor.

476
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,600
Is that right?

477
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,440
A signed photo of Rip Taylor

478
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,640
that he found at like a thrift store.

479
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,480
Wow.

480
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,040
And he signed to someone else on the back, too.

481
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,480
I mean, signed, obviously, he didn't sign it to me.

482
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,160
Did I say on the show also that he,

483
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,840
for this shoot that honestly was bare bones,

484
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,000
there were like four people involved in the shoot,

485
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,840
and he brought white chocolate mustaches for everyone.

486
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,680
Fantastic.

487
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,520
Candy mustaches.

488
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,340
Terrific, fantastic.

489
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,560
And then made us all take photos.

490
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,000
All right, now, everybody put the mustache over your head.

491
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,840
Okay, now you, get on the floor.

492
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,600
I'm putting this cone on you.

493
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,360
He made the DP lie down.

494
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,200
Oh, man.

495
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,000
Like poured glitter all over him,

496
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,680
like hit him with a mustache.

497
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,200
I'd rather, look, I love Mission Impossible.

498
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,360
I'd rather meet Rip than Tom Cruise.

499
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,680
Yeah, yeah.

500
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,280
I mean, it was special.

501
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,640
It was really special.

502
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,480
Tom would be great.

503
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,400
I'd love to work with Tom.

504
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,000
I'd love to have his hard eye contact on me

505
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,560
and make me feel special like he does to everyone, but.

506
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,240
I'd love to be terrified in Tom Cruise's presence, yes.

507
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,080
Yeah, I'd love to be on a movie where he like,

508
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,680
he's like, we need your body in better shape.

509
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Like, we just simply need you to be in better shape for this.

510
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
And you're gonna be working out of my gym

511
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,520
with me every morning.

512
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,920
Here's a book you can read

513
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,560
and teach you how to unlock your potential

514
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,680
and rid yourself of the phatens.

515
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,520
That's right.

516
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,440
That cloud your mind and your body.

517
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,600
And are you on psych meds?

518
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,000
Hopefully not.

519
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,840
Well, then that's it.

520
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,040
Get off the meds, dude.

521
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,120
So this, I mean, so this is the,

522
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,840
this is a place where everybody could have

523
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,760
a Rip Taylor-esque experience.

524
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,640
Guaranteed, it seemed like.

525
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,320
It also seems like,

526
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,720
I don't know much about the history of the place,

527
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,040
but it seems like Lobster Barrel,

528
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,840
which I think we're focusing on the first half.

529
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,680
Yes, you're right.

530
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,800
Of the episode title and the name of the restaurant.

531
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,600
As we should, it is Alan Hales,

532
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,560
but let's not lose sight of the phrase Lobster Barrel.

533
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,240
Is a very funny. Which I think was a chain

534
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,760
that existed with a couple locations outside of Alan Hale.

535
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,920
And I think he wanted to have a franchise,

536
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
but not just buy one, but to have his name.

537
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,160
He bought into this location.

538
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,640
I think so, or I think made it exist possibly.

539
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,560
I think there was not one.

540
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,240
I could be wrong. I'm not exactly sure.

541
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,960
But let's, with that said, Lobster Barrel.

542
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,800
Boy, what a crazy phrase.

543
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,760
I feel like.

544
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,960
Not the lobsters come in barrels.

545
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,720
Is that how they're transported?

546
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,040
Is the place itself considered the Lobster Barrel?

547
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Like the restaurant is a barrel of fun

548
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,280
and you'll be in it with lobsters?

549
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,400
It paints an interesting picture.

550
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,760
You run out of seafood house name,

551
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,240
fish house names at a certain point.

552
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,440
Crab trap, clam bar.

553
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,080
You know, these are the go-tos I feel like.

554
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Sharts in there.

555
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,440
Yeah.

556
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,680
Yeah. Schooner, like boats, name all the boats.

557
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,600
You know.

558
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Boat house, chart house, schooner house, salmon house.

559
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,000
Is there another like barrel?

560
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,120
I guess barrel is a fun.

561
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,280
Well, cracker barrel.

562
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,720
Cracker barrel, thank you.

563
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,560
And then there's Eidlauer on the valley.

564
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,400
It is a big barrel.

565
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,240
It is a big barrel.

566
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,320
It's a bar and.

567
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,160
You can see that.

568
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, they have food.

569
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,120
There's that dog in the back from the Rocketeer.

570
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,440
You ever been back there?

571
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,280
I have been back there,

572
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,600
but I didn't realize it was back there.

573
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,240
I think that's, I'm not sure it's from the move,

574
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,080
but you know what I mean?

575
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,920
Is it like in the back of the patio?

576
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,280
Like a facade of a dog with smoking a corn cob pipe.

577
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,120
It's on the patio?

578
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,240
Eidlauer. Yeah, yeah.

579
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,080
Yeah, yeah.

580
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,600
Yeah, that's, wasn't there originally, I think.

581
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,520
That was moved there.

582
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,240
Like that was a food stand.

583
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,080
Like in LA, car culture caught on so quickly

584
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,280
after they dismantled the red car trolleys.

585
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,600
A lot of businesses would like make novelty shaped buildings.

586
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,040
Often like, of course, Tail of the Pup, the most notable.

587
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,080
Yes, the hot dog stand that was a big hot dog,

588
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,200
which I think was, I'm not sure if I ever went there,

589
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,560
if it was still there when I was a kid.

590
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,480
It's supposedly coming back.

591
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,320
Oh, great.

592
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,120
It's being restored and I think will be re-opened.

593
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,960
I don't know how fast they're moving on this.

594
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,800
That's great.

595
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,280
Oh, wonderful.

596
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,480
I mean, that was on, that was La Cienega.

597
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,280
That was in this stretch of LA

598
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,040
where this, where Alan Hale did his restaurant.

599
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,480
A lot, all kinds of crazy other places around there.

600
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,520
There's a restaurant where you walk through a whale's mouth

601
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,900
that looked really nuts.

602
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,280
What was that called?

603
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,160
The, I don't have the name in front of me.

604
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,800
Oh, the Fish Shanty.

605
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,560
Oh, there's a, we missed a word.

606
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,400
We missed Shanty.

607
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,360
Look at this thing, like big wooden doors

608
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,320
with a big crazy monstro.

609
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,160
And there was a theme park around here, Kittyland,

610
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,080
which we talked about with Dumbo

611
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,320
because Walt consulted the Kittyland guy.

612
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,200
I think it's where the Beverly Center is now.

613
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,840
It seems like La Cienega was like a whole town,

614
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,680
a crazy bullshit.

615
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,880
You know what it sounds like is like the Beach Boulevard

616
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,120
where in the greatest city on earth,

617
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Buena Park, where it's like everywhere,

618
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
oh my God, there's a castle from Medieval Times.

619
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,360
There's a Burger King that looks like a castle.

620
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,560
There's the Pirate Place.

621
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,120
There's knots, there's roller coasters,

622
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,320
there's an Independence Hall.

623
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,920
It seems like La Cienega kind of had that vibe

624
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,000
in the 60s, 70s.

625
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,840
Yeah, for sure.

626
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,040
And did we say this was part,

627
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,680
Alan Hales was part of Restaurant Row,

628
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,240
which was other celebrity restaurants.

629
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,080
He was next.

630
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,800
Well, and specifically, seemingly celebrity corner

631
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
of Restaurant Row.

632
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,600
Districts within districts.

633
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,160
Exactly, and he was next to Xavier Cougat's restaurant,

634
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,720
which I believe was what, Cougat's?

635
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,760
Casa Cougat.

636
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,120
Casa Cougat, thank you.

637
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,960
Yeah.

638
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,800
Casa Cougat.

639
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,480
Apparently, I was having trouble finding-

640
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,120
Mary DeCharro, by the way.

641
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,720
Yeah, this is what,

642
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,600
I feel like we've been talking about this this whole time,

643
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,720
and Xavier Cougat, and Xavier Cougat.

644
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,160
I got no clue on Xavier Cougat.

645
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,000
Bandleader?

646
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,560
Yeah, bandleader back when that was like one of the hugest

647
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,320
professions in the entertainment industry.

648
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,360
I believe it's pronounced Xavier Cougat.

649
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,040
Xavier, yeah.

650
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Because I found one episode of What's Your Line,

651
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,040
where he's the mystery celebrity guest,

652
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,600
and then in-

653
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,080
Is that What's My Line?

654
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,920
Huh?

655
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,760
Is that What's My Line?

656
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,600
Is it What's My Line?

657
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,320
What's My Line, yeah.

658
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,800
Okay, I'm confusing it with you,

659
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,680
but you're a little, yeah.

660
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,840
So they say his name in that kind of quickly,

661
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,040
but then also Javier Bardem and being the Ricardos,

662
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,080
said it in a way I have never heard that pronounced before.

663
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,760
That's how I learned it said,

664
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,080
they don't say it like Professor Xavier,

665
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,840
they say Xavier Cougat.

666
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,680
Okay.

667
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,120
That's yeah, so you learned that way.

668
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,040
I learned one seemingly true-ish fact

669
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,240
from being the Ricardos.

670
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,080
This is the type of like-

671
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,120
I keep learning who bandleaders are.

672
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,960
That's right.

673
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,760
This is the 2022 on podcast The Ride,

674
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,640
lots of something really dirty every time,

675
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,760
and a bandleader.

676
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,560
How dirty will this one get?

677
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,680
Well, you have to really live up to what we've been doing.

678
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,640
Well, Alan himself provides some fodder later.

679
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,480
Oh yeah, yeah.

680
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,520
This is just a little example of Xavier.

681
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,360
Xavier.

682
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,360
This is Chica Chica Boom Chica.

683
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,160
This guy was like the biggest rock star in the world.

684
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,440
Listen to this shit, folks.

685
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
This guy was the weekend.

686
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,080
Xavier was the weekend of his day.

687
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,800
He was in like whatever the uncut gems of the time.

688
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,320
Why do you guys know about him though?

689
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,080
He's just, he's around.

690
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,560
Desi Arnaz mentions him on the Tonight Show.

691
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,960
I talked about this on the show before

692
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,640
when Desi Arnaz is like 12 minutes

693
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,480
and boring every one of the Tonight Show.

694
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,800
And he's old, he mentioned Xavier Cougat,

695
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,640
married to Charro.

696
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,880
He's around, he's in the universe.

697
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,800
He's in the old people, old actor universe.

698
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,880
We specifically, I believe Desi made a comment

699
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,720
we always joke about.

700
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,280
He was like, in Xavier Cougat was cheap.

701
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,400
Oh sure, yeah.

702
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,640
And he might've even said he was boring or cheap.

703
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,440
Yeah, they were just roasting each other.

704
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,160
But there's plenty of people I watch

705
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,960
on like these old roasts or something where I go,

706
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
I don't really know what that,

707
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,480
I don't have a deep knowledge of this person.

708
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,200
I just know them from being around.

709
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,840
They kind of like caught the tail,

710
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,880
the beginning era of television.

711
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,680
They jumped from live performance and radio

712
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,200
into television in the way that Tommy Dorsey

713
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,320
was likely dead.

714
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,120
Bunny Barigan, that's another guy I know.

715
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,640
Geez, oh my God.

716
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
I don't know a lot about Bunny Barigan.

717
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,440
I just have his best stuff.

718
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,920
Now you say Casa Cougat next door,

719
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,000
but we think maybe at some point there was a change

720
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,160
of the venue because I believe it might've been

721
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,320
the same place and I don't know whether one was before

722
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,640
the other or what happened.

723
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,720
But another important person had a restaurant around here

724
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,960
which was Caesar Romero, the Joker from the original Batman.

725
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,200
And his restaurant was?

726
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,320
Cappuccino Ristorante.

727
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,120
Great.

728
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,280
Which leads to, you can actually hear credit to,

729
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,680
amazingly a couple people on Twitter have tweeted

730
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,800
about Alan Hale's Lobster Barrel before,

731
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,680
including Pee Wee Herman and Cliff Nesterov

732
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,960
who's a historian of this kind of stuff.

733
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,920
And then Matt Oswalt, Patton's brother,

734
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,160
tweeted out an ad that is a dual ad.

735
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,000
Really the ads are the main thing to talk about.

736
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,760
But the ad was a dual ad for both Caesar Romero's

737
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,600
Cappuccino Ristorante and Alan Hale's Lobster Barrel,

738
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,480
both advertising what they were doing for Thanksgiving.

739
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,160
And Matt Oswalt tweeted,

740
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,360
imagine waking up on Thanksgiving morning

741
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,000
and saying to yourself, do I want to spend Thanksgiving

742
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,520
with the Joker or the Skipper?

743
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,720
That sums up why this is so great.

744
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,560
Yes.

745
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,160
That is a perfect tweet that explains.

746
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,360
One of them might be there truly.

747
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,760
This was a.

748
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,920
The golden age.

749
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,760
I think so.

750
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,400
Well and now you come to Hollywood,

751
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,520
what's Hollywood like?

752
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,600
And you have to figure out,

753
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,800
Hollywood Hollywood is the worst place on earth.

754
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,240
And then really it all happens in bunkers

755
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,640
in Delray or whatever.

756
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,480
What is Hollywood?

757
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,760
There's no, at this point in time,

758
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,840
you really could go to the Skipper's restaurant

759
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,440
in West Hollywood and you might see the Skipper there.

760
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,120
There was a Hollywood.

761
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,760
Right, it felt like, yes, it felt like,

762
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
I mean when you see it dramatized,

763
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,960
it always does feel like,

764
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,840
oh and the old stars were always around,

765
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,520
they were at Schwab's or they were here or whatever.

766
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,440
This was a concrete proof of a place you could go.

767
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,200
And same with Telly, same with Telly Savelle.

768
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,040
It's a lot like Sloppy Telly.

769
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,880
You knew you could go to,

770
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,320
unless he was in shooting, he'd be drinking or playing pool.

771
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,720
The universal Sherry.

772
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,560
Yeah.

773
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,160
Which was later, remarkable,

774
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,240
because that's the 80s, 90s.

775
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,560
This is before he died in the hotel.

776
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,760
Right, we remember.

777
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
Sloppy Telly, I want a place where I can,

778
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,440
that I don't have to clean up after myself

779
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,960
and where I can drop dead and somebody will pick me up.

780
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,800
We need to find a place.

781
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,520
I don't want my relatives to have to do it.

782
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,480
Baby.

783
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,480
The cleaning staff will dispose of the body.

784
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,360
They won't mind.

785
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,680
I'll leave a tip, I'll leave a big tip in my robe.

786
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,400
It's for you for cleaning up my corpse, baby.

787
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,240
It is, it wasn't.

788
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,520
It should have just said like in case of death,

789
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,600
there was like an envelope with the money in it.

790
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,040
I look, hey, Telly's no fool.

791
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,480
Telly could drop dead any minute.

792
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,360
So I'll always leave your cash tip for your death.

793
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,320
We're your housekeeper.

794
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,240
We need to find which room he died in.

795
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,520
There were, I mean, it wasn't unusual back in the day

796
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,200
for people to live in nice hotels.

797
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,880
It is unusual for that time period, I feel like,

798
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,040
for a aging television star to live in a Sheraton

799
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
next to a theme park around the corner

800
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,440
from an In-N-Out burger.

801
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,480
That's kind of different than the Chateau Marmots

802
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,200
who are like the French Riviera.

803
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,560
Celebrities are always at that In-N-Out.

804
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,200
Like what's their, Ghislaine Maxwell.

805
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,040
That's right.

806
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,720
It's the biggest celebrity hotspot there is.

807
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,040
Look, there was a time when you could go to that In-N-Out

808
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,120
and always see Ghislaine there.

809
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,680
You could always hang with Ghislaine.

810
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,200
I always wondered who that woman was.

811
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,920
She always reading a book.

812
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,760
She was so nice.

813
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,580
She'd call you a little buddy.

814
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,760
She'd mush your hair up.

815
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,680
It was just a magical time.

816
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,280
Her catchphrases.

817
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,520
But like, I'm trying to even think of like,

818
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,280
we've heard, we've lived in,

819
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,400
we've been adults in Los Angeles for so long.

820
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,320
I've heard stories of like,

821
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,880
he for Sutherland partying,

822
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,920
but there was never like a central location

823
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,200
you could necessarily go.

824
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,840
Cause like, I was trying to think,

825
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,400
is there like, there's no,

826
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,240
I can't think of a version of this.

827
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,440
Well, the documentary,

828
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,680
the Edgar Wright documentary taught me that

829
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,200
Russell Mayall from Sparks is always

830
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,400
sitting quietly at Earth Cafe.

831
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,240
Okay.

832
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,080
I don't think that counts.

833
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,280
That's, not bad.

834
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,120
Yeah, yeah.

835
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
At least there's one spot that we know.

836
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,160
That's not as, that's not,

837
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,800
maybe not the glamour level we're talking about.

838
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,400
There's something called Erawan.

839
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,740
Is that, do I have that right?

840
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,880
There's a chain of like rich people groceries.

841
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,800
Yeah, I just caught on to that.

842
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,560
There's a Calabasas one.

843
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,400
Yeah.

844
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,180
And yeah, I, well, I don't know.

845
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,080
Well, that's what the, the,

846
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,360
the Caruso mall in Calabasas, the comments,

847
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,680
where you might see an unfriendly Justin Bieber

848
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,280
grabbing a coffee and then leaving

849
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,880
in the ugliest car he've ever seen.

850
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,720
Yeah.

851
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,680
I mean, in Burbank, of course,

852
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,080
there was the karaoke bar Dimples,

853
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,240
one of the most cursed places in the city.

854
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,200
It's now a Whole Foods.

855
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,380
I'm sure the ghosts of just the building haunts it,

856
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,760
but Mr. Belding would be there.

857
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,600
Oh, well that's.

858
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,520
You can guarantee that Mr. Belding would be there.

859
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,800
Honestly, that is in the zone, I guess.

860
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,520
Mr. Belding is like the modern day this.

861
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,960
But, but yeah, it's a little.

862
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,640
But everyone was like, oh yeah, we go.

863
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
It sucks.

864
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,400
Like every, I never went,

865
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,080
it was a thing college students who lived

866
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,360
at the Oakwoods with like,

867
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,000
it was the only bar you could really walk to.

868
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,120
People would walk down there

869
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,280
and get their picture with Mr. Belding.

870
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,560
But he was like, everyone's like, oh yeah,

871
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,440
the bar sucks, the owner's a sleazebag.

872
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,000
There is a bar rescue episode about it.

873
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,840
Yeah.

874
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,680
And the guy.

875
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,520
Oh, I'm doing a lot of,

876
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,000
I watched bar rescue right before you guys came over.

877
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,840
Oh really?

878
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,680
Oh yeah.

879
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,500
Oh yeah.

880
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,640
There's a Dimples episode and the owner's so sleazy.

881
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,680
I mean, he's even wearing the sleaziest,

882
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,720
like short sleeve sweater polo.

883
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,840
If you can picture that, like,

884
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,080
and he's like, take the blow job shot.

885
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,920
Yeah.

886
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,760
And it's like you to put like the shop

887
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,600
between his legs.

888
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,400
The shop between his legs and they'd give it to you for,

889
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,640
and I was just like,

890
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,080
people would come back from this place.

891
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,240
It's like, you gotta come.

892
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,720
And I'm like, I don't know that I do.

893
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,560
Do I?

894
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,400
Yeah.

895
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,160
Taffer's like, who wants to do this?

896
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,000
You're demeaning women.

897
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,440
What are you doing?

898
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,280
Yeah.

899
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,040
The best celebrity you've got is Mr. Belding?

900
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,560
It's just been off the air for years.

901
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm shutting it down.

902
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,000
Mr. Belding is leering on the 20 year olds with fake IDs,

903
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,120
the 20 year old film students with fake IDs.

904
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,400
To bring it back to Alan Hale,

905
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,560
that's what there's, like,

906
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,720
you would think it would be weird and sad.

907
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,560
It seems like it wasn't.

908
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,000
Celebrities always around, but yeah,

909
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
it seems like everybody's aglow about this.

910
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,440
That's what, yes, that is the difference.

911
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,400
There's a thing we're doing later this month

912
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,800
that it does seem a little more sad.

913
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,640
A little more sad, yeah.

914
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,320
Yeah, but this does seem like a nice restaurant.

915
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,880
It's got a giant menu of like-

916
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,640
Yeah, people thought the food was good as well.

917
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,560
Yeah, it's a steakhouse and it's doing lobster and shrimp

918
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,000
and a lot of preparations.

919
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,520
Well, do people have the menu?

920
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,360
Oh, of course.

921
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,680
Imagine we all pulled the menu.

922
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,560
A beautiful illustrated menu.

923
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,240
That's really great, hand drawn

924
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,320
where everything's charmingly crooked

925
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,600
and they're jamming a lot in.

926
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,360
It looks like an old Mad Magazine thing.

927
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,120
But I like it because there's words that I don't see a lot.

928
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,920
Well, you brought this one up, lobster Thermador.

929
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Okay, so a lot of these preparations are still done

930
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,760
at a lot of nice restaurants back East.

931
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,080
Lobster Thermador is where the meat is removed

932
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
from the lobster, tossed with cream,

933
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,000
then it's put back in the shell, covered in cheese,

934
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,520
and put in a broiler.

935
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,600
Cheese and lobster, is that?

936
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,280
It is a unique combination,

937
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,400
but a lot of these kind of simulate like crab,

938
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,560
I was surprised to find crab Oscar is not on the menu.

939
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,320
Crab Oscar, tossed with cream, served with asparagus,

940
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,200
and usually a topping for like steak or chicken,

941
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,080
if you can Oscar an entree.

942
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,120
And can we Oscar that please?

943
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,280
That's right, yeah.

944
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,120
So.

945
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,440
Have you ever Oscared something?

946
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,880
Oh yeah, I've Oscared something, yeah.

947
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,720
Really?

948
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,120
It's usually tossed with not,

949
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,480
Hollandaise is the mother sauce,

950
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,600
Bernays is one of the childs.

951
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,440
Mother sauce.

952
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,640
Mother sauce.

953
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,600
In French cuisine, Hollandaise,

954
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,440
which you have on eggs Benedict is referred to as a base,

955
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,160
like egg based cream, mother sauce,

956
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,000
and then depending on.

957
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,840
Wait a minute.

958
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,680
Yeah.

959
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,640
I still don't know where mother sauce comes from.

960
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,320
It's a base, it's a base sauce,

961
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,240
and then depending on what you add to it,

962
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,400
if you add tarragon, that becomes Bernays sauce.

963
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,240
Mother sauce.

964
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,080
But did any sauce that you asked your mother for,

965
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,280
did that qualify as a mother sauce?

966
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,600
The barbecue, the yeah, the sweet baby raise.

967
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,520
Is that a mother sauce if your mother hands it to you?

968
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,560
Ask, when you asked what the mother sauce was,

969
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,200
would you of course do it, excuse me,

970
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,520
what is the mother sauce, please?

971
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,400
Mother sauce?

972
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,280
So you would, okay, so you would ask for something Oscared,

973
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,120
and then find out what the.

974
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,400
This is like in the last five years of my life,

975
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,320
I have ordered this.

976
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,680
This is a new thing, is Oscaring?

977
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,400
Well, I didn't, yeah, I didn't eat steak,

978
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,640
I wasn't a big steak guy,

979
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,840
because growing up, the era,

980
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,760
the 90s was the era of like don't undercook meat or eggs,

981
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,920
or you will die.

982
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,600
And it wasn't until when I was much older

983
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,240
and went to actual steak houses

984
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,800
where they put like care and thoughtfulness,

985
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,400
where it's like, oh, you can order a steak medium,

986
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,880
you can order a medium rare.

987
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,200
So a lot of those places you can add like a hollandaise to it

988
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,240
or mushrooms and thyme.

989
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,840
Good hollandaise to a steak?

990
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,520
You can add a lot of stuff on top of a steak.

991
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,160
Traditionally, usually you don't wanna,

992
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,600
if it's a nice enough place, the steak is good enough

993
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,280
and seasoned well enough, you don't need to pile stuff on it.

994
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,120
What's my feel about everything you're describing?

995
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,920
Like the lobster, we're gonna put cheese

996
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,760
and cream on the lobster?

997
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,600
Like, you want the lobster?

998
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,680
I mean, if you eat lobster, like a broiled,

999
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,720
a steamed lobster, a broiled lobster and stuff,

1000
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,640
you're covering it in clarified butter, you're dipping it.

1001
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, true.

1002
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,080
The base way it comes involves adding something.

1003
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,600
I like the option to like pile shit on something.

1004
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,720
But obviously if it's a hamburger, if it's anything,

1005
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,480
you would like, I would always like to try something

1006
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,000
in like a very simple version

1007
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,680
to really taste what's going on.

1008
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,000
But it is fun sometimes to get a bunch of shit

1009
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
piled on anything.

1010
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,440
Yeah.

1011
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,520
If it's an interesting concoction.

1012
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,640
I mean, especially in the mid 20th century,

1013
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,280
post-war America, like everything is being cooked,

1014
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
chicken a la king, everything's being cooked

1015
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,880
with cream and egg yolks, you know.

1016
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,200
Well, I think if we're doing,

1017
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,920
since it's a restaurant month, if we're doing,

1018
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,360
maybe we don't do plus it up for anything,

1019
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,560
it's gotta be Oscar it.

1020
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,600
If we're gonna Oscar it, it's like, how do we?

1021
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,000
Let's keep that in mind.

1022
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,240
I love crab.

1023
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,280
I think crab is much more flavorful,

1024
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,880
like just as a base than lobster.

1025
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,160
Sure.

1026
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,000
And so like-

1027
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And you like imitation crab meat as well?

1028
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,800
I do like imitation crab meat too, yeah.

1029
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,920
That's pretty good.

1030
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,740
I like both.

1031
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,680
I actually don't, you know what,

1032
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,160
now that I'm thinking, I don't really have a strong,

1033
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,680
I like both and maybe I associate both together.

1034
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,200
I don't have a sophisticated palette enough to even know.

1035
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,560
I can't even imagine what the difference is

1036
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,600
off the top of my head.

1037
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,040
I think, I mean, a lot of places have lobster,

1038
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,280
but like crab, growing up so close to the Chesapeake Bay,

1039
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,840
Maryland is just crab country.

1040
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,520
Like it's so cheap and it's so plentiful.

1041
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,640
It's like if you go to New England,

1042
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,240
like lobster is everywhere.

1043
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,920
So how often would you have crab or lobster?

1044
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh, in the summer, at least once a week.

1045
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,680
Really?

1046
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,240
Crab or scallops or clam strips or flounder.

1047
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,800
Yeah, at the Jersey shore.

1048
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,120
Flounder, did we have flounder ever?

1049
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,440
We haven't had flounder.

1050
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,200
When you saw Little Mermaid,

1051
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,960
was that a thing where you were like, we ate him?

1052
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,920
And Sebastian.

1053
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,760
And Sebastian, yeah, you're right.

1054
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,400
One of each a week.

1055
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,240
Yeah.

1056
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,080
Sebastian day.

1057
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,120
And you fry up a mermaid.

1058
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,960
You fry up-

1059
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,440
Right on the shore, you pick one out from a tank.

1060
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,720
Flounder and fried flounder and fried shrimp

1061
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,160
are like the kids menu go-tos,

1062
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,960
which I have never shaken off.

1063
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,640
Oh yeah, fried shrimp or like breaded shrimp for sure

1064
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,480
as a kid.

1065
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,320
Yeah.

1066
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,120
You dip that in tartar sauce or whatever.

1067
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,440
But flounder is very flaky.

1068
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,800
It's not overwhelmingly fishy

1069
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,440
and it's a great vessel to carry ketchup

1070
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,960
and tartar sauce and cocktail sauce.

1071
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,600
You put ketchup on flounder?

1072
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,880
Sure.

1073
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
As a kid, I put ketchup on everything.

1074
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,640
Would you put ketchup on flounder now?

1075
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,520
I feel like that seems like a faux pas.

1076
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,640
And now I just mostly tartar sauce or cocktail.

1077
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,720
Cocktails basically just ketchup and horseradish.

1078
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,200
I guess you're right.

1079
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,760
I never thought of that.

1080
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,600
Would anybody do anything Columbo style,

1081
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
which is a way that he served,

1082
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,920
that old Alan served veal.

1083
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,760
Oh, oh.

1084
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,520
Veal Columbo is breaded with wheat germ,

1085
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,040
oregano, garlic powder, mushroom and marsala wine.

1086
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,400
Okay, so it goes in that, all right, so it's a marsala.

1087
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,520
Yeah, it's just kind of a marsala.

1088
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,360
Yeah.

1089
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,200
Huh, huh.

1090
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,800
Just a crazy- Columbo style.

1091
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,600
I'm sorry, I jumped to a special menu,

1092
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,680
which is Alan Hale's Lobster Barrel special menu

1093
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,360
in conjunction with the American Heart Association.

1094
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,000
So he worked with the Heart Association

1095
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,800
to bring you the dessert pineapple cheesecake.

1096
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,640
Yeah.

1097
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,640
Also that veal had breading, right?

1098
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,280
Yeah, yeah.

1099
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,200
Baked halibut with alfredo sauce.

1100
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,200
Yeah.

1101
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,360
I don't know, maybe he might not have filled in

1102
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,960
the Heart Association on the full plan.

1103
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,560
They got a lot on their plate.

1104
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,000
They were big hearts and what have you.

1105
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,520
They were big Gilligan's Island fans

1106
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,360
and they said, look,

1107
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,320
whatever you want to do is fine with us.

1108
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,000
We just want our name next to you, Alan.

1109
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,040
Yeah, sure thing, little buddy.

1110
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,880
They're calling the entire

1111
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,920
American Heart Association little buddy.

1112
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,760
Aw, shucks.

1113
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,120
That's right, little buddy.

1114
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,040
Yeah, this menu, I'm going back on the regular menu.

1115
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,280
First of all, it is interesting to see the prices.

1116
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,080
There was a- Oh, yeah.

1117
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,760
They're not like, I mean, it's like a normal entrees,

1118
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,840
like what, between $8 and $15?

1119
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,000
And then some of the higher,

1120
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,800
there's like bigger ticket things.

1121
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,120
Shrimp and lobster Newberg,

1122
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
you got to jack it up to $15.95.

1123
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,760
Yeah, yeah, that's a little more pricey,

1124
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,680
but everything seems fairly reasonable.

1125
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,120
Norfolk style.

1126
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,480
I mean, maybe regular run of the mill crab meat,

1127
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,280
but when you're getting the Norfolk in there.

1128
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,360
Here's interesting, Jason, do you know anything about this?

1129
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,920
The chef's curry corner, seafood curry,

1130
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,760
does it say a la Sinbad?

1131
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,960
La Sinbad.

1132
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,800
Yeah, I don't know.

1133
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Do you know what that is?

1134
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm impressed, curry, that's pretty adventurous.

1135
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Well, that's what I was thinking, is that something,

1136
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,760
that feels like you're just getting like the older

1137
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,040
generation in America into like curry and stuff,

1138
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,560
which I think is, which is delicious.

1139
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,720
I have the spiciest kind of curry,

1140
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,120
that's what I'm, I wonder if this is a very 70s

1141
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,960
kind of curry.

1142
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,200
But still, like I didn't have curry

1143
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,680
until like 10 years ago, probably.

1144
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,840
You know, and bouillabaisse, I was surprised,

1145
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,760
like that seemed pretty adventurous.

1146
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,600
Yeah, so it's interesting.

1147
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,400
Curry is interesting.

1148
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,760
You can do that, you can do that seafood curry,

1149
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,320
a la Sinbad with major grazed chutney.

1150
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,320
So kinds of treasures on this thing and drawings and see,

1151
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,360
it's a great looking little.

1152
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
A little skipper on it and then a lot of barrels,

1153
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,520
one's tipped over, one has a bunch of claws coming out of it.

1154
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,760
It's like, that's a little, little scenes going on.

1155
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,200
I mean, it's, it's, it's beautiful.

1156
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,760
And this isn't the only thing that you could walk away from

1157
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,840
at this establishment.

1158
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,280
You could very easily find yourself the proud owner of

1159
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,800
an Alan Hales lobster barrel postcard

1160
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,240
with this great old line drawing of him,

1161
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,880
which you'll see in the art of the episode probably.

1162
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,000
And if he's there, he's signing it.

1163
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,760
He's signing that baby for you.

1164
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,680
He loves to do it.

1165
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,360
Apparently he would find first timers like,

1166
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,240
hey, I never seen you here before.

1167
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,800
Sit down, make yourself at home.

1168
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,480
I let me show you the menu here.

1169
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
Hey, you're a little buddy.

1170
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,720
Here's, there's an autograph, a whole skipper for you.

1171
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,560
Okay.

1172
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,520
So cool.

1173
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,360
Yeah.

1174
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:53,360
These have ended up on eBay and like the last episode,

1175
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,520
you want to do a real quick souvenir smackdown.

1176
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,360
Oh yeah, please.

1177
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,880
I guess what you're, what are you getting?

1178
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,560
A, I mean, I can show you,

1179
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,280
I don't know what the hell the autograph says.

1180
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,840
Kathy, it's fun.

1181
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,840
All keys, alibol, the best, the stain.

1182
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,200
I don't know what.

1183
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,600
I don't think.

1184
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,240
Probably not, unless he was drinking heavily that night.

1185
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,680
He was really drunk.

1186
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,520
I hope it's not too little buddy

1187
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,720
or else I will find myself buying it.

1188
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,480
I think it's to Kathy.

1189
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,920
You know, this was an authentic,

1190
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,240
the person said in the description,

1191
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,400
this was like to their parents when they visited.

1192
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,000
What do you think this is going for?

1193
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,240
On eBay.

1194
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,080
Yeah.

1195
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,200
Ooh, 29.99.

1196
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,040
Jason.

1197
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,640
$50.

1198
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,920
We're talking 150.

1199
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,760
Wow.

1200
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,600
Wow.

1201
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,440
Yeah, yeah.

1202
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,520
Keep it going higher.

1203
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,080
There's one more Alan Hale item.

1204
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,880
I want to do a quick bid on.

1205
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,360
This is a DVD set of Alan Hale's pre-

1206
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,200
Oh yeah.

1207
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,680
Gulligan's Island show, Biff Baker USA.

1208
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,640
There's eight episodes all told.

1209
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,160
Biff Baker seemed to be a kind of pre-Indiana Jones

1210
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,040
sort of thing in the fifties where Biff Baker and his wife

1211
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,200
were trying to find items in the world.

1212
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,160
Wow.

1213
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,520
But then they'd, you know, stumble across some problem

1214
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,560
that like they, you know,

1215
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,040
have to solve a crime or whatever.

1216
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,480
Anyway, eight episodes of Biff Baker USA.

1217
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,880
What are you paying for that?

1218
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,360
Eight episodes.

1219
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,760
9.99.

1220
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,600
Jason.

1221
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,240
I'm gonna say a hundred dollars.

1222
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Well, Jason gets it because the answer is $9,999.

1223
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,800
What?

1224
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,600
And 99 cents.

1225
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,440
Biff Baker.

1226
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,000
I suspect a mistyped entry.

1227
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,280
I don't think that a Biff Baker DVD

1228
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,560
or used to cost $10,000.

1229
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,760
This reminds me, there's that great Simpson's joke

1230
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,400
and I hope I'm getting the specifics right.

1231
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,160
It's a picture of Sean Connery, autographed by Roger Moore.

1232
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah.

1233
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,560
Uh-huh.

1234
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,120
Seems like a good show though.

1235
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,080
Check out Biff Baker.

1236
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,240
Wow.

1237
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,200
Let's get Jason that role, Biff Baker.

1238
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Biff Baker.

1239
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,720
Fun fact about Alan Hale Jr.

1240
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,560
Hollywood High class of 1938

1241
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,120
with graduating classmate Mickey Rooney.

1242
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,840
Oh. Whoa.

1243
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,080
Yes. Boy, oh boy.

1244
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,920
Wow.

1245
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,280
Height, oh my God.

1246
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,680
Those two roughnecks running around

1247
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,600
like they're doing high school hijinks.

1248
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,800
Did Mickey Rooney just go to regular high school?

1249
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,720
Wasn't he a big movie star by then?

1250
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,200
I think a lot of young actors went to Hollywood High.

1251
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,040
Yeah.

1252
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,880
It was like you went there

1253
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,600
and they got that mural that's everybody who went.

1254
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,200
Yes, now they have the sun-bleached mural

1255
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,520
and their backyard is the Jimmy Kimmel parking lot.

1256
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,360
The concert stage.

1257
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,440
Yeah, concert stage parking lot.

1258
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,640
Hey, I saw Weezer there.

1259
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,360
That stage, maybe twice.

1260
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,720
You went to two Weezers at Kimmel?

1261
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,040
I think I've only seen two Kimmel concerts

1262
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,800
and I think they're both Weezer.

1263
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,040
I think.

1264
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,440
Anyway, I completely lost my train of thought.

1265
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,560
Oh, the Mickey Rooney,

1266
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,440
there was that joke going around

1267
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,760
that someone photoshopped

1268
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,040
of a Mickey Rooney restaurant that did not exist.

1269
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,400
It was, what was it, Potato something?

1270
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,320
Yes, it was all different preparations of potato

1271
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,600
and it was in North Hollywood.

1272
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,360
It was in the Valley where you would believe it.

1273
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,360
You would believe like.

1274
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,200
That Mickey Rooney would have.

1275
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,040
I mean, I would believe.

1276
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,640
Well, that was a part of an influence

1277
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,600
in doing this month too

1278
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,400
and then we were disappointed to learn it wasn't real.

1279
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,720
But, yeah, Alan Hales lobster barrel.

1280
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,560
Thank you.

1281
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,400
Very real.

1282
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,240
Yeah.

1283
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,080
There were some other,

1284
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,080
Carol O'Connor from All in the Family had a restaurant.

1285
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,400
Yeah, I just discovered this.

1286
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,320
The Ginger Man.

1287
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,400
The Ginger Man.

1288
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,640
It was in Beverly Hills.

1289
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,000
The Ginger Man.

1290
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,160
Yeah.

1291
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,040
Yeah, the Ginger Man is crazy.

1292
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,360
There's a New York one too.

1293
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,280
You can look up photos of Carol O'Connor

1294
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,040
hanging out with Larry Hagman and Tyne Daly.

1295
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,160
The last time that the Los Angeles Rams

1296
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,800
were in the Super Bowl

1297
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,120
as they are going to be for the next Super Bowl.

1298
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,600
I think I'm right about this.

1299
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,000
LA Rams haven't been in it since 1980

1300
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,600
and they cut to, let's see how the vibe is

1301
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,920
over at the Ginger Man.

1302
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,760
Wow.

1303
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,240
During the broadcast.

1304
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,080
And let's check in on our friends at the Ginger Man.

1305
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,040
It was mania.

1306
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,920
The Ginger Man seemed like a spot.

1307
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,760
Yeah.

1308
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,520
But then he changed it to Carol O'Connor's place.

1309
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,720
Then he fully, oh and also he talks about it in his book.

1310
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,560
Wait, what did I say?

1311
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,920
No, no, did he call it Archie Bunker's place?

1312
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,320
No, I think he called it Carol's place.

1313
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,240
I was saying he called it like that because of, I assume.

1314
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,280
Like his place is after Archie Bunker's place.

1315
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,960
Right, I think.

1316
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,880
The guy also, he was very open about the fact

1317
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,000
that he just wanted to have a restaurant

1318
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,120
to have a restaurant.

1319
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,680
This is something that people did back then.

1320
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,240
He wasn't worried about turning a profit

1321
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,560
and that's why he paid health insurance

1322
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,040
to everybody who worked there.

1323
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,240
Hey.

1324
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,000
Which made him just break even.

1325
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,440
He would've made a profit if he didn't pay everybody

1326
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,480
in the back health insurance.

1327
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,320
That's great.

1328
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,400
Carol O'Connor's a good guy.

1329
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,600
Yeah, and he just wanted a place to go hang.

1330
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,440
Yeah.

1331
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,960
Where people would kiss his ass all day.

1332
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,560
Who doesn't want that?

1333
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,920
That's what Alan Hale wanted.

1334
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,760
This is great.

1335
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,960
This is a great way of being these kind of guys.

1336
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,080
Yeah, I mean if you.

1337
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,320
I need a place.

1338
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,800
If you need, yeah, if you want a place,

1339
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,960
if you're famous and beloved,

1340
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,880
you would just find a room somewhere

1341
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,120
where people would be going expecting to see you

1342
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,920
and be happy to see you.

1343
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,720
I mean it is a great life hack, really.

1344
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,560
Yeah.

1345
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,400
Yeah.

1346
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,480
Yeah, we should have podcasted around restaurant

1347
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,600
and we're just there every night.

1348
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,600
I mean, as long as we can find somebody

1349
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,960
to figure out the restaurant part.

1350
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,800
Well, Jason, you heard him talking about the.

1351
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,640
Uh-oh.

1352
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,760
It's all, it's chicken all a king.

1353
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,600
Yeah.

1354
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,440
Oh no.

1355
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,360
He cares from worrying about restaurant margins.

1356
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,360
Yeah, yeah, it's all, that's your forte.

1357
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,200
Guys, stop giving away Oscarings.

1358
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,600
Oscar's aren't free.

1359
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,440
On the house.

1360
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,920
We want to be generous, but we can't.

1361
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,360
We're not made of Oscars.

1362
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,160
The market price of crab is through the roof.

1363
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,920
Does, excuse me, the flounder,

1364
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,400
I think it's a little bit undercooked

1365
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,220
and Jason was like,

1366
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,920
I just saw some ketchup on it.

1367
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,040
It's fine.

1368
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,600
Podcast the rights under peril.

1369
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,440
Yeah.

1370
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,160
Is there another Pete container though

1371
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,720
that we could say instead of barrel?

1372
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,360
Scott, I wish I could find flounder

1373
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,440
that easily in Los Angeles.

1374
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,520
It's like finding good Italian bread.

1375
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,400
It's impossible.

1376
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,560
I had to agree with Spielberg and Gatzelberg.

1377
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,200
The bread out here leaves a lot to be desired.

1378
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,880
Or you have to learn about the local kinds of,

1379
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,000
like torta roll, but Leo rolls are delicious.

1380
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
If anyone has a restaurant that's going under right now

1381
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,840
or you think, oh man,

1382
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,480
I don't even know if I'm gonna have six months left

1383
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,660
on this thing, but I gotta ride out and see.

1384
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,260
Just add us to the name of your restaurant.

1385
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,500
Podcast Clubhouse, yeah.

1386
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,740
Yeah, just say like, and let's see what happens.

1387
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,580
I'm not guaranteeing.

1388
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,880
This isn't very clever,

1389
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,980
but it's a nod to your past to call it

1390
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,700
podcast the rides flounder container.

1391
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,540
Yeah, great.

1392
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,020
A nod to the famous store.

1393
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,300
That's good.

1394
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,300
Unless there was a specific kind of container

1395
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,220
you were fond of, then feel free.

1396
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,180
You're the expert.

1397
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,020
Okay, yeah.

1398
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,940
I mean, I'm trying to think of the type of,

1399
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,340
there was a thing called an AMAC box.

1400
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,260
That's too confusing.

1401
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,540
That's not a widely known term though.

1402
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,380
That could be a meal.

1403
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,260
Sterlite, is that the name of the brand?

1404
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,100
That's a good meal.

1405
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:27,940
Well, if it's a brand, we can't.

1406
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,060
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1407
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,020
I'd love to see any of these.

1408
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,540
Your containers start containers full of lobster.

1409
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,920
We saw.

1410
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,840
Podcast the rides flounder bin, right?

1411
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,500
That's generic, that's not a brand.

1412
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,780
Flounder basket.

1413
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,460
Well, yeah, you could get it in a basket.

1414
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,300
That's not bad.

1415
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,660
I'm just trying to think of like flounder hamper.

1416
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,100
Podcast the rides flounder hamper.

1417
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,740
That's my favorite sounding one so far.

1418
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,580
That's pretty good.

1419
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,620
If you know that your establishment is going to tank

1420
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,660
and you wanna have fun on the way down,

1421
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:02,020
I will help you turn it into podcast the rides

1422
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,620
flounder hamper.

1423
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,940
There is in the Valley, there is,

1424
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,100
I've heard it used to be an H salt fish and chips,

1425
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,940
which was another chain.

1426
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,420
It's mentioned in Mad Men.

1427
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,620
I think Pete Campbell, when he lives in Los Angeles,

1428
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,300
that's H salt fish and chips is one of his clients.

1429
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,700
I have heard that one of the locations

1430
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,940
is still a fish and chips place,

1431
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,340
but they had to take off the H salt maybe

1432
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,780
because they are no longer associated with it,

1433
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:32,380
which it seemed like it was falling apart to begin with,

1434
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,220
so I don't know.

1435
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,820
So this is a scenario you're looking for.

1436
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,900
Yeah, well, you're looking for.

1437
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,740
We're.

1438
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,380
Yeah, you're gonna help run it with the guy,

1439
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,900
whoever the person or the person is.

1440
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,740
We're gonna take over this former H salt.

1441
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,900
Take off this dying fish and chips restaurant.

1442
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,100
Uh-huh, and then we'll yeah.

1443
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,380
Let's kill it in style.

1444
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,220
Jason.

1445
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,300
Greasiest fish and chips I have ever had,

1446
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,980
a notoriously greasy dish.

1447
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,860
We can promise you Jason will put in a 40 hour workweek

1448
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,060
there also to help you with everything.

1449
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,460
I mean, I feel like you end up working an 80 hour workweek

1450
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,540
running a restaurant.

1451
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,860
Also, what's the statistic?

1452
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,460
Like most restaurants close within five years?

1453
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,780
Yeah, well, this one's closing.

1454
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,620
Oh, yeah, we're gonna be dying.

1455
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,940
We're gonna be done way quicker than that.

1456
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,220
Yeah, it could be a matter of weeks.

1457
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,060
Oh, nearly.

1458
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,500
You might not even get up to 80 hours.

1459
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,900
It'd be like the first day we'd get like five listeners

1460
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,740
that were like, oh, that's funny they did this.

1461
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,900
Wow, they did it.

1462
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,820
Boy, classic.

1463
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,980
This is my favorite show.

1464
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,860
These guys really commit.

1465
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,540
Oh, well, I took a picture and didn't buy anything.

1466
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,380
Yeah.

1467
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,340
Four days later, we're in the ground.

1468
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:34,020
The tartar sauce is immediately given everyone listeria.

1469
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,500
Jason was having a screaming match with the owner.

1470
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,140
You son of a bitch.

1471
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:44,340
I said market price on the scallops.

1472
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,740
Not buy one, get one free.

1473
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,740
Are you insane?

1474
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,620
The owner found a garbage bag of shrimp in Jason's trunk.

1475
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,900
Smuggling.

1476
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,540
He's trying to start a second business somewhere.

1477
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,020
He's like, I'm gonna waste the rest of the game.

1478
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,180
He bought a big freezer

1479
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,820
and he's trying to eat for the rest of the year.

1480
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,620
Now you say garbage bag of shrimp.

1481
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,220
That was one of my worst PA jobs,

1482
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,060
production assistant jobs in Hollywood.

1483
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,140
Did you eat on American Gladiators?

1484
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:09,980
No, that was.

1485
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,820
One garbage bag of shrimp, brother.

1486
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,140
That at least had real,

1487
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,860
there was, no, this was a promotionalbreak.com web series.

1488
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,420
The lowest you could go, PAing.

1489
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,740
And so I was shooting at this house

1490
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,540
and this guy's house in the valley,

1491
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,820
shot on a Friday, off on the weekend.

1492
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,040
They had shrimp,

1493
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:33,340
they had shrimp, like etouffee or shrimp and rice

1494
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,860
for lunch on Friday.

1495
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,620
Threw them in garbage bags in his trash can.

1496
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,220
Came back Monday morning, they're like, okay, bad news.

1497
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,820
You guys gotta go to a hardware store and buy some rate.

1498
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,740
The shrimp garbage bags are covered in bugs.

1499
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,740
They are covered in maggots.

1500
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,580
Oh my God.

1501
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,460
And then another guy who had a truck,

1502
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,940
we had to throw the garbage bags in his pickup truck

1503
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,700
and drive around to find an open dumpster.

1504
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,020
This is illegal, by the way, to dump that much trash

1505
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,300
in someone else's dumpster.

1506
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:08,260
And after blasting it with hardware store bug spray

1507
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,300
to try and kill the bugs,

1508
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,780
this was the lowest point of the recession.

1509
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,300
There's said I think of anything of your life,

1510
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,140
of anyone's life.

1511
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,580
Probably. Oh my God.

1512
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,820
Jeez. Break.com.

1513
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,660
But it was where we all remember the content they made.

1514
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,500
Don't we?

1515
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,300
Are they the ones who did that motorcycle stunt

1516
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,980
that almost killed that guy?

1517
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:37,180
We all got coffee mugs that said break.com we know guys.

1518
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,100
Which I still have.

1519
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,060
I have to get rid of that.

1520
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,900
I hate that.

1521
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,540
Why am I still haunted by that?

1522
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,540
Can we steal that?

1523
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,300
Cause we know guys too.

1524
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,500
Like podcast The Ride.

1525
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,460
They love Ellen Hale and talking about lobster.

1526
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,500
This could have been,

1527
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,260
we could have gotten a show on Spike TV if it still existed

1528
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,660
with the content we put out.

1529
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,140
I have some memory real quick,

1530
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,820
just some memories here from people on that Facebook.

1531
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,180
Oh great.

1532
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,020
My friends and I,

1533
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,220
I guess this is not negative cause this person was excited.

1534
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,340
My friends and I used to go in there in our skateboards

1535
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,060
and try to get free candy or mints.

1536
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,740
One time Ellen Hale was there and kicked us out

1537
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,380
of the restaurant and told us the candy was for the patrons.

1538
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,060
My friends and I were thrilled to meet him

1539
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,500
even though he kicked us out.

1540
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,780
Well, here's somebody.

1541
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,060
When I was a kid, he shook my hand right after I ate nachos

1542
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,700
and got cheese all over his hand.

1543
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:28,700
Well, hey, thanks for the free sauce buddy.

1544
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,900
Hey little buddy, appreciate it.

1545
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,100
You can wipe your hands, I don't skip or anything.

1546
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,220
Yeah, I think those were the best.

1547
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,820
Oh wait, here's one.

1548
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,620
Jimmy Cagney was there that night also

1549
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,300
with a 22 year old on each arm.

1550
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,540
I remember this being not too long before he passed.

1551
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,500
Yeah, Jimmy Cagney would have been old.

1552
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,340
Very old.

1553
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,860
When this was over.

1554
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,220
Were they his nurses?

1555
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,380
Let's hope.

1556
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,220
Yeah, yeah.

1557
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,660
Let me just wait, I had a couple of them too.

1558
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:05,660
Well, I saw that he, I think he would like,

1559
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,180
I saw a comment saying that he would like kick drunks

1560
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,020
out of the restaurant.

1561
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,220
I like that he had to do it too.

1562
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,500
Yeah, it was him.

1563
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,500
Why wasn't there like not a bouncer but.

1564
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,900
Well, I think he just took charge.

1565
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,340
Why would you hire a big old lug

1566
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,900
when you yourself are the most famous big old lug there is?

1567
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,700
Yeah, I guess so.

1568
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:26,100
But then one, one, no, one person,

1569
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,860
one drunk who he had to kick out of the bar

1570
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,500
was David Carradine.

1571
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,420
I guess I saw this, I saw this too, yes.

1572
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,820
I like, yeah, David Carradine.

1573
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,660
I have this here.

1574
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,820
He started destroying the restaurant.

1575
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,420
With his kung fu moves.

1576
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,140
With quote, his kung fu moves.

1577
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,900
He started, he got drunk and rowdy while at the restaurant

1578
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,900
and had started to do some damage to the place

1579
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,780
using his martial arts.

1580
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,860
Alan Ayl had to throw Mr. Carradine out

1581
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,500
and did so using a baseball bat just in case.

1582
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,340
He was.

1583
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,500
The real question is though,

1584
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,780
did he ever resort to having to hit a patron with his hat?

1585
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,380
Oh man.

1586
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,140
Why you?

1587
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,220
That was, in today's day and age,

1588
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,380
that would be like an upcharge event

1589
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,820
to get hit with his hat.

1590
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,220
Like you go in there and you get the meal,

1591
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,940
but you pay $50 and then it's like at the convention

1592
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,220
when you see like Robert Englund dresses up

1593
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,500
as Freddy Krueger once in a while,

1594
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,020
but you gotta pay a premium.

1595
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:17,860
Oh yeah.

1596
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,500
To get a photo with Robert dressed as Freddy,

1597
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,780
and not just a regular Robert.

1598
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,460
So yeah, if you get a hat, if you get hit with his hat,

1599
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,900
that would have cost money.

1600
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,580
But I don't know, it seemed like he liked the bat better.

1601
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,980
He seemed like he liked, he was like a pro wrestler sting

1602
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,860
and his weapon of choice was a bat in real life.

1603
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:37,260
I want that like in a street fighter level.

1604
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,100
Alan Hale with a bat versus David Carradine.

1605
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:44,260
Did they ever do that on Celebrity Deathmatch?

1606
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,340
Back in the day?

1607
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,180
It was that?

1608
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,220
They did it on a relevant Celebrity Deathmatch.

1609
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,140
That was on like note cards, like when they were struggling.

1610
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,420
That was possible, like we don't have any ideas

1611
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,260
we can do this one.

1612
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,540
Slagerkuggen versus Vizierinus.

1613
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,540
The van leader brawl.

1614
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:04,540
I found the website for MeTV, which is a channel.

1615
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:05,900
Oh I saw this, yeah.

1616
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,500
A cable channel that has a lot of syndicated shows.

1617
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,340
It's Nick and I now basically.

1618
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,180
It's got Svengulli on it too.

1619
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,540
That same guy Mark at Vanir covers a lot

1620
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,980
of historical stuff on it.

1621
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,300
And there was a blog post about Alan Hale

1622
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,140
and like different facts.

1623
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:24,140
Cause he, after this restaurant was opened through the 80s

1624
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,860
I think he financially got out of it in like 1982.

1625
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,620
Eventually would open a travel agency,

1626
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,060
like a travel company.

1627
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,940
Leisure and travel I believe it was.

1628
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:37,580
Yeah and so they had different facts about it

1629
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,700
that he advertised for a Canadian car dealership.

1630
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,900
That he had a travel agency.

1631
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,660
All these different things about his life.

1632
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,900
One of the comments, this is from Jeffrey.

1633
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,940
22 months ago, early 2020, early days of the pandemic.

1634
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,740
Jeffrey said, ah yes, the skipper.

1635
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,780
At least he would whack Gilligan on the noggin.

1636
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:01,500
Unlike dumb ass AG to Barney, Barney was a four star

1637
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,500
insolent, insubordinate turd.

1638
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,220
So this guy was really mad at Barney Fife.

1639
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,860
He's talking about Barney Fife and Andy Griffith.

1640
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,700
Andy Griffith.

1641
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,980
And he's saying that he appreciated the skipper

1642
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:16,020
who would discipline Gilligan in an aggressive way

1643
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,260
versus Barney who Andy Griffith never like punched Barney

1644
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,020
on Andy Griffith even though.

1645
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,940
Older man appears to have a black and white photo

1646
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,140
of him in the services.

1647
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,100
So he took these TV shows very seriously.

1648
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,060
I believe, or at least the ranking.

1649
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,260
Like he took rank fairly seriously.

1650
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,100
Right, because Andy.

1651
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,580
He wanted more discipline on his.

1652
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,660
He wanted Andy to discipline Barney.

1653
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:40,260
Barney was an insubordinate, an insubordinate turd,

1654
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,220
an insolent.

1655
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,260
He must have hated Hogan's heroes,

1656
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,300
like letting the soldiers let everybody just hang out

1657
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,260
and goof around.

1658
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,100
Yeah, that's true.

1659
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:49,940
In a fun time.

1660
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,180
Yeah, there's almost no discipline on that.

1661
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,340
Go to find that guy's account

1662
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,140
and see if it's just him complaining about

1663
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,820
like any sort of rank.

1664
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,860
Oh, are there other Jeffrey comments?

1665
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,900
Yeah, let me look.

1666
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,700
Yeah, see if you can find like a few is upset.

1667
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,220
I have many thoughts about F Troop.

1668
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,980
Larry Storch, still alive.

1669
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,740
Wow, you have your chance.

1670
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,140
100 years old, I think.

1671
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,260
At least try to get cameos from some of these.

1672
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,300
I don't think Larry Storch is on cameo.

1673
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,220
Well, he should be.

1674
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,380
Let's get him on there.

1675
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,620
I feel like we gotta talk about the best thing.

1676
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,300
Oh, I'm sorry, I passed by the tweet just to say it.

1677
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,980
Another time when Alan was throwing a drunk out,

1678
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,380
the guy was yelling that his daddy's in the mafia

1679
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,580
and he was gonna come back and kill everybody.

1680
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,420
Pfft.

1681
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,580
You know, Alan was an enemy of the mob.

1682
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,260
He took on the big institutions.

1683
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,820
It depended on what part of the mob.

1684
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,980
I'm sure he was connected to some part of the mob.

1685
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,620
Maybe it was a different part of the mob.

1686
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,500
Maybe, maybe not.

1687
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,740
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe he wasn't.

1688
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:58,060
But anyways, so there's all these great print ads

1689
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:01,180
which we'll try to post.

1690
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,300
But the best one, clearly,

1691
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,260
I mean, do you wanna do the honors?

1692
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,340
I feel like just a reciting.

1693
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,140
You know what I'm talking about, right?

1694
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:11,980
Wait a minute.

1695
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:12,820
If you don't have it.

1696
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:13,660
Yeah, you do it.

1697
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:14,940
I think I have it, but I'm not sure exactly

1698
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:15,780
which one you're talking about.

1699
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,340
Well, it's the Mother's Day special.

1700
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,180
Oh, right, right.

1701
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,020
Yeah, you do it, yeah.

1702
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,220
Okay, okay.

1703
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,580
Oh, yeah.

1704
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,620
Yeah, I got this too.

1705
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,860
This is some of the video.

1706
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,660
Feel free, Jason.

1707
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,660
Oh, no, sorry, I found Jeffrey's account.

1708
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,500
Oh, man.

1709
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,140
All right, you, Scott, go for it.

1710
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,580
I don't understand a lot of these comments.

1711
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:38,900
I think he's commenting on shows well before I was born.

1712
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,580
He has bandleader complaints, you don't understand those.

1713
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,620
The Dorsey's were lazy.

1714
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,940
They used poor batons.

1715
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,540
Okay, so Alan Hale advertising

1716
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:52,340
the exciting Mother's Day special at the restaurant

1717
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:57,100
in big old print bigger than anything else in the ad.

1718
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,980
Alan Hale wants to mother your mother.

1719
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,500
Smaller text.

1720
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,820
It's the sort of thing you'd expect of skipper Alan Hale.

1721
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,220
Besides, what mother can resist that personal touch,

1722
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,380
especially on May 13th.

1723
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,420
Alan Hale's lobster barrel,

1724
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,900
828 North La Cienega just below Santa Monica Boulevard.

1725
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,340
Call this number blah for reservations

1726
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:21,300
and warm the cockles of your mother's heart.

1727
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:26,220
Now cockles is a word my mother used growing up.

1728
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,220
Cockles is something I have heard.

1729
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,460
So your mom would have wanted her cockles warmed.

1730
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,540
Yes, exactly.

1731
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:33,500
I know she was not the biggest

1732
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,940
Gilligan's Island fan in the world.

1733
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,740
So maybe not by Alan Hale.

1734
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,140
Didn't want the personal touch on her cockles.

1735
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,700
She liked Batman though, she was a Batman fan.

1736
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,940
Well, what's a cockle?

1737
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,740
What's an example of using cockle in a sentence?

1738
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,580
That's a good question,

1739
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,420
I don't actually know the answer to that.

1740
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,060
Do you have any guesses to how she would have used cockle?

1741
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,740
Heart, warming the cockle of your heart.

1742
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,140
That's the phrase she would use.

1743
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:56,420
Oh, Merry Christmas.

1744
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,260
This time of year just warms my cockles.

1745
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,140
That's right.

1746
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:01,900
Jason, have you ever said cockles?

1747
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,900
I must have said cockles at one point in time, Michael.

1748
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:05,740
Yes.

1749
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,460
He seems upset that I even interrupted looking up Jeffrey.

1750
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,460
No, I just said that you even had to ask.

1751
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:12,300
That's fair.

1752
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,700
I'm looking up cockle.

1753
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,980
There was a show called Cockles in 1984,

1754
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,420
a British television series.

1755
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,660
This guy's probably yelling about cockles on MeTV.

1756
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,940
Cockles, oh, oh, oh, cockles are ventricles.

1757
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:24,780
Oh.

1758
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,980
Literally ventricles, that's what the phrase is.

1759
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,580
Do you want them warmed?

1760
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,180
Would it help your heart if their ventricles got warmer?

1761
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,340
I think you always want your heart to be a bit warm

1762
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:35,180
if it's cold. A little bit,

1763
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:38,100
but maybe not, it seems like warming too much.

1764
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,140
But doesn't say like, you don't want them like hot.

1765
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:41,980
Yeah, I don't think so.

1766
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:42,820
Heating up the cockles of your heart.

1767
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,340
Well, if you're gonna die,

1768
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,660
is that what a defibrillator does is warm your cockles?

1769
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:52,060
I think, no, well, it will warm them

1770
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,380
with the jolt of electricity, but.

1771
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,940
That's what I'm saying, yeah.

1772
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,180
Maybe, I think your, I don't know.

1773
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,700
I think your mother's cockles should only be warmed

1774
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,780
if she's about to die.

1775
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,900
I think they need to be a consistent warm,

1776
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,220
a model of warmth. I think a consistent warmth.

1777
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:06,300
You want a jolt of warmth. Yeah, no, basically warm,

1778
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,180
but like, let's not get them any warmer.

1779
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,220
It concerns me. But did the Grinch,

1780
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,900
when the Grinch's heart grew whatever sizes,

1781
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,540
was it warmed also because it was growing,

1782
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,060
because it felt he felt such like love?

1783
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,540
And did the cockles grow or only the heart,

1784
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,860
or does the heart, I guess ventricles are in the heart,

1785
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:24,100
so his cockles must have grown.

1786
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,900
They had to have grown,

1787
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,180
but does your heart heat up when you're working out?

1788
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,140
Does it heat up? Your body does.

1789
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:33,700
Your heart rate increases.

1790
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,900
Right, so I bet your heart temperature

1791
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,300
and your cockle temperature would have to increase

1792
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,420
if you're using. If cockles might all get warm

1793
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,820
a lot of the day. That's right.

1794
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,660
If we're in good shape.

1795
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,780
So when Michael Eisner had that heart surgery,

1796
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,340
it was, his cockles were being?

1797
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,420
His cockles were fucked up for sure.

1798
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,180
It was quadruple, so he had to have

1799
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:52,940
his cockles warmed four times.

1800
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,940
Right, and Letterman too.

1801
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:57,020
Anybody who's famously has had heart surgery.

1802
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:59,180
Or some of our most famous cockles.

1803
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,780
Checking in with Jeffrey on the post pic,

1804
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:04,420
call in what would you watch on TV in 1982?

1805
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,420
This is good, this is like a comedy tragedy.

1806
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,740
May we see both sides of Jeffrey in this,

1807
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,780
because he talks what he likes and what he doesn't like.

1808
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:14,180
He says, facts of life,

1809
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,740
give me an ice pick for my eyes and ears.

1810
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:17,580
Okay.

1811
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:22,580
Conversely, Jeffrey has to say, the happy wanderers,

1812
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:26,340
coffee and cabbage rolls, am starting to laugh.

1813
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:27,180
What is that?

1814
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,180
Coffee and cabbage rolls?

1815
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,980
I don't, I am unfamiliar with the happy wanderers.

1816
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,420
I have heard the term before.

1817
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,380
Yeah, I think that was a short lived show.

1818
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,220
Ice pick for facts of life.

1819
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:37,620
Doesn't care for facts of life,

1820
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:42,260
but also says SCTV best TV comedy.

1821
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,500
So. Okay.

1822
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,980
So it's pro SCTV.

1823
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,380
That's pretty current.

1824
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,260
Happy Wanderers,

1825
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,020
nationally syndicated travelogue television show,

1826
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,340
originally aired on KTLA in the 60s.

1827
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:57,860
Is this a travelogue, I guess?

1828
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,140
This is deep stuff.

1829
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:02,980
The cast included Slim and Henrietta Barnard,

1830
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,420
Buddy Noonan and Milos Hinshaw,

1831
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,940
who was the cinematographer for Mystery Mansion.

1832
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,460
So now we're at the point of the episode

1833
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,580
where the references even we don't understand.

1834
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,780
We're talking about proto Rick Steves.

1835
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,860
We're talking about pre.

1836
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,500
Huel, Huel, pre Huel.

1837
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,340
Yeah.

1838
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,380
This is not related, but is related

1839
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,820
because we're saying old names.

1840
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:29,420
Do you know Sigourney Weaver was related to an entertainer

1841
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,020
that I was not aware of.

1842
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,660
And I believe it was her uncle.

1843
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,380
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

1844
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,140
I knew she had some sort of relative history.

1845
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,620
Dennis Weaver?

1846
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:43,340
No, this man's name was Doodles Weaver.

1847
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:46,940
What's up with Doodles?

1848
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,380
Doodles Weaver was an entertainer.

1849
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,140
Yeah, Sigourney was his niece.

1850
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,140
His brother was Pat and he was an actor,

1851
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,260
comedian, singer, musician.

1852
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:56,020
He was on variety shows.

1853
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:00,140
He was on a Spike Jonze track, I believe.

1854
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,380
The old musician, Spike Jonze.

1855
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:03,580
Yeah.

1856
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,020
And I think he was just like, he was around.

1857
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,220
He did a lot of stuff.

1858
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:09,020
His name was Doodles Weaver.

1859
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:09,860
Doodles.

1860
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:12,900
And I was delighted to learn that.

1861
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:17,340
Oh, you like Alien and Avatar, do you?

1862
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:21,500
Well, Sigourney's all right, but not my favorite Weaver.

1863
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,100
That's an opinion we can all have now.

1864
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,380
Feel free to.

1865
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,220
Everyone listening, yeah, have that opinion.

1866
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:32,220
Feel free to clear out the party.

1867
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,700
You're uncomfortable with Omicron still.

1868
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:38,060
Have a party, say that, and then everybody will leave.

1869
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,420
This episode is probably the most thing Mike

1870
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:43,780
has shown at a party thing.

1871
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,340
You wanna know a weird L.A. thing.

1872
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,540
You know, like.

1873
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,540
That energy, you mean?

1874
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,460
Yep, that energy of pulling out your phone and showing.

1875
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,820
Do you know the Skipper's restaurant?

1876
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:53,820
The lobster barrel.

1877
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,580
It's just, it is.

1878
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,860
Yeah, this one is a real simulation

1879
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,380
for being somewhere with one of us,

1880
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,460
where you're just getting yelled at.

1881
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,500
You're getting yelled at facts about.

1882
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,340
It was all right.

1883
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,980
We were having fun and then they started talking

1884
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:10,100
about Alan Hill's lobster barrel and Doodles Weaver.

1885
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,700
I don't know, they're guys you see once every couple months.

1886
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,340
They're not bad guys, but.

1887
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,540
A little too much.

1888
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,020
A bit too much sometimes.

1889
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:27,060
So look, I think this guy's great.

1890
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,580
Really happy he wants to mother our mothers

1891
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:33,900
and warm their cockles.

1892
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:39,380
And he warmed so many cockles by signing autographs.

1893
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,820
What if he was like Ray Fiennes in Grand Budapest Hotel

1894
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:47,980
and he was just like having sex with every mother,

1895
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,460
every older lady that came in there.

1896
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:53,260
Ma'am, I would like to mother you.

1897
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:56,420
And it was, and they were like, I came in here for that.

1898
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,460
I came in here to be mothered by you, Mr. Hail J.

1899
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,980
I saw the ad.

1900
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,140
I will take a crab Newberg to go.

1901
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:08,140
That I believe just sauteed with paprika or cayenne pepper.

1902
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,980
A lot of it's just cream, sherry or cognac

1903
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:13,540
and then paprika or cayenne pepper.

1904
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,860
Different combinations.

1905
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:19,620
I'd like something a little more than the meal tonight.

1906
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,100
Alan, would you Oscar me?

1907
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:25,620
Okay, little buddy.

1908
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,220
A little something extra on top.

1909
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:32,580
You knew what he was getting at.

1910
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,700
You discipline men so much better

1911
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,380
than that lousy Andy Griffith.

1912
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,860
The hat stays on.

1913
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:44,860
Discipline me better than Bernie Phife.

1914
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:47,060
You can leave your hat on.

1915
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,700
You can leave your hat on.

1916
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,060
Well, I'd say it got pretty sufficiently weird.

1917
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:55,980
Hey, let me say things on the way out.

1918
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:56,820
You can leave your hat on.

1919
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:00,340
I think you survived Alan Hales lobster barrel

1920
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,260
on podcast throughout the Second Gate Celebrary.

1921
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:06,940
But is there any, could we possibly Oscar this place?

1922
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:09,500
Is there any way to make it better than I think it?

1923
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,700
This is everything that, you know, so far,

1924
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,540
we've only talked about dive.

1925
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:17,420
I was saying, I don't think you feel the Spielberg in it.

1926
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,820
You feel nothing but Alan Hales.

1927
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:20,660
Pure Hales.

1928
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,300
He's Oscaring all over this place.

1929
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,420
The only way it would be better is you showed me

1930
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,980
that the whale mouth, like if it was something

1931
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,260
that looked like the minnow or something,

1932
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,540
the minnow of the ship from Gilligan's Island, of course,

1933
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,060
or that it had more like tiki,

1934
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:39,180
like whatever you would call like their makeshift

1935
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:40,940
living situation on Gilligan's Island.

1936
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:41,780
Yeah.

1937
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:43,380
This was a dang submarine restaurant.

1938
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,220
Yes, that would have been-

1939
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,140
This is what should have done it.

1940
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:45,980
This is what deserves it.

1941
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:46,820
Even something just-

1942
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:47,860
There's half ideas here.

1943
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,780
You could fill, a dive would still be around

1944
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,620
if Alan was-

1945
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,460
Just more nautical.

1946
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,660
You can't tell completely,

1947
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:54,260
but there's some footage of it on YouTube.

1948
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:58,140
And just see a more nautical theming for sure

1949
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:58,980
would have been great.

1950
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,300
Shade the building like a crab trap,

1951
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,660
like a lobster trap.

1952
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,060
Sure, or a big barrel.

1953
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:03,900
Or a big barrel.

1954
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,460
Even just a big barrel simple enough.

1955
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:07,740
That's really the only, like what else would you want

1956
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,940
other than just like, I don't know,

1957
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,180
Bob Denver being there too, maybe.

1958
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,020
Yeah.

1959
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,700
But honestly, it's better that it's just Alan, you know?

1960
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,260
It's only, do you like Gilligan's Island?

1961
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,100
Yeah.

1962
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,460
Well, I've got a place where just the Skipper is.

1963
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,260
And I'm not saying, Bob should have had his own place.

1964
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,700
They all should have had separate restaurants, obviously.

1965
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,220
We're talking about Caesar Romero.

1966
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,580
It's like every Batman villain

1967
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:30,980
should have had their own place.

1968
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,220
Gorshians.

1969
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,740
Oh, A-Head writes itself.

1970
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:34,940
I'm saying, but the actor,

1971
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,020
Vincent Price should have had a place.

1972
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,900
All our waiters are dressed the same,

1973
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,540
so they look like the goons.

1974
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,740
It's like there's a video of Frank Gorshin

1975
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,180
I'm sure I've talked about on the show before.

1976
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:47,100
He's on Dean Martin Variety Show, I think.

1977
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,940
And he's singing his hit single, The Riddler.

1978
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,860
But he's not dressed as The Riddler,

1979
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,020
but the like dancer ladies are.

1980
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:55,860
Oh, okay.

1981
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,620
They're dressed in like the question mark stuff.

1982
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,380
And he's in just like a suit.

1983
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,740
But he's dancing and doing the like Riddler laugh

1984
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:03,620
and stuff in between singing.

1985
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:07,820
And yeah, imagine every Batman,

1986
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:11,740
every Otto Preminger should have had a restaurant.

1987
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:14,340
All three Catwomen, Julie Newmar,

1988
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,860
Lee Merriwether, Anne Earthquit.

1989
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,220
That's Catwoman Row on Cassie Winnigan.

1990
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:22,220
Catwoman Row on, that's a sub part of the celebrity area.

1991
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,900
You didn't know all three Catwomen.

1992
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,940
One restaurant should be drinks,

1993
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,180
one should be appetizers, and one should be entrees.

1994
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,740
So then you just go down the line.

1995
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:32,580
I have a pitch for that.

1996
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,740
Anne Harriet should have had her own restaurant.

1997
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,580
Yeah.

1998
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:40,180
Bob Denver's Dinner Diner.

1999
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,580
That's a pretty funny name.

2000
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,420
That's a pretty good name.

2001
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,260
Yeah, that's good.

2002
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,420
You know what, let's,

2003
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,780
maybe we're gonna do more of these,

2004
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:48,060
but is there an ultimate,

2005
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,300
I ultimate like, okay, let's see,

2006
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,580
let's add parameters of this.

2007
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,860
And let's ask the audience about this as well.

2008
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:57,380
Let's have a cutoff for when the actor's like famous TV show

2009
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,420
was off the air.

2010
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,340
So like, let's say it had to be off by like 1970.

2011
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:03,780
That's pretty early.

2012
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,300
1975, you think?

2013
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,140
I don't know.

2014
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,700
You think, well, maybe we,

2015
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,860
people are like a lot of eighties kids.

2016
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,660
You know what, I don't know.

2017
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,180
Cutoff, it's in 79, I'll say.

2018
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:16,020
All right, great.

2019
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:16,980
79 is a cutoff.

2020
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,460
That's generous, I believe.

2021
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,460
So what is the ultimate actor?

2022
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,260
Jason, it could be Frawley, it could be,

2023
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,580
like what would you have wanted

2024
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,420
out of this type of an establishment?

2025
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,180
If you go back in time and also have,

2026
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:31,100
like manifested one of your favorite old.

2027
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,140
The cutoff is hard,

2028
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:36,060
cause like I feel like a Peter Falk restaurant is,

2029
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,380
but he played Colombo well into the nineties

2030
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,380
on TV movies and stuff.

2031
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:40,500
Okay, well, all right.

2032
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,700
That's if they started.

2033
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,700
All right, I'll give you Falk if you want,

2034
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,140
but I don't think the listener should be allowed to pick

2035
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,220
somebody who went into the past.

2036
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,900
Is this a game for the listener?

2037
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,740
Yeah, no.

2038
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:54,580
They all have to agree,

2039
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:57,060
and it can't be until that show has to be done and canceled.

2040
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:57,900
It's too hard though,

2041
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,140
because if I were gonna pick Fred Gwynn,

2042
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,540
who played Herman Munster,

2043
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,740
he reprised the role later.

2044
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,540
After 79 did he?

2045
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:07,220
Oh yeah, wasn't there one 80s one?

2046
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,020
There was an 80s Munster revival.

2047
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,860
Get rid of the cutoff, I said.

2048
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,700
Fine, I'm getting rid of the cutoff.

2049
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,140
Or open up revivals.

2050
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:19,140
But they had to start with the role before 1979.

2051
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,300
Okay.

2052
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,580
How about that?

2053
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:24,940
Like their big famous role had to start before 1979.

2054
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:27,340
My answer is Paul Lin.

2055
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:28,180
Mm-hmm.

2056
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:29,020
There had to be like,

2057
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,580
I would have wanted a Paul Lin restaurant.

2058
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,140
It could have been like called Uncle Arthur's,

2059
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,940
which is his character on Bewitched.

2060
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:39,300
Uncle Arthur's, let's say he sold like stew or something,

2061
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:43,180
like boiling like a stew cauldron.

2062
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,340
You have to put on the ascot instead of a bib.

2063
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,460
And what you would have to change is,

2064
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,820
because what I like would happen with some of these guys too,

2065
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:53,100
like George Lindsay, who played Goober on Andy Griffith.

2066
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,340
He then started calling himself George Goober Lindsay.

2067
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:59,660
Just so you remember, he played Goober on Andy Griffith,

2068
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:03,820
which is why some of the signs say Skipper Allen Hale Jr.

2069
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,180
Just to remind you that this guy played the Skipper.

2070
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,340
That covers everything.

2071
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:09,420
It reminds you of his father.

2072
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,260
Yes.

2073
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,020
The junior in there, it reminds you of him.

2074
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,420
And then it reminds you of the Skipper, yeah.

2075
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:19,420
So call it like Paul Uncle Arthur Lin's like stew cauldron.

2076
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,180
And it's like a little spooky too,

2077
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:24,140
because it's an ode to that Halloween special he did.

2078
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,300
And then he would always be there.

2079
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,460
There's also a Paul Lin Castle Dracula recording

2080
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:30,420
where he like, I don't know what it's from,

2081
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,340
but he's just like,

2082
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:34,460
Ressi, Igor, what are you?

2083
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:36,780
I'm Count Dracula.

2084
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,420
Like it's on Spotify, I don't know what it's from,

2085
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:42,700
but like, so he had some Halloween stuff too.

2086
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,020
So I feel like that would be my ultimate,

2087
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:46,900
the Paul Lin's stew cauldron.

2088
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,140
Paul Lin, Paul Uncle Arthur Lin's stew cauldron.

2089
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,220
I mean, that's incredible.

2090
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,700
I don't know how to top that.

2091
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:58,460
I would like if, and I don't know his name off hand,

2092
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,940
but whoever played Sam the Butcher on the Brady Bunch.

2093
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:01,780
Oh yeah, what does that guy do?

2094
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,140
Make him open the butcher shop.

2095
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:04,260
He's gotta do it.

2096
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:05,660
And he's gotta be cutting the meat

2097
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,460
and maybe he doesn't do it so good.

2098
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,660
Maybe some of the chunks are too big.

2099
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:12,460
Maybe people get hurt sometimes during the day.

2100
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,660
But that's part of the fun.

2101
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,900
You don't know what's gonna happen.

2102
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,380
Alan Melvin is his name.

2103
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,220
Okay.

2104
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:21,420
Sam the Butcher Melvin's House of Brady Meat.

2105
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:23,780
All right, that's great.

2106
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,380
Yeah, that's great.

2107
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:28,100
House of Brady Meat, fantastic.

2108
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:32,140
And if it's Falk, then is like,

2109
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:34,660
if you had to name, I don't know Colombo well enough,

2110
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:38,700
but well, Ville Colombo, Colombo's House of Ville Colombo.

2111
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,900
I mean, yeah, you could probably take the entree.

2112
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,420
Or like precinct.

2113
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,740
His precinct of Ville Colombo.

2114
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:50,580
I was trying to think of a Jack Benny restaurant

2115
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,420
then I thought of something better.

2116
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:55,260
Tennessee Ernie Ford's 16 Tons of Fun.

2117
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:00,340
And I think maybe that's like a kid's like birthday part,

2118
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,700
like a Chuck E. Cheese kind of like,

2119
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:06,060
or it's like a Uncle Mo's Family Feedback.

2120
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:09,260
It's like a TGI frat with a lot of, you know,

2121
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,100
chintzy stuff on them.

2122
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:12,340
Maybe it's like, oh, maybe it's like a honky ton,

2123
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:14,340
like a Roadhouse or something,

2124
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,980
like a Texas Roadhouse got a lot of license plates

2125
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:20,620
on the walls, like a lot of barbecue and stuff.

2126
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,340
This is also-

2127
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,500
I got another, I just got another one.

2128
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:29,500
What about Randy Chucco Runyon's Hot Dog Sack?

2129
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:31,700
You remember his name?

2130
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,140
Randy Runyon is Chucco, he plays Chuckle the Clown.

2131
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,300
Randy Runyon.

2132
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,820
I didn't look it up either.

2133
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,260
Yeah, you didn't, God.

2134
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,860
Yeah, what's that thingy bib juice?

2135
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,700
Bib juice, yeah, you serve bib juice there.

2136
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,780
Which is an industry standard.

2137
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:49,100
It stands for, oh God, what does it stand for?

2138
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,300
Something in a bag?

2139
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,220
We looked it up.

2140
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,940
I'm gonna look this up, yeah, it's like a-

2141
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:58,420
All right, well you get Randy Chucco Runyon's Juicy Bib.

2142
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:02,020
Yeah, you're draped with a bib.

2143
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:04,620
Oh, beverage in a bag, I believe.

2144
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,780
So it's like if you, like a soda fountain

2145
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:11,140
or like the big like milk dispensers

2146
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,260
and like dining hall and stuff.

2147
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,380
It's usually like a bag and like a crate

2148
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:20,140
that you like feed into it and then cut the dispenser hose

2149
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:21,860
and then feed the hose out.

2150
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,300
That's how those machines work often.

2151
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,980
Okay, so that's why, so bib juice is a good one.

2152
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,100
Bib juice, yeah.

2153
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,180
Because I've sure been picturing that Chucco

2154
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:35,620
with a murder newborns and then like squeeze

2155
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:39,700
whatever was left into a juice and makes people drink it.

2156
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,220
Bag in a box, bag in a box, I'm sorry, I got it wrong.

2157
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:43,060
Bag in a box.

2158
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:46,580
I've got, you know what, I wanna just a real vague tease

2159
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:49,500
just for you two too, but I have an idea for Chucco

2160
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,060
but that's all I'll say.

2161
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,580
Well now let's really get out of this episode.

2162
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:58,740
Now you survived.

2163
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:00,260
Bug has the ride, the second gate.

2164
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,620
And again, with this Zorn reveal that you're talking about.

2165
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:03,500
Yeah, we're Zorns.

2166
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,460
Yeah, the other reveal is like,

2167
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,460
you like, the listener might have been thinking

2168
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,340
at some point, yeah, well there's such like kids

2169
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,980
who are the 80s, 90s and they love deep references.

2170
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:16,700
No, no, no, we've been wanting apparently

2171
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:19,500
to go back to the fucking 20s.

2172
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,820
That's what it's been, we're 100 years old at this point.

2173
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:24,980
Pre seat belts, keep going back.

2174
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:29,580
Pre that Tylenol scare in the 80s, keep going, keep going.

2175
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,780
Preludes, preludes.

2176
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:36,300
Preludes, not a prelude, preludes.

2177
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,020
No, preludes, like Simpson's joke.

2178
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:43,060
Well, look, if you want more of this,

2179
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:45,380
if you want more of this,

2180
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:49,060
we have only just begun the celebrity dive.

2181
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:53,300
It's the second gate all month is this kind of thing.

2182
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:58,300
You're gonna be swimming in mother sauce all month long.

2183
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:04,020
You're gonna be mothered and be covered in mother sauce.

2184
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,260
That's our promise to you for the rest of the month

2185
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:07,380
here on the second gate.

2186
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,300
I forgot to say this too about Alan Hale's father.

2187
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:12,740
He is credited with inventing and holding the patent to

2188
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:15,100
and or financing the creation of auto brakes,

2189
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:18,380
handheld fire extinguishers, greaseless potato chips

2190
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,900
and the folding theater seat.

2191
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,500
No, all of that.

2192
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,580
Alan Hale senior, that's what it says.

2193
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:25,420
There's no way.

2194
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,740
That's what it says online.

2195
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:29,140
That's Alan Hale's father who was a big inventor.

2196
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:32,620
He's, Alan Junior's getting drunk

2197
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:34,580
and telling tales out of school.

2198
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:36,820
I don't think Alan Junior got any of that money

2199
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,100
because I saw a picture of like,

2200
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,220
here's his house in Hollywood.

2201
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:43,140
Like, and he was a pretty modest one story.

2202
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:43,980
No, it was a beautiful house,

2203
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,580
but it was a modest, respectable one story home.

2204
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:51,860
So I'm saying like Alan Hale did not get like insane.

2205
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:52,700
Inventor money?

2206
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,380
Inventor money, air money.

2207
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:55,220
I don't know.

2208
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,500
Maybe that was one of his houses.

2209
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,420
Oh, maybe it could have been.

2210
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:00,500
Maybe he put it on the boats for the travel company.

2211
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,980
He maybe invested too much money in both businesses

2212
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,700
and lost all of it.

2213
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:05,540
That's bullshit.

2214
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,580
He probably lived in a stupid one story house.

2215
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,580
He should have lived in a big lobster.

2216
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:11,780
Missing opportunity.

2217
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:12,620
Yeah.

2218
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:15,020
Well, if we have a time machine, we'll go tell him.

2219
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:15,860
Yeah.

2220
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,460
And we'll be back on the main feed this week

2221
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:21,500
to warm you or your mother's cockles.

2222
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,340
Guaranteed.
