1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,920
they did the mash they did the podcast mash the podcast mash it was a modest

2
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,400
smash a modest mesh three guys ramble for cash the podcast mash they disagreed

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,880
about the flash it's uh hey what's up uh here on haunt cast the fright the

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:44,400
cemetery gate I'm Scott Boris Gerdner joined by Mike Boris Carlson I wrote

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,960
the full names out even though I know your names I was like the Boris is gonna

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,680
trip me up and then I wrote Mike Boris Sheridan what the wrong fuck it's Jason

7
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,400
Boris Sheridan yeah Jesus I don't know it's look there's a lot to think about

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,920
about there's the established spooky names which I've departed from and we're

9
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,360
doing these putting Boris in places Boris isn't usually I'm a mess I'm

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,180
your ramble your nightmare your biggest nightmare is a scientist combines Jason

11
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,720
and I in a lab and like a horrible experiment and then you have to deal

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,840
with both of our annoying stuff at when one person that's so that's what's I

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,600
think happening season a one-stop shop isn't the easier to do one person yeah

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,000
harder with two then like then somebody talking about coupons and apps where you

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,520
get medical results it can't become a conversation it stays in one body right

16
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,720
so actually a mad scientist could do me a lot of good okay well then you should

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,640
find the mad scientist to do it to combine Jason and I just like down the

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,920
middle I guess makes the most sense well in the modern way to find two of us if

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,720
we did down the middle then there's two yeah there's a Jason Carlson and Michael

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,120
Sheridan no that's what I know that's what you really don't want that's like

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,520
in there is my father's actual name Wow Oh Michael Sheridan okay this monster

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,160
exists in reality yeah I bet mad scientists are fairly easy to find

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,640
because I think in the modern world if you want a mad scientist just find

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,880
anyone who Joe Rogan talks to as a regular doctor or scientist he had a mad

25
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,640
scientist construct in a lab that orange shirt he was wearing in the

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:32,880
special yeah with the the boob sweat stains the dude I mean that's that story

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,120
told me before star recording that was crazy so you you're telling me you were

28
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,920
working in the lab late one night and your eyes held an eerie sight that's

29
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,000
fucking crazy bro I mean were you on mescaline or something like what's up

30
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:55,840
ayahuasca that is I mean that's that's I'm sure happened verbatim that's

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,560
happened yeah yeah so far there's a lot of hours of it there's no and he has a

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,320
lot of like free thinkers on there's no way that he hasn't encountered a real

33
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,680
life mad scientist who saw a real monster so that's just great you know

34
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,680
cuz like I mean those monsters should come out here cuz like in Texas you can

35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,440
do what the fuck you want like you know like nobody's gonna tell you you know

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,480
mash this way or mash that way like in Texas you do what the fucking ever man

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,280
RFK jr. is definitely gonna have a story in the next couple days about yeah I

38
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:31,760
was at a monster party and yeah I killed a Dracula I threw it in my trunk and then I

39
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,680
had to go to a steakhouse I had to go to Peter Lugar's for a dinner and then

40
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,240
people like reporters would be like well it looks like from forensic evidence he

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,920
wore the Dracula's skull like a mask at dinner and people are trying to figure

42
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,000
out what's going on and he's like no I didn't wear the mask I didn't wear the

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,680
skull like a mask that didn't happen and actually some DNA tests run and were

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,280
run and what he assesses as a Dracula was actually a 12 year old girl just

45
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,520
walking by in the forest who didn't do anything he had a wild past it was a lot

46
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,680
going on he used to hang out with Epstein look and Cosby and Weinstein and the

47
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,880
wolf man and the creature from the Black Lagoon these are just people he would

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,720
meet in New York it was New York City that's just in a party at the Black

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,240
Lagoon and I was introduced to this guy and what's his name creature I didn't

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,920
know the guy didn't spend a lot of time with him but it's my story and what can

51
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,960
I say Woody Allen invited him to the Black Lagoon one night because they was

52
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,640
hanging out with Woody Allen in New York as you do and then shit got out of

53
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,640
control pretty sure if you go in the Black Lagoon you are guaranteed a brain

54
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,600
worm so that at least would explain something that's right yeah true a worm

55
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:52,880
crawled up Kennedy's brain so we're talking monster mash today although I

56
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,840
will let me please emphasize the plural that this is this is a monster mash is

57
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,640
because much like the recent episode football shuffles there's one primary

58
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,400
one that we know about but it is a genre there are multiple things in this

59
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,760
genre yeah and and we're gonna talk about it here on the haunt cast to me

60
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:22,320
this feels like an inevitable episode just given kind of our pop cultural

61
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,880
interests and leanings and especially because it feels like the kind of thing

62
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,000
this hasn't literally happened but it feels like within the month there could

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,400
be a party going on and I leave a mash if you will and I go to the bathroom and

64
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,000
when I come back I find Mike like pointing at Justin Michael or somebody

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,280
and saying like Bobby Boris Pickett is good and I'm like how did this start and

66
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,400
you and Justin's like I don't know I didn't bring him up at all yeah no I

67
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,440
haven't I haven't said anything for the last 10 minutes I'm like my hands are

68
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,360
like choking Justin I'm like he's good Bobby Boris Pickett is good you you

69
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,240
didn't even say hello you just immediately started screaming the whole

70
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,320
room could hear it's super kicking everyone in the room don't take your

71
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,120
anger out Shawn Michaels yes well I will say this I think three or four years

72
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,380
ago I have called this shot on the show oh did you mash specific but just the

73
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,840
genre well I remember some discussion of like a monster mash related issue am I

74
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,480
making that is that what you're talking about yes and I think I made a mistake

75
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,040
on that and I think I've already apologized for it but I incorrectly

76
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,480
thought that the monster mash was recorded before Bobby Boris Pickett that

77
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,800
was completely wrong I was talking about Don Hinson and the rig of morticians and

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,080
they had a cover I believe it was in 1964 and there was something that was

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,240
listed wrong as far as dates so I apologize if I haven't apologized for

80
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,080
that before but so but that was a discussion of how well I was digging

81
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
through all like old Halloween music I was

82
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,960
music from past Halloween's that was I think like 2020 pandemic era driving

83
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,880
through haunts and stuff I think that was we were I remember listening to this

84
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,280
stuff in the car uh-huh so I think it's this is four years you're blaming the

85
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,960
pandemic for it yes a dig into into the mash genre well and for my incorrectly

86
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,080
reporting the original monster mash yeah and it was a time of a lot of fake news

87
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,000
and right not being able to trust sources and that's why a Joe Rogan is

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
needed to kind of make you question you're listening that's Dr. Fauci was

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:44,440
working in the Wuhan lab late one night there are labs and warehouse outside San

90
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:55,000
Bernardino or whatever the kovat comic-con kovat comic I saw it exists I

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,040
don't know anything else about it though did you get it someone it's someone got

92
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,720
like a kovat no no the comic book they were hanging out there normally a

93
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,400
comic-con there are the Westboro Baptist Church like repent you're going to hell

94
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,400
protesters this time there were kovat truthers talking about labs in

95
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,680
California and giving out a comic you should have guy didn't realize you were

96
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
giving out a comic I would have read that I tried to get it I thought it was

97
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,920
grass so I was you thought you were grabbing whatever someone hands of me

98
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,560
and it turned out to be the entertainment weekly you couldn't tell

99
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:40,560
the truth people from the entertainment I wanted to get the comic from the woman

100
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,160
cosplaying as the character from the comic but didn't work out well a comic

101
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,840
is a car you'll grab whatever you have free comics and you didn't realize till

102
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,560
page 13 it was a kovat truth or yeah hey wait a minute Reynolds said they had a

103
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,200
lot of fun making Deadpool this isn't cove it I think the character dr.

104
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,880
Fright she might be a stand-in for someone in our real world it is fun

105
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,000
though it sounds like they made it fun if that's the case which I appreciate

106
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,840
making history fun you gotta you know yeah you sneak the vegetables in to give

107
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,760
to the kids yeah it's gotta be so all right so monster mesh and pretty there

108
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,520
have been previous monster mesh controversies but well what we'll do we

109
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,760
can start with the the original the one that changed the game yeah you know fan

110
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,360
out and see what else is is in this world but that of course requires us to

111
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:44,080
start with the monster match the by Bobby Boris picket who so wait 62 is the

112
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,120
song is that is that correct which it feels to me like it is slowly becoming

113
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,080
and this will only become more the case as you know sands wash over some of

114
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,280
history yeah I feel like there will be a point in time where like pre Beatles 64

115
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,600
there are only five songs and anyone remembers or talks about and one of

116
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,680
those is the monster mash I think it hung in there yeah well especially like

117
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,240
of a rock and roll genre mm-hmm cuz like you'll get your classical pieces it'll

118
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,360
stick around whatever no that's different yeah like you're Dean Martin

119
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,040
stuff and we'll still have owed to joy but then yeah also besides that although

120
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,640
that's fine monster mash wipeout owed to joy I say yeah that's I like it better

121
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,760
uh-huh yeah I know what I've listened to more but there are yes there are a lot

122
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:40,240
of pre Boris Bobby picket mashes well okay so where do we go do we fan out do

123
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,080
we yeah I think go here and then we'll maybe go back in time we can go but we

124
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,240
can use this as the arrival point and we can go back in time and forward in time

125
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,360
yeah all the way to 2005 right as far as I can tell the most recent mash yeah

126
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,960
yeah that Bobby himself participated in but so yeah even when we were kids this

127
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,440
was a pretty fundamental piece I think it's buoyed by being one of the only

128
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,280
Halloween songs still in all this time yes we've talked about before you go to

129
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,040
that you walk around a neighborhood in trick-or-treat season and you hear you

130
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,640
know we try to loop in like sweet dreams are made of this or whatever but

131
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,160
like all right well just because it's like you know man-eater we're deciding

132
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,840
man-eater is a Halloween song but it's a bit of a stretch in terms of pure

133
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,040
actual meant to be Halloween songs it's sort of this and thriller and look

134
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,160
thrillers dicey or at this point so I Bobby Boris picket bite at his time beat

135
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,880
Michael Jackson yeah I mean it's a it's an amazing story especially given that

136
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,760
the guy was he's a veteran he fought in the Korean War he what it's something I

137
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,000
didn't know about this kid because you hear that voice which is like a creepy

138
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,200
guy and a very like lived in Boris Karloff kind of voice and I think as a

139
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,160
kid and maybe even until recently I thought this was just like an old weird

140
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,840
guy I think he was I thought he was a Vincent Price kind of person so when you

141
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,920
see a photo of him and he's just kind of like a sharp blonde he looks like

142
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,680
Jan and Dean he's just like kind of a clean cut could have been in the wonders

143
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,120
and the thing you do wonders he's like an actor as well he I think he was just

144
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,340
like figure trying to figure something out mm-hmm yeah anything anything that

145
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,900
could we a I think he had like a fine career he'd pop up on things I forget if

146
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,960
these are before or after the mash but he was on Beverly Hillbillies he was on

147
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,200
Petticoat Junction he he dated Cloris Leachman pretty cool yeah yeah good the

148
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,520
Diane Cannon yeah who went on to marry Cary Grant you know not long after wow

149
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,080
I was this guy was the Hollywood elite yeah I as a kid anytime anybody was like

150
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,240
doing some sort of like Halloween based I don't know music or TV you would think

151
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,480
that they were maybe like oh they're from like hell they came up from hell

152
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,520
Ozzy Osbourne as well and you hear Ozzy Osbourne talk about figuring out the

153
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,560
gimmick for black Sabbath and it was just like well like some people like

154
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,000
this like devil worship type stuff so we may as well let's try that as far as our

155
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,880
gimmick yeah it's not like they were so into it before they just were like ah

156
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,200
this is might be a fun gimmick Alice Cooper yeah yeah sure yeah seeming that

157
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,600
pretty like mild-mannered guy just kind of like golfer yes my grandfather got

158
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,340
on my dad's side golfed with him one time he came home like hey you know I got

159
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,600
paired with today you're a day son you're into the rock and roll you know

160
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,520
this guy Alice Cooper you ever heard him like what the fuck you golfed with Alice

161
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,360
Cooper today I think recently I've heard Alice Cooper say he golfs seven days a

162
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,920
week I think he's and Alice Cooper showed up on like the Mickey Mouse clubhouse

163
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,120
yesterday when my daughter was watching like a doll like a goofy looking Alice

164
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,940
Cooper shows up with a top hat boys by him well so yeah he rolled this character

165
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,240
rolls on the screen and I go Alice Cooper and then I look it up and 2019 is

166
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,240
like yeah Alice Cooper does voice on the Mickey Mouse I forget then I forgot the

167
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,920
name of the character right now there's one for the dads yeah for the dads of

168
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,520
the dance yeah yeah the older grandpa son for grandpa yeah that's where I'm

169
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,780
glad Marilyn Manson walks the walk and talks the talk he is he plays an evil

170
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,520
guy and is an evil guy yeah finally somebody who's not this namby-pamby

171
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,160
yeah Alice Cooper probably goes to the GOP convention but it's not as aggressive

172
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,400
yeah I guess I'm sure he's like lightly bad yeah in the way you some that age

173
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,800
not as far as I know as bad as Marilyn Manson sure yes yeah um but anyway he

174
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,760
like Bobby Ross Pickett sings in bands and in his in a little like nightclub

175
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,840
show he does he did this impression and gave somebody the idea of like maybe we

176
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,640
could get something out of this and do a little novelty single yeah maybe sell

177
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,880
5,000 copies and that's the ultimate dream of this which it's so bizarre

178
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,800
that it's now like it yeah it will be it will dethrone truly some classical

179
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,000
composers yeah will be much less remembered than right the monster mesh

180
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,840
yeah I mean when I see a picture of her I see a video of him doing it it feels

181
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,560
very much like when I see Frank Gorshin doing an impression of somebody there's

182
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,560
this there's like I don't know if you ripped Frank Gorshin off I just like it

183
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,280
feels go it feels like the impressions of the time for some weird reason I

184
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,640
don't even know I can articulate what I'm talking about well isn't it even in

185
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,120
some respects is this song and he doing this voice not more iconic than Boris

186
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,440
Karloff himself yeah yeah this point it's more around you're more like a you

187
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,080
know like a three-year-old is gonna hear this and maybe never see a Boris Karloff

188
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,840
performance yeah probably I mean there's Simpson voices and like I guess Wren from

189
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,800
like that's Peter Laurie's voice but like do most people our age know Peter

190
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,320
Laurie's voice or they know what Wren sounds like hmm so there is like that

191
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,120
weird thing where people are doing impressions of famous stars and I'm

192
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,080
wondering what the breakdown of people who know what that voice is actually

193
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,360
from mm-hmm so yeah you're probably right yeah well this is why we're here

194
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,240
to teach the history and the Vegas terms that are wrong and we don't actually

195
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,680
know yeah so let's get into it the Laurie cast with Jason Sheridan I'm here to go

196
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,680
through the Laurie biography as I know both Wren and Peter Laurie is that a

197
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,200
dream solo I mean you just talking old character actors yeah yeah yeah mm-hmm

198
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,880
six hours long and it's just you just do you'll go and you'll go and like get

199
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,440
lunch and leave the mic on and stuff crunch crunch crunch right like so it's

200
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,760
not like a continuous I stopped talking about the Maltese Falcon our hours and

201
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,400
hours ago and you'll wander in the room you be like oh it's still on and you sit

202
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,720
down you go a couple other thoughts I had during lunch then you just kind of

203
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,920
go for more thoughts on M on Fritz Lang's M so you should put it on yeah

204
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,140
it's a podcast it'll take up your whole day and if you sync it up yeah you can

205
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,100
take a lunch break as Jason does yeah that'll help you get through the work

206
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,900
day it's like hey I'm here with you I know this email job sucks but we'll get

207
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,740
through it together you're not having lunch alone you're having lunch with

208
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,620
somebody who's also not talking right on you can hear them crunching with their

209
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,660
mouth that's good idea but anyways so they put this song together and just

210
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,740
here you know to jump out of history I don't know how much need there is to

211
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,020
play the song itself very famous I think we know it to our audience I

212
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:50,740
assume yeah but here what I will do is just play I'll play my favorite zone of

213
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,660
it here there's a little snippet

214
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:15,460
a functional yeah not a funny lyric never really thought about Dracula's son

215
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,500
before and now it's all I'm gonna think about all day yeah yeah is he in any

216
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,460
media is there anything you can watch there a son of Dracula movie I'm sure

217
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,820
there is possibly maybe a famous one but but that just makes me picture of like

218
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,620
mild-mannered son who's learning how to be a vampire right although it could

219
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,860
also be you know they're like eternal so they're so you know Dracula's son could

220
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:54,420
be 700 years old Dracula's adult son yeah yeah I think this analysis is way

221
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,540
more than they did when they were writing the song yeah yeah yeah well

222
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,900
definitely because they wrote the song in half an hour yeah I think that's

223
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,860
literally true this was knocked out and surprised me like so many of you know

224
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,460
that's what they say that's what that's what McCartney says yeah Brian Wilson

225
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,020
says that God only knows all the masterpieces God only knows in Monster

226
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:18,180
Mesh there is a Beach Boys connection by the way that in early television

227
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:24,500
performances or at least in one Bobby was backed up by the Beach Boys the like

228
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,100
less nationally famous speed here's a photo of Boris making a face and

229
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,420
there's Brian Wilson next to him that's cool other Beach Boy David Marks Beach

230
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,260
Boys did a pretty inessential cover of this they would do it live but it would

231
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,540
lead to some good like I mean they like lit it scary and Mike Love made scary

232
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:51,300
faces and that's good all spooked or like did all of their problems throughout

233
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,340
there a lot like mental health issues and and Mike Love's general

234
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:02,220
cantankerousness was it just because they were too scared from the song the

235
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,780
song freaked them out well I think about it they mainly did surfing songs before

236
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,900
this and then that was maybe the first veering into into darker territory it's

237
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,540
like the musical equivalent of a bad LSD trip so yeah the monster meant that

238
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:20,980
their encounter with Boris Pickett maybe they never recovered from I was gonna

239
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,860
say I think I mentioned this on the show before but a couple years ago Bruce

240
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,580
Springsteen and the E Street Band did a cover of Monster Mesh and did like kind

241
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,100
of a ska or like a reggae version of it and in the middle of it Bruce just goes

242
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:39,980
this is terrible so funny because it wasn't really working I don't know why

243
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,460
they did it like that but in the middle he's wow terrible geez that the

244
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,060
confidence is there any history of anything like that of Bruce Springsteen

245
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,300
being never non confident not that I've seen within its three-hour sets because

246
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,180
Bruce is like this ridiculous I'm not gonna be scared of a Dracula or

247
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:04,140
Frankenstein that's silly yeah he didn't like their asses what were you

248
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:10,220
saying oh well I was gonna say the thing I only just learned the view of the

249
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,820
stuff about the backing singers oh yeah yeah yeah there's crazy people on it the

250
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:21,420
blossoms they were like an in-demand like backing vocalist group mm-hmm they

251
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:27,340
included Darlene love Darlene love is on yes it's a stacked lineup Leon Russell's

252
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,820
on it the drummer of the ventures is on it it was a pretty yeah the Krip Kicker

253
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,720
five is actually well that's if you okay hang on the Krip Kicker five is the

254
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,300
they're the vocal group in the Sun so right but then there's a whole wait and

255
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,900
isn't the band also named separately technically yeah there's it's confusing

256
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,380
to me and then I think he had a different like band later but the but the

257
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,100
whole thing there's actually like a strange thing with all of it that I'm

258
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,980
stealing this observation from other sources from some article and somebody

259
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,380
pointed out in a tweet a long time ago but if you think about it the this is

260
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:12,140
the song is kind of a predecessor to tenacious D's tribute that it's not the

261
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,980
greatest song in the world it's just a tribute right it is the same thing here

262
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,860
because it's a song about encountering monsters doing the monster mash but that

263
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,220
but it's about that what we know is the monster mash is not what they did it was

264
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,900
also called the monster mash but if you think about it we don't know what they

265
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,780
were doing and playing or what the Krip Kicker five sounds like right at least

266
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,020
they're you know we're hearing humans who might have stolen that name yeah yeah

267
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,900
yeah it's a song about a song we will never hear that's a good point it's one

268
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:52,260
of the headier pieces of art of the century I think about it yeah there was

269
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,860
some way to know yeah you know it's like how great blues songs were lost

270
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,700
because nobody brought the bad scratchy microphone to play but yeah there were

271
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,300
no field recordings of the monster mash so we have no idea it might have been a

272
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,780
thousand times better than what within this song that is something that should

273
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,620
haunt you if you were a big monster mash fan like us yeah yeah what you will

274
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:18,660
never know what the when the mummy was banging on a bone xylophone you will

275
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,180
never know how good that sounded yeah how good how crisp the individual tones

276
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:29,020
of the different sized bones were yeah whoo it's gonna keep me up there's

277
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,820
something if we're analyzing why we like this there's definitely that that just a

278
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:39,620
bunch of monsters all playing playing a band together it's just inherently it's

279
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:45,060
so it's so fun it's a monster like they've survived a long time these same

280
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,460
monsters they're reborn all the time sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't

281
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,820
mm-hmm oftentimes it doesn't I would say sometimes they get a new member a

282
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,980
Carmilla creeper type well you're right the monster cereals of course you're

283
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,260
talking about all right right yeah she's back she's back this fall oh the

284
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,100
monster cereals are starting to come back oh okay that's good but it is like

285
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,700
cuz Halloween is so even though probably Christmas is everybody's favorite

286
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,780
Halloween as a kid is very exciting and mm-hmm I don't know there's just

287
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,060
something about Halloween that is super fun if it's the candy or the costumes

288
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:26,460
but yes this song you imagine the most fun party of your life and it's with

289
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,500
Frankenstein mm-hmm and the mummy is it almost is it one of the first

290
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,900
iterations of monsters being cute does it open up the genre that like they take

291
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,520
a little break from the terror like when is what's like Abbott and Costello meet

292
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,600
Frankenstein what year is that like oh that's probably before it's got to be

293
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,480
before aren't they kind of scary in it because they like jumping each other's

294
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,240
arms and stuff yeah and they're scared of him and stuff but that's they were

295
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,520
doing some comedy stuff with monsters 1948 is when they met Frankenstein and I

296
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,040
also like that when you Google this that Google is like you mean Abbott

297
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,960
Elementary no no I don't mean something from the last five years I'm looking for

298
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,440
a 1948 computer have you not learned the kind of things I look up whose computer

299
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:17,920
do you think you are five years well I was this is what I was trying to do and

300
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,320
I didn't have a good answer for when the first monster party anything existed I

301
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,120
don't know but I found previous monster party songs okay well that's let's go

302
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,140
backwards then yeah all right so you what you've done is proven that the

303
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,000
concepts did not necessarily come from Bobby Orr's pick right and I didn't I

304
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,440
don't know that maybe there's an oral history somebody can point me in the

305
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,960
direction but it was still like strange enough that in fact when Darlene Love

306
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,880
was at like you know she would just like hear about gigs from producers and

307
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,520
somebody's like oh you know can you come in we're doing a Halloween song and

308
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,960
she was like a Halloween song that sounds stupid never knowing it would be

309
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,600
one of the biggest yeah singles of her career although no not associated with

310
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,400
her really and Halloween wasn't Halloween wasn't as big of a deal back

311
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,200
then either you don't think so that's something I don't really know is like

312
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,080
the fully like how when does Halloween become right what we know is I mean yeah

313
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,160
I imagine the Monster Mash supercharged it I would I think that I don't know do

314
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,280
you think it's a straight line from 50s and 60s or is at any point in there does

315
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,920
it does Halloween get way more popular just one year I don't know it's good

316
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,920
question I wonder if just like and did it get way less popular oh wait no it

317
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:36,080
when was Kennedy shot 64 so what month it was 63 but what month November

318
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,560
November okay so it's in there before I bet it was a very I bet 63 it was a very

319
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,680
joyous Halloween and 64 everybody brought down a little bit maybe people

320
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,600
did not want to think about death no no even though even though it was November

321
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,600
65 would be a bummer at 65 okay by your logic the next Halloween in 65 would be

322
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,200
okay we shot 63 was he not didn't you say it was November 63 I'm confused

323
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,280
doesn't do this we have to settle on which Halloween was sad I think it was

324
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,960
in 1964 maybe 65 was a little bit sad still yeah I'm confused I'm trying to

325
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:20,360
load up Bert Convy's Monster Hop while I'm doing this too so you know do you

326
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,800
think there was ever the theory that Kennedy was that there was a there was

327
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,800
an errant Dracula or wolf man who was Billy's part of it he does say there

328
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:37,600
was a wolf man on that for many decades you've been ignoring the wolf right so

329
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,120
somebody was shooting a silver bullet at the wolf man I wasn't it's that's what's

330
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,480
so oral about yeah Oswald was a good man he was trying to kill a wolf man who was

331
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,280
trying to kill Kennedy but then the kid then the motorcade got in the way his

332
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:56,680
name is Lee Harvey Oswald Van Helsing people don't know that the name was too

333
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,440
long everyone got exhausted like how I'm back I don't have it in me to name those

334
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,120
last two names yeah so okay I so yeah I don't have a definitive answer what the

335
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,880
first monster party happened but 1958 Bert Convy who I mean in reality it

336
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,960
might have been in like the you know in the 1600 right the actual party if we're

337
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,080
talking the real party but when was it first acknowledged on wax right I don't

338
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,200
know but this is 1958 it is called the monster hop by Bert Convy who hosted

339
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,040
game shows and stuff oh right match game yes yes so you're a song really yep 19th

340
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,080
that's what it says 58

341
00:28:48,080 --> 00:29:11,320
that surely felt like the monster mash from an alternate reality that's what

342
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,280
there's so many monster mashes that's what I was like oh my god and then

343
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,760
afterward everybody was doing a fake monster mash too that's called a monster

344
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,160
hop by Bert Convy this has to be part of the inspiration for the Lewin Davis like

345
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:34,960
hey mr. Kennedy oh oh you know I think this novelty song there's a market for

346
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,960
some song and knockout and real musicians do it yeah this is a bill

347
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:47,400
doggett monster party 1959 I'm gonna say I give credit to any who represent

348
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,240
Frank it's beyond Frankenstein Dracula and Wolfman because yeah that's look

349
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,640
that's who I think of but those are the core I'll give bonus points to this guy

350
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:09,040
if he names beyond that bill dog it don't dog it

351
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,040
that gives us time to start dancing there are not a lot of lyrics in this

352
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:22,720
the place an unrelated song so it's like an instrumental and then it's like

353
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:29,160
what if I just a song interrupts that doesn't have the same meter or have

354
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,720
anything to do with the song that's currently playing yeah no that's it's

355
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,280
not as good as the the monster no I'm like a convie's winning for me so far but

356
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,000
still like that's I mean those are the base of the funniest too as far but like

357
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,960
that just yeah we'll go we'll move on but just to prove like this is not Bobby

358
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,880
Boris Pickett perfected it mm-hmm but the idea was out there I think the what

359
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,980
he brought to the party was alliteration I think that my well

360
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,840
monster hop is a fun term I think monster mash there's a right cleanliness

361
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,880
to it and just mash in general because now where did that come from was there a

362
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,520
lot of were people calling things mashes yeah that's a good question is it

363
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:16,440
related to the mashed potato maybe is that why yeah maybe is the monster mash

364
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:24,440
a dance or is it the party I think it's the most I think it's the dance monster

365
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,760
mash is the dance right it's not we did the mash we did the monster they did it

366
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,400
yeah maybe at the monster bash right you go to a monster bash to do the monster

367
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,160
mash you don't attend a monster mash mm-hmm right right all right so we're

368
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,960
getting around we're getting our dictionary a real quick a guy I brought

369
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:48,080
up years ago to 1960 sorry I forgot about this Zachary the great Zachary

370
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,680
this is a horror show yeah a bunch of things like a lot of these guys are like

371
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,480
they did radio for a while they did this like this was Bobby was big he was like

372
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,080
a kid I don't remember the channel but he was like a yeah LA DJ for but like

373
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,000
that 1960 is spook along with Zachary and this is an album I actually kind of

374
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,840
like in general and there's many songs but there's nothing there's nothing

375
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,600
about a party but just even musically I'm like the song ring-a-ding orangutan

376
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:24,720
huh similar to a monster mash that's all so I just just for funsies I'm playing

377
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:59,800
so it's in the spirit of it I think too it's a wild song really yeah

378
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:05,480
arrangement wise I like it yeah yeah it feels like some effort maybe was put

379
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,640
into it yeah yeah the only one that I caught that I kind of like actually that

380
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,960
I would recommend genuinely for your Halloween playlist if we're doing here

381
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,240
we're covering the ones we sort of actually dig this guy this is on called

382
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,760
beware by Bill Buchanan I heard this on a playlist by this guy Mayor Hawthorne I

383
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,080
like a lot who's trying to do all Halloween music and this this is this I

384
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,480
just think is pretty good yeah yeah beware by Bill Buchanan

385
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:06,800
yeah like this yeah this is just isn't that like leader of the pack story song

386
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:21,800
kind of you can count on it any odd time yeah a lot of just cool to me it is like

387
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,480
that's got a good vibe yeah yeah yeah that's cool I feel like there's a joke

388
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:34,040
there too of not like Pennsylvania 65,000 Transylvania 259 yeah I assume

389
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,400
yeah I don't quite understand what that it but I you know it feels like a

390
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:43,800
reference phone numbers they used to like have a word in there oh right yes

391
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,600
yeah yeah well what's the movie that's called something like that is

392
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:54,640
Transylvania 65 oh yeah yeah whatever not important but anyways so clearly this

393
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:00,800
was this did become like a thriving genre kind of capitalizing on the you

394
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,400
know like like the B movies of the era and you know probably all leading to

395
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,240
Monster Mash rising to the top but then it's kind of I think for this guy

396
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,720
especially like well what else do I do are there other things in this world in

397
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,240
this monster world that I can get up to and Mike you were comparing Halloween to

398
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,960
Christmas in terms of holiday fun and he thought why don't I bring some of

399
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,880
that Halloween fun over to Christmas so not too long after Monster Mash was the

400
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,800
follow-up Monsters Holiday

401
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:59,520
you didn't need to put them in a castle to know that's that's that's too

402
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,720
tortured of a rhyme I don't think the monsters all live in castles hmm they

403
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,600
shouldn't castles are where like the rich gentry live right right not they

404
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,680
storm the castle yeah I mean I guess no yeah Dracula lives in a castle yeah yeah

405
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,600
yeah and he I guess then he and all right so it's his castle and he invites

406
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,440
over because everybody else Frankenstein may be created in a

407
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:32,400
castle depending hmm he's created in a lab sometimes like a Frankenstein but

408
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,600
Wolfman that doesn't have to have a castle yeah creature mummy is in a tomb

409
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,240
of some kind you know Phantom of Opera is an opera yeah yeah he's not there

410
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,880
Hunchback's in Notre Dame tower but I guess that I know if you're going through

411
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,440
who's gonna host I mean it's look it's not Wolfman yeah not everybody's you're

412
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,560
not gonna although maybe there's something fun and grimy about going to

413
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,360
the cave I'll fit in you know it's like sure when you know when the party's all

414
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,080
happening in kind of a small kitchen and yeah yeah yeah yeah but Dracula has the

415
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,400
room for entertaining absolutely yeah he has a lot I'm sure and then secret

416
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,120
slides and all that shit yeah all right anyway

417
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:43,120
themselves a new play. They planned to rob Santa's slave. They were making a list and checking it twice. Frankenstein wanted a shiny new trike. A new chain went up.

418
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,840
this one definitely it just doesn't have the heat and no like some of the other

419
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:54,120
monster songs it so quickly devolves into spoken word yeah with some music in

420
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,280
the background yeah yeah just saying lists which that we got two tough rhymes

421
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,920
right away Frankenstein wanted a shiny new trike. Trike? I mean I guess there's

422
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,320
trikes for adults but you call it yeah it's called a recumbent bicycle or

423
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,320
something that's a strike he's gonna break a trike. What's funny to me

424
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,400
about this is this is on the first this is on a Monster Mash album. Oh yes the

425
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,360
original Monster Mash by Bobby boys picking in the Crip Kickers. Oh that's

426
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,560
right it's Crip Kickers are his band Crip Kicker 5 is the monster band who

427
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,760
will never hear. Right but so usually I feel like so like okay we got a hit

428
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,920
next album we're gonna just repeat it yeah we're gonna twist again next

429
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,240
summer yeah we're gonna try that we're gonna try to do it again there are

430
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,680
multiple attempts on the same album as Monster Mash to repeat this the the

431
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,440
future success of Monster Mash. Listen there's this song there's like 24 songs

432
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,360
on this album and they're all monster songs 16 and some of it like there's a

433
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,920
song called Monster Mash Party which I won't even play that's just the same

434
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,880
exact the thing as you're hearing now with less lyrics like almost about him

435
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:17,560
like cleaning up at the part or something like there's just so few ideas. These monsters made such a mess. Not quite that. They spilled the Mountain Dew. Everyone get a bag and start cleaning up. This is your responsibility too.

436
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,840
It's just like they were already out of ideas is what I'm saying.

437
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,400
When you listen to the actual Monster Mash. No there because like what do you

438
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,600
establish with Monster Mash is a song with like five verses and a lot of lyrics

439
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,920
that's where that spoken word gets you is now you got a jam it full of details

440
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,480
yeah but how many more do you have left you've used all the good monsters right

441
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,380
used all the good party stuff yeah we got Slim Pickens after I was I had the

442
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,960
same arc with this where I'm like I'm gonna go through the full album and most

443
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,920
of the album was insufferable yeah yeah I mean there's one called a Transylvania

444
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,920
twist which is mythology from the first Monster Mash because the Dracula says

445
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,200
whatever happened to my Transylvania twist so now we get to hear that yeah so there's

446
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,420
some interesting lore I guess here and there but a lot of it is really bad and

447
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:07,280
just a copy of Monster Mash only worse. What was anyone's feeling about the

448
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,480
werewolf Watusi? Well I like the name of it so that's gonna be elevated just in

449
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,480
general yeah let me let me do a second yeah can you play a little of that

450
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,040
that's interesting Lawrence Wolfe approved yeah but I just think he's doing like a

451
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,520
Dracula voice for a werewolf so I he didn't really change it up much but he's

452
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,440
Bobby Boris singing as the character right but it's it's just a little I

453
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:07,000
think he should have established you wanted him to sing like a wolf man? A different musical identity for each monster to switch it up a

454
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,520
little Jason the wolf man singing would be really hard to listen to probably

455
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,520
because he howls and stuff. Wolfman Jack was always howling on the radio. Didn't sing though.

456
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,560
Wasn't a good point. Yeah yeah. Wolfman singing? Wait wasn't somebody in this era

457
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,760
didn't somebody have kind of a wolf vibe persona or what was the deal with that

458
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:33,480
whoever did I put a spell on you that has that's kind of like a howling monster sort of if you count that as a

459
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,880
Halloween song I guess you could yeah but I some people have howled certainly

460
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,200
people have howled on record before yeah I'm just saying a purely as a wolf man that would be

461
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:51,840
yeah who sings a song dead man's Party it's a dead man it's a boingo boingo okay yeah that is roped in I'd say in the Halloween

462
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,760
that's a spooky yeah it's a Halloween song yeah yeah yeah I don't know I mean

463
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,320
you're look you're right for variety Jason but he is at that he established he

464
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,060
He is a vampire kind of guy, is he?

465
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,900
Yeah.

466
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,400
What was Boris Karloff, mainly?

467
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,560
He was, wasn't he Frankenstein, too?

468
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,180
Wasn't he Two Monsters?

469
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,020
Or am I mixing up?

470
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,400
I forget, I gotta go through,

471
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,820
I think they're all on Peacock, he was Frankenstein,

472
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,320
Bela Lugosi was Dracula.

473
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,160
Right, right, right.

474
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,320
That's right, yes.

475
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,720
These were all things I certainly had to know

476
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,740
as a Universal Tour Guide that was out of my brain

477
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,760
as soon as I stopped doing this stuff.

478
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,200
I know Bela Lugosi because of Ed Wood.

479
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,040
Yes.

480
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,860
I know that.

481
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,480
And I've seen some of these as well, but.

482
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,760
Bela Lugosi, hey!

483
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,220
But yeah, I like Ed Wood a lot.

484
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,160
It was, I just remember deep into tours,

485
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,480
because you go to the monster area,

486
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,920
I just remember that was a zone

487
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,080
where I would say these words, don't mean anything to me,

488
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,840
I just don't care about these movies that much,

489
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,520
and I'm like, it's right where I'm getting tired,

490
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,120
especially on a tour that's not going well,

491
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,240
and just trying to use,

492
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,320
how much tour guide energy can you muster up

493
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,160
in the Court of Miracles?

494
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,600
Bela Lugosi, Boris Karla, and like not,

495
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,160
if I don't have it there,

496
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,720
then the next 20 minutes are gonna be really rough.

497
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,560
Then I'm just excited to get into that mummy's tomb

498
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,920
where I don't gotta say shit,

499
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,720
except for I get like a full minute breath,

500
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,840
I could take a nap in there and it's dark,

501
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,320
and then I just have to wake back up to go,

502
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,940
Whoopi Goldberg, oh no, watch out for scarabs!

503
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,440
That's a good break, yeah.

504
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
A full minute, though, where you don't gotta do shit?

505
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,280
Yeah.

506
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,840
And you gotta know nobody's watching you, either.

507
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,920
They're watching the, yeah,

508
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,880
even the people who are in the row in front of me,

509
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,160
or they're not cognizant there's a human being there.

510
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,000
They don't wanna make eye contact.

511
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,600
Can nap against that window as long as I,

512
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,440
oh yeah, that's so uncomfortable.

513
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,320
Playing Tetris on the flip phone, you know.

514
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,760
I remember one time,

515
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,920
I may have said this on the show before,

516
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,720
that like somebody just like,

517
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,080
not only was reading in the front car in front of me,

518
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,880
but just like put it up at eye level,

519
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,840
like took it up from their lap to just block their face,

520
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,720
and I had the best view of somebody,

521
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,120
and they were reading that book.

522
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,760
What was that book that Oprah featured,

523
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,920
and then it turned out to all be a lie?

524
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,920
And they had to go on and apologize.

525
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,920
James something?

526
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,760
Yeah, yeah.

527
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,880
James Fry.

528
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,840
A million little pieces?

529
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, something like that.

530
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,360
Yes, after all that had,

531
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,560
after it had been determined that the book was fake,

532
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,560
somebody was just reading that right in front of me,

533
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,840
blocking their eyes to not experience King Kong.

534
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,680
That's funny.

535
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,680
I don't wanna see King Kong,

536
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,480
I wanna read the book, The Fabulous Droid.

537
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,520
How much money did you pay to come here and read?

538
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,320
Let alone that the book is a lie.

539
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,640
Anyways.

540
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,720
I wanna give Zachary Lee's album credit,

541
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,240
because there's different things on it,

542
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,560
and this Monster Mash is just like going to the well already,

543
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,400
that's what I wanted to say.

544
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

545
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,120
Oh, so you heard that full album,

546
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,520
and there's already a variety in the,

547
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,720
yeah, yeah, well, look, there's a repetition for sure,

548
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,520
and it's not helped by,

549
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,720
then he's, when he's kinda like back a couple years later,

550
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,160
when there's like a full,

551
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,200
a full true reset to a new thing.

552
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,040
Right.

553
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,720
It's not enough of a reset.

554
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,800
Here, he is after a big introduction by Dick Clark,

555
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,280
performing presumably on American Bandstand, Monster Swim.

556
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,200
Yeah.

557
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,040
Yeah.

558
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,520
I mean, his voice, and back in 62,

559
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,640
the trip kickers and I brought the Monster Mash to you.

560
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,520
But now it's a different day, and Mashie is a gray,

561
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,520
and the lights grow dim, we now do the Monster Swim.

562
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,880
Same beat.

563
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,800
All you would be, Monsters.

564
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

565
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I like that he's doing this in front of like

566
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,800
a big weird octopus.

567
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,640
Yeah.

568
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,280
Paper mache looking octopus, so I like that.

569
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,800
Yeah.

570
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,880
Let me see if I can get to the chorus.

571
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,360
Not so loud.

572
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,920
We can't do the monkey or even the dog.

573
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,720
Same piano, and basically, somebody else.

574
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,480
We can't do the monkey.

575
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,040
It's a cool side smash.

576
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,080
We can't do the monkey.

577
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,200
It's bigger than the mash.

578
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,520
It's bigger than the mash.

579
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,360
Oh man.

580
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,960
It's the most wishful thinking.

581
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,560
Bigger than the mash.

582
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,760
That's like the, like, it's a little while ago now,

583
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,640
but Trump doing like, and Biden might come back,

584
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,560
you know what he might do?

585
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,080
He's gonna come back, he's gonna try to take it,

586
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,840
and then I'll be debating him again.

587
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,400
Wouldn't that be something?

588
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,720
It's bigger than the first debate.

589
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,520
Oh, it's like, I just heard a thing about Trump

590
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,320
doing the like, the Congressional Medal of Honor.

591
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,560
It's better than the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

592
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,960
Oh yeah, yeah, that was funny.

593
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,720
I, yeah, it's very sad.

594
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,000
It's also like, you know,

595
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,640
when the career is just clearly on the down slide

596
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,800
a little bit, like we're sort of seeing it,

597
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,960
you know, Katy Perry had a rough year.

598
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,880
Yeah.

599
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,520
She did the song, was it, it's Woman's World.

600
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,360
Yes.

601
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,760
I haven't heard it, I just know it didn't really work,

602
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,480
but if somewhere in there, if she like,

603
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,800
I don't know what the song sounds like,

604
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,600
but it's like, woman's world, it's bigger than firework.

605
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,440
Ha ha ha.

606
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,840
Step aside last Friday night.

607
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,720
There was a video like released where she had to be like,

608
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,680
this is a, like weeks later after it came out,

609
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,440
she was like, this is a parody of like 10 year old,

610
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,080
like kind of rah rah, generic feminist sort of,

611
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,720
like she, you're like, she's explaining what the song is,

612
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,560
like weeks later, and it was like,

613
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,040
this isn't really helping this song.

614
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,920
Songs don't usually require a little story.

615
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,120
Which is what Bobby did at the start.

616
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,880
Hey, remember the other song?

617
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,440
You know me. You love the other song.

618
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,760
I know the beat, I know there's been a seismic shift

619
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,600
in pop music since the last time you saw me,

620
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,440
but do the Beatles do songs about monsters?

621
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,120
I'm timeless like the monsters.

622
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,400
Oh man, yeah, there's so much,

623
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,920
I'm sure there was like an argument

624
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,840
or who, like putting it together like,

625
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,200
people aren't gonna fucking remember this, okay?

626
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,640
This is a shitty song from a decade ago.

627
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,520
We had to remind them this was a thing.

628
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,400
This needs a scroll.

629
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,840
This needs a last time on.

630
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,480
This is a song that needs.

631
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,920
People don't know.

632
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,360
If you had a skip intro button on the song.

633
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,040
Jog your memory.

634
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,880
Yes, when Beatles release a new album,

635
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,880
at the start of the album, they should remind people

636
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,320
what other songs they had in case they forgot.

637
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,720
Hey, it's us, the Beatles.

638
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,680
We told you that she loves you,

639
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,480
but now we're back with a brand new bag.

640
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,600
All about holding your hand.

641
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,400
And just a reminder, it's not spelled like the bug.

642
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,880
There's an A in there.

643
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,040
You know what I'm realizing?

644
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,840
Don't forget about the A.

645
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,080
John Lennon does it in Glass Onion, I think, right?

646
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:39,920
Oh, you're right.

647
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,480
I told you about Strawberry Fields.

648
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,320
Yeah.

649
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
The place you thought. Wow.

650
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,160
Yeah.

651
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,360
That was definitely following the footsteps.

652
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,800
Yes, we were very into Bobby Boris Pickett at the time.

653
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,240
John thought that people forgot about Strawberry Fields,

654
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,840
so he wanted to remind them in Glass Onion

655
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,680
on the White Album.

656
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,960
You think they'll know we told them

657
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,120
about the fool on the hill?

658
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,400
They'd probably like the update

659
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,040
that he's living there still.

660
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,560
Yeah, he did it.

661
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,120
The walrus was Paul, he says, in that song.

662
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,240
What the fuck?

663
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,200
Yeah.

664
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,320
So John did it, yeah.

665
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,240
John did it, too.

666
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,640
I apologize to Bobby and the estate.

667
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,400
He paved the way for a lot of, yeah.

668
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,000
Well, and embraced genres, as we'll see.

669
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,760
I have no desire to play the song,

670
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,200
but somewhere in that album that there's the title

671
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,960
Rabian the Fiendage Idol.

672
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,320
That's what that requires Katy Perry-esque,

673
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,400
because you have to know about Fabian,

674
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,480
and that he was a teenage idol,

675
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,400
and I don't know much about Fabian,

676
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,640
just know that name.

677
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,320
I'm like, okay, I think I get it.

678
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,160
Rabian?

679
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,320
Is it rabies?

680
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,520
I don't know, I don't know, I guess.

681
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,680
This is kind of like, I know the big picture.

682
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,720
Like, Teen Beach Party, Universal Monster,

683
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,920
I haven't really gone back

684
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,400
and watched each individual movie.

685
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,280
Yeah, well, if you wanna combine them,

686
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,840
I think one of the best mystery science theater movies

687
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,920
is one called Horror at Party Beach.

688
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,600
And I'm trying to remember if that's the one.

689
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,480
There's one where when the monster shows up,

690
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,320
it looks like he has a mouthful of hot dogs.

691
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,960
Like, the first, of course you don't see him

692
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,360
for an hour and 10 minutes,

693
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,240
and then when he shows up, you're like,

694
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,360
he just has a big, he has like 16 hot dogs

695
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,200
jammed in his mouth.

696
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,480
Well, if he went to Party Beach,

697
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,080
that's a thing you have to do, I'm assuming.

698
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,440
That's like, it's a little competition.

699
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah, it's competition.

700
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,280
If you wanna cut it at this beach party,

701
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,280
you fit 16 of these bad boys in there.

702
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,800
It researched, like just researching

703
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,280
or looking through all this stuff,

704
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,560
I was just like, this is a 30-hour series

705
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,960
if you wanted it to be.

706
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,200
There's so much stuff that is,

707
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,280
even just in the time it was recorded,

708
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,560
not even going to the 2005 era.

709
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,720
Yeah, yeah, sure.

710
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,560
Yeah, I know.

711
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,480
I was disappointed by how many,

712
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,280
I assumed that there would be a lot more

713
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,520
that give you crazy mythology, you know?

714
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,800
I, because what I want is like story songs.

715
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,520
I want like, and he was returning from the blood bank

716
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,600
and he slipped.

717
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,400
They did the bloody twist.

718
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,240
Yeah.

719
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,400
They slipped on the blood.

720
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,440
Nothing's that funny.

721
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,280
Yeah, no, nothing is that funny.

722
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,120
But like, there's just,

723
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,600
there's so many like imitators too.

724
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,840
Oh, I forgot to even mention this,

725
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,080
Lon Chaney Jr. recorded Monster Holiday.

726
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:25,920
He covered it?

727
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,120
In 1964.

728
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,920
Geez, wow.

729
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,600
And then that other band you were saying

730
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,840
covered Monster Mash.

731
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,800
A lot of Monster Mash covers certainly over the years.

732
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,640
Yes, but then-

733
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,480
What was the band,

734
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,320
what was the scary band name of that?

735
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,160
Don Hinson and the Rigor Morticians.

736
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,120
The Rigor Morticians.

737
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,960
But then they-

738
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,800
And they don't have any originals?

739
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,640
They did have originals

740
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,240
that were rip-offs of the Monster Man.

741
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,680
Yeah.

742
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,960
Lon Chaney Jr., I think from,

743
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,760
I think I remember this.

744
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,200
There's a You Must Remember This series

745
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,480
on the Universal Monster Movies.

746
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,480
And I think the stuff about Lon Chaney Jr. is

747
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,320
he was a massive pain in the ass.

748
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,400
I forget the details, but it's like-

749
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,240
But not in the fun way.

750
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,120
Oh yeah, he was a real fail son

751
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,200
and like took over for his father

752
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,920
and like he sucked.

753
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,600
They have a song, Don Hinson,

754
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,760
I forget if I listen to this even,

755
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,920
called The Monster Dance Party, 1964.

756
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,240
You audition it here.

757
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,240
["The Monster Dance Party," by Don Hinson and the Rigor Morticians plays.]

758
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,320
Oh, I think this might be an instrumental.

759
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,520
Okay, I'm thinking of a different-

760
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,000
Instrumentals are dead to me.

761
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,480
Fake, it's a fake.

762
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,600
There is one here.

763
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,760
I think I even played it.

764
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,000
She's making something 10 minutes,

765
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,800
used Frankenstein as a surfboard.

766
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,840
Monsters, surf party.

767
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,920
This is called riboflavin-flavored,

768
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,440
non-carbonated, polyunsaturated blood.

769
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,120
If this doesn't have lyrics,

770
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:52,960
I'm storming out of the room.

771
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,800
It does.

772
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,120
["The Monster Dance Party," by Don Hinson and the Rigor Morticians plays.]

773
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,960
It sounds like Beware.

774
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,280
When the moon arises in the western sky,

775
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,120
and the vampires are out on strife.

776
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,160
Exactly.

777
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,080
At times they have trouble finding necks to bite.

778
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,880
That's why I concocted my new delight.

779
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:18,880
My riboflavin-flavored, non-carbonated, polyunsaturated blood.

780
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,040
Riboflavin-flavored,

781
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,240
non-carbonated,

782
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,520
polyunsaturated blood.

783
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,360
All right.

784
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,920
Beaver, let's step this down.

785
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,200
We need a take two.

786
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,040
Girls, I apologize.

787
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,080
You seem very nice,

788
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,160
but you're gonna have to sing better than that.

789
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,000
No.

790
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,840
All right.

791
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,800
Let's not even finish that one.

792
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,800
Just some constructive criticism.

793
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,720
You all sound like shit.

794
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,560
So let's go back in the studio and do it again,

795
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,080
but good this time.

796
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,240
We're doing it on purpose.

797
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,760
We're trying to sound like ghouls.

798
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,960
That's the idea. No, no.

799
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,000
Don't give me that shit.

800
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,960
They're shrieking, not singing.

801
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,400
It's justified.

802
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,680
Mike, I feel like that unlocked a memory

803
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,040
where I was at one of your apartments

804
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,840
and you have played the riboflavin song for me before.

805
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,560
I may have played that on this show before.

806
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,800
Around this, in the same episode

807
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,040
where we were talking about this four years ago.

808
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,920
Also, I have heard you go to bat for Zach or late

809
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,080
a number of times.

810
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,680
I listened to that Zach or late on the first time

811
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,840
like 10 years ago.

812
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,520
So you have certainly heard Ring a Ding,

813
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,160
Orangutan for many years at this point because of me.

814
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,680
I'm a man in my 30s, young, free, unencumbered.

815
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,280
Could just listen to Ring a Ding, Orangutan all night.

816
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,480
I think they have a G at the end,

817
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,520
even though it is Orangutan in the real.

818
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,680
So I think they misspelled it.

819
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,240
Soupy Sails has a song called

820
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,040
My Baby's Got a Crush on Frankenstein.

821
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,920
Can I just say, has Soupy Sails ever come up

822
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,760
on the show before?

823
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,600
I think a little bit.

824
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,000
Soupy Sails is like novel, or he had this kid,

825
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,360
it was like a kid's show, but adults liked it.

826
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,200
And I like it because he had this monster

827
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,120
in Fang who was only represented by a hand.

828
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,120
And I just love any good guttural yelling.

829
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,720
So I love when he like,

830
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,960
it was like something my dad found so funny.

831
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,600
So I found it so funny too.

832
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,800
And my wife, Erin hates this shit.

833
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,040
If I ever put a clip on her, if I ever go,

834
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,440
she says, stop it, stop it.

835
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,280
She has such an aversion to Soupy Sails.

836
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,520
If she's listening, she's gonna be so upset.

837
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,400
Oh, I'm sorry, Soupy's on here.

838
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,760
Just tell her not to listen to this part.

839
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,600
What is this?

840
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,320
Is there a, is Fang on it?

841
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,920
That's, I don't even real, I don't remember.

842
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,760
Let me see.

843
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,560
It's, I'm just, I think this is from like 66, maybe.

844
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,800
Let's see if Fang is on.

845
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,640
["Fang Is On It"]

846
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,480
Ah!

847
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,160
My baby's got a crush on Frankenstein.

848
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,960
She thinks that monster is divine.

849
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,480
She says I'd be her vampire.

850
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,720
He's actually singing.

851
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,480
If I had a stiff and jerky walk.

852
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,440
If I'd always grunt instead of talk.

853
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,360
If I had his look, she wouldn't balk.

854
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,920
At loving me, a no serene.

855
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,960
And then here comes the monster mash-a-woos.

856
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,640
That old vampire's spectacular.

857
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,480
To use my baby's own vernacular.

858
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,560
His cool, cold blooded, icy stare.

859
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,560
His shiny, patent leather hair.

860
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,360
The way his bat wings fly.

861
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,200
I don't like this part.

862
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,760
No, I don't either.

863
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,640
I don't like this fail.

864
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,480
He, he lost, boy, he had us in, he lost us.

865
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,480
I clocked it because of the ah-woos parts.

866
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,520
Like every single person making these

867
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,800
in the wake of Bobby Warren's picket,

868
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,120
there's like at least two elements.

869
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,320
They were like, we have to steal two elements.

870
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,280
It has to be there, like that little drum fill,

871
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,840
that just general drum sound of the time,

872
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,600
the ah-woos, or the chord progression exactly.

873
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,440
Or the topic.

874
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,280
Everybody was really afraid to just fully do a new thing.

875
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,120
That's why I'm like going through these last nine numbers

876
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,960
like this is, there's so much.

877
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,120
I can't believe there's so much.

878
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,240
I can't either.

879
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,040
Scott, just go back.

880
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,640
The soupy sale, Aaron hating soupy sales,

881
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,280
it does remind me, I am picturing you and your son,

882
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,480
and like Aaron's out of the house,

883
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,200
and like my dad used to,

884
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,640
when I wasn't supposed to watch South Park or the Simpsons,

885
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,320
and then my dad just going, just go in the play room,

886
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,560
and just close the door and turn it down.

887
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,640
You don't mind, it's fine, you know?

888
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,200
But you doing that to your son,

889
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,080
and like, all right, mom's out of the house,

890
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,480
put soupy sales on.

891
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,640
Don't tell her, just be cool about it.

892
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,520
Don't make fang voices.

893
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,840
Yeah, I'm the same.

894
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,120
A formative, important memory that makes my mom so mad

895
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,000
when I bring it up was my dad,

896
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,600
because my dad wanted to watch Beavis and Butt-Head.

897
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,400
He can't watch it without, and then nodding,

898
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,800
he's like, all right, come in, come in, slide,

899
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,240
and then remote in hands, like ready to change

900
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,080
if she walks in.

901
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,120
That's really funny.

902
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:42,960
Very important.

903
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,920
Too much local news scaring,

904
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,320
or Tipper Gore in the news scaring,

905
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,080
and it's like, what did you think I was gonna do

906
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,040
if I watched Simpsons and South Park?

907
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,600
Yeah, all this shit, the only thing that actually scarred me

908
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,480
was when I watched like a 2020 with all of my family there

909
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,480
about a father who killed his own kids,

910
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,080
and then I said, dad, are you gonna kill me?

911
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,840
And I ran out of the room.

912
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,720
You know, the local news is where you should take it,

913
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,680
that's where the real dark stuff is.

914
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,760
What do you think was more traumatic,

915
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,760
me watching some adult cartoons with some cursing,

916
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,600
or like the Little League fathers,

917
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,400
like foaming at the mouse, screaming at each other.

918
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,240
That was scary.

919
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,640
In real, like 10 feet away, and it's like,

920
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,240
I don't care, we lose, that's fine,

921
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,880
I just wanna get the free soda and a hot dog.

922
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,440
Is this happening as much these days

923
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,840
as it was when we were kids?

924
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,120
Because it happened all the time,

925
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,760
and I only played Little League stuff for a short time.

926
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,240
But yes, dads flipping out during games

927
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,000
happened what felt like fairly regularly.

928
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,320
I mean, are they just soothed

929
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,960
by being able to sit in the bleachers

930
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:58,160
and like, you know, look at stuff on their phone?

931
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,000
Porn out.

932
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,840
Yeah, porn out.

933
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,680
File away.

934
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,520
I didn't know what you were going to,

935
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,360
either you were gonna say vaping or something,

936
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,600
maybe vaping calmed them down.

937
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,400
Probably vaping, you know?

938
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,720
For us, that'll be, you know, like.

939
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,840
Listening to a mash of some kind.

940
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,680
Yeah, yeah, really.

941
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,360
It's like, okay, I'll calm down with, you know,

942
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,560
there's a song, what song did Bobby Boris Pickett do?

943
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,560
And okay, in 65, he did the Monster Hullabaloo.

944
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,080
Okay, phew, all right, I don't have to get mad

945
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,000
at the other dads.

946
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,440
I'm jumping around all over here.

947
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,680
There was a Rankin and Bass stop motion movie

948
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,120
in the 67 or something called Mad Monster Party.

949
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,200
Oh, yeah, I've never seen that.

950
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,160
I know that DVD cover very well,

951
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,880
but.

952
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,560
And there's like a James Bond ripoff song,

953
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,640
sung as the theme of it, called Mad Monster Party.

954
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,480
Ah.

955
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,320
That I guess I'll just play now.

956
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:45,160
Sure.

957
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,160
I appreciate them at least going with a different genre.

958
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,480
So I appreciate them at least going

959
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,680
with a different genre.

960
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,560
One.

961
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,480
Now, a word.

962
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,320
Deary.

963
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,360
Shit.

964
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,060
It's party time.

965
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,280
Okay.

966
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,600
You know, it's not the best song in the world,

967
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
but it's kinda cool. It's about a party in it,

968
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,000
but in a different way.

969
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,840
All right. So.

970
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,680
Hey, sure.

971
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,500
There's that.

972
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,340
Yeah.

973
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,200
So much.

974
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,040
There's a lot.

975
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,400
I mean, like, look, we don't have to,

976
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,560
if you got something in the pocket you like,

977
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,720
by all means throw it in,

978
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,320
but we could move through the rest of the forest.

979
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,160
Yeah, let's do that.

980
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,000
Yeah.

981
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,840
Discography.

982
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,660
Yeah.

983
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,500
Because he's a little quiet,

984
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,040
other than that the song never really goes away,

985
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,440
and I don't think he's one of these guys

986
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,200
who gets like screwed over.

987
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,360
I think there might've been a time

988
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,320
where he was not as well represented,

989
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,160
and he got with a new guy who helped him figure out

990
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,400
how to license this thing correctly,

991
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,400
and maybe, and I think he made his own version

992
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,640
that he didn't know whatever company on.

993
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,480
Right.

994
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,300
Well, yeah.

995
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:20,920
I have an excerpt from Wikipedia about how he gets.

996
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,760
All right.

997
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,800
When we turn things over to Wikipedia.

998
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,720
I know.

999
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,360
It was just so like confusing.

1000
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,760
I had to like, I had to screen grab it.

1001
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,960
In 1989, Stuart Hirsch began managing Pickett,

1002
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,680
and upon learning Pickett did not own

1003
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,000
the master recording of Monster Mash,

1004
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,760
the pair in 1993 recorded a perfect copy

1005
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,800
of the original Monster Mash

1006
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,340
that they then used to undercut

1007
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,460
the owners of the track Universal.

1008
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,300
Monster Mash. Monster Mash.

1009
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,120
Boris' verse.

1010
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:54,960
Bobby Boris' verse.

1011
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,800
Bobby's verse.

1012
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,620
Bobby's verse.

1013
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,040
I wrote down Bobby's verse.

1014
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:58,880
Sure.

1015
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,480
It is Taylor's version much earlier.

1016
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,080
She did it in the wake of Bobby Boris doing it.

1017
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,080
She copied Bobby Boris' Pickett.

1018
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:08,920
Yeah.

1019
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,960
And then, if only he were around to do, you know,

1020
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,940
blank space Bobby's version.

1021
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,440
But a blank space, baby.

1022
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,640
All right, Judy.

1023
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,080
In blood.

1024
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:19,920
In blood.

1025
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,560
So that's in the 90s.

1026
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,240
Should we jump back to the monster rap?

1027
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,000
Yeah, so, you know, the mash is still going.

1028
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,760
The mash will just shart for no reason.

1029
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,040
It hit number 10 in August 73.

1030
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:35,880
What?

1031
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,440
Not even at Halloween, so, like, I don't know.

1032
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,000
It just kept going, but he's pretty quiet,

1033
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,720
I'd say mostly, until we get into,

1034
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,120
where do I even start?

1035
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:46,960
I don't know.

1036
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,320
All right, I'll just pick a random spot.

1037
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,600
In 1985, it was Monster Rap.

1038
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,800
["Monster Rap"]

1039
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,160
Ha ha ha.

1040
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,520
Still working in the lab late these nights

1041
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,760
with eyes grown used to any science.

1042
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,160
I created a monster who could dance and walk,

1043
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,280
but I couldn't teach him how to talk.

1044
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,800
My faithful assistant, that hunchback fool

1045
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,000
who wastes his time in DJ school,

1046
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,600
said, as you get in, don't be a cop.

1047
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,120
You're the monster rap.

1048
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,360
Shock the body, shock the body, body,

1049
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,720
shock the body, shock the body, body,

1050
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,960
shock the body, shock the body, body, shock.

1051
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,800
Ah!

1052
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,120
What do we think?

1053
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,560
I like shock the body.

1054
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,400
I kind of like the shock the body part too, honey.

1055
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,640
It's different, he's not just saying monster rap.

1056
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,240
Right, it's different.

1057
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,360
I give him that, and I kind of like it,

1058
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,040
of like, I kind of like it, I don't know.

1059
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,440
Can I jump ahead in that song to,

1060
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,240
there's a line, I just gotta play this one line.

1061
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,720
Let me make sure this is all queued up,

1062
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,360
because this has been haunting me, fittingly.

1063
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,840
The monster rap haunts Jason.

1064
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,680
Yeah.

1065
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:03,520
Well.

1066
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:08,520
I've given you a voice, now rap for daddy.

1067
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:15,080
I've given you a voice, now rap for daddy.

1068
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,360
Like, oh man, that's out there,

1069
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,760
that's out there with the unpleasant,

1070
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,120
some of the most unpleasants,

1071
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,960
I don't know why that just gave me the chills.

1072
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,520
That sounds like the kind of shit you guys would say,

1073
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,640
and then you're like, what?

1074
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,080
What's weird about it?

1075
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,000
Take me pop, daddy, what's weird about that?

1076
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,400
What's weird about that?

1077
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,480
Maybe that's why it's giving me the chills,

1078
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,440
I'm seeing myself reflected back to me.

1079
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,760
Dark mirror image.

1080
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,040
Gazing to the abyss, long enough, the abyss gazes back.

1081
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,640
And then when he then he raps, and then he's like,

1082
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,960
now I'm this, and he's like Wolfman Jack, weirdly.

1083
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,800
Right, yeah, yeah.

1084
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,880
So he does do a character there, that's what you wanted,

1085
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,560
you said it on the first album.

1086
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,440
Might not be him.

1087
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,280
Oh yeah.

1088
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,120
I don't know.

1089
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,600
I don't know if it's him.

1090
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,440
Maybe not.

1091
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,440
He might have the ability to do that.

1092
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,480
Shook the body, he went to DJ school.

1093
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,480
DJ school.

1094
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,480
The question is, how many things do you punify,

1095
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,400
at what point does it get confusing?

1096
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,760
Yeah, is it 85?

1097
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,600
Is that right?

1098
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,440
85, yeah, yeah.

1099
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,640
Yeah, that's pretty early even for an old white guy

1100
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,520
to try hip hop or try rapping.

1101
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:28,720
It's not so, yeah, people did it way later, I would say,

1102
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,000
and acted as if it was.

1103
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,160
I mean, it's three years before the Beach Boys got there.

1104
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:36,040
Yeah, there's much shittier cash-ins.

1105
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,560
Where does this fall along with that John Wayne one?

1106
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,920
Do you know about the John Wayne rapping duke?

1107
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,320
Oh wow.

1108
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,560
Somebody, that's a novelty record

1109
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,640
that was actually really popular, the rapping duke.

1110
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,480
Really?

1111
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,280
It's 84.

1112
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,800
Yeah, it's a guy rapping as John Wayne.

1113
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,640
Okay.

1114
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,200
But it was like kind of, wow,

1115
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,400
the guy who did it opened for Bobby Brown

1116
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,200
and Stevie Wonder actually was.

1117
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,280
Oh wow, rapping Rodney's 83, nevermind, I take back my.

1118
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,880
Rodney got there in 83?

1119
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,200
That's what this says, yeah.

1120
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,360
That's crazy to me.

1121
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,800
I thought that was late 80s.

1122
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,760
Wow, geez.

1123
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,360
Wow, rapping Rodney, 83.

1124
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,200
Damn.

1125
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,520
Nevermind, I give credit to Rodney

1126
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,280
for being an old white guy getting to a new genre.

1127
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,560
Rodney, yeah, we're not saying

1128
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,440
that any of these guys invented rap,

1129
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,480
but did Rodney Dangerfield invent

1130
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,400
shitty white guy cash-in comedy rap?

1131
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,240
Right.

1132
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,080
That's a good question.

1133
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,160
Yeah, I got in there first.

1134
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,560
He did it before rapping duke.

1135
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,960
If Rodney was alive, he would have gone on stage

1136
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,360
at that Kendrick show at SoFi,

1137
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,880
where the Crips and Bloods were shaking hands

1138
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,880
and he did the Drake song so many times.

1139
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:51,320
So he, like a 105-year-old Rodney Dangerfield

1140
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,640
on stage with Kendrick.

1141
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,040
I'm burying the beef with Rodney Dangerfield.

1142
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,400
It wouldn't have been Dr. Dre doing that intro line,

1143
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,640
the I see dead people,

1144
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,040
it would have been Rodney Dangerfield.

1145
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,720
Right, in a hospital bed.

1146
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:08,000
I see dead people, it's me and my wife's thankful,

1147
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,240
something like that.

1148
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,520
A woman who was 117 just passed away.

1149
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,920
I think she was the oldest person alive,

1150
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:15,760
so it could have happened.

1151
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,880
The oldest person alive to remember

1152
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,000
the references we make on the show.

1153
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,960
I think there's been a couple of times

1154
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,440
where we've blown by a couple first name

1155
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,360
or Frank Gorshin mentions and not said who that is,

1156
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,080
which is always a good thing too.

1157
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,760
Because you can't always, if you...

1158
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,800
If you're listening to this show,

1159
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,320
I understand at this point you have to do

1160
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,240
a lot of Googling unless you've been listening for a while.

1161
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,360
Or you don't, or don't care.

1162
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,640
Or your life goes on normal without ever knowing

1163
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,160
what that name was that we said.

1164
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,000
It's true.

1165
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,840
I like that the deeper, that the B side of the single

1166
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,400
of Rappin' Rodney, wait sorry, one side is Rodney Rappin',

1167
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,200
then Rappin' Rodney, then Rodney continues Rappin'.

1168
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,280
Ha ha ha ha.

1169
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,840
Wow, and he did it with the guys who wrote The Breaks

1170
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,600
with Kurtis Blow.

1171
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,400
Rodney's working with real, he got good writers.

1172
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,320
Wow.

1173
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,440
I don't think, we have not been nominated for a Grammy.

1174
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,760
Rappin' Rodney is a fundamental song apparently.

1175
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,600
I guess.

1176
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,680
I actually, yeah, I'm not an expert on Rappin' Rodney,

1177
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,080
but it seems like a thing I should be an expert on.

1178
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:17,920
Yeah, yeah.

1179
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,320
You're disappointing everybody.

1180
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,640
Who would assume that you are?

1181
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,320
Mike, I have another memory of you're sitting

1182
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:28,840
in your old apartment and we tried one night

1183
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,080
to watch Caddyshack 2.

1184
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,680
Yeah, we tried getting through Caddyshack 2,

1185
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,520
but yeah, that was unwatchable.

1186
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,440
It took me about 10, 15 minutes of Jackie Mason

1187
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,280
walking around a construction site

1188
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,480
and we're like, yeah, let's turn this off.

1189
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,720
Did Jackie Mason ever rap?

1190
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,720
Yep, looks like he did.

1191
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,520
King, King, that was fast.

1192
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,120
King of deli rap.

1193
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,000
Oh, that sounds good.

1194
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:48,840
Might be good.

1195
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,680
In that apartment, we also did successfully watch

1196
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,200
movie 43, is that what it's called?

1197
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,040
Oh jeez.

1198
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:56,880
Did we?

1199
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:57,920
Yeah, it was rough.

1200
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,120
I don't have a memory of that.

1201
01:08:59,120 --> 01:08:59,960
Yeah.

1202
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,800
Yikes.

1203
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,720
You may have just gotten in there without me

1204
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,560
and watched it.

1205
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,480
I'm breaking into Mike's apartment,

1206
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,760
which is always 95 degrees for sun rising out.

1207
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,720
Let's not skip past the Jason is giving you shade

1208
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,120
for the heat in your apartment.

1209
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,360
How many years later?

1210
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,200
How many years are we talking?

1211
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,680
No, it's not shade.

1212
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,520
14?

1213
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,680
I think it's just, it's fair.

1214
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,240
It's a fair assessment.

1215
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,080
Yes, it was hot.

1216
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:22,920
It was really hot.

1217
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,280
It was hard to get it to cool down.

1218
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,960
It was old building.

1219
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,040
Yeah, it wasn't my fall.

1220
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:27,880
I mean, I guess it could have gotten.

1221
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:28,720
No, it wasn't.

1222
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,040
Now this is, now imagine this.

1223
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,400
If the bright mad scientist could just make

1224
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,280
that conversation happen inside one head.

1225
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,120
Yeah, discussions. Oh yeah,

1226
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,760
men with two brains style.

1227
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:42,080
Arguing then with itself about which apartment.

1228
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,400
No, it was more like 96.

1229
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,640
No, 94 is what it was.

1230
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,240
It never went above 94.

1231
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,280
The heat may have given you brain damage

1232
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:52,240
so you don't remember the cinematic spectacle

1233
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,000
that is the movie 43.

1234
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:54,840
Yeah.

1235
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,880
I don't think we watched that there.

1236
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,360
Pretty sure, cause it was Jackman

1237
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,320
with the balls on his chin, right?

1238
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,160
Maybe.

1239
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,720
Yeah, but that has nothing to do with where you watched it.

1240
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,240
Jackman had balls on his chin

1241
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,080
regardless of where it was viewed.

1242
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:08,920
Okay.

1243
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:10,880
Maybe I'm wrong.

1244
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,320
Fine, let's back to silly monster songs.

1245
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,880
Enough with bad sketch comedy movies.

1246
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,960
Yeah, let's jump ahead to,

1247
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,520
well, I guess it bears mentioning that in 1995

1248
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,840
there was Monster Mash, the movie.

1249
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,640
Oh yeah.

1250
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,160
Also called Frankenstein Sings, the movie.

1251
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:32,960
This was written by Alex Sokolow and Joel Cohen,

1252
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,520
the Joel Cohen, these guys who were some of the many

1253
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,240
writer-created writers of the first Toy Story.

1254
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,440
And that's the Joel Cohen that the name confusion

1255
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,240
led to Bill Murray being in Garfield.

1256
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,440
He thought he was working with the Cohen brothers.

1257
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,800
Two Garfields.

1258
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,640
Yeah, two Garfields.

1259
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,040
I still think that's a lie.

1260
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,760
Yeah, maybe he's covering his tracks.

1261
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,080
Yeah, that's well, the name's not spelled the same way.

1262
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,680
I have, look, I don't, I just need,

1263
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,080
I don't have to say more about it.

1264
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,760
Jimmy JJ Walker's in it.

1265
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,920
John Casir is in it, the Crip Keeper.

1266
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,840
Yeah, yeah. The end.

1267
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,120
That's one of those you poke around,

1268
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,600
like any fun material for the show?

1269
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,840
Nope, nope, not worth wading through it.

1270
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,600
Maybe an Edgemont who would've sat through this,

1271
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,440
but not here.

1272
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,560
Yeah, in the old days.

1273
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,040
Madness.

1274
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,160
But then, and then he's kind of quiet until 2004

1275
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,920
where there's kind of a dual set of songs.

1276
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,080
I'll start with the first one.

1277
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,280
He somehow got roped into doing

1278
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,360
politically char-issue charged music.

1279
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,840
And I, this one's about deforestation.

1280
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,160
And they all are accompanied by kind of like

1281
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:45,880
Newgrounds type flash animation in which you'll see,

1282
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:50,880
you know, our old pals Dubya and Condi and Chaney.

1283
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,880
So just imagine that.

1284
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,360
So this is Monster Slash.

1285
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,760
Hiking in the forest, late to one night.

1286
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,400
When our eyes beheld an eerie sight,

1287
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,400
our president appeared and began to frown.

1288
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,240
Then he and his friends cut the forest down.

1289
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,000
He did the slash.

1290
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,360
They did the forest slash.

1291
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,640
Slash.

1292
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,960
It was brutally brash.

1293
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,360
Slash.

1294
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,160
Public opinion was mash.

1295
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,040
He did the slash.

1296
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,680
And they did it for the cash.

1297
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,720
The lobbyist.

1298
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:30,520
Okay, this is so much a piece with the next one

1299
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,920
that I'll just go straight into it.

1300
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,800
One year later, he did climate mash.

1301
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,880
We were hiking past the white ice.

1302
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,680
We were hiking past the white ice.

1303
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:47,360
When our eyes beheld an eerie sight,

1304
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,360
the president appeared with folks very strange.

1305
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:55,080
The zombies and vampires of global climate change.

1306
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,000
It's not global warming, say your ill company, the cycles.

1307
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,400
Our math tells us it's natural weather cycles.

1308
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,040
These claims from industry heavies

1309
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:10,040
let the president rest behind his own protective levies.

1310
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,320
They're doing the climate mash.

1311
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,160
Oh yeah.

1312
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,000
All right.

1313
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,320
The science is bad.

1314
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,280
Climate mash.

1315
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,960
Solutions are tried.

1316
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,840
Climate mash.

1317
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,320
And they do it for the cash.

1318
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,440
For the cash.

1319
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,880
All the sound effects, by the way,

1320
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,280
are like George W. Bush is a vampire

1321
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:34,760
and he's sucking what's labeled as oil ale from a can

1322
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:37,920
or at some point he, right at the end there he,

1323
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,920
which movie is the dancer pour all the water maniac?

1324
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,440
Oh, we've done this.

1325
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,280
We've gone over this on the show.

1326
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,120
I know, we forgot.

1327
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,600
Is it Slash Dancer or is it the other one?

1328
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,280
That, I don't know, whichever it is.

1329
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,080
I think it's Slash Dancer.

1330
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,640
Okay, so that George W. Bush does that with oil.

1331
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,000
Can I just get ahead of it?

1332
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,040
Is there a song about the deficit or the national debt?

1333
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,000
Like the capital steps, does he sing about?

1334
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,120
That's more of a conservative thing though,

1335
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,440
being worried about the deficit.

1336
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,360
He seems like he's on the left here.

1337
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,200
Which is good.

1338
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,040
It's true.

1339
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,160
And you know, look, we should have listened to him.

1340
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,720
If we'd all listened to climate mash back then,

1341
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,480
we'd be in a better place today.

1342
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,760
And that's 2005, right?

1343
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,640
2005.

1344
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,560
Yeah, he actually, you know,

1345
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,520
and he did it before An Inconvenient Truth.

1346
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,000
So he was actually a head of,

1347
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,320
he's again a pioneer in many ways.

1348
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,040
This is, when I hear both of these songs,

1349
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,240
what I picture is Harry Shearer laughing up a storm.

1350
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:36,440
This is like, you know, he does entire,

1351
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,640
in like classic Simpsons, he'd probably like

1352
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,800
do all the dialogue and never crack a smile.

1353
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,840
But then he listens to the climate mash and he's like,

1354
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,960
ah, ha ha ha, good falling.

1355
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,920
Book him for Lace Show.

1356
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,360
He probably was on it, right?

1357
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,680
Yeah, maybe, yeah, yeah.

1358
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,040
There's 40 years of Lace Show to go through for us, I think.

1359
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,120
Harry Shearer's show.

1360
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,640
Is he still doing it?

1361
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,480
Probably.

1362
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,320
Probably.

1363
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,120
Yeah, way less listeners than we have.

1364
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,400
He's doing it to no one.

1365
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,640
The microphone hasn't been plugged in for years.

1366
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,840
You know what, it's not the same thing,

1367
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,240
but it reminds me of like during the Bush administration

1368
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,880
when all of a sudden Burt Bacharach was like,

1369
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,760
I'm putting out a protest album.

1370
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:21,680
Oh, I remember that.

1371
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:25,400
Who are these people that are destroying our lives?

1372
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,840
Yeah, you know, like, I appreciate the sentiment, Burt,

1373
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:31,360
but we needed this.

1374
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,600
Really early, I wasn't still at Funny or Die,

1375
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,200
but I would like go visit and somebody's,

1376
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,280
I'm like, what are you guys working on?

1377
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,920
And then the most miserable, somebody's like,

1378
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,760
been miserably working on graphics for hours

1379
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:45,760
of Tom Green's Trump rap called Do the Donald.

1380
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,880
Do the Donald, do the Donald Trump.

1381
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:53,520
My skin is orange and I didn't say nothing but lies.

1382
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,120
I'm like, man, you were funny once, what happened?

1383
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,680
You're right, you're not wrong.

1384
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,400
I don't like Trump either, but Jesus.

1385
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,800
I appreciate the effort, sir.

1386
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,280
Everyone always roasts the pantsuit anthem,

1387
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,960
but they don't, that never gets mentioned.

1388
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,600
Yeah, yeah, well, it was like, you know,

1389
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,520
because the pantsuit anthem was closer to the election.

1390
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,320
It's like, you remember the Oscar movies

1391
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,440
that come out in December, it was in the season.

1392
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,880
Yeah, but yeah, go check out Donald, Do the Donald.

1393
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,240
Now, speaking of sketches in Funny or Die and such,

1394
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,160
I don't think you can do this episode

1395
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,160
and not mention two incredible sketches

1396
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,080
based on Monster Mash and all this stuff.

1397
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,960
Mr. Show's Monster Party's Factor Fiction,

1398
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,320
which has so many perfectly accurate,

1399
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,520
fantastic equivalents of this song.

1400
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,400
And then, of course, our pal, Nick Weiger's

1401
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:50,400
immortal monster fuck once voted the number one thing

1402
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:54,600
on Comedy Bang Bang ever, and I can't argue,

1403
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,640
that's really funny, it's very, very funny.

1404
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,320
I didn't realize also, I never appreciated

1405
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,760
that the guy, his voice, or his character he plays in it,

1406
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:06,200
who did the original song, I think is called Leo Carpazzi

1407
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:10,000
and the actual co-writer of the song is Lenny Capizzi.

1408
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,440
So I never knew that he was nodding

1409
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,600
to the non-vocal writer of the song.

1410
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,120
So detail, I didn't appreciate Weiger, it's so great.

1411
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,440
What else though?

1412
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,400
I mean, that takes you through the,

1413
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,360
you know what's funny is that, I mean,

1414
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,160
I think, look, politically, regardless of whether

1415
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:32,840
you like the songs, I think Bobby Boris Pick is a good guy.

1416
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,840
He had this whole arc where he reunited with his daughter,

1417
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,080
a daughter he didn't even know about, way late in life,

1418
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,480
and they got to reconnect before he passed away.

1419
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,440
He had a struggle with leukemia, which sounds very sad,

1420
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,720
but he got to have this relationship,

1421
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,400
and she was so delighted.

1422
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:50,760
She's like, oh, I remember when I got to tell my kids,

1423
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,880
you know who Grandpa is?

1424
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,400
He did the monster mash.

1425
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,720
That's wonderful.

1426
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,560
That's pretty fun.

1427
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,280
He was very well regarded, apparently,

1428
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,080
and then even when he came down with leukemia,

1429
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,200
he started doing blood transfusions,

1430
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,520
and then the agent would call him, how's it going?

1431
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,160
And he'd say, Stu, there's nothing like fresh blood.

1432
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,000
He like monsterified, he was still doing it.

1433
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,840
Yeah.

1434
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,400
So I don't know, I'm glad there's a guy we can celebrate

1435
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,480
and not go into some like, oh, but then he's saying,

1436
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:22,480
oh, he did this, oh, he would've hated the McGovern mash.

1437
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,440
Yeah.

1438
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,240
Wait, was that the right, no, I should be,

1439
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,160
no, Mondale's what I should be saying.

1440
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,160
Walter Mondale.

1441
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,360
I mean, he could've done a McGovern mash.

1442
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,440
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1443
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,240
Yeah, a song about how Mondale was,

1444
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,040
he'll only win Minnesota.

1445
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,040
I think I've said this on the show before,

1446
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,000
a friend of mine, or I guess he's,

1447
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,280
we're recording these out of order,

1448
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,760
he's been on the show at this point, Justin Donaldson.

1449
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,600
His dad was a pop star in the 70s

1450
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,040
and toured with Bobby Boris Pickett, here and there.

1451
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,760
And my favorite thing is that it was very cheap

1452
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,960
to get Bobby any other month but October.

1453
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,800
But in October, if you were booking Bobby,

1454
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,720
it was the price shot up.

1455
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:04,560
I don't know the air details.

1456
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,720
Can I interest you in the St. Patrick's mash?

1457
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,120
If you wanted to book Bobby to do Monster Mash in March,

1458
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:10,960
pretty cheap.

1459
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,520
Everyone's having a wonderful day.

1460
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,080
We're all saluting the hero MLK.

1461
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,840
That was like 500 bucks.

1462
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,040
He was the opposite of a monster.

1463
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,960
Like, yeah, people are confused by that.

1464
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,200
Well, it was cheap, it didn't cost.

1465
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,800
But October, you're paying up to get Bobby

1466
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,040
to do an appearance, which I love it.

1467
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:38,040
Like Homer investing in pumpkin and being mad in November.

1468
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:44,680
I believe Justin directed the video for the Monsterfuck.

1469
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,520
Yes, that's right.

1470
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,760
The original Monster Mash, I believe that's correct.

1471
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,880
A really good video, too.

1472
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,240
Here's where my mind started going,

1473
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,000
is if he did pass away, unfortunately,

1474
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,320
but yeah, I started wondering what genres

1475
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:02,320
he would capitalize on and try to bring Monsters into.

1476
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:07,000
There's nothing as totally new as rap today,

1477
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,200
but I was trying to think what sort of the era

1478
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:14,640
that Boris might nod to.

1479
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,920
And what popped into my head was monster trap.

1480
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,760
And I was like, all right, what's a low impact?

1481
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,760
How do I get my head around trap music

1482
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:30,480
as much as Bobby Boris Pickett would?

1483
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,320
Whatever, yeah.

1484
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:35,240
And I went on YouTube and just looked up free trap beats

1485
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,840
and I found free DaBaby Type Beat Bounce

1486
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,320
produced by Phantom.

1487
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,120
Thank you, Phantom.

1488
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:47,120
And okay, this is my poorly researched jammed out attempt

1489
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,440
at the monster trap.

1490
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:56,440
I need some like, ooh, remember when I did the rap?

1491
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,120
Well, now I'm back with something new.

1492
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:09,400
In the lab, late one night, eyes beheld,

1493
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:14,000
eerie sights, monster rose from his nap,

1494
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,520
started doing monster trap, monster trap,

1495
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,560
monster, monster trap, monster trap, monster, monster trap.

1496
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,960
Frankenstein, Dracula, Dracula, Frankenstein,

1497
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,800
Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, Wolfman, Wolfman.

1498
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,640
That's it.

1499
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,480
That's great.

1500
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,300
That was great.

1501
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,140
That was really good.

1502
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:37,280
It sounds good to me, you got some birds in there.

1503
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,040
Yeah, yeah, that's the same.

1504
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,080
If it's not accurate, it's as accurate as he would have been.

1505
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,440
I mean, and that's my best shot at it,

1506
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,540
but it's also very possible that you listen

1507
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,820
to the song, the 2024 song, Monster Trap,

1508
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,820
and it just goes, I was working in the lab.

1509
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:54,540
That's more effort than he would have put in.

1510
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:58,060
Yeah, they did the trap.

1511
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:00,860
It was some, it was some genuine trap.

1512
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:02,580
There's a, there's a Nicki Minaj song

1513
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,380
called Bees in the Trap that that sounds like.

1514
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:06,220
Oh yeah, it does.

1515
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:09,660
Bees in the trap, bees in the trap, monsters in the trap.

1516
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:12,540
Relatively, I learned just like my Googling,

1517
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,960
do you mean Abbott Elementary,

1518
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,100
earlier I was Googling monster rap and they're like,

1519
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,740
do you mean Nicki Minaj's verse?

1520
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:18,580
Oh, from Monster.

1521
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,320
No, no, I do not.

1522
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,220
That's from the last 20 years.

1523
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:24,520
Have you not learned anything from my history?

1524
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:28,740
I am looking up the 1985 Knowledge Single Monster Rap.

1525
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:32,260
Stupid AI, getting wrong shit again.

1526
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:35,900
Gotta log into DuckDuckGo to get like some clean results.

1527
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,620
They know, if I go to Ask Jeeves,

1528
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,540
they know I'm looking for Bobby Boris Pickett.

1529
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:41,380
Yeah.

1530
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:42,940
That's where my kind is accepted.

1531
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,620
Pure, pure search.

1532
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:47,460
Anyway, too bad he can't be around to do Monster Trap.

1533
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,300
He should have been on,

1534
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,980
well no, when he died somewhat recently,

1535
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:52,980
like 10 years, 10 years, 15.

1536
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:53,820
Yeah, maybe.

1537
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,660
Was he a live monster is what,

1538
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:57,740
from my beautiful Dark Toasted Finish from 12,

1539
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:58,580
14 years ago?

1540
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:01,380
Well, could Bobby have been on that track is what I'm saying.

1541
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:02,220
Was it possible?

1542
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:03,500
Ladies and gentlemen.

1543
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,500
Bobby Boris Pickett remix.

1544
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:10,420
You got like what, Rick Ross, Jay-Z, Kanye, Nicki Minaj,

1545
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,740
Bobby Boris.

1546
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:16,180
Here we go, about to drop some mad science for 2010.

1547
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,860
Get rid of the Rick Ross intro for Monster

1548
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,780
and put Bobby Boris on it.

1549
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:22,660
That should have been the thing.

1550
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,580
A no good blood sucker.

1551
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,540
Yeah.

1552
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,780
Well, if only, I mean, that's a remix,

1553
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:36,500
waiting to be done, I would say.

1554
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,820
Seems like Kanye's fallen victim

1555
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:40,940
to some mad scientists lately, hasn't he?

1556
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:43,780
Oh God, the story gets weirder and sadder.

1557
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:44,620
Yeah, yeah.

1558
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,060
I was working in the lab with my nitrous tank.

1559
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:53,380
My dentist was there in Dracula and Frankenstein.

1560
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,380
And I hooked Ye up to my electrodes.

1561
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,980
Oh God.

1562
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:59,260
His jack dentist.

1563
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:01,100
Tap to dentist.

1564
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:01,940
Bobby died in 2007.

1565
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:03,260
Jack is the wolf man.

1566
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:04,100
Oh, so he never.

1567
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,180
So he wouldn't have been able to do it.

1568
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,020
Yeah, yeah.

1569
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,660
You could see though, Kanye, I don't know,

1570
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:10,100
with his like eclectic hirings and you know,

1571
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,380
there's like spoken word parts on that album.

1572
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,380
Yeah, he could have like, yeah.

1573
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,500
Yeah, well, yeah, there's a lot of collaborations,

1574
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,660
at least in the old days.

1575
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:19,500
Yeah.

1576
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,340
I mean, it's now I guess too, but.

1577
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,540
And he never called up the originator.

1578
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:23,380
Yeah.

1579
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:24,580
One of the great early rappers.

1580
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:26,900
Right, 85.

1581
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,260
He should have had Rodney on the track.

1582
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,940
He should have had Bobby.

1583
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:33,620
When is the, yes.

1584
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:36,980
Hey, have you guys heard this new like hit single

1585
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:40,980
with Bobby Boor's Pickett and Rodney Dangerfield?

1586
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:43,660
Rodney died in 2004.

1587
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,420
So College Dropout is around then, right?

1588
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,780
He kind of passed the baton.

1589
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:49,980
Yeah, yeah.

1590
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:51,340
Well, February 10th, 2004.

1591
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:53,380
So yeah, Rodney's like last thing.

1592
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,220
Goodbye, Rodney.

1593
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:55,060
Hello, Kanye.

1594
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:58,260
Sampling, welcome back.

1595
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,340
Sampling rapping Rodney.

1596
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,660
Has anyone done that?

1597
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:03,340
Anyone done it so.

1598
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,660
Well, the John Wayne one is famous because he,

1599
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,140
because Notorious B.I.G. does reference.

1600
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:10,340
Remember rapping Duke to Har to Har.

1601
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,980
Never thought hip hop would take it this far.

1602
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:15,140
So he did do a reference to one of these novelty songs,

1603
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:17,300
but did anyone give a nod to?

1604
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,940
Right. Yeah.

1605
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,380
I don't know.

1606
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:21,900
And has Monster Mash been sampled?

1607
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,220
I mean, that's a funny, that's a thing to look up.

1608
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:27,260
Was it sampled in that weird like

1609
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:30,500
Munster's Fall Out Boy song or am I misremembering?

1610
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,340
Not so.

1611
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:32,180
I'm not sure.

1612
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:33,020
I don't think so.

1613
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,700
Munster's Fall Out Boy.

1614
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,140
I do like that song.

1615
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:37,980
You do?

1616
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:39,940
Yeah, I like the Munster sample.

1617
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,860
She wanna dance like Uma Thurman.

1618
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:45,540
It's called Uma Thurman, yeah.

1619
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:46,380
Well, it was, oh wait.

1620
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:50,420
Well, what whosampled.com is showing me is that it was

1621
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:53,820
covered and remixed by Carmella Creeper.

1622
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:54,660
There you go.

1623
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:55,500
To bring it all back around.

1624
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,340
There you go, Jay.

1625
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:57,180
She's a DJ.

1626
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,300
She is a DJ.

1627
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,380
Oh, she's been to DJ school.

1628
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:06,100
Well, I hope this is a fun trip into a genre.

1629
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,260
If we missed anything.

1630
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:08,100
We missed a lot of things.

1631
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:08,940
Okay, okay.

1632
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:09,780
Well, let us know.

1633
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:12,900
Yeah, if you care to hear about more

1634
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,340
or do you want more old man novelty rap

1635
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:17,820
or does that sound abhorrent to you?

1636
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:20,940
Should we lock that in a tomb and not resuscitate it?

1637
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:23,020
But otherwise, I think you survived.

1638
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:25,700
Hauntcast, The Fright, The Cemetery Gate.

1639
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,020
