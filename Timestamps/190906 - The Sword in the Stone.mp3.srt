1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,800
Today's episode may be a joy overload if your favorite Disney character is a clever niece

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
named Bridget.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,240
It may also contain some of fiction's greatest roosters, Matt Hooper cosplay fantasies, and

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,040
hawk lunches.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,700
Who so listeneth of this podcast shallst be mildly amused.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,700
This is Sword in the Stone on Podcast the Ride.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:55,940
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the show where every episode a kooky old man turns the three

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,640
fish in order to teach us a lesson.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,360
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Hi, I'm Mike Carlson.

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
That doesn't happen.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,140
That doesn't happen every episode.

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,680
What do you mean?

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,480
Teaches us to use our heads and we learn about being clever as opposed to using, you know-

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
It hasn't happened once.

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
Force of will.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Anyway, Scott Gardner's here too.

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
And you have to weigh in on this issue.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,780
Let's account for the possibility that the wizard also wipes our memories, but leaves

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,780
us with the lesson.

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,780
Yeah.

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,780
Thank you.

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,780
But if he does it every time.

27
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,820
I would say a kooky old man talks about treats that he's recently enjoyed.

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
That would be Jason Sheridan.

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,820
Well, all right.

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,820
That's fair.

31
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,820
That happens every episode.

32
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,820
That's what I know.

33
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,820
He's Merlin's age at the height of wart.

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,820
Yeah.

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,820
Yes.

36
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,820
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,820
You're a combo of both.

38
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,820
Height of Archimedes, geez.

39
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,780
Well, here, look at this.

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,500
We're playing in our favorite mythology, the number one Disney property that we've been

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
waiting to get to for so long.

42
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:12,500
You know, before we unsheath the sword of the topic of today, just a quick thing I wanted

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,780
to mention because I wanted you guys and the listeners to know about some very good theme

44
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,100
park related news in the Gardner household recently.

45
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:29,500
Just last week, Erin was the winner of an 18 month free pass to Universal Studios.

46
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Whoa.

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Yeah.

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
18 months.

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
18 months.

50
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Sizable.

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,900
I didn't know such a thing was a possibility.

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,220
Universal is weird and stingy.

53
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,020
Even their annual passes, if you get it in August, it only goes through December.

54
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,020
Right.

55
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,020
This is crazy.

56
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,140
18 months.

57
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,700
So thrilled about it.

58
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,980
How did she earn this honor, you might be wondering?

59
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,780
By losing a kicking contest.

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:00,940
She, Erin, participated in a work foot golf competition.

61
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
It was a...

62
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,140
Erin, also your wife, for those of you who don't know.

63
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,140
Oh, yes.

64
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,140
Yes, Erin.

65
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,140
Foot golf is your...

66
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,140
What is foot golf?

67
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
I don't know.

68
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
I didn't know about it before.

69
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,540
Neither did she, which probably hurt her chances at foot golf, but everybody at her place of

70
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,700
work was playing foot golf.

71
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
I don't...

72
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,060
Honestly, it was at an official foot golf course even.

73
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,060
Wow.

74
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,060
I know.

75
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,060
What?

76
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,060
Frisbee golf, foot golf, I don't know.

77
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,540
I think it's a combo.

78
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:36,900
It's like soccer ball style kicking into bigger holes.

79
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:44,140
And next to golf, it's like a combo course of traditional golf and foot golf.

80
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,140
Okay.

81
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,540
It was six holes, at a total par 18.

82
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,340
The winner of the whole competition scored a 16.

83
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,500
Erin scored a 45.

84
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,420
And it involved her losing her final ball in a lake.

85
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,420
And so she was mildly ashamed by all this, but then at the end discovered that there

86
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,080
is a last place prize.

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,100
And that was an 18 month free pass.

88
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Wow.

89
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,060
That's pretty good.

90
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,060
Very good.

91
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,060
And her was a theme park fan.

92
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,060
What was number one?

93
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,420
I think it was maybe also theme park.

94
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,940
It might have been a Disney thing.

95
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,940
Oh, okay.

96
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,940
Yeah.

97
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,940
These were good.

98
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,140
This was a high stakes foot golf competition.

99
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,140
Right.

100
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,500
The last place prize was like sort of a, hey, don't worry about it.

101
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
You still get a prize.

102
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
It wasn't like a punishment.

103
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,060
No, no, no.

104
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:40,380
She did not increase her workload at her place of employment, at the mine where she worked.

105
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,460
She didn't have to shovel more coal.

106
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,940
Well, that's good.

107
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,420
No, fantastic.

108
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,420
So I get to like, you know, now I will have to pay to go along with her, but now it's

109
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,620
not free island new bar access.

110
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,620
Wow.

111
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,620
It's great.

112
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,140
It wasn't an 18 month pass to the unbuilt Universal Studios in Dubai.

113
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,140
No, no, no.

114
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,860
It wasn't something like that.

115
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,700
Not just, you don't just get to go into the gate and that's all that's there.

116
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,780
But you unlimited, like you can go in and out of that gate as many times as you want.

117
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,780
So okay.

118
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,780
Wow.

119
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,780
That's great.

120
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,780
Congratulations.

121
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,780
Feeling fine.

122
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,780
Yeah.

123
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,780
Wonderful.

124
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,780
Wonderful news to get.

125
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,460
And who knew her poor footsmanship would pay off so wonderfully.

126
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,460
That's great.

127
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,460
Thanks, Aaron.

128
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,460
Yeah.

129
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
Thanks.

130
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,460
We'll all thank Aaron for you.

131
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,460
Thank you, Aaron.

132
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,460
Also.

133
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,460
You're reaping the benefits of this.

134
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm going to learn about foot golf because I don't know if this is going to really come

135
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,060
up maybe in passing.

136
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,540
I love miniature golf.

137
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
Sure.

138
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
They're miniature golf fans.

139
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,620
Oh wait, miniature golf counts.

140
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,300
We can talk about miniature golf.

141
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Yeah.

142
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Hey, great.

143
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
All right.

144
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,100
We cover, we just unlocked like seven more episodes.

145
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,220
Oh, sure.

146
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,340
And again, foot golf too because it came up here now.

147
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,340
But I'm intrigued by foot golf, especially because a listener emailed, Mark D. Natal

148
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:05,020
emailed that the Troutdale, the place that you could catch trout has closed.

149
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,020
What?

150
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,020
No.

151
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,860
The Troutdale Hills is no longer there.

152
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
Oh, bummer.

153
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,100
The ponds are all dried up and it is closed for good.

154
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
So I cannot go trout fishing.

155
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,100
I passed by the sign recently.

156
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
Oh no.

157
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,740
Cherished six-year-old memories of an activity that I didn't keep up beyond six years old.

158
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
Wow.

159
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,740
Bummer.

160
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,420
Well, I will say that the foot golf course is in the same county as the former Troutdale.

161
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:39,460
Residents of said county still have some fun on there, but it's not the fun of killing

162
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,460
an animal, of hooking a trout and gutting it.

163
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,580
But foot golf's a little fun too.

164
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
Okay.

165
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,660
A little fun to be had everywhere.

166
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,660
Yeah.

167
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
Sure.

168
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
Oh man.

169
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,100
I'm going to avoid, let me just not talk for the next 45 minutes though, because RIP Troutdale.

170
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Yeah.

171
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
RIP.

172
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,100
Yeah.

173
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
We could take a break too if you need.

174
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
Yeah.

175
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,860
Let me go outside, take a deep breath and think about every individual trout.

176
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,860
They didn't get to die in the expected way.

177
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,780
They were all just tossed on the side of the road somewhere.

178
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,100
They got to live a full life with his trout friends.

179
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
That's sad.

180
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Yeah.

181
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
I know.

182
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
I wanted to eat them.

183
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,100
They didn't get caught by a kid.

184
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,100
It sucks.

185
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,900
Anyways, so good news for me.

186
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,820
Jason, I feel like there's something you got locked and loaded to discuss as well.

187
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,860
I have a news story that was very interesting to me.

188
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,860
It's a couple months old, but it hasn't really come up on the show yet.

189
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,420
Only a few theme park news sites picked it up, but real news sites picked this one up

190
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
too.

191
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,180
The Orlando Sentinel, the Associated Press.

192
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Okay.

193
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:58,500
So a few months ago, you know, all right, well, let me set this up.

194
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,900
There's a resurgent labor movement in America.

195
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,000
We've seen teacher strikes in multiple cities.

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,340
There's coal miners recently have been sitting on the tracks down in Kentucky blocking coal

197
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,620
trains because the company went bankrupt here in our own city of Los Angeles.

198
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,380
The Screen Actors Guild just had elections.

199
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,780
The Writers Guild is having very contested elections right now.

200
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,780
They're a blast.

201
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,780
They're a blast.

202
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:29,500
We're getting so many great emails and so many great sons of terrible people who name

203
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
names.

204
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Yeah.

205
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,980
And that's funny that sons came up because a famous son comes up in this story too.

206
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:45,900
So now Disney, in various Disney cast members are in various different unions, which is

207
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,460
down in Florida.

208
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,020
Disney World employs so many people.

209
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,420
So a few months ago, 600 out of a thousand costume performers threatened to cut ties

210
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:04,920
with their local union due to quote, horrible representation and unresponsiveness to grievances.

211
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:15,460
Now this is local 385 of which about half of 9,000 members are Disney cast members.

212
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:22,820
So and around a thousand of those are costumed are like goofy Mickey cast members.

213
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,820
OK.

214
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,100
So that but they're not all Disney people.

215
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,140
Some of them are other theme park.

216
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,660
Other lots of different stuff in this local.

217
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,340
And I'll explain what union it is in a second.

218
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,340
So OK.

219
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,340
All right.

220
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,220
The character performers have been in this union since the 1980s.

221
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:50,420
And this was such a huge deal that the head of this union had to fly down to Orlando,

222
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:57,060
hold hearings about this like corrupt leadership and put the local office into what is called

223
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,660
trusteeship where he appointed two people to take over and there'll be elections in

224
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
18 months.

225
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
OK.

226
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,580
Now the another independent office said in court filings that this local union,

227
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,900
these leaders may have created false records, committed embezzlement and obstruction.

228
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:24,420
Now so the union in question is the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters and the head

229
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,380
of this union is James P Hoffa.

230
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:34,020
Not to be confused with James R Hoffa, noticed Jimmy Hoffa, his father.

231
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
Oh.

232
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,660
The son of Jimmy Hoffa flew down to Orlando.

233
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:47,340
So Jimmy Hoffa famously had to deal with the mob and the Kennedys.

234
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:53,180
His son, James P Hoffa, is dealing with a guy explaining that, no, I'm not goofy.

235
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,540
I'm a friend of goofy.

236
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,100
I'm not goofy. I'm a friend of goofy.

237
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,620
Had to fly down to put local 385 into trusteeship.

238
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,460
Wow. Wow.

239
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:11,060
So a much sillier lineage than his father held.

240
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,140
Yeah. Yeah.

241
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,980
We have the dawn of costume characters and not yet happened during Elder Hoffa's time.

242
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,540
No. Well, he disappeared in the he disappeared in the 70s and I think was declared dead in

243
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,740
the 80s.

244
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,100
Uh huh.

245
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,780
They I think the Mythbusters conclusively proved he is not buried under Giants Stadium,

246
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,180
which was the longer word.

247
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,580
Jimmy Hoffa, for more context, once played by Jack Nicholson in a movie, will be played

248
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,620
by Al Pacino in the upcoming movie The Irishman.

249
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,820
Yes. In the de-aged Scorsese film.

250
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,460
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

251
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,300
OK. So very strange.

252
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,660
There's no there's no property.

253
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Does Disney now own something where they could create a costume character of Hoffa?

254
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,300
Do they own the rights to the film Hoffa?

255
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Who owns? Yeah. Who owns Hoffa?

256
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,420
But if this is actually an interesting question is in general, could you make a walk around

257
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,580
character of any sort of notable figure?

258
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,300
Oh, yeah. What are the rules there?

259
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:24,100
Is there a law against just making, you know, say a Trump walk around character in?

260
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,460
Where would it go? Where would he be?

261
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,980
He'd be in the monkey cages in Animal Kingdom if he asked me.

262
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:38,500
We had something to say about he. Well, NBC owns the NBC made The Apprentice, so they could.

263
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,580
They might be the likely home of a Trump walk around.

264
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,460
And it's almost surprising they didn't do it at the time because you could go get a photo

265
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,580
with Billy Bush at the Access Hollywood red carpet at the end of the tour.

266
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:52,740
Right.

267
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,540
I'm amazed like there wasn't Trump presence on the studio tour at that time.

268
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,460
We know they were pushing that thing so hard.

269
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,260
Right. Yeah.

270
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,460
There's got to be something, though.

271
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,140
So wait, so this this union, though, is just it's costume characters, but it's other.

272
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,740
It's not just it's just a regular teamsters office, too.

273
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,860
So the costumes characters, there's about a thousand of them.

274
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,300
Two thirds of that number threatened to walk because of poor representation.

275
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,660
So I'm just confused. Like there's costume characters, but also there's truck drivers.

276
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,100
Truck drivers. So how do you maybe this is too much.

277
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,900
I don't know if this is in the article, but like how do you end up in a union that has like truck

278
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,420
drivers and a guy playing Daisy Duck or a lady playing Daisy Duck?

279
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,300
It's confusing to me.

280
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,860
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, lots of unions cover.

281
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,540
Right. Multiple things.

282
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,820
Multiple things.

283
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,020
It just seems like a performer's union would be the one that covers that.

284
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,140
But I don't I don't have no knowledge of this.

285
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,620
Well, it's interesting you bring that up because we're going to circle back around to unions

286
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,020
when it comes to today's topic.

287
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,020
What? Something I learned about this.

288
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,140
Wow. Total left turns coming. OK, interesting.

289
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,700
Huh, huh.

290
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,340
Mike, are you at this point just worried about the safety and well-being of the

291
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,220
many who has the hots for you at Disney World?

292
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,380
No, no.

293
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,660
There's a little crack in that.

294
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,260
No, it's fine. Everything's fine.

295
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,140
I said Daisy. I said Daisy, not Minnie.

296
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,100
I didn't say Minnie.

297
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,700
You thought you'd throw us off the scent.

298
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,020
I said another female character.

299
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,900
I didn't say Minnie.

300
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,460
Because if conditions are poor enough that she can't make kissy sounds from inside the head.

301
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:33,700
Right.

302
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,220
It's going to be fun. They're going to have elections within 18 months.

303
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:44,260
But can a truck driver still make a kissy face at me through the windshield of a car of his truck

304
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,020
while I'm driving alongside him?

305
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:52,740
Which would be a great joke in a National Lampoon's vacation type scenario.

306
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,900
Oh my gosh. Yeah, because Clark wants the sexy girl, but it's a gruff truck driver.

307
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:05,620
Or he was fantasizing about her, but then he's drifting and going mad and it's actually a

308
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,580
big gross dude.

309
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:14,820
Right. If I didn't know what scene is in the newest vacation movie, the horrible scene that

310
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,900
is the play on the old original one, I wouldn't think that was in the newest at Helms movie.

311
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,660
Are you talking about the one where she dies?

312
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,620
Yes, where they kill.

313
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,580
Yeah.

314
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,700
Kill what's her name?

315
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,980
Christie Brinkley.

316
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,620
Right. The killer in the new vacation.

317
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,100
Yeah.

318
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
It's the truck Moser down.

319
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,300
Yeah. He's like flirting with whoever. I mean, I think it's an equivalent.

320
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,140
Is it actually Christie Brinkley or is it a newer female character?

321
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,980
Oh, because it's, yeah, it's not.

322
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,180
Yeah. Because it's at Helms and he's like, you know, remember the original vacation?

323
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,340
Yeah.

324
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,380
Clark is flirting with Christie Brinkley on the highway.

325
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,660
She keeps showing up on the highway.

326
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,660
Yeah. Well, in the newest vacation at Helms is flirting with a young lady on the freeway

327
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,620
and then she just gets killed by a truck or something.

328
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,380
She just gets run over.

329
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:58,660
Yeah.

330
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,060
That's bleak.

331
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,740
Yeah, that's incredibly bleak.

332
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,540
That's the movie.

333
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,500
Anyway, your dad's vacation.

334
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,700
This is yeah.

335
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,180
Yeah.

336
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,220
So anyway, we're slaughtering your expectations.

337
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,540
On the pavement of what you think that vacation is going to be.

338
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:15,780
Yeah.

339
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,580
Is you thinking it's going to be funny?

340
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
What bridges are we burning talking about?

341
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,140
I'm thinking going through it in my head right now.

342
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,500
Yeah, we're doing the check.

343
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,060
I don't know.

344
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,500
It's deep in a podcast that's half about union relations.

345
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,460
Oh my gosh.

346
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,740
The union talk scared everyone away if the sword and the stone title didn't already.

347
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,660
So we're good.

348
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,980
People love my historical context and I've got even more of it.

349
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,620
This is interesting.

350
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,220
I don't know what could possibly be coming in this area.

351
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,180
Oh, sure.

352
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:58,100
Well, we can start diving in, I suppose, to the sword and the stone.

353
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,980
Well, it isn't a live show so much at all of the parks now.

354
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:13,060
I guess the main way the sword and the stone functions today is as a photo opportunity

355
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,100
and the bulk of the Magic Kingdoms and almost all of them except for Shanghai.

356
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,180
I think it is in Shanghai, isn't it?

357
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,420
Is it?

358
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,060
Maybe it is.

359
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,500
I think it's Hong Kong, right?

360
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,580
It's in Hong Kong.

361
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,860
But is that the one that's still on the show?

362
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,420
It is in Hong Kong.

363
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,140
That I know.

364
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,580
So it's still the show.

365
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,100
Well, then it brings down to which are still Merlin hosted.

366
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,100
Paris still has Merlin.

367
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,660
Okay.

368
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,260
I saw one in Hong Kong and Merlin was speaking.

369
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,380
I don't have an ear for it.

370
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,180
I wasn't sure if it was Cantonese or Mandarin.

371
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,060
Yeah, not sure what the go-to is at Hong Kong.

372
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,060
Yeah, we don't know much about Hong Kong, Disneyland.

373
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,420
Yeah, it seems like the official languages of Hong Kong,

374
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,700
from what I could tell, are written Chinese and spoken English.

375
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,100
It's cosmopolitan city.

376
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,220
Lots of language spoken.

377
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,720
Sure.

378
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,340
So there's not a show right now in Disneyland.

379
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,020
Yeah, it doesn't seem like it.

380
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,580
And I haven't seen this in a very long time.

381
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,820
2006 was the last time, I believe.

382
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,620
Something like that.

383
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,260
Oh, yeah.

384
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,220
They did it.

385
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,260
I found a 2012 posting by the Walt Disney Family Museum,

386
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,500
which was screening Sword in the Stone for an anniversary,

387
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,900
saying you could still get your picture with the Sword in the Stone at Disneyland,

388
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,740
but the show is not running right now.

389
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,220
Yes.

390
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,720
Okay.

391
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,160
So yeah, the main way day to day that it functions is that there is an anvil

392
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,000
with a sword sticking out of it, and you can try with all your might to pull the thing out,

393
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,360
but it will not budge.

394
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,080
And that is because the only way it will move is via magic.

395
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,440
Only the chosen few, as in the film, can pull the sword out of said stone.

396
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:02,200
And the only way that this is ever done day to day in the parks is via this show

397
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,600
that usually involves Merlin, but not always,

398
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:17,320
where Merlin is trying to find a placeholder king while King Arthur is away on vacation.

399
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,440
Is that what it is?

400
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,400
Yeah, because it's temporary.

401
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,240
It's the temporary king of the realm.

402
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,040
It's temporary.

403
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,200
They make it very clear to the children.

404
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,680
You are not the king here forever.

405
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,400
It's for like an hour tops.

406
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,440
You are not.

407
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,960
Pendragon put this sword in the anvil.

408
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,800
Disney Legal is very clear that they can't promise guests things even on rides.

409
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,920
Mara, there's like a, I think Tony Bexler talked about it,

410
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,040
because they have to make Mara so big and they say,

411
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,000
you know, you'll have eternal youth if you don't look into Mara's eyes.

412
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,400
So she's so big, everyone obviously looks,

413
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,120
unless you actually coordinated it with one person.

414
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,520
You might have a legal complaint.

415
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,640
We failed to do.

416
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:57,880
Right.

417
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,840
If everyone closed their eyes on Indiana Jones,

418
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,880
maybe there's a legal complaint to lodge, which of course would be insane,

419
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,520
but funny.

420
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,080
I mean, maybe we should try to do that and see where it would go.

421
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,320
Yeah.

422
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,360
So even all their offering is a very temporary kingship even,

423
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:19,560
but then at the end, the determination is of the show is that it took so long to find the king

424
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,160
that you don't even get that.

425
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,360
You aren't even, do you guys know this?

426
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,120
I read a transcript of the show.

427
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,040
Maybe I don't.

428
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,680
The justification that you get a crown and it is quickly taken away.

429
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,240
Yes.

430
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,560
Yeah.

431
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,880
And you don't actually get to be, you don't even get to be temporary king of Disneyland

432
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,760
or Disney World because there was so much business trying other people,

433
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,120
pulling the sword out of the stone.

434
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,680
Right.

435
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,280
So even like, oh, the time, like his alarm goes off.

436
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,120
I think a literal alarm sound is made even though it's a,

437
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,200
why can't I think of the word with the dust and the measures, the time.

438
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,160
Oh, what's the word?

439
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,040
A sundial?

440
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,440
No, no, the hourglass.

441
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:04,920
Yes.

442
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,640
God, I could not come up with the word hourglass.

443
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,240
I don't use them very often.

444
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,720
Sure.

445
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,160
It's not how I tell time, first of all, and I don't play a lot of games.

446
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,560
So yes, every board game used to include an hourglass.

447
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,520
Yeah.

448
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,640
You have a lot of hourglasses around.

449
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,920
Tiny plastic hourglasses.

450
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,880
Tiny plastic hourglasses.

451
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,000
And then if one broke, you used to have to dig out the other,

452
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,680
get the hourglass from the other board.

453
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,800
Now there's a board game I don't think I've talked about on the show or maybe briefly

454
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,640
because it's hard to avoid talking about it.

455
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,800
I had a game that was Planet Hollywood, the game.

456
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,600
Oh, I had that.

457
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,240
You had that too?

458
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,480
Yes.

459
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,080
It was the PII.

460
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,960
It was actually the globe itself with cards inside.

461
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,880
The famous globe from the logo, including the extruding one star.

462
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,720
And you set a little timer and then a little like very generic melody plays,

463
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,600
but good for them for writing original music for this game.

464
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,400
And then it dings.

465
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,360
Do one of you still have a copy of this?

466
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,920
I do.

467
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,720
I got it.

468
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,240
And Schomburg I may have it.

469
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,480
Or my Disney afternoon Avenue shit came from.

470
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,760
I'm just saying there's a lot of podcasts where people play games like D&D.

471
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,160
We could call a Cthulhu or something like that.

472
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,440
We could play around.

473
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,480
Well, and I think Hollywood recorded.

474
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,120
Absolutely.

475
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,040
Well, and there was a Disneyland board game as well, I believe.

476
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,720
Oh, yeah, that's like that was a lot of versions of that.

477
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,200
I feel like, yeah, there must be a lot of classic.

478
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,080
Yeah, right.

479
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,520
We are finding so many bits of bullshit that we can do.

480
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,760
The Planet Hollywood game is just like name Renee Russo movies.

481
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah.

482
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And then you name as many as you can.

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,480
I love it.

484
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,920
Sure.

485
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah, I think we have that.

486
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,840
But unless we got rid of I don't know.

487
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,440
It's in Schomburg if it still exists for me, because then obviously we could like

488
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,640
if we had two versions of we could have like multiple games going at once,

489
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,600
cutting back forth.

490
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,720
It'd be a real elaborate.

491
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,080
Oh, that would be easy to follow up.

492
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,120
Like the back of a comic book store when they're like tabletop gaming

493
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,800
and there's so many games going on.

494
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,480
Or we host podcast game nights and people come play against us, the masters.

495
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,560
Mm hmm.

496
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,320
The experts know you're Renee Russo.

497
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,600
Yeah, we are three Renee Russo experts.

498
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,720
You better know your shit.

499
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,600
So are we allowed to say like Nightcrawler?

500
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Yeah, because that wouldn't have been canon.

501
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,960
That would have been a movie.

502
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,800
I think we can play it from a little trouble will mainly be that the stars of today,

503
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,880
like Ansel Al Gore will not have be represented.

504
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,840
The stars that we know so much about today are not represented as cards.

505
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,720
So we and so like we couldn't do name Jeremy Renner endeavors and then

506
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,040
app Amazon storefront album music videos in car commercials.

507
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,080
But and also like there'll be questions like if you met Harvey Weinstein,

508
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,160
how many hugs would you give him to thank him for all the movies he's made over the years?

509
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,360
And you'd be like, well, three.

510
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,400
And obviously we don't want to talk about that.

511
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,640
Name all of your friends who you would love to see sit on John Lasseter's lap.

512
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:19,080
Oh, hey, this was a very this was a touchy huggy game.

513
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,200
These questions should have been canceled back then.

514
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,600
Yeah.

515
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,280
Well, we can't go backwards.

516
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,120
There have to be cancelable questions.

517
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,160
Yeah.

518
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,480
So once we go through, I'll go through first.

519
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,400
I'll pluck out all of the cancel questions.

520
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,600
It would also be funny to discover them while playing.

521
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah.

522
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,400
Yeah.

523
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,280
So either way.

524
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,160
Oh, certainly.

525
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,240
Original California Adventure had a casting couch joke on one of the windows.

526
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,560
Oh, yeah.

527
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:41,800
Yeah.

528
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,560
Someone designed someone wrote designed.

529
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,680
It was approved.

530
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,880
It was painted on.

531
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,760
And that eventually pretty quickly someone was like, get that the hell out of here.

532
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,040
I think there was a disconnect between what the casting couch was and what people thought.

533
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,520
I think it's still not OK that people thought like,

534
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,240
and then you got to give a couple of smooches.

535
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,800
But I do think people didn't.

536
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,440
Was it like it's the word sounds fun.

537
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,880
It's even alliterative.

538
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,360
Oh, yeah.

539
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,720
I think by the 90s had like any representation of Hollywood just felt like schmoozy.

540
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,160
Go to Beverly Hills, baby.

541
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,720
You know, so do we need to cancel the word schmooze?

542
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,320
Yeah.

543
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,040
Schmoozing does potentially involve not so good things.

544
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,280
Yeah.

545
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,960
Well, let's just clarify what schmooze means.

546
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,240
Schmooze will now be called networking.

547
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,240
The the smoothie stand we love so much.

548
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,560
Wait, that's what it is.

549
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,040
Yeah.

550
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,200
Yeah.

551
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,920
It's smoothies.

552
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,520
They serve smoothies there.

553
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,800
So it's called schmooze.

554
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,440
Not schmooze.

555
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,160
No schmooze.

556
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,920
TH schmooze schmooze.

557
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,760
It's donuts and smoothies and you can get the big Donald Duck thick ass donut.

558
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,260
Yeah.

559
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,920
There is that why Donald Duck's thick ass came up before or were we just admiring it in another way?

560
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,040
I can't remember.

561
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,160
It's possible that we were talking about that because Jason and I split a large donut

562
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,640
when we were waiting for Guardians the first time we ever wrote it.

563
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,480
It was like a Hulk donut, right?

564
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:13,880
Yeah.

565
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,000
Or was it Captain America because it had apple pie filling?

566
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,760
No, I think it was Hulk.

567
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,880
I think it was green.

568
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,520
I'm pretty sure it was Hulk.

569
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,200
But it definitely had apple pie filling.

570
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,240
But I can't remember why I was talking about Donald's rear.

571
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,800
I don't know.

572
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,240
It's occurring to me now that I have some new cats recently and one of them I would have to

573
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,440
qualify as having a thick ass.

574
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,640
And I think it makes me love her more.

575
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,120
I do.

576
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,520
Like in a Donald way, I think it's one of her most adorable facets.

577
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,240
It's endearing.

578
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,640
It's very endearing animal quality.

579
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,000
Like Winnie the Pooh.

580
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,800
It would certainly get stuck in a tree hole.

581
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,480
I don't want to get canceled but throw some pics up on the Twitter.

582
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,360
My cats, the cats.

583
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:02,680
Yeah.

584
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,120
I don't think I'll be canceled for that but we're talking about it in an endearing term.

585
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,520
It almost feels a little too...

586
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,360
That feels like too abrasive of a term.

587
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,800
I've been calling it a rump.

588
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,920
Well, of course.

589
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,480
I love my cats rump.

590
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,600
That's very wholesome.

591
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:16,840
Yes.

592
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,800
The reason with the Donald ass is because I think I said the word ass and it was weird

593
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,560
to use it in context with Donald.

594
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,320
We should be using the words rear and bottom, hindquarters.

595
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,440
Any of those are very safe for this very nice podcast.

596
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,560
I don't know if I...

597
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,480
Something about hindquarters feels odd to me because that implies you're going to spend

598
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,280
some time in there.

599
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,240
I don't see it like that.

600
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,160
Quarters is like a place you live.

601
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,280
Okay.

602
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,160
That's my own odd connotations with mass terminology.

603
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,440
My last thought about this is that when I was a child in the Pinocchio song,

604
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,480
and maybe I've mentioned this before, when you would sing the song,

605
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,640
I forget exactly which song it is, but it's just like there's a line in there about his

606
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,600
little wooden seat.

607
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,640
I would lose my mind laughing.

608
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,000
I thought that was the funniest thing.

609
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
I still think I think it's funny.

610
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,720
Calling it a seat, little wooden seat.

611
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,600
That feels in our wheelhouse.

612
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,000
As much as we've already used, we've already talked about thick ass before.

613
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,200
I think us started like if we can try to from here on out.

614
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,080
Just call it a seat.

615
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,800
Call it seats.

616
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,280
Seats.

617
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,160
That's pretty funny.

618
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,040
All right, fine.

619
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,760
We'll use seats.

620
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,080
I think you managed to find the tamest word humanly possible.

621
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,680
Well, I love my cat's seat.

622
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,000
My cat's got a great seat.

623
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:45,080
Also, Pinocchio's seat has come up before because in that crazy song,

624
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,880
today I wept for the Geppetto song in that Christmas special that I'm a big fan of.

625
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,560
He talks about spanking.

626
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,080
He fondly recalls spanking Pinocchio and getting a blister.

627
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,240
And this is a nice memory.

628
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:07,000
So weirdly, this several Pinocchio's seat comes up in several ways in Disney mythology.

629
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:16,600
My Pinocchio song theory is that the high D and actor's life for me is what Walt thought of actors.

630
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,720
That they were good for nothing scumbags.

631
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,880
That they get punished for their sinful lives.

632
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,800
Anytime I do something like coming out of an audition, sometimes I get stuck in my head.

633
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,400
Awful audition, I get that song stuck in my head.

634
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,480
A full hour 45 leaving Santa Monica, you have actor's life for me.

635
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,080
Mocking you.

636
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,840
I disagree.

637
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,560
Kurt Russell, Suzanne Plachette, these are actors he had a lot of fondness for.

638
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,320
He couldn't think that the profession was.

639
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,760
I think there was some he liked.

640
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,640
I'll just say.

641
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,760
You're saying there was a handful of elite actors, Annette.

642
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,480
Julie Andrews, Dick Fanda, yeah.

643
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,200
Right, those people he liked, but your average working actor he had nothing but to stay in for.

644
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,700
Perhaps.

645
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,520
Or even if he loved them, he thought they are like.

646
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,880
Layabouts.

647
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,680
And yeah, and then silly creatures in pursuit of something silly.

648
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,400
Reaper heads.

649
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,120
He also took roles away from them by appearing on the show all the time by not hiring a host.

650
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,520
And by voicing Mickey himself, he kind of like took that spot for a decade or so.

651
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,000
Eventually we realized more capable Mickey voices.

652
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,800
That's true, yeah.

653
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,640
Walt's hatred of actors is very evident.

654
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,000
But he does seem supportive, at least in California Adventure's statue form of Mickey's

655
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,120
suitcase in a dream.

656
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,400
Right.

657
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,040
He's alive and like, here we, here you go, bud.

658
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,400
But that was obviously, you know, that statue is not based on

659
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,000
like, it's not from, it's a fantasy, you know, that wasn't really.

660
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,640
It's figurative.

661
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,560
It's a figurative statue, you know.

662
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,760
So like.

663
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:04,600
So he didn't show up to California with Mickey Mao with a fully rent out of a real life character.

664
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Yeah, that wasn't actually what happened.

665
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,840
So I'm just saying it's possible he wouldn't have supported Mickey's suitcase in a dream.

666
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,720
They need a new mattress on that sleeper car, my fucking neck.

667
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,680
That is the narrative in suitcase.

668
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,800
Doesn't count as a meal.

669
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,640
I want money back.

670
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,680
Do you think they could, do you think Walt could have gotten a child seat

671
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,760
for him being that he's small?

672
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,480
For Mickey?

673
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,240
Or did he have to keep him on his lap?

674
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,600
Like you have to like, like parents of newborns to not pay for that extra seat.

675
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,320
I don't know.

676
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,200
It's a good question.

677
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,320
He was like, Mickey, Mickey, you'll be saying that you're under two.

678
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,920
Save us the feet.

679
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,640
It's my Walt, which is the same as my Obama.

680
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,760
Same as your Obama, right?

681
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
It's very Cronkite.

682
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,560
This is what I.

683
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,840
Yes, that's how old men talked in the old days.

684
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,720
Very clipped.

685
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,240
Stop.

686
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,920
And this is what we're going to do.

687
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,360
That sort of.

688
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,520
Or I mean, if it's Tom Hanks' version, of course, it's, well, Mickey,

689
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,680
we're going to say you're two years old.

690
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,520
Which is sort of his Mr. Rogers as well.

691
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,880
I think he looks great as Mr. Rogers, but the voice is a lot huskier.

692
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,280
Yeah.

693
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,200
But Mr. Rogers is a tough voice to do.

694
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,000
Tough voice to do.

695
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,720
Tough voice to do.

696
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,680
So high and.

697
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,960
It's hard to not make it completely unnerving.

698
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,000
Yes.

699
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,440
Does it sound like a serial killer or that you're making fun of them?

700
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,080
Right.

701
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,320
Yeah.

702
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,760
I'm Mr. Rogers.

703
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,240
Yeah.

704
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,640
It's not.

705
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,760
Hello there.

706
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,120
You can't just go like.

707
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,960
George H.W. Bush, I guess, as well.

708
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,760
Like Kookie.

709
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,120
Merlin, the wizard of lore.

710
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,080
Are you trying to bring this back?

711
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,840
I am bringing it back around.

712
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,000
Jason, this is the lightest topic we've ever done.

713
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,360
I know.

714
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,600
I love it.

715
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,160
We have to have.

716
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,640
I've got a lot.

717
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,120
I've got a lot.

718
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,200
Well, yeah, we were texting on the way.

719
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,200
You've been convinced the whole time of the fullness of the top,

720
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,640
of the robustness of the topic.

721
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,480
I haven't been convinced on the fullness of the topic.

722
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,800
I just knew that I could just do a voice for a while.

723
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,920
And then we like that would kill enough time for the podcast to be over.

724
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,280
Anyway, back to.

725
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,760
So this podcast killing time.

726
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,160
I think it's all valuable, crucial information.

727
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,440
I guess that's one way to look at it.

728
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,320
Sword in the Stone, of course, based on the myths of King Arthur.

729
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:31,320
First kind of the myths of legend that were sort of collated by Sir Thomas Mallory and

730
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:40,200
and later on by T.H. White, who wrote the book, The Sword in the Stone, a shorter novel,

731
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,000
eventually the first part of the larger piece, the once and future king.

732
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,320
Which I learned a little bit about when I was younger because it is all that is the

733
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,000
basis of the musical Camelot, which I was in in high school.

734
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,600
Oh, my God.

735
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,640
Do we have the tape?

736
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,200
What did you do?

737
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:04,040
OK, so I was very excited because they said they were going to do a dual casting for this one,

738
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:10,120
which meant there were multiple people playing Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot.

739
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,280
And there was also and Merlin and there was a kooky knight.

740
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,560
And I forget his name.

741
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,040
I did not get that part.

742
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:26,520
The part I got is the child who comes on at the end after Camelot has fallen and volunteers like,

743
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,960
Your Highness, my Lord, I'll fight.

744
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,600
I'll bring my bow and arrow, my Lord.

745
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,640
And then Arthur tells him about the glory days of Camelot, because of course, Camelot,

746
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:44,840
this grand happy place lured it over by Arthur and Guinevere until she leaves him for

747
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
the once good night, Lancelot.

748
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,960
And then there is a battle between them.

749
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,360
OK.

750
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,040
And then Camelot falls.

751
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,120
Did you go into any high school audition scenario dreading?

752
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,160
Am I going to be the kid?

753
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,520
No, I was fully prepared.

754
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,160
In fact, in MAME, I wanted to be the kid and did not get it.

755
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:16,360
I got to like the girlfriend's straight laced father, the fiance's father that

756
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,320
Auntie MAME's nephew is supposed to marry.

757
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,440
I did not do well in high school theater.

758
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,080
It sounds like you were in a lot of.

759
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,760
How many shows were you in?

760
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,320
Four.

761
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,080
We just did one musical a year.

762
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,000
So you were in the musical every year?

763
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,480
Yeah.

764
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,120
That's pretty good.

765
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,680
But like in middle school, I was usually like the bad guy or at least a supporting

766
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,720
lead or something.

767
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,400
Well, it's like it's bumping up to the majors and it gets it's a tougher and tougher slice

768
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,120
every time.

769
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,360
Well, now you're in that now in Hollywood.

770
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,120
Who's the only one who lives in Hollywood now?

771
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,880
Is that true?

772
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,600
Does nobody here?

773
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,200
A couple of people I know have like moved to L.A.

774
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,880
Actually, the older brother of like a childhood friend just sold a screenplay to Netflix.

775
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,080
So he used to win well.

776
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,480
OK.

777
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,400
I'll never be the number one in my class because I was next to me alphabetically was

778
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,080
David Gallagher, who is the who is the middle child, I believe, on the show Seventh Heaven.

779
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,640
Oh, right.

780
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,040
Oh, yeah.

781
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,160
Who was at the time.

782
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,240
So already had achieved more than.

783
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,360
Sure.

784
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:28,120
A direct to video Richie Rich due to Macaulay Culkin not returning to the franchise.

785
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,760
Well, yes.

786
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,640
Oh, yeah.

787
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,200
Wow.

788
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,440
So are we just judging it on same year or just in like around a class?

789
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,720
Because I just realized there was a guy who was a year older from Schomburg High School

790
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,080
that is like a very successful actor named Mike Rourke, who's in a bunch of things.

791
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,400
OK.

792
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,320
What do we know the time?

793
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,040
I don't know.

794
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,000
You should schmooze with him.

795
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,600
Oh, I know.

796
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,320
You mean that.

797
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,280
I know what you mean by that.

798
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,080
Excuse me.

799
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,680
What kind of schmooze?

800
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,280
I read you loud and clear, pal.

801
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,400
Yeah.

802
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,320
So the myths of legend of King Arthur, Disney never really made like

803
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,560
besides Sword in the Stone never really had like a King Arthur movie.

804
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,480
Yeah, there's no live action.

805
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,680
Well, besides kidding.

806
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,240
Kidding.

807
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,280
King Arthur.

808
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,080
Yeah.

809
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:19,480
But there's not like a Disney animation canon Arthur besides Wart, the boy who pulls.

810
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,320
Because Arthur doesn't factor into this tale.

811
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,560
Yes.

812
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,960
No, they like they allude to it.

813
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,800
In the movie Sword in the Stone, which it's been a long time since I watched some clips

814
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,960
just to confirm that Merlin did indeed turn himself and Arthur into fish at one point.

815
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,920
That was my most clear memory of it.

816
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,760
And like Wart or Arthur, whatever you want to call him, like casually pulling the sword out of the stone.

817
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,260
OK, yeah.

818
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,400
Yeah, so Arthur isn't a character in it, but Arthur is referred to.

819
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,080
And in this show, in the live show, Arthur is referenced as he's away.

820
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,520
So when you're on vacation, you rubs your duties or sconded with.

821
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:06,440
Which is probably good because it would be terrible for a small child to be enjoying the day

822
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,360
at Disney World and then be responsible for the fall of like dealing with the ramifications

823
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,280
of the fall out of Camelot falling.

824
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,000
So you view it as you're not becoming like the king of Disneyland.

825
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,400
You have to take care of Camelot.

826
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,440
You're running the same.

827
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,600
You're keeping it within their story.

828
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,480
Yeah, you're like the 10 minutes where they think on VEEP,

829
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,440
where they think Selena Myers has to be president in the first episode or something.

830
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,160
So you're just saying the kid is being set up as like the fall person, the fall guy.

831
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,920
Oh, well, now I'm saying it's good they're not the fall guy.

832
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,240
Right.

833
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,880
But you're saying that.

834
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,320
They could very well be the fall guy.

835
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,600
Right, where they're just they're just installed sort of towards the end.

836
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,960
I see Merlin is is good.

837
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,840
Merlin is pure.

838
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,920
I cannot speak to the other people who do the show, the Royal Majesty makers.

839
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,240
So sometimes it's Merlin.

840
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,560
Sometimes we know sometimes it's these two people.

841
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,560
I don't know where they're coming.

842
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,680
Sorry, there's four of them.

843
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,320
There are two of them, but there's four characters.

844
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,520
I learned about this because I was like, what the hell is this?

845
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,840
And I had to look it up on the Disney World website because on the Disney World website,

846
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,360
it's under the Royal Majesty makers.

847
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,200
It's not under the sword in the stone.

848
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,760
Does that imply that they do this show today at Disney World?

849
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,800
They do the show today.

850
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,440
In fact, it was running yesterday and today.

851
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,080
Oh, OK.

852
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,120
Few times a day.

853
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,920
Meet retired knight Sir Sterling, his clever niece, Bridget,

854
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,080
Squire Tobias and the kind Lady Llewellyn as the official ambassador to Cinderella's court.

855
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,960
They will put your skills to the test and school you in the finer points of regal behavior.

856
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,040
Next, D23.

857
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,600
If you want to win the most obscure costume contest, go with clever niece Bridget.

858
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,320
Clever niece.

859
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,640
Yeah.

860
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,680
Or Tobias.

861
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,480
Or Tobias.

862
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,800
So four characters will come out and you're saying they did this yesterday.

863
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,200
Two.

864
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,720
I think they alternate the characters.

865
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,360
OK, right.

866
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,080
You said that.

867
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,320
And this is where the unions come up again.

868
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:11,160
I learned I was told this and I had to look it up because I was surprised to learn this.

869
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,320
These roles are actors equity roles.

870
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,820
OK.

871
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,920
Which is the that is the union you join if you are a Broadway performer.

872
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,000
And this is the union that runs some of the other roles in Florida.

873
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,520
People will be in turtle talk with Crush and get their equity card and then they could go

874
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,800
join a Broadway chorus.

875
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,680
Well, this is some of the issue that we talked about this with Matt Gorley that he was like

876
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,320
when you're back when there's dialogue and you're improvise, if it's this like heightened level of

877
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,360
performing, you get to be you get much better pay seemingly.

878
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,160
Yeah.

879
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,080
And it's seemingly why they have Disney avoids doing too many things like this.

880
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,040
And it's maybe one of the first to go because the staffing is like Star Wars land like Galaxy.

881
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,520
Yeah.

882
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah.

883
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,240
Yeah.

884
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:03,000
A few of the people are equity because old the tyrant Bob Chapek just said, well,

885
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,840
the people that are at the in working in the stores, they'll be our characters.

886
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:13,480
They say three confusing phrases that you and that will replace right there being droids.

887
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,440
It's running around.

888
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:21,160
Yes, because so the droid operators would fall under the purview of the union that puppeteers

889
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,880
are in.

890
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,040
OK, I'm not sure which one that is, but I was shocked to learn.

891
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,360
And so I found a listing for the royal majesty makers.

892
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,360
Like to get the job.

893
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:32,600
Yeah.

894
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,400
On backstage on like the the.

895
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,520
Have you applied?

896
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,920
No, because it was a listing from like 2013, but they were also applying.

897
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,800
There was listings at that time for turtle talk with crush world showcase players.

898
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,680
So apparently in Florida, I think it is if you are using a microphone,

899
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:57,320
you are the role as equity because turtle talk with crush doesn't sing.

900
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,120
First, I thought it was saying you were equity, but singing might get you a bump.

901
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,760
OK.

902
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,440
So but still crazy to me because I don't know how much out here is equity.

903
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,520
It seemed like, yeah, Matt Gorley was saying a lot was ag, but the American Guild of Variety

904
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,000
artist.

905
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,320
So yeah.

906
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,240
So all right.

907
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,840
So Merlin's doing OK.

908
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,000
Yeah.

909
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,320
So I would assume Merlin equity, too.

910
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,520
But he's going to retire.

911
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,880
Bridget's doing OK.

912
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,160
My question is, why are there it's in a company that obviously cuts a lot of cost.

913
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,800
They're cutting costs now because Disneyland is empty.

914
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,680
It's empty today.

915
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,280
All the passes are unblocked.

916
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,520
So it never kicked back in Space Mountain 10 minute wait two hours ago.

917
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,280
And we're recording this in the middle of the afternoon.

918
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,840
Did Galaxy's Edge kill Disneyland?

919
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,720
Yeah, I guess it did.

920
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,520
It didn't happen.

921
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,920
I don't know because truly what time is it?

922
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,040
It's like five o'clock right now.

923
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,080
It was three o'clock.

924
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,800
And I look 10 minute wait for Space Mountain in the middle of the day.

925
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,720
Well, it's 93 degrees out.

926
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,800
It's hot out, but it's never stopped people.

927
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,400
Yeah, that was not like it would still like Guardians is 25.

928
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,120
I think cars would probably the longest wait.

929
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,040
I walked on Guardians last week.

930
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,680
I was there.

931
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,360
Yeah, I was there recently and everything was pretty light.

932
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,760
So anyway, so where was I going with this?

933
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,000
It seems odd to me that they wouldn't just keep having Merlin be the character

934
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,120
because it's only one person.

935
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,240
It's just one guy.

936
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,120
And there's two people.

937
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,600
You would think they would all be like, well, we just have Merlin do it,

938
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,280
not have these new characters.

939
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,800
Four of them.

940
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,080
Four of them to rotate.

941
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,320
Just always put the robe on.

942
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,600
Anybody can do it.

943
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,880
Merlin can be either gender.

944
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,360
Who cares?

945
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,200
Let's just do Merlin.

946
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,960
And he's more fun, I'm assuming.

947
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,760
I think he's more fun.

948
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,120
I think the Royal Majesty makers are a little sticky.

949
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,480
I mean, they're pretty tight and they have to do a lot of stuff.

950
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,520
I like Merlin.

951
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,320
I like a kooky old man, even if it's just a big beard and a hat.

952
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:53,240
I think all three of us probably we enjoy a bearded old man

953
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,120
over most type of characters.

954
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,760
That's definitely true.

955
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,260
Yes.

956
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,600
You're Marvel.

957
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,920
Does Marvel McFay have a beard?

958
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,480
Oh, yeah.

959
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,120
He does, right?

960
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,400
He is like a Dreamfinder kind of guy.

961
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:03,640
Yeah.

962
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,320
So like that's yeah.

963
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,640
So I'm just wondering what the thinking is.

964
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,600
Maybe kids don't connect with Merlin as much as they used to.

965
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:16,920
I mean, they've not kept this particular property alive as a vibrant.

966
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,360
Nor is there.

967
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,000
There's not really like a song, you know, from Sword in the Stone.

968
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,200
No.

969
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:28,520
Maybe the most iconic song free of classic Disney era.

970
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,720
Yeah, I couldn't pull it.

971
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,360
I was reading about Sword in the Stone because that was one of two rabbit holes.

972
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:40,600
I went down for this Sword in the Stone directed by a man named Wolfgang Reitherman.

973
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,160
He's one of the nine old men.

974
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,200
One of the nine old men.

975
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:44,700
Yeah.

976
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,080
Also credited as Woolly Reitherman,

977
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,960
credited as director on Jungle Book, Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree,

978
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,920
Aristocats, Robin Hood, co-directed the many adventures of Winnie the Pooh,

979
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,800
the Rescuers and 101 Dalmatians.

980
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,080
Geez, pretty good.

981
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,720
Pretty good.

982
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,840
And like this is also coming like in a period that started in 1950 with Cinderella when

983
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,240
they're like, OK, we're back to feature like that and animated features.

984
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,440
Before that, there was like six like package movies, like weird movies about planes.

985
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,000
Yes.

986
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,040
War Bonds.

987
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,440
War Bonds, Three Caballeros, Ichabod and Mr. Crane.

988
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,080
Mr. Toad.

989
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,960
Or Mr. Toad.

990
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,040
That's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type movie.

991
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,540
Yeah.

992
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,040
Ichabod and Mr. Crane.

993
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,120
Peace Mealing anthology movies because so much of the staff was at the war.

994
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,280
And then it took so long to do animation at that time and new Disney anime feature would

995
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,120
only come out every few years.

996
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,620
Yeah.

997
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:42,700
Yeah.

998
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:20,060
The story of a confident rooster who believes that he's crowing can make the sunrise based on an old play.

999
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,100
Chanticleer, if that sounds familiar.

1000
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,780
Were you in Chanticleer in high school or middle school?

1001
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,060
No, it doesn't sound like a play that people super were into.

1002
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:35,020
Like in the early 1900s, late 1800s, whatever it came out.

1003
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,940
Chanticleer, the basis, though, for the movie Rock-A-Doodle.

1004
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,420
He's gone at it.

1005
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,580
It's exactly what I was looking up.

1006
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,100
Yeah, wait, is that why there's that weird rooster thing?

1007
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,600
Yeah.

1008
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:52,220
Chanticleer was updated with an Elvis theme for Rock-A-Doodle.

1009
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,740
For Rock-A-Doodle.

1010
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,620
Chanticleer got so far.

1011
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,740
I love Chanticleer.

1012
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,940
Is that the name of the chicken?

1013
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,540
That's the name of the chicken.

1014
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,040
Oh, man.

1015
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,620
What a mealy name.

1016
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,660
Chanticleer.

1017
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,740
Like chant, the word chant and then Echler.

1018
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,980
E-C-L-E-R.

1019
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,140
I think there is a French basis.

1020
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,620
He is apparently, I think it's called a Gallic rooster,

1021
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:18,860
which is one of the unofficial symbols of the nation of France.

1022
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:22,460
So Chanticleer got far enough in the development process

1023
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,140
that there's tons of Mark Davis concept art for Chanticleer.

1024
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,620
Oh.

1025
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,060
And it looks great.

1026
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,300
Like look at these cool roosters.

1027
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,020
Really?

1028
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,220
Mark Davis, who, just a reminder, did a lot of the Haunted Mansion art

1029
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,900
and a lot of the great characters in the parks are due to Mark Davis.

1030
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:38,780
Country Bears.

1031
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,500
Country Bears.

1032
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,980
I looked up Chanticleer and I think I spelled it wrong

1033
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,220
because I just got a listing for Chanticleer Apartments,

1034
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,300
one star, Garden Grove, California.

1035
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:47,820
So that's not this.

1036
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,340
Is the landlord this?

1037
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,780
There wasn't going to be a movie based on that.

1038
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,340
The landlord is a fancy chicken.

1039
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,580
No, that's Chanticleer, I believe.

1040
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,580
Is that him with the top hat?

1041
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,140
Yeah.

1042
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:58,380
Wow.

1043
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,380
Because he really thinks very highly of himself.

1044
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,180
Holy shit.

1045
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:06,060
Jason, what you're showing us is extremely America Sings slash splash mountain.

1046
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:11,340
Well, Scott, I'm glad you said that because this concept art of lady chickens

1047
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,180
looks exactly like.

1048
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,900
Like Southern Belle chickens?

1049
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,660
Like America Sings chickens.

1050
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,460
Exactly.

1051
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,020
They belong on that boat in Splash Mountain.

1052
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,900
Nothing ever really goes away at Disney, which also,

1053
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,700
and this is a little bit of a leap, another piece of concept art for Chanticleer,

1054
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,140
a dog with a key next to a jail cell.

1055
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:34,940
Whoa.

1056
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,900
Is a cop dog, but still like Pirates of the Caribbean.

1057
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,700
And the dog himself also looks extremely like I feel like somebody looks like that in Splash

1058
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,100
Mountain.

1059
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,740
Yeah.

1060
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:53,500
And furthermore, this owl character is exactly the way Archimedes Merlin's owl in Sword in

1061
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,620
the Stone looks.

1062
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,420
He stole that for the owl in the Sword in the Stone.

1063
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,380
Yeah.

1064
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,340
I mean, I guess he can.

1065
00:48:59,340 --> 00:48:59,980
He used it.

1066
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,620
If it wasn't.

1067
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:05,340
This is a secret Chanticleer episode.

1068
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,700
What has happened now is the audience has stumbled into what they thought was Sword

1069
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,100
in the Stone.

1070
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,580
They thought it was about unions, but really, this is just about Chanticleer from here on

1071
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:13,900
out.

1072
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,900
I mean, I think Chanticleer rules.

1073
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,260
There's even more concept.

1074
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,940
All this concept art is amazing.

1075
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,780
He's my new favorite character.

1076
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:25,900
People could not get over, though, that like people aren't going to want to see a chicken

1077
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,400
movie.

1078
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,220
Of course they are.

1079
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,180
And yeah, then Ratatouille down the road.

1080
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:38,620
Now, and Don Bluth was like in the 50s, was around Disney Studios for some of his early

1081
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,100
gigs.

1082
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,860
So they didn't.

1083
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:51,740
And the Chanticleer movie shares like one or two concepts, I think, with the Disney

1084
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,740
Chanticleer development stuff.

1085
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,900
I think the bad guy is a fox.

1086
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,380
The love interest is a pheasant, but there's not a ton of crossover.

1087
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:04,060
OK, there's fencing chickens here.

1088
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,900
The fencing looks great.

1089
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,340
I mean, it's Mark Davis stuff.

1090
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:07,740
It's great.

1091
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,420
I'm sure it's in that book.

1092
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,060
The new like $80 Mark Davis Puffy Table Book.

1093
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:12,860
Oh, right, right.

1094
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,580
Or a two book set, I think just came out.

1095
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,100
But yeah, is Chanticleer, is that a public domain play?

1096
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,740
Can we put that up somewhere with you as Chanticleer?

1097
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,580
I mean, I would love that.

1098
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:32,380
Everyone in the play, similar ish to Animal Farm, every character is an animal.

1099
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,540
The costumes for this play are like animal suits.

1100
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,420
Can we use the Rock-A-Doodle songs?

1101
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,780
Can we combine it all?

1102
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:46,780
It's Mark Davis style design, but the songs from the iconic songs.

1103
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,300
People screaming Rock-A-Doodle.

1104
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,420
I have the play right here.

1105
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,460
I have pulled it up.

1106
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:57,820
I think by the time Rock-A-Doodle got made, it certainly would have been in the public domain.

1107
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:03,420
Rock-A-Doodle also at the time competing with Beauty and the Beast and Five will Go West.

1108
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,620
Don Bluth involved with American Tale, not really involved with Five will Go West.

1109
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,580
Do you know who plays Chanticleer in the, they started spelling it with double E's

1110
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,980
by the time the Rock-A-Doodle came around.

1111
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,340
Disney was going to call it that too.

1112
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,580
Do you know who plays the Chanticleer in Rock-A-Doodle?

1113
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,700
I think I do.

1114
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,340
What do you know?

1115
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,860
Is it Glen Campbell?

1116
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,420
Yeah.

1117
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:23,660
Wow.

1118
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,620
Isn't that wild?

1119
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,340
Weird.

1120
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,060
Yeah.

1121
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,860
In 1990, we're like opposite Beauty and the Beast.

1122
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:32,940
Essentially, there's a animated film starring Glen Campbell.

1123
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,220
Yeah.

1124
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,260
Very strange.

1125
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,660
So we could have never had Rock-A-Doodle, which I had a VHS of Rock-A-Doodle growing up.

1126
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,340
I watched Rock-A-Doodle a lot.

1127
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,940
We can't stop singing the name.

1128
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,060
Rock-A-Doodle?

1129
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:46,300
Yeah.

1130
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,260
And remember this is pre-Rock-A-Doodle time.

1131
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,820
But now that we're post-Rock-A-Doodle, we have to remember that Rock-A-Doodle wouldn't happen.

1132
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,020
It's really fun to say.

1133
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:55,420
Yeah.

1134
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,300
I've never seen it.

1135
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,580
I've never seen it either.

1136
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,080
Oh.

1137
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,300
It can be pretty fun.

1138
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,500
If you told me this was a Chanticleer episode, I would have watched Rock-A-Doodle.

1139
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,860
Rock-A-Doodle has better songs than...

1140
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,660
I remember the songs from Rock-A-Doodle.

1141
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,020
I do not remember the Sword and the Stone songs.

1142
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,980
I guess it has songs.

1143
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,260
It has some music.

1144
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,020
Maybe it doesn't have like song songs.

1145
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,460
It doesn't have big numbers.

1146
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,300
What is your favorite Rock-A-Doodle song?

1147
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:23,660
Rock-A-Doodle.

1148
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,420
Sundooshine from Dumb.

1149
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,060
Sundooshine?

1150
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:30,560
Yeah.

1151
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,660
You said that like, oh yeah, Sundooshine.

1152
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,160
Yeah.

1153
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:34,940
That's my favorite.

1154
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,440
Yeah.

1155
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,500
My daddy taught me how to sing.

1156
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,460
I remember that lyric.

1157
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,460
Kiss and Coo is a song.

1158
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:40,960
Yeah.

1159
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:42,940
Yeah.

1160
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,780
I remember watching Rock-A-Doodle a lot and that was just one where I was like,

1161
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,460
this might be one for me and my brother.

1162
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,580
I don't think anyone at school will want to talk about Rock-A-Doodle.

1163
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,460
But I want to podcast one day.

1164
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,540
Hey, let me call you out on something.

1165
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:05,900
I feel like you've said you don't like doo-wop music and this is very Elvis doo-woppy old rock and roll.

1166
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,940
Yeah, but a chicken is singing it.

1167
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,180
That forgives.

1168
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:12,540
Right.

1169
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,460
I'm just saying I think there's an inconsistency there.

1170
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,300
It's more like doo-squawk music.

1171
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,380
Squawk.

1172
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:18,860
All right.

1173
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,980
Well, we'll do a full rock and roll.

1174
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:20,940
Yeah, that's better.

1175
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,580
That's better.

1176
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:21,980
Thank you.

1177
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,940
Jason's favorite genre of music is squawk and roll.

1178
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:29,500
Wow.

1179
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,020
Oh, what a discovery.

1180
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,820
Well, yeah, Rock-A-Doodle will have to get on the queue soon enough.

1181
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:38,220
Could you imagine if like talking about Disney animated classics, like, well, yeah,

1182
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:43,180
the animation started to get scratchier and people who grew up at Disney animated movies

1183
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,220
started making stuff.

1184
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,220
You know, there was a 101 Dalmatians and Jungle Book.

1185
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,300
And Chantecler and...

1186
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:58,060
I mean, once Poco Loco got into the mix, the line up, like every Disney theme park,

1187
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:01,020
five hour line to meet Poco Loco.

1188
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,380
Different worlds.

1189
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,260
Different worlds.

1190
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:05,820
What could have been?

1191
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,180
No sword in the stone.

1192
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:15,020
And the like incredible sums of money that could have gone to the estate of Edmund Rostlund.

1193
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,860
Yeah.

1194
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,460
It's best they don't think about it.

1195
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:23,100
And if you're a Rostlund heir or heiress listening to this, my apologies.

1196
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,420
You only you do have Rock-A-Doodle money.

1197
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,700
No Disney, the feral cats of Disneyland don't exist.

1198
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,700
There's just feral roosters everywhere.

1199
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,980
If you're there at Rope Drop, it's just a nightmare.

1200
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,220
It's an auto audio nightmare.

1201
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,940
It's just screaming roosters in every land.

1202
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,620
Walt's idea to promote it at the end of the 60s.

1203
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,260
What if we release a thousand roosters into the park?

1204
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,700
And of course, there would be a Disney plus Chantelier announced already.

1205
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,940
A movie coming soon.

1206
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,900
CGI, mix of live action and CGI.

1207
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,400
Yep.

1208
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:57,740
They can still do it.

1209
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:58,940
That's true.

1210
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,220
That's in the archives somewhere.

1211
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,700
The Jacob Tremblay.

1212
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,460
A Chanticleer?

1213
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:04,960
Yeah.

1214
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,660
I think you need like the guy from Magic Dragons or someone.

1215
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,220
You need like...

1216
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:11,920
Leto.

1217
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,900
Oh man, Leto?

1218
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,100
Leto is good.

1219
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,140
Chanticleer.

1220
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,820
I'm not sure who would own Rock-A-Doodle now.

1221
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,540
Who put it out?

1222
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:20,860
Was it Bob?

1223
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,300
Samuel Goldwyn distributed it.

1224
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,260
Oh, so it wasn't like any studio?

1225
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,860
It wasn't partnered with the studio or anything?

1226
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,500
That's so weird.

1227
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,460
I'm not quite sure.

1228
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:30,860
It was a weird time.

1229
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,620
We look into it and realize like, wait, you know who owns Samuel Goldwyn?

1230
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,340
I do.

1231
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:35,820
I do.

1232
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,940
I didn't even realize.

1233
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,020
My parents didn't even think to tell me.

1234
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,820
My last name is hyphenated?

1235
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,780
Gardener slash Goldwyn?

1236
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,780
It's never looked.

1237
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,860
It was Samuel Goldwyn company.

1238
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:49,900
Who owns that now?

1239
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:50,960
Geez.

1240
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,620
You see it every now and then, but it's sort of like every now and then.

1241
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,540
They merged with United Artists.

1242
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:56,780
Yeah.

1243
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,780
Who owns United Artists?

1244
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,860
United Artists shows up every now and then.

1245
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,580
Columbia TriStar, I feel like is used now.

1246
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,780
It doesn't.

1247
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,420
You're just buying.

1248
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,980
Why is there no theme park where I can meet the TriStar lady?

1249
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:11,900
Give her a hug.

1250
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,660
Even just an Instagram pop-up.

1251
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:19,340
We need to find a lawyer and do an episode with a lawyer and we need to lay out our plan for

1252
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:24,540
acquiring all of these different IP that have been my enjoyment for so long.

1253
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,060
Yeah, because that's where the real money.

1254
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,780
Just go down the list of things and lay it out with them.

1255
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,140
They'll tell us how realistic it is, how much money we're looking at.

1256
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,380
Marvel McFay portal, little Abner portal, Rockadoodle portal.

1257
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:42,380
We are going to end up owning so many unpleasant IPs.

1258
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:44,860
Yes.

1259
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:50,300
If I could just own one of Heathcliff's Cadillac cats, Hector, please.

1260
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:50,780
Just Hector.

1261
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,500
Just Hector.

1262
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:56,540
But then he's got to get removed, a la Spider-Man from MCU.

1263
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,340
Yeah, so when the Heathcliff reboot comes, he'll...

1264
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,820
Are you saying in like old cartoons they'll have to remove Hector?

1265
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,900
You don't have to replace him with a different cat.

1266
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,620
Remove Hector, yeah.

1267
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,580
Oh, that's fine.

1268
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,540
Put a mustache on him.

1269
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:10,700
Just put a mustache on him and color him differently and call him something else.

1270
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,700
That's a lot of work for that reissue.

1271
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,580
You earned it.

1272
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,620
I earned it because that lawyer will do it.

1273
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,620
People are sleeping on Hector ownership.

1274
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:16,860
Yeah.

1275
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,580
Well, okay.

1276
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,300
Sword in the Stone.

1277
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,180
Sword in the Stone.

1278
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,620
Back to the Sword in the Stone.

1279
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,340
Hey, hey, hey.

1280
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,460
I like, you know what?

1281
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,660
Good rabbit holes.

1282
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,540
Yeah, thank you.

1283
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,220
Yeah, I got so excited.

1284
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,740
I mean, that Mark Davis art is great.

1285
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,660
It's always so fun to uncover his stuff.

1286
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:38,780
Did you see where for the Sword in the Stone experience where you actually hit the switch

1287
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,780
that actually makes the sword available?

1288
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,740
Do you know where that is?

1289
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,380
Is a picture.

1290
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,180
I found a picture.

1291
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,500
I mean, this is according to some website.

1292
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:51,740
I heard the technicians wander around sometimes and like we'll release it

1293
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,060
throughout the day if people are trying it.

1294
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:59,180
It's right by Pinocchio's Daring Journey, supposedly.

1295
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:02,140
Supposedly there's a switch just in the bushes.

1296
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:02,940
What?

1297
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,780
So like you can go over there.

1298
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,140
We're probably giving information out.

1299
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,260
People are going to try to do it.

1300
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,740
So I'm going to let me see what it says here.

1301
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,300
Hit the button.

1302
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,940
In the bushes by Pinocchio's Daring Journey, you'll spot the switch.

1303
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,500
A custodial cast member accomplice.

1304
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,700
They use that word.

1305
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,940
It uses to activate the sword's release at the proper time in Merlin's show.

1306
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,260
So it's somewhere on the left of Pinocchio's Daring Journey.

1307
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,780
It's got to be like key operated though.

1308
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,900
You can't just like hit a button.

1309
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:32,300
I would think we're a fob.

1310
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,180
Yeah.

1311
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,140
Security fob.

1312
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,220
Presumably digitized it.

1313
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:36,860
Yeah.

1314
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:42,380
I, you know, the, the, I had to give the Royal Majesty makers credit.

1315
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,820
They do like a lot of interaction.

1316
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,100
They do a lot of improv with the audience and the family and stuff.

1317
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:53,980
But I do like Merlin, like when Merlin is doing it, he clearly always picks a dad first.

1318
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,100
It's always a dad.

1319
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,980
Big brawny guy.

1320
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,460
You don't know the shtick of the show that they'll be.

1321
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:02,140
Yeah, they pick a strong guy to try to pull the sword out of the stone.

1322
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:05,820
And he fails, but they end up telling, you know, maybe you could be a bodyguard.

1323
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,140
You could be like the guy who protects the king.

1324
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,980
But I think the king is somebody else.

1325
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,460
It is in the long history.

1326
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,660
It is trying to embarrass your dad.

1327
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,660
That is what another entry.

1328
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,300
It's a hit.

1329
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,860
And you can add it one time.

1330
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:25,180
You could see it in French, Chinese, English, around the world.

1331
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:29,340
Dads of all countries were being embarrassed regularly daily.

1332
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:29,900
Daily.

1333
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,980
By Merlin or these merry makers.

1334
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:36,220
And then Merlin pulls out a stick, a Y-shaped stick, which I learned.

1335
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,420
I always wonder what that's called.

1336
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,660
A drowsing rod or a divining rod.

1337
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,540
Will you look for water with a stick on the beach?

1338
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:48,860
It's a pseudo science that these people used it to look for water, for ore, for minerals.

1339
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,300
That feels like a thing you would have used as a child.

1340
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,060
To try to find.

1341
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,980
Your first toy was a divining rod.

1342
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,140
Yeah, to find treasure on the beach.

1343
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:58,860
I'll say this.

1344
00:59:58,860 --> 00:59:59,980
It eased it a lot.

1345
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,220
It was a lot of 90s kids cartoons.

1346
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:02,460
Yeah.

1347
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,420
Like divining rod.

1348
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,700
Like, yeah.

1349
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:09,820
And I was looking for treasure on the beach.

1350
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:10,220
Yeah.

1351
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,020
I mean, I always was jealous of the metal detector guys.

1352
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,740
I feel like I never see metal detector guys in the beach.

1353
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,860
Only in movies.

1354
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,340
They're like.

1355
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,580
I saw all the time growing up, but now I really see.

1356
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,300
Because I never saw.

1357
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,380
In the Jersey Shore, I'd see them all the time.

1358
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:24,940
Really?

1359
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:25,660
Yeah.

1360
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,780
Metal detector guys.

1361
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,620
Metal detectors cost a fortune.

1362
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,940
And what were they looking for in the Jersey Shore beach?

1363
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:31,820
Money.

1364
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,180
Hoffa.

1365
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:33,980
Treasure.

1366
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,980
Shimming off his metallic corpse.

1367
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,180
Sea glass.

1368
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:37,900
Sea glass.

1369
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,500
Sea glass.

1370
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,100
I don't think shells would come up.

1371
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,740
So like they were just looking for change.

1372
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,240
Yeah.

1373
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,940
But a metal detector and a scooper.

1374
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,180
Because you have to have a sifter, scooper sort of thing.

1375
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,860
Or else you're bending down all the time.

1376
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,020
Every now and then.

1377
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,100
It's not a good plan to riches.

1378
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:00,460
Pieces of ships or I think people thought they'd find the balloons or something.

1379
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:06,060
If you were a metal detector guy or kid growing up, tweet at us.

1380
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,100
Let us know please.

1381
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,300
If you have a plan.

1382
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,580
What was the plan?

1383
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:12,060
And what was your greatest bounty that you found?

1384
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:17,260
Which, yeah, somebody might really surprise us too.

1385
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:19,500
We'll be eating crow soon enough.

1386
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,660
Yeah, because it wasn't like a gold detector.

1387
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,940
I found a Rolls Royce.

1388
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:25,020
It fell off of a ship.

1389
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,420
Quickly barely any water damage.

1390
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,300
That was something I saw as a kid.

1391
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,500
Someone finds a car.

1392
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,380
They dig up a car.

1393
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,780
Nothing found with a metal detector.

1394
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:36,700
That'd be the dream.

1395
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,140
I think I used a divining rod though as a kid.

1396
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,020
I do think I pretended that that worked.

1397
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,940
But Merlin had good pantomime skills with the divining rod.

1398
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,100
Because he really makes it look like it's leaning him.

1399
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,260
As opposed to the other way around.

1400
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,780
The Merlin performers were pretty great.

1401
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:55,900
I think they had to cut muster.

1402
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:01,340
I ended up on a website, a blog, Confessions of a Walt Disney World Merlin.

1403
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:05,820
Where he details the audition process and the training.

1404
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,540
And that you couldn't really go do it in the park.

1405
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,060
They'd first train you for a while in a taped off area

1406
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,820
like you would in an audition setting.

1407
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,540
Like here's the exact dimensions of everything.

1408
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:20,220
And so you just pantomime it for a while backstage.

1409
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:24,380
And then you'd have to go like, all right, let's go run it from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m.

1410
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,940
Like when the when the parks closed.

1411
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,620
And then you'd be then you'd be given your officially awarded your hat

1412
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:34,540
and your divining rod and get to be a practicing Merlin.

1413
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,860
Why was that called Confessions of a Merlin?

1414
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,300
Was there anything like tawdry?

1415
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,020
Was there anything?

1416
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:40,940
Not at all.

1417
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:45,740
Other than that, other than the like potentially not the best treatment of the doves that.

1418
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,780
I just learned that Merlin would release.

1419
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,220
I just learned that anytime you ever release doves, they're going to die quickly

1420
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:56,300
because they're being put into captivity and they don't like they've been trained.

1421
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,980
So anytime doves are released in like a ceremony or something.

1422
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,660
Oh, you're throwing them into the wild.

1423
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,160
Yeah.

1424
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:06,060
Well, here he dictates to that.

1425
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,860
And let me read a little passage from an excellent article, by the way.

1426
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,540
Confessions of Walt Disney World Merlin.

1427
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:16,140
Just opening the hands might result in the bird just sitting there in the palm

1428
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,500
or casually dropping to the ground to search for French fries.

1429
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,780
So there had to be an upward thrust to let the bird know how to fly.

1430
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,100
You can't just say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1431
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,900
Yes, you have to throw the bird.

1432
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,980
Once the bird is thrown in the earliest days of the show,

1433
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,700
clever hawks circles near the castle,

1434
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:37,980
realizing that every hour Merlin would be releasing a free lunch.

1435
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,860
Hadn't thought of that.

1436
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,740
That's a good.

1437
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,180
That's a good thought.

1438
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:47,100
It was unclear how that situation was eventually resolved, he says.

1439
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,460
I wonder it wasn't.

1440
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:49,820
That's my head, it's realizing.

1441
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:53,900
But every bird I released says this Merlin flew safely back to their cage

1442
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,900
for a reward behind the Magic Kingdom.

1443
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,660
But how can that be?

1444
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,220
I don't know.

1445
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,740
Is he trying to absolve them sad?

1446
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,540
Does he know that every dove survived?

1447
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,260
Yeah, I don't think.

1448
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,300
The confessions you would think you would be like, yeah.

1449
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,460
And then they all they all died every time.

1450
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:10,940
An actor's life for me.

1451
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:13,660
You have to tell yourself stories so you can sleep at night, you know?

1452
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,020
Great absolves.

1453
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,220
That's how he washed his hands after writing this article,

1454
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:25,180
forgetting about all of the children whose arms broke as they lifted the heavy.

1455
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,340
They didn't release the button on time.

1456
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:31,020
Then the kids are like, just snap their shoulders clean off.

1457
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:34,060
Well, I saw a kid, I watched a video of a kid doing it

1458
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,100
and he pulled from the handles and it started to come up

1459
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,780
and then he just grabs the blade.

1460
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:40,300
And I was like, oh,

1461
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:45,900
King Colin is intense and he's very trusting that it doesn't.

1462
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,540
Very nice.

1463
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,220
Holmes did it.

1464
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:48,860
What did he get it?

1465
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,300
Yeah, he got it.

1466
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:50,940
OK, got it.

1467
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,140
It was already pretty much up.

1468
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,500
It doesn't come all the way out.

1469
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:57,740
I feel like as a kid, because you don't want a kid just waving a prop sword around.

1470
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:58,300
Of course not.

1471
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,380
But that is does feel unsatisfying.

1472
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:04,060
Today in Galaxy's Edge, this is possible around every corner.

1473
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:05,980
Yes, that's very true.

1474
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:10,780
Or I was got nailed by a kid who had the lightsaber like quiver.

1475
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:16,380
But he had it sideways, like around it, like he was going down a pathway

1476
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:22,460
with this like lightsaber thing falling off his shoulder and I wasn't nailing people.

1477
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,100
That's funny that you were hit by a kid with a lightsaber

1478
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,340
because I've been hit by several adults with lightsabers.

1479
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,180
Yes, I would believe that too.

1480
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:34,140
Yeah, with those black like cases for the blades.

1481
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:34,780
Yeah, yeah.

1482
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,280
Yeah.

1483
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,420
Not like they were swinging it at me.

1484
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:40,460
Not quite the dignified weapon that Obi-Wan.

1485
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,220
And we described it as.

1486
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:44,300
Watch it, grown lightsaber owners.

1487
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:51,180
The other, you wouldn't call this a confession, but I like the detail that Merlin had to

1488
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:55,420
greet kids, take photos, sign autographs after the show was done.

1489
01:05:55,420 --> 01:06:00,620
And a lot of kids, this being the early mid-90s, speaking of unpleasant IP,

1490
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:03,100
a lot of kids thought that he was the page master.

1491
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:04,240
Oh.

1492
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,220
The Macaulay Culkin movie one, right?

1493
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,380
Reference to Macaulay Culkin's lesser films.

1494
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:13,900
I've never seen that page master.

1495
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,340
Not to mention that what you were saying about the humor of the show,

1496
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:22,700
really a lot of it is a kid's chance to, for getting even with dad.

1497
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:27,500
I'm trying to get every Macaulay Culkin title into this episode.

1498
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:34,540
I had like page master toys and I definitely remember seeing a lot of ads for it and did not push.

1499
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:36,460
What was the premise of it again?

1500
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:39,580
He goes into a bunch of a live books or something.

1501
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:39,900
Yeah.

1502
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,340
Does he go into the books?

1503
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,540
This is only for us to know.

1504
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,860
I know Andrew Grissom likes the page mass.

1505
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:45,740
This is the Moog rules.

1506
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,860
Grissom a movie.

1507
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:47,740
Anyway, side note.

1508
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,780
He doesn't listen to the podcast though.

1509
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:51,100
He does.

1510
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,460
So I'm a little bit.

1511
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:58,380
I feel like the page master was trying to like, oh, people liked princess bride.

1512
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,060
Right.

1513
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:00,380
Right.

1514
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,540
Similar like kid gets a book read.

1515
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:03,900
I've never seen the princess.

1516
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:04,540
I haven't either.

1517
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,700
Oh my God.

1518
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:07,180
Oh yeah.

1519
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,900
I wasn't going to say anything, but since you went first.

1520
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,700
I'll say it.

1521
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,260
I'll say I'm not.

1522
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,260
I also don't like Goonies at all.

1523
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,980
Well, I've never, I don't think I've seen all Goonies either.

1524
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,820
People are going to be really mad now.

1525
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,860
I think there's enough anti-Goonie out there.

1526
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:28,140
I remember playing a Nintendo video game that I never got past like level two of Goonies on.

1527
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,100
There was a game of it?

1528
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:29,820
There was a game.

1529
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,780
You kept yo-yoing bad guys.

1530
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:33,740
I don't know.

1531
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,260
No offense if anyone likes Goonies.

1532
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,380
I just found it sort of abrasive and unpleasant.

1533
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:39,820
That's just me.

1534
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:40,700
I don't know.

1535
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:45,180
I like princess pride, but I am not like obsessed with it.

1536
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,540
Like people are.

1537
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:47,580
Yeah.

1538
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:48,060
There was.

1539
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,060
You got your wall of Sean and you're under the giant.

1540
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:50,700
I mean, for sure.

1541
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,820
What else could you want in a movie?

1542
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:57,580
But I think I get suspicious of very like movies that are like should like shown at

1543
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:01,260
midnight with like revival Hollywood forever ways all the time.

1544
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:02,300
Maybe I do.

1545
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,340
I have a bias or sorry.

1546
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:05,420
I just like don't take the time to check them out.

1547
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:10,220
If I didn't grow up with it, I'm sure that one's probably great at being Rob Reiner.

1548
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:10,860
And yeah, it is.

1549
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:11,580
It is good.

1550
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:12,220
Yeah, it is good.

1551
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,300
I don't want to even downplay that too much.

1552
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,420
Yeah, I was looking at page.

1553
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,420
I got bored looking at the page master wiki.

1554
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,180
It's so exciting.

1555
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,620
There's like a kid with like he's like he doesn't want to learn.

1556
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:27,980
And I think then he goes and meets the page master and he likes to learn after that.

1557
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:32,860
I feel like there was a big trend in 90s entertainment of like we got to get the

1558
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:37,340
kids off the TV and the video games and teach them about books.

1559
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:40,540
And I can only imagine that's even harder nowadays.

1560
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,140
Yeah, probably.

1561
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,380
I just saw I mean, Christopher Lloyd was the page master, though.

1562
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,140
So now it's got that tension a little bit.

1563
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,420
I loved Camp Nowhere.

1564
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:51,820
He was the adult.

1565
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:52,460
All the polls.

1566
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,780
He was the adult in Camp Nowhere.

1567
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,940
Well, I didn't even reference the future.

1568
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:58,700
UPN's Deadly Games.

1569
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:00,860
Sebastian Jackal.

1570
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,460
That's my favorite Lloyd performance.

1571
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,340
That's your Lloyd.

1572
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,700
Christopher Lloyd's like on Instagram now and I follow him and he just goes to all the cons.

1573
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:12,140
And I don't I don't believe he's actually posting because he'll just like post like

1574
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,340
back to the future memes.

1575
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:16,220
Yeah, and that might be corporatized.

1576
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:16,700
Yeah.

1577
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:17,740
But anyway, good to see him.

1578
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:18,700
Good to see him out there.

1579
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,620
He's live action in Page Master too.

1580
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1581
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,140
He's to the dual role.

1582
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:22,620
Yeah, I see.

1583
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,020
I see.

1584
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:23,520
Okay.

1585
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,680
And Phil Hartman is a slender and violent pirate.

1586
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,680
Slender and violent.

1587
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,160
Interesting.

1588
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,280
Patrick Stewart in there too.

1589
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,120
Great people.

1590
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:33,360
Yeah.

1591
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:33,680
All right.

1592
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,040
We're going to do a double feature of Page Master and Rock-A-Doodle.

1593
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,320
We might be in our words.

1594
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,240
Love both of these films.

1595
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,560
What else about Stewart and the Sto- Oh, did you see characters?

1596
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,840
There's videos of Pinocchio tries to pull the sword.

1597
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,960
Peter Pan.

1598
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,000
Flynn Rider.

1599
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,920
Flynn Rider?

1600
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,840
Flynn Rider from Tangled.

1601
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,440
I was going to say like from Tron.

1602
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,280
That's a different Flynn.

1603
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,880
Oh my God, if Flynn from Tron was in a fantasy land.

1604
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,000
And then his lasers.

1605
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,640
Wow.

1606
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,120
Oh yeah.

1607
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,720
That would be awesome.

1608
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:12,320
And then apparently every YouTuber, a lot of YouTubers, a lot of videos of like,

1609
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,400
I tried to pull the sword and I didn't.

1610
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,760
Like backpack people?

1611
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,520
Uh.

1612
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,240
Like backpack.

1613
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,680
Like, hey, what's up guys?

1614
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,080
People.

1615
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:20,400
Okay.

1616
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,680
Just in general.

1617
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,120
There's a lot of the-

1618
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,320
Which why not do it?

1619
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,760
I assume you haven't pulled the sword out of the stone, but if you have photos, I would imagine.

1620
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,080
I have photos.

1621
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,840
I think I have adult photos with it.

1622
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,040
I do think it's fun.

1623
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,800
I'm sad they don't do it at Disneyland.

1624
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,760
I think it's a little bit of like-

1625
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,720
I really liked the show.

1626
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,920
I think it's charming.

1627
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,760
If you're a kid who likes magic and stuff, it's like, it's not a full on magic show,

1628
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,480
but you get the fun.

1629
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:47,200
He like, he has his bag and then he turns it upside down and shows you there's nothing in the bag,

1630
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,600
but then he's magically able to pull stuff out of it.

1631
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,880
Larry Poppins style.

1632
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,360
Yeah.

1633
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:51,680
Yeah.

1634
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:57,120
I saw one where like the kid gets a proclamation, rolled up proclamation and the medal,

1635
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,920
like a medallion, and then the video cuts out and then they're eating in a restaurant

1636
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,360
in Alice from Alice in Wonderland.

1637
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,520
It's like, you were the ruler for it.

1638
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,120
She got so excited to see he had pulled the sword from the stone.

1639
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:09,840
Oh.

1640
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,080
I think that's very charming.

1641
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:12,800
They would do that.

1642
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,920
They'd keep it up a little bit.

1643
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,640
Play along.

1644
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,680
A reputation.

1645
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,160
The thing that doesn't seem to happen in Star Wars.

1646
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:18,320
Right.

1647
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:18,640
Yeah.

1648
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,520
That's what they've claimed.

1649
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:19,840
Yeah.

1650
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,840
No, it is.

1651
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,880
It does feel like I guess they stopped doing it a while ago, but it is the type of thing that

1652
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,520
goes away, especially during budget cuts.

1653
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,680
And like it is the stuff that really like makes the park feel extra good.

1654
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,040
Like they're getting rid of this Pixar.

1655
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,720
What's the, what's the band?

1656
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,520
The Philharmonic.

1657
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,160
The Philharmonic.

1658
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,280
The Pixar thing.

1659
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:39,780
Or some.

1660
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:40,800
Yeah.

1661
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,280
It's some fun name.

1662
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:41,440
Yeah.

1663
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,800
The Pixarmonic.

1664
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:43,440
Pixarmonic.

1665
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:48,160
That's a fun little thing over on Pixar Pier when these, the musicians play those songs and

1666
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:48,720
that sucks.

1667
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,520
That's going away.

1668
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:49,920
What else?

1669
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,480
They're cutting the.

1670
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,120
Oh, the Hoopty Doo show.

1671
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:53,280
Right.

1672
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,400
Which you just saw.

1673
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,200
Which I just saw.

1674
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,440
I didn't realize they were running something at the time.

1675
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,600
And like, yeah, walked right in.

1676
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,320
It was mostly people, tired people eating chicken fingers.

1677
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,480
And I was like the only one sitting like in the balcony.

1678
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,200
Like great view of the stage.

1679
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,240
Good job, guys.

1680
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:10,960
Good job.

1681
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,200
Slew foot Sue.

1682
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:14,560
Yeah.

1683
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,920
These little like, I mean, it's actually tying it into current events.

1684
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:23,600
If there is this feeling that why aren't the little like fun street shows happening on Batuu

1685
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,760
that you might have expected.

1686
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,720
I, yeah, I agree.

1687
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:30,880
These things are not, and they are little, they aren't like necessary and the park survives

1688
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:35,760
without them, but it is, it's great color indeed to end the idea that there's magic

1689
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,800
around any corner.

1690
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,360
And this being an especially magical little show.

1691
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:39,520
Yeah.

1692
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,360
Like running into shows is fun.

1693
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,760
Like running, like turning a corner and going, oh, what the heck?

1694
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,720
Oh, that's cool.

1695
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,120
Oh yeah.

1696
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,200
Well, and then, you know, like push the trash can or something.

1697
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:51,760
Or like the percussion guys who you think they're janitors and then they start playing

1698
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:56,880
those things where you don't even realize a show is occurring and you're swept up into it.

1699
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:02,080
And I have to say, I don't think like a lot, I don't think Universal has something like,

1700
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:07,200
there's no, like I wish there was a thing in Universal where you could fake throw chum

1701
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,040
into water and summon jaws.

1702
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,960
Then they end, they give you a short sleeve turtleneck and a pack of smokes.

1703
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,720
And you're a chief Brody now.

1704
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,320
That would have been what I liked as a kid.

1705
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,960
You pull jaws magic tooth.

1706
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:21,200
Yeah.

1707
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:26,560
One of the teeth is magic and one of the teeth is magic and they release whatever tooth the kid picks.

1708
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,120
Yeah.

1709
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,400
Congratulations.

1710
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,120
You have to temporarily deal with the mayor.

1711
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,200
You're the deputy mayor of Amity Island.

1712
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,120
Are open, but should they be?

1713
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,000
But you decide, you decide wrong.

1714
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,720
People will die.

1715
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,680
People will die.

1716
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,960
Discuss next year's lifeguard budget.

1717
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,160
It's July 4th.

1718
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,200
We can't close.

1719
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,200
That's most of the summer right there.

1720
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,600
You might be wanting to protect people, but you'll do, the mayor is going to tell you why

1721
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,080
you're wrong.

1722
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,600
He's look, he's been in there for a while and he knows what he's doing.

1723
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,400
So, you know, sit with him, but maybe just agree with him.

1724
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,160
Just do what he says.

1725
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:04,640
Just don't.

1726
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:04,880
Yeah.

1727
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,920
You can't fight city hall.

1728
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,720
Thinks they know how to govern Amity until they're put in the chair.

1729
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,200
Yeah.

1730
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:18,320
You'd be good at writing like the campaign for this is the reason to keep this mayor.

1731
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,320
I forget his name, but the existing mayor of, of Amity.

1732
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,440
These are all good.

1733
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,360
Larry the one was the actor.

1734
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:25,680
Okay.

1735
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:27,440
Yeah.

1736
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,640
These are all good campaign.

1737
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,120
This is very like, don't change horses midstream.

1738
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:32,640
Oh yeah.

1739
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,200
Just come on.

1740
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:33,520
Yeah.

1741
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,800
He knows he is still the mayor in jaws too.

1742
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,320
I saw someone point out a while back.

1743
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,840
He's still the mayor.

1744
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:45,760
Is he, is a hologram of him, the mayor in jaws 12 and the future too,

1745
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,400
whatever number it is, I've really got it wrong.

1746
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:48,640
Yeah.

1747
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,800
It's all the same.

1748
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,000
Hollow Brody.

1749
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,880
Hollow Brody.

1750
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,160
I never thought about how I'd like to see all of jaws.

1751
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,120
Whatever just nine.

1752
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:01,680
What is it?

1753
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:06,400
That would be the, that would be the area where like how we're getting like IP overload.

1754
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,440
That would be the area where you would then get like way on board.

1755
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:10,240
I feel like Scott.

1756
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:10,640
Yes.

1757
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:15,520
That's one that I would bid on is can I do all of hologram jaws?

1758
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,360
The hologram jaws from back to the future too, we're going to make that.

1759
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,800
And it's going to look like that.

1760
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,760
And it's going to look like that.

1761
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,920
He's going to be all digitized and picked like he's going to,

1762
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,400
it's going to be like TV static when he rises out of the water.

1763
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,120
Yes.

1764
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,200
Like that's, that's where the, uh, uh, choking on IP will get you.

1765
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,920
You can get that micro targeted.

1766
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,200
Oh, hell yeah.

1767
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,200
I would love some micro targeting of just a line of menswear, uh,

1768
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:44,720
based on Richard Dreyfus's character, which is most of the clothes I owned for colder,

1769
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:51,600
uh, fall weather look like, uh, no, he's got like the gray varsity shirt and like beat up jeans and

1770
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,640
a blue beanie.

1771
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,080
Oh God.

1772
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,360
Do you have a blue beanie?

1773
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,360
You got to get a blue beanie.

1774
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,400
I think I do.

1775
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:58,880
You do.

1776
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,120
Well, you gave me one.

1777
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,080
Did I?

1778
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,400
That's kind of like you ordered you like once you were like, do you want this winter cap?

1779
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,120
Do you want this beat?

1780
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,160
Like I, I, that's not as much of a beanie.

1781
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,200
That's a more winter hat.

1782
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,480
I see right through this.

1783
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:17,680
You buy Jason dress up clothes, just like Duffy summer Jason.

1784
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,720
I did get that backpack at an army surplus store.

1785
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:23,680
They did have beanies at the counter, but I was like, oh, two warm outs.

1786
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:27,280
I think a little bit more like smaller.

1787
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,000
That's my feeling.

1788
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,640
I like a beanie, but yeah, it's a winter hat.

1789
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:31,440
Yeah.

1790
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,600
Amazon sent me two of them.

1791
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:33,760
Yeah.

1792
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,160
So I gave him a gray, the gray winter hat, but it's not so much.

1793
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,160
It's not a full on Richard Dreyfus costume.

1794
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,280
You don't think it qualifies?

1795
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,320
No, I don't think so.

1796
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,920
But yeah, I think we, I think we can put on the Twitter side by side comparison of

1797
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,760
Dreyfus and jaws and your look like to see if we can get it pretty close.

1798
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,040
I have it pretty close.

1799
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,480
I have it pretty close.

1800
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,280
It's a pretty easy menswear like beat up jeans, varsity gray.

1801
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:06,800
Sweatshirt scruffy facial hair trainer, like canvas sneakers.

1802
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,080
By the way, I've just been lost in the jaws.

1803
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:10,560
3D.

1804
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,000
Yeah, I'm thinking about it already.

1805
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,560
It's jaws.

1806
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,920
Jaws 19 is the, is the movie I was, I was coming up short, but it's yeah.

1807
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,560
Jaws 19 and the only, my take when I go in and pitch the take, it is just,

1808
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,600
it's just Jaws, but you just put the hollow before everything.

1809
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,480
We have to get on the hollow orca, the whole orca.

1810
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,600
We got to, we got to drop.

1811
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,240
Holla chum.

1812
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:30,960
That's all I got.

1813
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:35,840
What could you, how fast can you get a meeting with some Mechis for this?

1814
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,920
Do you have to even get it approved through him?

1815
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,640
I'm not sure.

1816
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:38,800
Yeah.

1817
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,080
This might be outside of it.

1818
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,280
This might be outside of it.

1819
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,520
Now suddenly I'm the plunderer trying to do extra back to the future, but not that like

1820
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,640
Martin's story is done.

1821
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,640
Jaws doesn't have the Mechis involved at all.

1822
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:49,680
But back to the future does.

1823
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,640
Oh, back to the future.

1824
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,120
Oh, jaws 19 is the, okay yeah.

1825
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,960
I think sort of even though they made a ton of.

1826
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,640
Producer credit on back to the future.

1827
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,200
Is that a steal?

1828
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,760
Yeah.

1829
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,800
But I think Spielberg is still gatekeeping jaws franchise, even though they made tons of jaws.

1830
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:08,160
This is dicey because yeah, jaws is a whole other property from back to the future.

1831
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,120
Universal owns all of it.

1832
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,080
But yeah, I don't want everybody to have to sign off on everything, but we're dealing

1833
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,040
with digital stuff.

1834
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,120
So can the A be replaced by a one?

1835
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:19,120
It's still, you'd say it out loud jaws, but it's a one instead of an A.

1836
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,920
That just seems like a prequel.

1837
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:22,400
What's that?

1838
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,520
That sounds like a prequel to me.

1839
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,160
Now you're right.

1840
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:24,800
Huh, huh.

1841
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,240
I'm just feeling out options.

1842
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,040
Like how can I get.

1843
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,360
But also maybe Spielberg's not so precious about it to the fact where you could do this.

1844
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,240
Like he doesn't want maybe a full on reboot of jaws.

1845
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,840
If this isn't a perfect quibi property, then I don't know.

1846
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,880
It's perfect for quibi.

1847
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,600
This is exactly what.

1848
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,280
How does the Benchley estate feel?

1849
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,960
I mean, they're probably chomping at the bit for a little more jaws.

1850
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,200
Yeah.

1851
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:45,840
Religals.

1852
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:51,760
And they'll feel great when I tell a tale of digital horrors and.

1853
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,040
Sure.

1854
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,360
Also in the jaws novel.

1855
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,040
The Dreyfus's character sleeps with Brody's wife.

1856
01:18:59,040 --> 01:18:59,840
Oh, right, right.

1857
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,640
Well, this holo Dreyfus.

1858
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,080
Oh, yeah.

1859
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,400
Mrs. Hall of Mrs. Hall of Brody.

1860
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:06,480
Yeah.

1861
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,080
Do you foresee it being like a reboot style graphics kind of, or like.

1862
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:10,880
It's exactly.

1863
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,600
It's from the.

1864
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,800
Exactly what Marty.

1865
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,760
When it eats him.

1866
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,320
Encounters.

1867
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:18,800
But and so also obviously it would look if you were in the audience,

1868
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,600
every individual audience member, it looks like jaws is rising up from a really small

1869
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:28,240
source point and then getting bigger and bigger as he goes and he's going to bite you.

1870
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:29,680
Are there any other.

1871
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,240
And then he disappears in a way where only his eyeballs remain.

1872
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:33,600
Right.

1873
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,320
Man, I.

1874
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,240
This is this is what I was.

1875
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,120
That is your dream.

1876
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:37,680
I do.

1877
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,360
For years you've been like, everyone's doing IPs and now we've actually.

1878
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,400
Had your perfect.

1879
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,680
Nothing but complaints, but I just hadn't seen the light and it took

1880
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:51,440
Sword and the Stone to get there and I've.

1881
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,240
My mental sword has been pulled out of my stone and now all the synapses are firing.

1882
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:58,720
I don't know.

1883
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,440
I think you could.

1884
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,960
I think with Spielberg, you could get him in on this take because it's so

1885
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,480
far out from actually being like a totally new jaws.

1886
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,600
And he's look, it's like it fits right alongside Ready Player One.

1887
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,320
We're re contextualizing back to the future things.

1888
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:12,720
Yes.

1889
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,720
You're right that it's Spielberg controls both.

1890
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,480
Spielberg is also back to the future.

1891
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,880
So he's the he's the who I gotta talk to.

1892
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,040
Yeah.

1893
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:23,120
And I think he's back as always is the one vocally like protecting back to the future.

1894
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,800
I feel like Spielberg might be as well, but he's always the one that's like,

1895
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,040
we're all going to have to be dead before they make a new one.

1896
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,560
Yeah, but this is totally different.

1897
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,320
I would never step on the story of Marty and Doc and Jules and Vern.

1898
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,040
That story is done and it's perfect, especially Jules and Vern, especially Vern touching his dick.

1899
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:47,040
But this this is its whole I want to see what Marty didn't get to see.

1900
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:47,440
Right.

1901
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:51,840
He was busy having to stop that unspecified thing at the Cafe 80s.

1902
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,480
This may have unlocked your whole like future in Hollywood.

1903
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,040
Just in general, there are other movies you like where there's movies inside of those movies that you could make.

1904
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,840
Like there this could be a whole genre for you.

1905
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:04,560
There have to be.

1906
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,120
I could make I'd like to make a lot of the shows that you see within Stay Tuned, the John Ritter,

1907
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:14,400
because there's a lot of like demonic versions of like Married with Demons.

1908
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,800
I don't remember what they actually are, but this that one.

1909
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,560
I'd make all the Stay Tuned movies.

1910
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:18,960
Right.

1911
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,440
That one might not be as a flashy of a pitch.

1912
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:26,800
No, but still pretty kind of more indulgent stuff I can do after Jaws 19 is a huge hit.

1913
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,760
Huge hit.

1914
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:32,000
And we would have to you would have to if you took maybe you just make a deal with the AMC theaters

1915
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,160
and you convert every AMC into a holomax.

1916
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,640
You mod it out.

1917
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,240
You put the words holomax on it.

1918
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:43,360
At the very least, just put the words on it like a promotion like when 7-Eleven was spring or was a

1919
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,160
quickie mart for a while.

1920
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:44,640
Exactly.

1921
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,600
People would be so excited.

1922
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,400
This is the most Instagrammable opportunity.

1923
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,480
We should just again, this is something we should just cut out and you should just file this away.

1924
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,080
Because what if somebody else does it?

1925
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:54,640
Yeah.

1926
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:59,120
What if I were to tell you there is an announced doesn't seem like it's far along,

1927
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,440
but announced live action sword of the stone.

1928
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,520
That's that's very believable.

1929
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,280
From a writer of Game of Thrones and the director of 28 Weeks Later.

1930
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,120
OK.

1931
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:14,080
So that's apparently happening, but enough that IMDB does not have a lot of information.

1932
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,960
One thing we know that movie is going to be full of shitty effects.

1933
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,240
And so all all movies are shitty effects.

1934
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:25,280
What's great about Jaws 19 is it just owned it doesn't be like, oh, like,

1935
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,440
let's not try to make this look photorealistic.

1936
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,280
Let's just be shitty.

1937
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,960
Am I wrong, though, that it kind of look reminds me of reboot from the 90s?

1938
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:33,440
It's a little bit.

1939
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:38,320
And it's just a little more translucent polygons, which is going to help you get this done so much quicker.

1940
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:38,820
Right.

1941
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,080
It's going to be quick.

1942
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,600
It's going to be a quick process.

1943
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,880
90s nostalgia is like a thing right now.

1944
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,160
I feel like we're seeing that.

1945
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:46,800
Yeah, absolutely.

1946
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,720
Well, and there's been so they brought that they brought Marty's self lacing shoes back.

1947
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,600
And so, you know, the future Pepsi is back.

1948
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,080
Yeah.

1949
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,400
Oh, yeah.

1950
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,640
You've been able to get those bottles and yeah.

1951
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,120
And that was, you know, I have an almanac at home.

1952
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,000
Like, there's so many, you know, especially this movie so fetish.

1953
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,920
Nobody's it's time to make the full time to make the full jaws.

1954
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,720
Oh, man.

1955
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:11,280
And the mute, the score is just you just run the John Williams score through.

1956
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,320
You just make it a midi.

1957
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:13,840
Oh, yeah.

1958
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,360
Score's done.

1959
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:18,640
Oh, my God.

1960
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:23,120
Who knew Sword and the Stone was going to unlock so much chicken the rest of my career.

1961
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,200
You're going to be the king of the realm.

1962
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,040
Remix the realm of I was going to say Hollywood, but really hollow, hollow.

1963
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,240
Well,

1964
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:36,960
that is no joke.

1965
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,960
No, that makes a lot of schmoozing.

1966
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:40,560
Both go.

1967
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:46,800
OK, I do have I do have a quick other thing about certain stone, though.

1968
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,760
Well, first of all, you know, Mikey was saying it's such a like wonderful detail.

1969
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,480
And it's those little details that make Disneyland magical.

1970
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:58,800
I don't know if you could credit him specifically, but this sort of the stone was put in along with

1971
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,160
Tony Baxter's 1983 fantasy land overlay.

1972
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:09,520
And I dug out my ticket magazine that made me aware of Mr. Baxter as a kid.

1973
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,880
And he talks in that.

1974
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,640
I'll just read a quote.

1975
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,920
You know, with all the work we did on the dark ride exteriors, do you know which detail

1976
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,360
the guests noticed the most?

1977
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,680
It's the sword and the stone by the carousel.

1978
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,520
And that's probably the cheapest and easiest thing we put in there.

1979
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:28,240
That was just an afterthought as a way of giving some theming integrity to King Arthur's carousel.

1980
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:28,720
Yeah.

1981
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:32,480
Because there's no other representation of the sword in the stone world.

1982
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,400
So they like expanded it out a little bit.

1983
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,520
Everybody looks at every photographs that stands around with their kids.

1984
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,560
And they're in this courtyard surrounded by some of the most wonderful themed detailing

1985
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,200
we've ever done.

1986
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,520
And yet that's the thing that everybody goes to.

1987
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,080
It's this weird.

1988
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:44,960
It's the centerpiece.

1989
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:52,400
It's like the like the the hull of the ship, the mermaid on the ship.

1990
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:56,720
You're looking at that as opposed to it's like Dreamer's Point that Walt the statue

1991
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,760
wall laying out at.

1992
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:03,440
It is interesting because like it is I do think something about like pulling the sword

1993
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:08,160
out of the stone, whether even you've seen the movie or not, there is something that

1994
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,440
like draws you to it.

1995
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:14,240
There's something like very iconic about it, whether you actually have that in your brain

1996
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:14,560
or not.

1997
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,600
Like, I don't know.

1998
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,480
I don't know what it is.

1999
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:23,040
I don't know if it's like myth, just general myth that we've all like, you know, been raised

2000
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,640
on or something where you're like, I wonder if I could do like, I wonder what it is.

2001
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:31,760
I mean, I think a sword in general, whether it's like, you know, Zelda, you know, that's

2002
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,160
a very like a thing we've all have in our heads from playing like Zelda for our whole

2003
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:36,880
lives.

2004
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:42,320
So I wonder if it's like so much sword iconography in our brains and it's such a perfectly

2005
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,120
placed little thing.

2006
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:51,680
I have to think that was in Tony Baxter's mind when designing the Paris park, because

2007
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:59,280
from when I watched the video of them doing the certain stone show in Paris, it is center

2008
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,320
behind the castle.

2009
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,840
It is right behind the castle.

2010
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,160
And you can watch it from the balcony and notice that people on multiple tiers watching

2011
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:06,320
it.

2012
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,240
Huge place of prominence.

2013
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,000
It's more complex rock work.

2014
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,200
More complex rock work.

2015
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,760
Merlin has like an Igor style helper.

2016
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:15,680
That's a good character.

2017
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:15,920
Wow.

2018
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:16,160
Yeah.

2019
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:24,720
But I think also, you know, the legends of King Arthur, if you go back to like British

2020
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:30,720
history and European history and monarchy, all those countries just kind of all those

2021
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,480
monarchies just blend together.

2022
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,560
Like, I don't really understand it very well.

2023
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,520
I've seen Mary Queen of Scots, a very boring movie, but like the British royal family is

2024
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,240
related to the French monarchies related to German.

2025
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,760
It's very complex.

2026
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,040
But you don't got to think about all that shit.

2027
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,560
Well, you just got to pull a sword.

2028
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,680
But really given a center of prominence, the Paris park.

2029
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,400
I also think it's interesting, like the whole like, am I worthy?

2030
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,480
There's some weird psychological thing with that.

2031
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,840
And that shows up a lot in myths, you know, Thor's hammer or whatever.

2032
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,280
It's like, are you special?

2033
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,480
Really is what the question is.

2034
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:10,240
So like the question, are you going to win the lottery?

2035
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:10,800
Like there's a.

2036
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:12,880
Hero's journey shit.

2037
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,120
Yeah, something in all of our brains.

2038
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:15,680
Sure.

2039
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:21,360
It's very funny in the American versions with Merlin when he gets a crowd to chant,

2040
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,360
all hail King Colin.

2041
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,120
Hip hip hooray.

2042
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,360
All hail King Rider.

2043
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,200
Perfectly mundane name.

2044
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:37,120
You know, really quick also that reminded me that there's I was trying to remember,

2045
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:42,000
isn't one of the doesn't one of the TGA of sitcoms have a thing where they go to Disney

2046
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,800
World and then and like I was thinking, is it Michelle on Full House pulls the sword

2047
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,680
out of the stone and then she's the she's the ruler of the realm and they take it more seriously

2048
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,200
and she actually gets to issue commands and Stephanie's mad.

2049
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,200
I was wrong.

2050
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,160
What it is where they made up a thing that did not exist anywhere else,

2051
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,920
but is a good idea of a show.

2052
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,720
I think they were trying to cross promote a Latin.

2053
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:11,840
So there is a thing where you rubbed a big lamp and if you if you rubbed the lamp and a

2054
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,200
genie came out, then you're the ruler of Disneyland.

2055
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,400
And that's what they use the float from the Aladdin parade at the time.

2056
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:20,800
Smart.

2057
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,600
I remember this.

2058
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,560
Now, yeah.

2059
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,060
Yeah.

2060
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,720
I had the faintest memory of this and I knew you would have it.

2061
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:27,600
Yep.

2062
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:27,680
Yeah.

2063
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:28,000
Yeah.

2064
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,400
Like you are you like something with the something with the ruler of Disney.

2065
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,440
I even wonder if the writers were like, what if they use what if we use that certain the

2066
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,000
stone thing and they're like, yeah, we'd rather you know, needs to be a Latin.

2067
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:45,360
We got to look at which offers a fun little crossover where DJ's story is that she really

2068
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,080
wants to see Steve Scott Wenger.

2069
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:48,800
Right.

2070
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,720
And she's like seeing him all over.

2071
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:55,760
She sees him as Indiana Jones in the stunt show and she sees him as Aladdin,

2072
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,760
but he is the voice of Aladdin.

2073
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,400
He is a lot.

2074
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,360
You get to see the voice dressed as Aladdin.

2075
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,160
Whoa.

2076
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,000
Very special universe collapsing moment for sure.

2077
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,160
But they're they're very like they're they're big.

2078
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,680
It's like a lot of legalese even in this episode moment like and you and like this.

2079
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:16,800
We don't do this all the time.

2080
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,600
I think like I have to like Aladdin chic guy has to say like, no, we don't ever do this and

2081
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,120
we won't do it if you at home.

2082
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,960
I come to see this.

2083
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,640
Come but just to be here.

2084
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:27,840
Come to the don't expect.

2085
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,400
Look, the magical day is your award.

2086
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,600
If you're lucky, you'll get a royal medallion.

2087
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,200
That was an older show I saw.

2088
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,520
Colin receives the royal medallion.

2089
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:42,720
Dad gets the memory which hit which got a big laugh.

2090
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:43,520
So that's a joke.

2091
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,400
And that's a joke.

2092
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,120
And you know what?

2093
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:48,880
I thought that was your joke and I liked the joke and realizing that that was a yeah.

2094
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,160
Hey, they were funny.

2095
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:50,400
Yeah.

2096
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,280
No, Merlin.

2097
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,960
Merlin lands that laugh.

2098
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,480
You would get something though.

2099
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,600
That's the last thing I have.

2100
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,120
You would get a medal and you would get like a royal proclamation.

2101
01:29:59,120 --> 01:29:59,600
Yeah.

2102
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:04,000
Can we look and see on eBay if these are available?

2103
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,520
Well, here, look it up.

2104
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:13,280
The other joke that I like legitimately is that Merlin implies that well, first of all,

2105
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:19,680
the bird will choose who will be taking part in the ceremony and they release the bird.

2106
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,800
The bird just leaves.

2107
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,080
The bird doesn't pick anybody.

2108
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,560
Oh, yeah.

2109
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,280
And that's funny.

2110
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:28,000
And then Merlin says like, well, that's all for the better because if the bird picks you,

2111
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:28,720
you'll know it.

2112
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,640
And he wipes something off of his shoulder.

2113
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:31,440
Solid.

2114
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,960
Implication that's yeah.

2115
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:33,840
Solid joke.

2116
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,200
I think you can cut if you're looking to save money, you can cut the bird.

2117
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,840
I don't think you necessarily need the bird.

2118
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,200
And the birds are equity.

2119
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,320
So they're getting.

2120
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:46,160
17 seeds an hour.

2121
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:50,560
You can get genuine rare vintage Disney World Merlin Sword in the Stone medallion.

2122
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,400
$45.

2123
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,360
Buy it now.

2124
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,880
$5 shipping.

2125
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,760
And it is like it looks like a solid little piece.

2126
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:58,880
But you didn't earn it.

2127
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:06,320
But this is this is like this is like Harrison Hightower, Stolen Valor.

2128
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,280
Yeah, that's true.

2129
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,920
I feel like the majesty makers aren't giving out.

2130
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:10,880
That's pretty good, though.

2131
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,360
It says on the back in the royal lettering, like temporary ruler of the realm.

2132
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:16,320
Sure.

2133
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:16,800
It's funny.

2134
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,080
It's up to you to decide Brexit.

2135
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,720
No deal or will you get an extension?

2136
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,040
Temporary.

2137
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,800
The next John Oliver will be railing about you for 18 minutes.

2138
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,120
Oh, there's a Disneyland one for $2.95.

2139
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,760
And it's a different design.

2140
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,440
And it just has says sort of the sword in the stone.

2141
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,760
And then on the back, it just says Disneyland happiest place.

2142
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,880
Kind of breaks the reality a little.

2143
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,320
Yeah, a little less special.

2144
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,200
Doesn't say it doesn't refer to your role in all of this.

2145
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:49,440
Right.

2146
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,120
But there's not many of these on here.

2147
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,800
There's only like a couple.

2148
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:58,080
Any listeners, if you were selected as temporary ruler of the realm, let us know.

2149
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,600
How did your day go?

2150
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,080
Did it give you false confidence?

2151
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,240
Did you go back to school after the vacation?

2152
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:05,520
Yeah.

2153
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,040
Are you a jerk to everybody?

2154
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,000
Do you feel bad about it?

2155
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:08,720
Have you atoned?

2156
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:10,880
Have you called the people that you wronged?

2157
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:17,200
I hope not, because Merlin taught Arthur that you should not be cocky and you should not.

2158
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,880
You should think before you act was the big lessons.

2159
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,880
You're really listening to Merlin.

2160
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:23,280
Yeah.

2161
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,160
And we jerk.

2162
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:24,960
Why were you so?

2163
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,920
Why are you so fucking sure yourself?

2164
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,920
I think Merlin, too, like from just reading summaries of sword in the stone, kind of

2165
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:41,680
an early not version of Jeannie, but had some like self-aware modern gags at it.

2166
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:47,520
Like you'll even be in movies, you know, like mentioning topical topical Merlin.

2167
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,240
Topical Merlin.

2168
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:49,840
Twitter.

2169
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,600
Oh, topical Merlin.

2170
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,160
Does he end up in Bermuda at some point?

2171
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,640
I feel like that's a joke when he like disappears.

2172
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,960
He like comes to like on a beach.

2173
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,520
I don't remember.

2174
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,480
Like I saw that.

2175
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,000
Yeah, maybe we'll look it up.

2176
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,960
Well, I guess we did it.

2177
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:05,520
We did it.

2178
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,760
I guess we talked about certain this for a while.

2179
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,120
We boy, you know what?

2180
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,200
We managed to do it.

2181
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,640
You survived fuck has the ride.

2182
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:18,880
And truly like how could I have been worried about it being a thin episode when it ended up

2183
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,680
giving me this like, I know, I know what the next 15 years of my career are.

2184
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:27,360
And I will when you all I will.

2185
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,920
Yeah, I will feel like temporary ruler of the realm.

2186
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,520
And when everyone's at the hall at the hall of max for the big premiere.

2187
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,020
Yeah.

2188
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:37,520
Wearing holoties and seating all popcorn.

2189
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,520
And I've been development hell trying to get a Chanteclair project off the ground.

2190
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:48,000
But you're also over on this Broadway, this Broadway, this Burbank theater over here playing

2191
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,520
Chanteclair on stage.

2192
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,020
Sure.

2193
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:56,880
So that's somehow I also have to crow at dawn every morning to get the sun to rise in real life.

2194
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:58,240
It sucks.

2195
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,840
You were cursed with his actual duties.

2196
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:02,340
Yes.

2197
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:02,960
On this earth.

2198
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:03,520
Yeah.

2199
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,360
So you're trying to sell a project.

2200
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,720
You're playing him on stage and you are also Chanteclair.

2201
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:11,040
I was Chanteclair all the time, I guess.

2202
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:15,760
And you lay the eggs that we eat for breakfast.

2203
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,480
Famously rooster laid eggs.

2204
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,520
Yeah, right.

2205
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,120
Well, I don't know how animals work.

2206
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,640
And that's the takeaway.

2207
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:31,280
My future is just looking at pictures of adorable cat seats on Twitter for the rest of my life.

2208
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:31,680
Sure.

2209
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,720
They're thick seats.

2210
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:34,960
That's what I'll be doing.

2211
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,400
That's that's another I should probably start the Instagram.

2212
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,520
My cat's seat.

2213
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,200
There's no pictures of her face.

2214
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,360
That's how we get them eight to 80.

2215
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,520
The 80 year olds we call bottom seats.

2216
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,320
For the young people, we spell thick with two C's.

2217
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,040
Thick seat.

2218
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:58,320
Until there's a cooler way to spell seat, we will use the traditional.

2219
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:58,720
Yes.

2220
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,760
Yeah, we have to do that.

2221
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,720
But for now.

2222
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:01,280
