1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,280
You gotta hold it closer.

2
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:36,280
Happy birthday, Islands of Adventure, 25 years.

3
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
You brought a noisemaker.

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Oh, one of those.

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,280
You did a good job hiding that in your hand.

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Oh wait, you're not done.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
I know.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,280
I was practicing palming it.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
I brought one for you.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Wow.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Like a magician.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Like you kept it slight of hand.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
That's right.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
Yeah.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Here, I brought ones for you guys.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
Oh, great.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
Whip it.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
Yeah.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Holy.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,240
Because you can only buy, you cannot buy a single noisemaker.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,680
You have to buy a bag of like 20 or so.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
You can't buy a single bag.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,120
He did not want to give us these.

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
He wanted one for himself.

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
Oh, this is an accident.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
The end.

27
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
This is an accidental gift.

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,520
Did you try to barter with them and say, come on, can you open up a bag?

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,160
It's like when you, like there's a six pack of something and like technically the store

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,120
could probably sell you just one can of something.

31
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
No, I just got it on Amazon.

33
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
It makes sense.

34
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
Oh, okay.

35
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,720
You didn't email Amazon and say, hey, could you split this bag open and give one of these

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
to me?

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
Or eBay.

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,760
I bid four cents for one noisemaker.

39
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
All right.

40
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,240
Yeah, the shipping costs more than the items.

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
Yes.

42
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
To a ridiculous amount.

44
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
I was hoping you.

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
$10.99.

46
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
I was hoping you were haggling at a party city.

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
Oh.

48
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
That was my hope.

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Yeah.

50
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
Like, look, the bag's partially open anyway.

51
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Right.

52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,240
There's a hole in the bag.

53
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
It's basically damaged.

54
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
You're going to have to just exit out.

55
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
You may as well just give it to me.

56
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Right.

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,520
I mean, it's, I put the air into it.

58
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm the one doing the labor.

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Right.

60
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,960
I don't know what moment is this piece before my lips have touched it.

61
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Exactly.

62
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Yeah.

63
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Well, mine's kind of a lower pitch.

64
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
What is that?

65
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,140
Yours was much more of a uncomfortable fart.

66
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,140
Yeah, weird.

67
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,140
That was weird.

68
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,160
Oh, you should get your money back with this one.

69
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
Yeah.

70
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
This one sounds weird.

71
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,920
I should've said, Mike, I thought you were going to blow on the noisemaker and I'd put

72
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,560
your butt up against the microphone.

73
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,640
And whistle.

74
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,360
Whistle on my asshole.

75
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Got him.

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,160
Do we say our names?

77
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,560
Do we say what the...

78
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,520
My name is Mike Carlson.

79
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,880
Mike Carlson, Scott Gardner.

80
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,720
Yeah.

81
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,560
Our names don't matter.

82
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,400
Just in case.

83
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,220
Just in case.

84
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,760
On a week like this, who are we?

85
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,840
We are just ballast and trash in comparison

86
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,760
to the great park who we celebrate today, 25 years.

87
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,320
Yeah, we cannot hold, like, we're not in the same league

88
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,560
as, like, walk around John Hammond or walk around Merlin

89
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,480
or Woody Woodpecker and Explore Gear.

90
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,660
Yes, these are the names we celebrate today.

91
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,240
The names of the, like, atmosphere characters

92
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,920
in Lost Continent who absolutely no one knows

93
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,440
unless Jason looked them up in the last 24 hours.

94
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Well, I rewatched the open, like, the souvenir video

95
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,480
that you could watch.

96
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,080
One more time this week than usual.

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,400
One more time.

98
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,040
I had forgotten.

99
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,360
It's only about, like, under 28 minutes long,

100
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,560
and I feel like it's one of those things,

101
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,080
but it's like souvenir VHS at a theme park, $40.

102
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
Right.

103
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
You know?

104
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,480
And you paid for it at the time, do you remember?

105
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,720
I did not.

106
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,360
I did not buy that or the soundtrack.

107
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
But did your parents complain to you about the price?

108
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,960
Probably.

109
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Here, this is, okay, actually, while we have the noisemakers,

110
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,120
I don't wanna, like, keep making this a thing

111
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,760
in case they're annoying for the audience,

112
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,400
but can you just, like, what I wanna do

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,480
is, like, use one for bleeps.

114
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,920
So can you, like, describe your dad finding out the price

115
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,640
and he does it in a profane way

116
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,440
and I'm gonna bleep you with this.

117
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,760
So you're pretending you're your dad.

118
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
Yeah, yeah, you look at the price, $40 for this.

119
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,200
Yeah.

120
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,040
These am-f-ing rip-off artists.

121
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,880
But I bleep you.

122
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,480
So here, okay, here we go.

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,520
$40 for that?

124
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,640
I'm not paying for a god damn thing.

125
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,320
That's pretty good.

126
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,880
For one tape?

127
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,360
If these mother-f-ing think that $40 is a fair price

128
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,120
for 28 minutes of content,

129
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,640
they're out of their f-ing sucking minds.

130
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,360
I, you know, my mother was more the one

131
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,960
who worried about that sort of thing

132
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,760
and she hates profanity.

133
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,600
Oh, okay.

134
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,520
So it wouldn't have been.

135
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,640
She would have live done a noisemaker

136
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,280
in order to not be doing this work.

137
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Yeah, yeah.

138
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,720
She hears the show and hears the profanity sometimes, yes?

139
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,560
Oh.

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,920
Oh, yes.

141
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,280
Yes, I am told that sometimes.

142
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,120
Okay, yeah.

143
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,280
This is the biggest reason why I don't encourage

144
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,040
my parents to listen more.

145
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,880
Right.

146
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,720
I'm certainly aware of that.

147
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,920
I know that that is, they're hard out at that,

148
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,480
which in fact, something, they recently gave some praise

149
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,280
to a feature film, which we all were praising.

150
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,960
We were praising it in text and have been for,

151
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,080
you know, we work in comedy,

152
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,400
so we admire other comedy out there.

153
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,000
So we've all been, everybody's been abuzz

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,400
about the movie Unfrosted,

155
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,040
Jerry Seinfeld's stirring tribute to the serial Cold Wars

156
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,400
and, I'm sorry, the Breakfast Treat Cold Wars,

157
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,400
but my parents, one of their bits of praise for this film

158
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,960
was, you know, and there were all those comedians in it

159
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,360
who were usually so nasty,

160
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,520
but here they were keeping it clean.

161
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,200
Nasty is a particularly good word.

162
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,720
Well, nasty, I don't know.

163
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,280
I get, maybe just due to, you know, association.

164
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,120
I hear nasty and I think female.

165
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,360
I don't know what that says about me.

166
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
Oh, right, right.

167
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,960
But it doesn't, I feel like that,

168
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,160
there's the implied adjective there

169
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,960
is it's directed at Amy Schumer.

170
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,840
Who else are they talking about, right?

171
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,680
So they've probably seen her on a roast

172
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,600
and gone, oh, no, why bring that foul language

173
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,640
into a roast like that?

174
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,080
But here, she's just like a 60s businesswoman

175
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,400
who's trying to get her kind of breakfast square

176
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,280
off the ground before the other ones can.

177
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,440
Well, I think Melissa McCarthy is.

178
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,360
That you're right, oh, her too.

179
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,200
Oh, because she does.

180
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,560
Her movies are full of farts and poops.

181
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,520
Nasty farting.

182
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh, yes.

183
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,400
Is there like something, maybe,

184
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,640
where like Jim Gaffigan makes like a joke about,

185
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,240
I don't know, something very light,

186
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,520
but maybe, oh, he's kind of nasty.

187
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,440
And this could just be something different,

188
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,280
something we're not.

189
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
A light entendre, an entendre and a half.

190
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,960
He does, in his act.

191
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,640
Right, and this nasty man, Jim Gaffigan,

192
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,000
has been cleaned up by unfrosted.

193
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,480
I don't know, I'm just throwing it out there,

194
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,320
I don't know.

195
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,520
One of the cleanest stand-ups going.

196
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,240
Yeah, yeah, but we're also talking

197
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,040
about my parents' standard here.

198
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,240
Right, she could say, I like rock and roll,

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,000
like a specific type of rock and roll,

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,600
like this Black Sabbath, maybe.

201
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Yeah, does Gaffigan have a Black Sabbath joke?

202
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,600
I don't know, I don't know, I haven't seen all of it.

203
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,160
He likes Black Sabbath.

204
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,000
Isn't that what he does?

205
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
He talks in kind of like a.

206
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,440
He does that, yeah.

207
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,360
What is he saying, why is he talking about.

208
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,400
It's a lot of funny voice delivery, yeah.

209
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Right, right, okay, so all right, so anyway,

210
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,960
if you want to watch a clean film

211
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,320
that doesn't need noisemaker censoring,

212
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,440
watch the, we're out of.

213
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,160
Unfrosted, but that's not what we're here to talk about.

214
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,600
No, we're not, Jason, can I real quick,

215
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,400
because we're here to celebrate the 25th birthday

216
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,920
of Islands of Adventure, you're gonna love it.

217
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,160
Which I believe is yesterday, as people are hearing this,

218
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,560
May 28th, 1999, hence the episode.

219
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,520
So let me throw this out here on the episode,

220
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,280
and you tell me you could do this as much as you want,

221
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,840
or as little as you want, could we frame this

222
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,160
as if Islands of Adventure is your son,

223
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,960
and this is his 25th birthday.

224
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,800
Or daughter.

225
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,320
Or daughter. Or daughter.

226
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
Sure, that's true, you're right.

227
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,400
Or nasty daughter.

228
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,240
You're right.

229
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,400
Islands of Adventure is your nasty daughter.

230
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,120
I don't like that at all, I don't like that at all.

231
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,840
But Jason is allowed to choose.

232
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,000
Sure. So, you know,

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,240
as we look back on some things today,

234
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,360
I want you to really feel pride.

235
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I am, yeah, I'm very proud.

236
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,160
They can finally rent a car without paying extra fees.

237
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,400
Oh yeah, yeah.

238
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
They're probably, they're not off the health insurance

239
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,000
necessarily yet, but next year they'll get kicked off.

240
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,080
Their parents' health insurance.

241
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Their parent being Universal Studios,

242
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,680
the original. Right.

243
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,920
It was not a, I don't wanna say luxury,

244
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,080
not an option, I feel like, when we were,

245
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,880
like I feel like when I was finishing college,

246
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,960
like the, or whatever sent my parents a letter,

247
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,360
like you have one month more after he gets out of school.

248
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,160
And then you have to buy a plan.

249
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,680
Like you were. I think I may have made it.

250
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,240
Kicked out after school.

251
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,360
This might have been an ethno problem.

252
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Yeah.

253
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,440
Perhaps, yeah.

254
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,160
So, yeah, so today, so as we go through.

255
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,320
As we celebrate, Islands of Adventure's still having

256
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,960
health insurance and being a great son.

257
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,000
I want you to think of this, yeah, as your son.

258
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,720
And then sometimes people will find something

259
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,040
that you didn't like as much and you'll say,

260
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,320
well, that was a real trying time in growing up.

261
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,440
Bad phase. Sure.

262
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,200
Bad phase you were going through there, son.

263
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,480
Wow, that's interesting.

264
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,160
So, yeah, let's think of this as if you had a child

265
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
25 years ago.

266
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,040
Let's not think about how old you were

267
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,360
or the logistics of it.

268
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,560
Oh, yeah.

269
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,400
Some sort of an immaculate birth.

270
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,240
Could have done it.

271
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,640
Babies making babies.

272
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
Certainly could have done it.

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,840
Yeah.

274
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,800
Jason had relations with, I guess,

275
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,680
Universal Studios, Orlando.

276
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,360
Yeah, he, he, he fucked the gate.

277
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,880
The globe, yeah.

278
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,000
The globe's a good way to do it, yeah, yeah.

279
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,520
What's the, where does life come from?

280
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,400
Which landmark?

281
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,040
And a beautiful baby was born 25 years ago.

282
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,240
And now, look, he's all grown up.

284
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,760
Wow, boy, crazy.

285
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,560
Does that sort of, is that relatively in league

286
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,760
with how you're feeling on this special occasion?

287
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,600
Sure, yeah.

288
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,680
Well, I was reminded rewatching that souvenir video

289
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,320
that it is the theme park of the 21st century,

290
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,440
which I think they say about five times

291
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,280
in a 27-minute video.

292
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,000
Can you also, this video,

293
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,280
because I've watched some of these things.

294
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,120
Yeah.

295
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,640
Is this a video that's like,

296
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,000
is it the Disney-style thing

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
that's like a family going around

298
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,920
and you see what they do?

299
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,080
Is it the thing where the characters talk to you?

300
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,760
Is it like, where there's a really,

301
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,480
I know there's one where there's an extreme close-up,

302
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,960
which you should not do on someone with a prosthetic beard.

303
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,880
And there's, all right, let's go as tight as possible.

304
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,160
We want to really see that netting in the beard.

305
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,840
And there's a guy who's like,

306
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,120
hello, I am Merlin.

307
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,440
And is it that one?

308
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,600
Yeah, Merlin has a long prosthetic beard.

309
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Yeah.

310
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,000
Walk around John Hammond.

311
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,680
You can kind of tell it's glued on.

312
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,720
Yes, yeah, that's a very fakie beard.

313
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,280
Yeah, so if you want to see a video

314
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,360
of the closest close-ups on the worst beards

315
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,200
you've ever seen,

316
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,240
this is how they needed to herald their arrival.

317
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,080
It's the highest-checked theme park,

318
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
of the 21st century.

319
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,640
Beards could use some work,

320
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,440
but that's some of the charm, don't you think?

321
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,160
Yeah, so that, we could say,

322
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,440
that was maybe a rough start, son.

323
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Trying to get old before his time.

324
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,280
Exactly.

325
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,120
Putting on a fake beard

326
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,280
instead of growing a real one.

327
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,120
Exactly.

328
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,560
But that's the one you're talking about, Jason.

329
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,400
Yeah, yeah.

330
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,320
And kind of the denizens of each land

331
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,880
sort of welcome you to Shilin.

332
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,520
Yeah, you do get,

333
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,120
I feel like you don't get much,

334
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,400
I guess you get Popeye in Toon Lagoon,

335
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,680
kind of get a Hodgepodge in Soos Landing.

336
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,520
That's tougher.

337
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,360
It's cartoon characters,

338
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,400
who's going to be your host,

339
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,960
as opposed to the original,

340
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,880
the port of entry guy on the-

341
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,600
The storyteller on the big adult tricycle.

342
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,440
Of course.

343
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,920
I don't know what you call a full-size three-wheeled bike,

344
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,760
but he's just kind of riding around everyone.

345
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,280
Mantrake, it's a mantrake.

346
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
And he's very boisterous.

347
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
What are you most looking forward to?

348
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,160
And then he gets them at the end of the video.

349
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,600
What was your favorite adventure?

350
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,760
What did you most enjoy today?

351
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,120
Like, oh, I did the whole,

352
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,840
oh, very good.

353
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,600
I did Spider-Man.

354
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,520
It is like most original theme park IP.

355
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,480
There's a lot of clamoring for more original theme park IP

356
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,640
and not things from movies.

357
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Characters you can only meet here,

358
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,120
or in these specific places.

359
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,920
And it's funny how usually what that ends up being

360
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,640
is somebody going, hello, I'm the X-Maker,

361
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,960
or the X-Finder, or the X-Doer.

362
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,040
It's always what they always, they do-

363
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,880
There's a default.

364
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,120
If Imagineers or Universal Ears or whatever you call them,

365
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,680
like ARK just cut loose.

366
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,640
What they always end up at is a boisterous guy with a beard.

367
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,200
They always end up with Santa Claus.

368
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,160
Yeah, yeah.

369
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,240
It's always just Santa Claus.

370
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,320
And we like it.

371
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,520
Yeah, it often works.

372
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,040
I love all of these guys.

373
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,080
I don't want to call them fake Santas.

374
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,560
They're not fake Santas, but they're like Santa siblings

375
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,200
or Santa, I don't know, adjacent relatives.

376
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,040
I don't know.

377
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm the wish grower.

378
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,960
You take your wish and whisper it into this pot,

379
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,200
and then you go about your day,

380
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,400
and I'll sprinkle water and positive wishes onto your wish.

381
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,080
And by the time you come out for the day,

382
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,360
you can look at a fully grown wish

383
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,280
and purchase it for $60.

384
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,160
My name is Mr. Enchantment, of course.

385
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,120
I'm gonna write this way to a whole world of enchantment.

386
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,160
You see in the video,

387
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,800
a lot of the citizens of Port of Entry,

388
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,320
which have changed a lot over the years.

389
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,680
There were pirates.

390
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,000
There's been a mayor on and off.

391
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,920
There was a quick shot in the video

392
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,360
of a poem reader with a real brook.

393
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,160
She's got a real Brooklyn axe.

394
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,560
Oh, I'm looking at your lines.

395
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,600
You're gonna get wet today.

396
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,880
It was very easy.

397
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,640
It's like, yeah, you're at Island's Adventure.

398
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,600
The water wires are really intense.

399
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,920
I like this voice coming out of you,

400
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,840
because you're landing in a real Edith Bunker.

401
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,120
Rooster, oh, I was going more for Archie.

402
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,000
Rooster, we gotta get this Annie girl.

403
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,360
She's gonna be rich.

404
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,440
We gotta get Daddy Warbucks' money.

405
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,640
That's one of the people after,

406
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,680
not the Carol Burnett orphanage owner.

407
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,720
Is that what you're doing, or who is the?

408
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,680
Which Little Orphan Annie character are you doing?

409
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,960
I was doing Rooster's girlfriend.

410
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,800
Oh, okay.

411
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,120
I'm not familiar with the musical or the movie.

412
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,960
Mm-hmm.

413
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,800
So that's why.

414
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,640
She's like a mall.

415
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,960
She's like a real, like, gun mall.

416
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,800
A gun mall.

417
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,120
Yeah, she's a real gun mall.

418
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,360
She's a real gun mall.

419
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,080
You know what a gun mall is.

420
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,520
People are having trouble understanding

421
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,040
what Rooster's girlfriend is in Annie.

422
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,200
All right, a gun mall.

423
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,880
She's a real gun mall.

424
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Jason talked about gun malls on the show a few times.

425
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,440
No, I know, I remember the gun mall chunk, yes.

426
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,520
Good, thank God.

427
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,240
All right, anyway, back to my lovely child.

428
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,200
Yeah.

429
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,920
So we were talking about what to do for the episode,

430
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,200
and I was pitching the most niche,

431
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,200
most niche, like, smallest rides imaginable,

432
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,440
some of which have, like, haunted me.

433
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,280
Yes, yeah, yeah.

434
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,320
I will set, like, pterodon flyers back in Jurassic Park.

435
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,160
This is a children's ride.

436
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
This is for children.

437
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,640
It flies above Camp Jurassic.

438
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,880
It flies above the land.

439
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,720
Yes.

440
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,720
But it has, it doesn't just have a minimum height requirement,

441
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,800
it also has a maximum height requirement.

442
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,720
Oh, so you gotta be, really,

443
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,800
like, certain, like, Knott's Berry Farm rides

444
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,160
for kids are this way.

445
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,000
Yeah.

446
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,400
But those are not, those are rides that go

447
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,000
around and around in one area.

448
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,120
This is, like, this takes you on a little journey.

449
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,000
This gets you way away from mom and dad.

450
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,840
And so I think if you're supervising a child,

451
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,800
if you're riding with a child, you can ride.

452
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,240
But the maximum height is 56 inches,

453
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,040
so just under five feet, so.

454
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,160
Wait, so you're allowed to be, you can be a parent,

455
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,480
but does that apply to you?

456
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,840
Do you have to be under five feet as a parent?

457
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,920
I don't think so.

458
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,760
Okay.

459
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,440
Because the other trick for this ride,

460
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,480
which I narrowly missed out on

461
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,600
when we were down there last fall,

462
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,680
is that during Orlando and former events,

463
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,280
it's opened up, anyone can ride it.

464
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,120
Right.

465
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,960
Though during those rides and events.

466
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,320
This is typically not, this is typically not running.

467
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
That's, yeah.

468
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,160
Well, no, it's running, it's just.

469
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,720
It's running, it's just running for parent-child.

470
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,560
Oh, okay, yeah.

471
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,640
It's used exactly by the rules, too,

472
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,680
but you have to be, to be an adult to go on it,

473
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,320
you generally have to have a child with you.

474
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,800
Yeah, maximum height, 56 inches,

475
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,200
or accompanied by a rider meeting height requirements, so.

476
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,640
This is one of the most confusing things.

477
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,480
It is. In my mind.

478
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,840
Because I've never quite understood how you get on this.

479
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,720
I think you just have a kid,

480
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,920
but are you saying I cannot go on this?

481
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,760
Or I could with my child?

482
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,680
Well, I'm saying you could

483
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,480
if you were accompanying a child.

484
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,920
Even though I'm over five foot.

485
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,440
Because the minimum height is 36 inches,

486
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,480
maximum height is 56 inches, so.

487
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,120
But you have to be a child as well.

488
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,280
So you have to, you could be a five foot child,

489
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,960
and a parent could go on with,

490
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,800
but the parent doesn't have to.

491
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,600
No, you can't be a five foot child.

492
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,000
If you're a child over 56 inches,

493
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,840
then you don't get the ride.

494
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,000
You're shit out of luck,

495
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
unless you're accompanying a smaller child.

496
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,000
If you're 4'11", and an adult, can you go on alone?

497
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,840
It appears so.

498
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,360
Yeah, it is purely height.

499
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,200
It is purely height,

500
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,360
and things typically fall along adult-child lines,

501
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,880
given the heights, but not always.

502
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,000
But I can go on with a child.

503
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,840
Yes.

504
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,840
What?

505
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,880
So you're saying, why not,

506
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,960
why wouldn't I, you be able to do it normally?

507
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,880
Right, it's just a cut down on the adults, then,

508
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,720
to go on it?

509
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,560
Well, yeah, here's the thing,

510
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,600
because this runs like,

511
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,080
it dispatches a lot of ride vehicles.

512
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,120
The ride vehicles only hold two people at a time.

513
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,840
So it's maybe a weight thing, all told?

514
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,680
So it's a cut down on adults.

515
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,720
I tried to ride it in June 1999.

516
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,520
I was so excited to be soaring above Jurassic Park.

517
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,640
However, the wait time was two hours.

518
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,000
It was longer than Spider-Man.

519
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,840
It was longer than Hulk.

520
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
Touring Plans calls it,

521
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,280
it says it can only do 170 people per hour,

522
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,320
and they also call it

523
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,440
Islands of Adventure's biggest blunder.

524
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,360
Wow.

525
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,920
Bad phase, son.

526
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,760
Yeah, bad.

527
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,600
Bad phase.

528
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,440
Yelk, they can't, you know, you've had some victories,

529
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,840
you've had some Spider-Mans,

530
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,440
but you've also had some Pteranodon flyers.

531
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,720
And it's still around too, so it's a bad habit

532
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,160
that Jason's son just can't kick.

533
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,000
You gotta quit Pteranodon flyers at that point.

534
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,840
You gotta quit Pteranodon flyers, Jason's son.

535
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,920
The height requirements are confusing,

536
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,480
but that's okay, you're still getting,

537
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,800
you know, by the time you're 30,

538
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,840
maybe you'll figure it out.

539
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,600
I always share it in.

540
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,320
Well, here's another seemingly blunder.

541
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,360
A big portion of Toon Lagoon

542
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,800
is occupied by a massive amphitheater.

543
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,640
Okay.

544
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,960
And this is a shot I wanna call for the future.

545
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,040
You're not doing it here?

546
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,880
No, I'm not doing it here.

547
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,920
Too much to do.

548
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,040
When I explain it,

549
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,760
you will understand why I'm not doing here.

550
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,720
Pandemonium Circus was a show that opened with a park.

551
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,680
And it is all your favorite.

552
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,720
Jason's right about this.

553
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,480
Yeah, it's all your favorite.

554
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,760
Jay Ward, Fleischer Studios,

555
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,400
and King Features Syndicate characters

556
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,920
doing circus acts.

557
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,760
Okay.

558
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,600
Doing like.

559
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,320
Scott, try not to be bowled over in your chair.

560
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,920
Try not to fly over in your chair.

561
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,760
You see me teetering.

562
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,400
I'm trying to get back to the microphone.

563
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,720
Guys, could somebody pull me back, please?

564
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,760
I've got a show to do.

565
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Like, someone does tightrope walking.

566
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,600
Like, does Beetle Bailey do tightrope walking?

567
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,000
I think it's Beetle Bailey does tightrope walking.

568
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,960
Are you really? Is that true?

569
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,960
I saw a video and I wasn't sure if they were joking.

570
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,320
But in the last couple years,

571
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,360
a full video of this show was uploaded.

572
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,440
It hadn't been online for a long time.

573
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,520
Pandemonium Circus.

574
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
Pandemonium Circus.

575
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,640
So like, if Dagwood is throwing knives

576
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,720
at Betty Boop, you know.

577
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,560
It's also in here.

578
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,680
Do we know that these, have you just never like,

579
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm sure you've watched the video.

580
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,840
I would hope.

581
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
But, or maybe not, I don't know.

582
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,400
Are you just, you have not done the dot.

583
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,320
You aren't sure what's going on in that circus.

584
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,680
I'm not sure.

585
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,920
I saw it in 1999.

586
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,840
We were kind of befuddled by it.

587
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,520
Cause it's half like face characters

588
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,240
and half fur characters.

589
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,760
Beetle Bailey is in the show.

590
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,920
I'm looking at a picture of the cast.

591
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,120
Bluto's in it.

592
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,800
Rocky from Rocky and Bullwinkle.

593
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Popeye.

594
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,640
Woody Woodpecker is in it.

595
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,000
Boris and Natasha.

596
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,640
Sniley Whiplash.

597
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,720
A lot of J Ward.

598
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,000
But yeah, Beetle is there

599
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,280
and he's wearing like a fun little suit or something.

600
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,560
So the whole gang, everybody's there.

601
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,400
Yeah.

602
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,240
Broom Hilda.

603
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,080
Yeah.

604
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,880
Bimbo.

605
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,440
When you know Bimbo, that's,

606
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,320
I've definitely heard of that before seeing it right now.

607
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,680
Bimbo is from the Betty Boop universe.

608
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,520
I have heard of Bimbo.

609
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,320
Maybe.

610
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,080
The little white dog.

611
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,000
I hope so.

612
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,720
Cause otherwise, what are we doing

613
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,160
with this Bimbo character?

614
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,760
Yeah.

615
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,040
So yeah, no, Jason's 100% correct.

616
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,280
Just not enough time to get to that.

617
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,120
Okay.

618
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
Can we, can I go back real quick?

619
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,600
You said that you were haunted by pterodon flyers.

620
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,840
Cause I wanna ride it.

621
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,680
Okay, that's what you meant by that.

622
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,200
And it's been 25 years.

623
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,040
So.

624
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,760
And I haven't figured it out.

625
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,680
Okay, so that's good.

626
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,520
I wanted to go back to that

627
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,840
cause I didn't know what you meant by that.

628
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,800
You just meant you wanna ride it.

629
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,560
It's like the one thing I haven't ridden.

630
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,400
How does it?

631
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,040
And it's your one reason to have a child.

632
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,000
Oh yeah, right.

633
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,840
Oh.

634
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,680
Like there's an idea.

635
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,480
A lot of McCann territory,

636
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,440
but pro, I could go down there.

637
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,360
Pterodon flyers.

638
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,320
There's gotta be a way,

639
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,520
I guess you could go on with one of our children.

640
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,160
I suppose we could do that.

641
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,200
If we're all there together with children.

642
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,480
We're all there with children.

643
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,080
Uncle Jason could go on with one of our children.

644
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,360
I wanna go with dad.

645
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,200
No, no, no.

646
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,080
This is out of your hands.

647
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,560
This is, we are dealing with something

648
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,360
that has been around longer than you.

649
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,200
This man.

650
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,040
This has nothing to do with you, son.

651
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,240
This man has been haunted.

652
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,080
Haunted.

653
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,000
We need to end the haunting here.

654
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,560
This is about setting a spirit free.

655
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,120
You know, or if our kids aren't there,

656
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,360
if one of the nice listeners brings their child,

657
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,000
they could force their child to go on

658
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,520
with their favorite podcast host

659
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,040
who has been haunted by this.

660
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,880
Yeah.

661
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,800
If you're looking for a way to give back to the show.

662
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,640
Right.

663
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,460
Lend us your children.

664
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,460
Exactly.

665
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,660
So yeah, if you brought your children,

666
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,860
if we're down there all at the same time,

667
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,180
maybe there's a whole line of a bunch of different children

668
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,660
that wanna ride with Jason and make his dreams come true.

669
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,100
Yeah, cause I wanna re-ride.

670
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,340
I wanna get back in line.

671
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,620
Okay, we need more than one kid.

672
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,660
All right, so don't come to us with your single kid.

673
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,700
That's worthless to us.

674
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,540
Right.

675
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,100
Two kids minimum.

676
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,260
Two kids minimum.

677
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,140
And none of these kids,

678
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,820
none of these growth spurt kids over five feet.

679
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,700
Yeah, no.

680
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,620
They have to be under five.

681
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,820
And then we can finally,

682
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,420
this is your unfinished business.

683
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,180
Finally, Jason can rest.

684
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,020
Yeah.

685
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,300
And go on what Touring Plans calls

686
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,660
the worst ride at Island of Adventure.

687
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,500
I don't know, is that possible?

688
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,660
Is that junky little coaster over at, like,

689
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,500
Oh, look at this.

690
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Look at this shade he's throwing.

691
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,420
I guess there's a unicorn animatronic now.

692
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,460
Yeah, I don't, okay.

693
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,060
Is it the same coaster as in Harry Potter's year?

694
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
Yeah, yeah, it's the same.

695
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,860
Because that's all right.

696
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,700
You know what?

697
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,380
On a day where everything else

698
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,980
is really crowded at Universal Hollywood,

699
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,940
I'll do that and I'll have a nice time.

700
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,740
It's over so quick and it's not worth the big wait.

701
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,580
But yeah, you get an animatronic at the beginning.

702
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,620
But also the one here has the benefit

703
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,420
of it's up on top of the hill.

704
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,540
So you're getting nice views,

705
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,820
which will be kind of irrelevant

706
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,580
when the Fast and Furious coaster opens,

707
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,460
because that'll be a real coaster with better views.

708
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,020
Real views, yeah.

709
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,300
But so I could see,

710
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,380
that Islands of Adventure one is pretty inessential

711
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,180
because you don't have the view component.

712
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,540
That was back in the, like, pre-dates,

713
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,420
I believe pre-dates Hogsmeade.

714
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,780
Oh yes, it was there before.

715
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,100
Yeah, it was called something else.

716
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,940
I don't remember.

717
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,420
It was back in Merlinwood.

718
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,020
That section of Lost Continent.

719
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,940
The souvenir video also has great views

720
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,540
of the massive Enchanted Oak Tavern,

721
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,860
which has the big, ugly tree,

722
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,220
the big, scary tree on top of it.

723
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,020
This was a Lost Continent restaurant

724
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,020
that was demolished for Harry Potter?

725
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,860
Yes.

726
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,420
Okay, uh-huh.

727
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,260
Was it good?

728
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,100
Do you miss it?

729
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,940
Does that haunt you?

730
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,380
I think we only ever walked through it.

731
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,220
Okay.

732
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,980
Okay.

733
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,660
Can't make a judgment.

734
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,020
There's no way you think Pterodon Flyers is a word.

735
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,300
There's just no way.

736
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,900
You would give it, your guess would be

737
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,740
that that effect goes there.

738
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,460
I can't judge, I haven't been on it.

739
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
Oh yeah, oh that's why it's haunting you

740
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,820
so that you can't actually rule.

741
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,860
You know what's funny is I feel like I went on it.

742
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,620
I feel like I, was I small enough?

743
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,580
Oh, maybe.

744
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,860
Because I went in the first year of this park.

745
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,700
Yeah, me too.

746
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,140
But I was in high school.

747
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,580
Would I have been too?

748
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,940
I feel like you would have been too tall for that.

749
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,420
I really, I feel, I kind of have the memory

750
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,580
of going on it though.

751
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,620
Am I crazy?

752
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,580
Am I completing things?

753
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,660
Yeah, I was about to start high school

754
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,980
but then I assure you, I was not too tall for it.

755
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:09,380
That five, five one, getting to that last inch or two

756
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,540
of five one took a while.

757
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,220
I hear you, yeah.

758
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,060
I'm looking at a, this is from looper.com,

759
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,300
ranking rides best to worst.

760
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,660
Are these fighting words for you

761
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,420
or are you gonna defend your son?

762
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,860
They put, at worst ride and out of adventure

763
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,100
Storm Force Accel-a-tron.

764
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,220
Is it Accel-a-tron or Accelerator?

765
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,220
Accelerator?

766
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,660
Well then this article can't be trusted.

767
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,620
Wait, no, no, no, I'm looking at the sign of the ride.

768
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,620
It's called Accel-a-tron.

769
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,180
It is called Accel-a-tron.

770
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
Yes.

771
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,140
Well that's how I knew.

772
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,780
Jason said the other way and then immediately flipped.

773
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,420
Well, if it's on the sign,

774
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,140
yeah, I don't know.

775
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,420
I haven't done that in a long time.

776
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,260
What is it?

777
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,100
Is it like, it's teacups?

778
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,180
It's teacups.

779
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,820
And you hear Storm and Magneto just screaming at each other.

780
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,660
I tried to do it.

781
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,660
I told this story in Orlando.

782
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,740
I was about to go on it and the line was kind of long

783
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,740
and then there was a like a teen working there.

784
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,780
He's like, and we have defeated Magneto.

785
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,620
And I was like, I think I got the best actual part

786
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,020
of this ride so far.

787
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,700
So like I'm good, I don't need to do it.

788
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,740
Did I maybe, I'm looking at Pterodon Flyers.

789
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,580
I feel like I did it.

790
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,420
Maybe.

791
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,780
Maybe it was my sister.

792
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,380
Maybe she was small enough to do it

793
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,020
and I was the one accompanying and that's why.

794
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,860
Oh, maybe.

795
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,460
That might be it.

796
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,300
I think so.

797
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,740
We will get, look, we know people, okay?

798
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,420
We will get you on this goddamn ride.

799
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,980
I, oh, God.

800
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,180
Oh yeah, thank you.

801
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,020
Ride.

802
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,780
We can make this happen.

803
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,660
I don't know how, but we will make it happen.

804
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

805
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,320
Next time we're down there.

806
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,220
I wanna go to one of those Informer events.

807
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,060
Okay, that seems like-

808
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Unlimited food.

809
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,260
Just unlimited.

810
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,140
Hang on, one of those Informer events.

811
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,060
You just dove in with that.

812
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,900
I don't know about the Informer event.

813
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,700
He said there's a, yeah, there's a meetup

814
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,900
where they rent the park out.

815
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,740
Okay.

816
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,460
Orlando Informer rents the park out

817
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,700
and you get-

818
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,620
That is a newspaper.

819
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,180
I don't know, I'm so in the dark.

820
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,580
I gotta, you gotta help me out.

821
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,420
Sorry, sorry.

822
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,260
It's like a-

823
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,500
These are big, they're very popular.

824
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,340
You pay like-

825
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,940
It doesn't mean, I still need content.

826
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,660
You still, I'm sorry, I'm making you provide context

827
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,500
of any kind. It's a theme park.

828
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,340
Specific thing?

829
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,160
Am I, or am I wrong?

830
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,940
Or is it a regular newspaper?

831
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,820
I think it is like Orlando tourism in general,

832
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,940
but it's a lot of theme park coverage.

833
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,780
Right, right.

834
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,900
So they rent out Universal

835
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,980
and you can get in like in the late afternoon

836
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,980
and after EPM or so,

837
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,180
it's only people who paid for that ticket.

838
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,700
The riff-raff is gone.

839
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,540
Wow.

840
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,380
And the people who paid-

841
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,220
The riff-raff is gone.

842
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,660
And then there's some sort of unlimited food

843
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,500
that Jason has brought into this.

844
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,980
All you can eat like at the counter services,

845
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,940
they set up a phase and stuff.

846
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,660
You can cross parks backstage.

847
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,660
Okay.

848
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,820
And it's anything goes. I like that.

849
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,500
Adults can do taradon flyers.

850
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,300
And adults, most importantly, adults can do-

851
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,140
You can ride a shirtless too.

852
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,980
Taradon flyers.

853
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,820
Whoa.

854
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,260
Because it's adults only.

855
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,060
You can go fucking nuts at Islands,

856
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:17,460
excuse me, you can go fucking nuts at Islands of Adventure.

857
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,300
Yes.

858
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,200
God, I'm just imagining the kinds of things

859
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,120
you can do at these informer events now.

860
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,360
Can you like f**k and f**k?

861
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,840
Because that's illegal in Florida.

862
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,880
When you're a Toon Lagoon,

863
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,920
you can do all the f**k-ing and f**k-ing you want,

864
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,440
specifically at Toon Lagoon.

865
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,800
Love the boys, but the noisemaker joke got old.

866
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,760
They committed to the bit a bit too hard.

867
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,600
Jason's warming up for some part of it.

868
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,440
That was a very quiet one.

869
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,800
I was trying to do a sad one.

870
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,960
I don't think you have that control.

871
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,800
Yeah, there's not.

872
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,280
That was kind of a pitch bend, can you?

873
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,960
No, I see what, I fell right into his trap.

874
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,800
Yeah.

875
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,800
I mean, that was sad.

876
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,640
That was absolutely sad.

877
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,800
That was pretty dramatic.

878
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,120
It wasn't slide whistle sad, it was a new type of sad.

879
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,760
Look, I was just saying, Jason,

880
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,240
I'm sure there's somebody at Universal

881
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,480
who could figure this out for you,

882
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,680
but I think Jason wants to pay the money

883
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,600
because he wants to get all you can eat mozzarella sticks

884
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,760
at the Fantastic Four Cafe.

885
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,960
Oh, that sounds nice.

886
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,040
Yeah, I want my tummy really rumbly

887
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,880
getting on the pterodon flyers.

888
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,240
Yeah, yeah, well you get them.

889
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,120
You want to be up there, finally soaring,

890
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,840
achieving your long-eld, your 25-year-long dream,

891
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,680
and then to puke up mozzarella sticks on the people below.

892
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,080
I ate too much green eggs and ham

893
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,320
at Circus McGurkis Cafe Stupendous.

894
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,680
If you pay for the Orlando Informer ticket, though,

895
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,040
you can take a Target bag,

896
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,600
fill it with mozzarella sticks from the Fantastic Four Cafe,

897
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,920
and then eat it while you're on pterodon flyers.

898
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,400
Or take them back to your hotel if it has a kitchenette.

899
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,720
Or not, eat them cold.

900
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,040
Sure, yeah. Sure.

901
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,320
But that's what you get for those,

902
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,520
that ticket price. That's a recipe

903
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,080
for one of those great, like Jason's saying,

904
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,680
something made me sick, I don't know what it was,

905
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,680
and then we're doing the autopsy of it,

906
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,040
and like, wait, you were having mozzarella sticks

907
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,920
that were six days old? No, it wasn't that.

908
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,680
No, those holes. It was five days old.

909
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,840
It was the wind, the wind did it to me.

910
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,600
The wind threw off my microbiome.

911
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,560
Eat some of that red light treatment,

912
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,120
just like Steve Harvey gets.

913
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
That'll get rid of, that'll fix your microbiomes.

914
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,840
We will get you on pterodon flyers in the next two years.

915
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,960
I pledge this to you. Let's do it.

916
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,480
When I pledge it, I mean somebody else

917
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,080
is going to figure it out, but I pledge it to you

918
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,320
that you will be on pterodon flyers.

919
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,080
Who out there listening has the override

920
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,560
to this awful height restriction?

921
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,600
Does somebody work with this restriction

922
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,200
that tears our society apart?

923
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,720
I bet there's a 13-year-old like me listening to this show.

924
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,800
I bet there's a little...

925
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,160
You mean a literal one from a multiverse

926
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,000
or literally a person like you?

927
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,760
No, not a multiverse, like someone molded in my image,

928
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,640
like a little 13-year-old theme park weirdo.

929
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,760
That has been listening to us?

930
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,280
Yes. That we molded?

931
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,160
Yes. That's your actual son?

932
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,280
And if someone...

933
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,160
No, just hypothetically, I think.

934
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,880
But if so, I hope you're using your own money for this

935
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,000
and not stealing mom and dad's credit card.

936
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,200
We appreciate the business here on this Patreon episode,

937
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,600
but let's make sure that's on the up and up.

938
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,280
But I'm sure it is because if they're in molded

939
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,960
in Jason's image, I'm sure they're a very good boy.

940
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,880
They have a lemonade stand or a paper route.

941
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,800
They're making their money the old-fashioned way.

942
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,560
It's funny how that one, most of the money comes in

943
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,120
digitally, but then we just get sent an envelope of nickels.

944
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,080
And it's sent to Podcast The Ride,

945
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,800
but the P is backwards.

946
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,400
And then we send out a cassette tape to them.

947
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,040
Hey, hey, kid, kid, listen to me.

948
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,920
I know you're hearing this.

949
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,000
Okay, now's the time.

950
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,080
You gotta be a little rebellious.

951
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,720
Oh my God. Just take, just take the credit card.

952
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,360
Take one they don't use that much.

953
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,320
Oh my God. Just take the credit card.

954
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
Take the Sears card.

955
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,280
They're not around anymore. The Sears card.

956
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,440
The Sears card.

957
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,280
The Sears ain't gonna send a bill.

958
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,480
Take the card from the store that doesn't exist.

959
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,600
Well, it exists in Burbank.

960
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,560
Yes, I know. We've been through this.

961
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,360
We'll go through this clearly an infinite more episode.

962
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,080
Well, we'll have to go through the store

963
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,320
before we do that.

964
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,360
What else? Other island stuff.

965
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,200
Yeah, yeah, yes.

966
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,040
If we're going, if we're going,

967
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,880
so we're going through like, what are the,

968
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,640
it's the, it's the, the obscure,

969
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,960
the obscurities that don't get the.

970
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,000
They don't get the proper.

971
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

972
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,440
Some of which won't get full episodes,

973
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,320
although it sounds like a lot of them still will.

974
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,640
I mean, it could be.

975
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,240
I initially, like my instinct was like,

976
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,280
well, if it's just gonna be happy birthday

977
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,040
or islands of adventure is a theme,

978
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,320
I'm gonna make it an Island Skipper Tour backdoor episode.

979
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm gonna make it the backdoor violent.

980
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,840
Okay, all right.

981
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,680
For Island Skipper Tour, which was of course.

982
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,520
And if you're gonna do that,

983
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,400
I'm gonna make you explain what Island Skipper Tour is.

984
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,720
Island Skipper Tour at the very beginning

985
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,280
of Islands of Adventure has only lasted about two years

986
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,640
and then for a third year, I think it came back seasonally.

987
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,640
These were the sole attraction at Port of Entry.

988
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,800
And technically the first ride you would hit

989
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,480
after you got to the end of Port of Entry.

990
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,600
These were kooky looking boats

991
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,960
that would take you from Port of Entry to Jurassic Park

992
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,320
or from Jurassic Park back to Port of Entry.

993
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,480
I bet you're gonna flip the script on that one.

994
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,840
Or also the same thing from before.

995
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,640
Well, there were plans for a third dock at Toon Lagoon.

996
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,160
It was never built.

997
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,200
Third dock?

998
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
That's right.

999
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,400
It was never built because the park, why bother?

1000
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,520
And also these were very expensive

1001
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,640
to upkeep and buy gasoline for.

1002
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,800
So you could, instead of walking around

1003
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,880
in like a circle basically,

1004
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,560
you could just go right to a boat

1005
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,200
and take a boat across the waterway

1006
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,000
in Islands of Adventure, which is named what?

1007
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,680
The Inland Sea.

1008
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,720
The Inland Sea?

1009
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,560
Yeah.

1010
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,960
It is, I never heard that.

1011
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,920
The Inland Sea.

1012
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,760
Yeah.

1013
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,600
Catchy.

1014
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,240
I was gonna say, it's just like kind of a utilitarian

1015
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
type of name for it.

1016
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,080
Yeah.

1017
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,920
I was just calling it.

1018
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,360
The Dream Finder will take you to the,

1019
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,480
no, not the Dream Finder.

1020
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,240
The Enchantment Finder will take you to the Inland Sea.

1021
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,720
It's the Inland Sea over there, sea inside.

1022
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,080
The Inland Sea, just kind of gave it.

1023
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,800
That's actually the name it was when we got here.

1024
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,040
That was the natural swamp name.

1025
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,920
Right, there was a swamp.

1026
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,920
Well, when the big comet hit Marvel,

1027
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,880
the big comet created all the islands,

1028
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,120
the big impact, and you could see the impact area

1029
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,440
at Marvel's superior island,

1030
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,680
and then it created all these islands sprung up.

1031
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,520
Is that the mythology?

1032
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,600
This is canon, right?

1033
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,440
This is canon.

1034
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,800
That's what, wait, that's the story

1035
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,840
of Islands of Adventure, a comet hit

1036
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,440
and created a bunch of magical islands?

1037
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,240
An asteroid, comet, some sort of large impact.

1038
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,080
Did you know this, Mike?

1039
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,920
No.

1040
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,000
I've never heard this backstory.

1041
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,800
Do you know there's these big crystal structures

1042
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,800
at Marvel's superior island with all these big story line

1043
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,160
artwork painted on it?

1044
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,360
I'm sorry, there are barely any Google results

1045
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,640
for Inland Sea.

1046
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,000
There's enough to show that it's accurate,

1047
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,520
but you are talking about something

1048
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,480
that is such a thin slice that it's barely documented.

1049
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,000
This shows how deep you go.

1050
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,960
I don't even, I don't even call it,

1051
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,680
I always just call it the lagoon,

1052
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,000
which is standard, I think, theme parlance.

1053
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,040
Where did you learn about the comet

1054
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,920
that created Islands of Adventure?

1055
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,120
I think this is like early on,

1056
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:59,120
there was a lot more myth-making and stuff.

1057
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,800
I mean, so the body of water, ostensibly,

1058
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,400
is the impact of the comet?

1059
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,320
Well, I guess, well, you can see the impact on the ground.

1060
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,680
You can see like the effects at Marvel's superior island.

1061
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,800
But then isn't that the impact point,

1062
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,640
not the Inland Sea? That's the impact point,

1063
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,840
and then it all just sprung up.

1064
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,120
But did the blast create the Inland Sea?

1065
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,720
I think so, I would guess so.

1066
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,840
At least certainly a part of it,

1067
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,280
if it all of a sudden created these islands.

1068
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,960
But it was a magical comet of some kind, too,

1069
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,160
because it grew dinosaurs.

1070
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,080
By the way, I'm seeing a website saying meteor,

1071
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,000
but again, it's, you know, we're picking it,

1072
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,280
you know, we're, this is Christmas grass.

1073
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,400
It was a magic, big piece of rock.

1074
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,800
Okay, but yeah, I'm seeing this affirmed somewhere.

1075
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,600
The crash site, okay, hit in Marvel's superhero island,

1076
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,920
and the, well, they keep switching,

1077
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,080
they call it an asteroid, too.

1078
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,680
The asteroid is said to still be under there,

1079
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,640
and it has magnetic powers,

1080
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,080
and both good and evil are attracted to that site.

1081
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,440
So that is why good and evil are always

1082
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,280
jockeying for power, especially in-

1083
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,400
Well, that's why you get a Spider-Man ride

1084
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,200
and a Doctor Doom ride, you know?

1085
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,560
So all of that is powered by the underground media.

1086
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,080
It created, it was a blast, it created six fun islands,

1087
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,240
and then stayed underground,

1088
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,560
where its powers make a fear-fall machine possible.

1089
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,400
Right.

1090
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,440
And they flared up at some point,

1091
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,600
and it attracted King Kong and Harry Potter, too.

1092
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,760
Don't worry about it.

1093
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,280
That's its own, I don't know.

1094
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,760
Then magic happened, also.

1095
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,560
Right, wow, so okay.

1096
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,760
So that is, I know that there's a lot of, like,

1097
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,440
mythology around just, like,

1098
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,120
the new epic universe in Celestial Park.

1099
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,840
I've seen, like, little pieces of storytelling

1100
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,400
that they've already, like, hinted at or just said.

1101
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,240
Yeah.

1102
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,040
So it feels like they were already on this here,

1103
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,480
because I don't, I'm trying to think,

1104
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,840
is there anything in, I guess, Disney, Orlando,

1105
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,600
is there anything that has any of the parks

1106
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,040
that have, like, an origin like this,

1107
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,720
other than the water parks?

1108
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,080
It's like, Blizzard Beach has kind of an origin

1109
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,960
of why there's a blizzard happening on this beach

1110
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,760
and Typhoon Lagoon, but I don't know,

1111
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,440
like, Animal Kingdom doesn't have, like,

1112
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,600
a magical- How did this happen?

1113
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,240
Right, a wizard blessed a zoo and something happened.

1114
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,760
Well, it just comes along with being

1115
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,120
the theme park of the 21st century.

1116
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,440
Yeah, it has a- I guess you're right.

1117
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Well, Disney MGM Studios had the backstory

1118
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,080
of the world's greatest man wanted to chase

1119
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,240
a villainous other studio out of his state,

1120
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,080
out of a state where they had planted a flag already,

1121
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,520
and he brought all of the best talent together,

1122
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,920
Bette Midler and Rick Moranis

1123
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,440
and creepy, upright walking muppets,

1124
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,680
and he, you know, he forged a place in fire

1125
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,080
to show an evil studio what for.

1126
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,880
Well, that's the most inspiring story.

1127
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,440
Yeah, I'm wiping tears as I said.

1128
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,520
Right, so did you know that story, Jason,

1129
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
when you were a kid?

1130
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,360
Did you know the meteor story?

1131
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,880
I think so, well, you know, the first time I went,

1132
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,720
there was like a souvenir pack at Marvel Super Hero Island,

1133
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,160
and I think it had a lapel pin

1134
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,320
and a poster, I believe, and a comic book.

1135
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,360
Oh, was there a narrative about this?

1136
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,680
There is a comic book with three stories in it

1137
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,040
that explained the backstory of all three

1138
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,560
rocks at Marvel Super Hero Island,

1139
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,520
and they had Marvel talent, like Chris Bockelo

1140
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,560
drew the Spider-Man, Sal Bechema drew the Hulk,

1141
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,680
Mike Waringo drew the Doctor Doom,

1142
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,880
so these are like A-listers they put on this.

1143
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,920
So this is another calling of show,

1144
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,800
this is another episode of this comic,

1145
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,400
we gotta get our hands on this comic.

1146
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,160
It's somewhere in Pennsylvania,

1147
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,920
it's somewhere back at my mom's house.

1148
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,240
Oh, you literally have it.

1149
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,680
Yeah, I have it, and I'm sure I find it on eBay.

1150
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,760
Is it in a glass case?

1151
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,880
I hope it's not just rotting away.

1152
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,720
What if it's under a leaky pipe or something?

1153
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,560
It's perfectly protected.

1154
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,400
What's going on in the house?

1155
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,920
It's got a bag and board, and it's in a short box, you know.

1156
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,600
Okay, all right.

1157
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,640
Well, we're gonna get your copy of it and do an episode.

1158
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,600
Just read it, and not even with funny voices,

1159
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,640
with realistic voices.

1160
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,680
No jokes.

1161
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,520
No jokes.

1162
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,600
Yeah, that will be the first joke-free episode.

1163
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,440
Some things are sacred.

1164
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,280
On purpose.

1165
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,000
If there's been a clunker here and there in our catalog,

1166
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,320
I can't say, I'm just saying that we tried on those.

1167
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,160
I'm not even saying specifically which one.

1168
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,280
This will be the first joke attempt-less episode.

1169
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,120
Right, exactly.

1170
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,600
So Island Skipper Tours, getting back to it.

1171
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,800
These were, this was so exciting to me.

1172
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,040
I never rode the Animal Kingdom boats

1173
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,000
that would take you around, you know.

1174
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
This is a common theme park thing, I guess,

1175
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,880
is like having boats briefly

1176
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,960
and then stopping, bothering with that.

1177
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,800
Right.

1178
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,720
Yes, because boats take a lot of upkeep

1179
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,440
and a lot of fuel.

1180
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,960
And you know, I should never have bought mine.

1181
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,760
Yeah, you're haunted by that thing.

1182
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,960
Sitting in your driveway.

1183
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,800
Sitting in your driveway.

1184
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,360
Rusting away, yeah.

1185
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,440
I can't even put my kid on it to run around.

1186
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,760
Spiders will get him.

1187
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,160
Do you wanna know the names of the boats?

1188
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,000
Of course.

1189
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,320
Do we, Jason, please, who do you think we are?

1190
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,240
They're a little confusing, so Tropical Trader,

1191
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,640
that one just looked like a sailboat.

1192
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,960
Sure.

1193
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,800
Sure, basic boat.

1194
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,640
That one's fun.

1195
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,720
Great, basic gas boat.

1196
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,840
Samplane.

1197
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,000
This is like repurposed, like, junker.

1198
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,560
It looks like it got plane parts on it.

1199
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,480
Samplane.

1200
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,320
Samplane.

1201
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,960
Well, I do not, vehicles deserve to have names.

1202
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,800
Yes, one does.

1203
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,240
It looks a little like something Jimmy Buffett

1204
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,920
would have driven.

1205
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,120
It's got a little bit of atmosphere, dancer vibe.

1206
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,320
Right.

1207
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,560
And then the last one was called Boatney,

1208
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,920
and it's like a funky school bus.

1209
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,680
It's like a funky painted school bus on skiffs.

1210
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,120
Like the Muppets rode in.

1211
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,960
Yeah.

1212
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,800
Or the Partridge Family.

1213
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,640
Or Electric Mayhem.

1214
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,560
Mm-hmm.

1215
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,400
Huh, Boatney.

1216
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,840
Well, they all rode in it at some point, Mike.

1217
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,840
No, but it was Electric Mayhem's bus.

1218
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,240
But do they not, all the Muppets end up on the bus?

1219
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,840
I knew what you meant.

1220
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,720
I guess I didn't have to add that I knew specifically

1221
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,560
whose bus it was owned by.

1222
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,400
I mean, you're correct.

1223
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,760
All right, if I looked at the registration,

1224
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,640
it would say Electric Mayhem.

1225
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,040
I'm not arguing on that.

1226
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,480
Right.

1227
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,800
Okay, so you get, these were not just like

1228
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,760
the Epcot Friendship Boats, where they're just regular,

1229
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,680
they all had their own theme and personality.

1230
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,360
Yeah.

1231
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,600
And you don't know which one's gonna show up,

1232
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,840
so you get kind of a different little experience.

1233
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:53,040
And the videos, the best video about this channel,

1234
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,120
Storybook Amusements put it up.

1235
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,480
There's some VHS footage of someone on the ride.

1236
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,920
There's another one or two videos.

1237
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,920
All of them seem to mention that the boats

1238
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,240
were air conditioned, which is a plus, you know.

1239
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,200
No wonder you've dreamed about these boats.

1240
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,160
I mean, that is nice.

1241
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,000
It's very muggy.

1242
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,440
I don't disagree with that.

1243
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,560
One of the strangest things I read about the boats,

1244
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,100
on the first boat of the day,

1245
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,160
face character John Hammond and face character Ian Malcolm.

1246
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,360
Really?

1247
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,440
They had a walk around Ian Malcolm?

1248
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,160
They had walk around Ian Malcolm.

1249
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,760
Supposedly, they would ride the first boat of the day

1250
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,560
over to Jurassic Park.

1251
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,160
Wow. Wow.

1252
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,160
The two good pals who got along so famously.

1253
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,080
Arm in arm.

1254
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,680
Let's go see what you've created, Mr. Hammond.

1255
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,520
I love it.

1256
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,340
You know what?

1257
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,600
I'm sorry I was so testy at that one brunch.

1258
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,120
After this spectacular tour,

1259
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,320
I love what you've done here and I'll never leave.

1260
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,000
I'll take a boat with you every day.

1261
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,040
Does it reset every morning though?

1262
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,520
They haven't even gone through the events

1263
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,920
of Jurassic Park yet.

1264
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,300
So every morning, John Hammond and Ian Malcolm

1265
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,200
are sort of born anew and their relationship starts over.

1266
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,920
You know, it's kind of like half of that land

1267
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,720
is everything is fine and then the River Cruise is hell.

1268
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,720
Isn't though, does not the video in River Cruise

1269
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,880
slash Jurassic Park the Ride,

1270
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,880
does it not refer to like we had some unpleasant trees

1271
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,560
because the park's open too.

1272
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,360
So I think actually timeline wise, it is.

1273
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,800
All this stuff happens, the Jeep got pushed

1274
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,580
and the kids were in the tree and all that happened.

1275
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,120
Then they got their act together and they open.

1276
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,280
I guess you're right.

1277
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,320
You're in a time that's post-Jurassic Park, pre-Lost World.

1278
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,000
And so Malcolm being there is kind of wrong

1279
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,240
but he did go back for Lost World.

1280
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
It's like they added another thing of him.

1281
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,900
Maybe he's there to be mad and try to stop it.

1282
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,880
Right. I don't know.

1283
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,920
Maybe. Or there was a brief period of time

1284
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,920
where he flipped and then by Lost World,

1285
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,000
he was anti-park again.

1286
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,640
Right. Interesting.

1287
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,480
Yeah. I don't know.

1288
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,700
The big question is, did he lie on the front of the boat

1289
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,760
with his shirt open and let all the ladies ogle him?

1290
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,960
Please, of course.

1291
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,760
I mean, that wasn't the meme thing yet though

1292
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,820
at the time when it opened.

1293
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,300
No, I think it took a generation growing up

1294
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,780
and all admitting to each other that,

1295
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,700
I don't think anybody cared about that,

1296
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,060
unless, although I don't know,

1297
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,860
there probably were a lot of people out there

1298
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,500
secretly stopping that VHS right at that part,

1299
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,100
watching it through shaky lines.

1300
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,980
I think it unlocked a lot of people's sexuality, certainly.

1301
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:53,980
But no one acknowledged it until, I feel like, a decade ago.

1302
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,780
I didn't see it online a lot.

1303
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,140
But it was a collective awakening.

1304
00:46:59,140 --> 00:46:59,980
Yeah.

1305
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,820
The power of the internet.

1306
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,540
They were all talking about the water drops on Laura.

1307
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,380
They're insane.

1308
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,420
He's the most sensual man of all time, in general.

1309
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,260
That is right.

1310
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,060
That is what he does, his hands and little,

1311
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:10,900
that is like the-

1312
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,740
That's what he does in real life.

1313
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,300
That's why that scene was so effective.

1314
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,140
If you've ever been around it.

1315
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,260
That's why it was his ultimate character

1316
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,460
that broke it all open.

1317
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,500
Or they just like the comedy, like,

1318
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,460
that's him yelling, must go faster,

1319
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,300
must go fast when they're being chased.

1320
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,820
Well, there's a lot to love about it in the movie.

1321
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,460
There's a lot to love about Dr. Ian Malcolm.

1322
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,300
There's a lot of funny,

1323
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,900
there's a lot of sensuality.

1324
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,980
We're here to talk about the sensual side of Jurassic Park.

1325
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,020
Wouldn't you say Jeff Goldman's very sensual?

1326
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:38,860
That's the word that comes to mind.

1327
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,700
I would say so.

1328
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,620
Yeah, certainly, yeah.

1329
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,580
And then you got Alan over there, giving him side eye.

1330
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,620
What's this happening with my wife?

1331
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,440
Were they married?

1332
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,280
No, they weren't.

1333
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,120
No.

1334
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,540
They were like, just figuring it out.

1335
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,380
I think they were figuring it out.

1336
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,420
And he doesn't want kids, so that's a conflict.

1337
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,260
Right.

1338
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:00,260
Ian Malcolm and Julia Moore were estranged.

1339
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,740
Yes.

1340
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,020
They had an adopted gymnast daughter.

1341
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:04,860
Right.

1342
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,100
Who like kicks a velociraptor in the head

1343
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,180
with her cool, cool gymnast maid.

1344
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,180
Best decision they ever made,

1345
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,500
signing that girl up for gymnastics class.

1346
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,340
Right, save their lives.

1347
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,980
Little did they know how that would come into play

1348
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,700
on a certain dinosaur island years later.

1349
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,300
Seeing that in theaters, I was like,

1350
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,960
why do they keep talking about her being a gymnast?

1351
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,520
And then she like kicks a velociraptor in the head.

1352
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,840
And I was like, hell yes.

1353
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,440
This is awesome.

1354
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,400
I remember thinking it was a little goofy at the time.

1355
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,880
And now I wish most movies had something as fun as that.

1356
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,720
I agree, yeah.

1357
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,920
I felt that way at the time.

1358
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,160
I have a quick clip here of.

1359
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,000
The Skipper Tour.

1360
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,480
The, well, it's a souvenir video,

1361
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,280
and you're seeing a familiar face

1362
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,440
on the Jurassic Park boat dock.

1363
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,280
Okay.

1364
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,800
That's in Jurassic Park land.

1365
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,520
Now we can.

1366
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,880
Hey, there's Mr. Hammond, the man who created it all.

1367
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,880
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

1368
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,680
So John, in that instance,

1369
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,640
you did get a good view of the Jurassic Park boat dock.

1370
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,000
John Hammond's already at Jurassic Park,

1371
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,500
and he's welcoming you.

1372
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,040
And this is that John Hammond

1373
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,920
that looks exactly like you slash your dad.

1374
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,760
Yes.

1375
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,220
This has come up before, hasn't it?

1376
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,060
Yeah, yeah.

1377
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,880
Yeah.

1378
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,440
David, my dad looks more like David Attenborough,

1379
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,400
but this John Hammond does look more like me.

1380
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,000
You mean Richard Attenborough.

1381
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,600
Richard Attenborough, excuse me.

1382
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,440
David's.

1383
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,260
Animal guy.

1384
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,100
Oh, your dad, okay.

1385
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:40,940
Or nature documentary.

1386
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,080
So you're saying your dad looks like the real deal

1387
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,080
in the movie, and this looks like you

1388
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,920
if you put a beard on it. And you look like Theme Park.

1389
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,560
If you put a beard on it. John Hammond.

1390
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,880
Yeah.

1391
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,120
It really is.

1392
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,760
I look like spirit gum John Hammond.

1393
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,600
Right.

1394
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,280
I mean, is that something that adds to your fondness

1395
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,920
for this place, or at least this video,

1396
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,200
that there's something about you,

1397
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,280
you're looking at that, like what is it I like

1398
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,600
about this guy?

1399
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,920
Something about this guy.

1400
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,120
Something about this guy.

1401
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,960
Again, it all comes back to family, I think.

1402
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,680
See, if I could have just, if I could borrow

1403
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,600
walk around John Hammond, he could accompany me

1404
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,360
on Pterodon flyers.

1405
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,720
Oh, God.

1406
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,220
Can we, okay, we're helping the auntie

1407
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,900
for the Orlando Informer event.

1408
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,860
We have to have somebody dressed as John Hammond

1409
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,000
accompany Jason on Pterodon flyers.

1410
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,600
Oh, Universal Bounding, John Hammond.

1411
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,440
Yeah, yeah.

1412
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,760
Why isn't Universal Bounding at the end?

1413
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,600
That's a good idea.

1414
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,740
Here's more John Hammond.

1415
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,580
Oh, please.

1416
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,500
Very strange clip.

1417
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,320
The knowledge we've gained in Jurassic Park

1418
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,600
will transform every aspect of human life.

1419
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,800
Nothing will ever be the same again.

1420
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,840
So come back soon.

1421
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,760
And kids, remember to mind your studies.

1422
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,120
Thanks, Mr. Hammond, we will.

1423
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,680
Remember to mind your study.

1424
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,960
Why does he have like a Scotty on Star Trek accent?

1425
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,920
Yeah, and he also, I don't remember John Hammond

1426
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,560
being very focused on kids keeping up on their studies.

1427
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:16,560
And then the narrator going, thanks, Mr. Hammond, we will.

1428
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,060
He means, wait, he means his gymnastics.

1429
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,540
He knows that's the best.

1430
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,380
Oh, maybe.

1431
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,140
That's his best way to make sure the people

1432
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,980
who test out his facilities don't die.

1433
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,820
There's a gymnastics kid at the ready.

1434
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,660
That makes sense.

1435
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,480
It is crazy.

1436
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,220
You put that video next to your face

1437
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,460
and I'm just darting back and forth.

1438
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,420
It's the closest doppelganger.

1439
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,620
It is odd.

1440
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,900
It's just like the facial, the type of, the eyes.

1441
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,380
I don't know what it is.

1442
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,740
It is odd, I cannot dispute it,

1443
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,860
but it is not terribly flattering.

1444
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,700
I think part of it's also.

1445
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,140
I wasn't thinking that either way.

1446
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,660
I was thinking about it in the sort of like

1447
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,620
the gentle demeanor in a way as well.

1448
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:55,940
Whoa, that's nice.

1449
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,140
Yeah.

1450
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,020
You also, you know this guy could do

1451
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,100
a killer Scottish accent.

1452
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,740
We know anything about Jason.

1453
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,060
You want to give us some minor studies?

1454
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,900
His minor studies.

1455
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,660
Scottish is the hardest accent to do,

1456
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,500
and now Jason can do it.

1457
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,420
I know, it's really hard.

1458
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,780
I can't do it at all.

1459
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,980
And even when there was like, you know,

1460
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,620
everybody could kind of do Daryl Hammond

1461
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,660
doing Sean Connery.

1462
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,300
I couldn't do that.

1463
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,140
Yeah, I can't.

1464
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:20,980
Yeah.

1465
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,020
Anyway, I mean, look, if Jason wants to give it a shot,

1466
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,860
he can give it a shot.

1467
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,860
He's got to give it a shot.

1468
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,140
It's going to come out as Shrek.

1469
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:26,980
Oh, please.

1470
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,620
If you're lucky.

1471
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,460
That's the best case scenario.

1472
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,060
Mind your studies.

1473
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,900
It's better than I thought.

1474
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,500
It's better than I thought.

1475
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,900
I was doing it.

1476
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,740
Yeah, wow.

1477
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,560
Not bad.

1478
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,400
Hey, geez.

1479
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,240
Not bad.

1480
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,080
Yeah.

1481
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,900
Pretty good.

1482
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,740
He did it, he delivered.

1483
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:45,740
So, do you remember when you were a kid taking this tour?

1484
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,020
Do you remember, did you do it the first thing,

1485
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,660
or did you, like, as soon as you got out of port of entry,

1486
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,980
did you say, mother, father, we must go on these boats?

1487
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:59,820
No, because I went right to Marvel's Superhero Island.

1488
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,660
Right, as you should have.

1489
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,360
I went right to that theme park land,

1490
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,820
and pretty much very quickly wandered

1491
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,420
into a comic book store.

1492
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,260
Okay.

1493
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,080
Because there is a store.

1494
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,920
Not a ride?

1495
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,180
You just went to a comic book store?

1496
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,940
I take that back.

1497
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,420
I did Dr. Doom's Fearfall.

1498
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:23,980
I think at 13, I was not brave enough to do the Hulk.

1499
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,260
And Spider-Man had, like, a two, three hour wait.

1500
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,900
So that was, like, we came back at the end of it.

1501
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,180
We knew, like, okay, we'll do it later.

1502
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,500
Lines go down.

1503
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,860
We'll do boats later.

1504
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,700
I think we did boats, trying to remember.

1505
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,300
I feel like it was in the afternoon,

1506
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:50,380
and either, because I was there in 99 and 2000.

1507
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,580
But it was something you were looking forward to going in,

1508
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,220
or was something that you realized was there later?

1509
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,060
Do you remember that?

1510
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,100
I think it was one of those, like,

1511
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,780
we were looking around, taking it all in,

1512
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,240
and we saw them crossing the lagoon,

1513
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,060
and it's like, oh, gotta do that.

1514
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:05,900
Gotta get on a boat.

1515
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,740
Gotta get on a boat.

1516
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,100
And we embraced, and we said,

1517
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,900
look where our family is today.

1518
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,180
Look where our journeys have taken us.

1519
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,700
The wonders of man.

1520
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,380
Also, the first time I was there,

1521
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,620
it was so goddamn hot.

1522
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,820
Like, it was, I know it's Orlando.

1523
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,780
I know it's June is the summer, but.

1524
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,980
Can I remind you guys when, a month ago,

1525
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:31,380
we were talking about how the LA cold

1526
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,420
is so oppressive at night,

1527
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,980
that you have to bring a sweater

1528
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,500
to even make it out after your phantasmag,

1529
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,460
but the Florida weather, which is notoriously perfect.

1530
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,420
That was the story in an episode one month ago.

1531
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,740
Now here you are saying, so hot, so muggy.

1532
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,060
No, it was bad, like, it was a heat wave.

1533
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,900
There we have it.

1534
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,380
This was a unique situation,

1535
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,380
I think is what he's saying. This was unique.

1536
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,860
The rare day of bad Florida weather.

1537
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,300
Extra 15 degrees hotter, extra humidity,

1538
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,260
because everyone has a limit.

1539
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,940
Even Jason and I love humidity, you know,

1540
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,540
you gotta limit, and I don't know,

1541
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,180
we could probably track down exactly

1542
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,940
what the humidity was that day,

1543
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:09,940
if we found the dates.

1544
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,820
Oh, historical weather records?

1545
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,620
If you could find out what day you were tripped.

1546
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,740
Famously, the most humid day.

1547
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,820
Right, it's possible it broke some sort of record.

1548
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,260
The humid apocalypse.

1549
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,100
Right.

1550
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,940
Yeah, thousands of people got muggy to death.

1551
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:23,780
It's possible.

1552
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,700
Their eyes fogged up, and they just walked

1553
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,380
right off of cliffs and into the sea.

1554
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,700
We were there, when we were there in 2019,

1555
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,300
it was kind of a brisk day when we went to Universal,

1556
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,500
and I, at 5 p.m., as the sun was going down,

1557
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,820
did Dudley Do-Right, it got drenched.

1558
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,660
So I had to.

1559
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,300
This is one of the great tales.

1560
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,340
Jason, we know, the socks, of course, of course.

1561
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,420
This is scripture.

1562
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,740
Going into a store asking for just the largest bag

1563
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,060
they had, so I go in the bathroom,

1564
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,060
throw a t-shirt in the wet bag,

1565
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,820
and just put a hoodie on.

1566
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,660
I think you're saying,

1567
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,180
you give me the largest bag you have,

1568
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,980
and then you walk out wearing that.

1569
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:05,820
Yeah.

1570
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,380
It would be warm.

1571
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,860
Theme park hack.

1572
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,300
If you don't want to pay for a poncho

1573
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,260
or a change of clothes, just ask for the biggest bag.

1574
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,140
Like you, it's a bag usually reserved

1575
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,420
for like a big sword prop or something

1576
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,580
in Marvel Super Hero Island.

1577
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,580
It's very long, the bag, and then you could wear that bag.

1578
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,980
We have these for Namor's Trident.

1579
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,260
Yeah, there you go, thank you.

1580
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,820
That's the specific I was missing.

1581
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,980
You know, he's the one swimming through the toilet water

1582
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,700
above the restroom sign.

1583
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,620
Yeah, that toilet prevents Disney

1584
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,460
from making a Namor ride in Orlando.

1585
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,300
That's right.

1586
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,140
It's true.

1587
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:40,980
A what ride?

1588
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,060
Namor, the Submariner.

1589
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:42,900
Namor?

1590
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,740
Yeah.

1591
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,820
He's like Marvel's Aquaman.

1592
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,660
Okay.

1593
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,660
He's got little trunks on, and he's shirtless,

1594
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:52,220
but he's like, he rules over an underwater kingdom,

1595
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:54,660
and he's a dick, and no one likes him.

1596
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,700
But he is plastered outside the bathrooms

1597
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,500
at Islands of Adventure, which now that prevents Disney

1598
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,540
from ever making an Orlando-based Namor ride.

1599
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,380
Wow.

1600
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,220
Yeah.

1601
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,040
Wow.

1602
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,940
Finding Namor.

1603
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:06,780
Yeah.

1604
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,020
Nope.

1605
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,700
Not gonna, he was in Black Panther 2, right?

1606
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,540
I believe.

1607
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,140
Yes, I haven't seen it all.

1608
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,540
I haven't seen Guardians 3, I haven't seen Black Panther 2,

1609
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,380
I haven't seen Ant-Man 3.

1610
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:18,700
I'm so behind.

1611
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,540
Yeah.

1612
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,740
From what I've been hearing,

1613
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,260
you're missing all the best ones.

1614
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,260
Well, that's what I've heard too, but.

1615
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,980
Did you finish X-Men yet?

1616
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,820
No!

1617
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,220
Oh, we have so much to talk about.

1618
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,740
I don't see anything, I don't watch anything.

1619
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,980
I know we have a lot to talk about.

1620
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,580
I'm going to.

1621
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,900
Guys, it's really, and it's not even for the show,

1622
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,740
I'm not going to sit around for an X-Men 97 episode,

1623
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,580
but you guys as friends need to have this moment.

1624
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,980
I agree, I believe we do need to have it.

1625
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,580
This is, you're spitting in Jason's face

1626
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,220
not finishing this show.

1627
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,060
I know.

1628
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,940
And it's not because you're not watching anything,

1629
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,380
because I feel like you're,

1630
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,340
I think you'll still do like.

1631
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,180
Well.

1632
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,820
All right, so just a quick two and a half hour

1633
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,580
Club Random with Alice Cooper.

1634
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,260
But you can do other things while you listen to the wisdom

1635
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,340
from Alice Cooper on a Club Random.

1636
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,180
Yeah.

1637
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,700
No, the visuals are so much a part of it.

1638
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:13,700
You need to take in the colors so murky in his club

1639
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,300
that they don't exist in nature.

1640
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,140
Right.

1641
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:21,620
New colors are being invented by the merging of magenta

1642
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,900
and dark green and smoke gray.

1643
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,740
It's experimental television.

1644
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:29,420
You need to examine the very confusing chairs

1645
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,060
that seem to have very sturdy armrests,

1646
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,420
but they're really like low.

1647
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,260
They are kind of low.

1648
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,180
Well, that's what Richard Dreyfus famously

1649
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,940
sunk into his chair on his Club Random episode.

1650
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,940
All the way down.

1651
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:44,460
And he was like lying down on the chair by the end of it.

1652
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,740
One of the strangest things I've ever seen.

1653
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,780
But yes, no, I can't watch,

1654
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,460
I can't passively watch X-Men

1655
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,020
and I can passively watch Club Random.

1656
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,580
Yeah, yeah.

1657
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,420
So.

1658
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,340
Well, come over, you should go,

1659
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,740
I'm gonna set you up on a date.

1660
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,980
You go to Jason's place.

1661
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,420
You guys sit and watch together.

1662
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,500
On your old TV that I have.

1663
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,660
That is funny, I forgot.

1664
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,660
Jason has my like, what year is it?

1665
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,500
It's 14 year old.

1666
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,340
2010.

1667
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:11,340
It's a 14 year old TV.

1668
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,180
Wow.

1669
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:13,000
Still pretty good, right?

1670
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,840
Yeah, it's still really good.

1671
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,680
I mean, it might as well.

1672
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,700
It is 8, 1080 HD.

1673
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,900
You know, it is a giant.

1674
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:18,940
Is it 1080?

1675
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,780
No, it's not.

1676
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,740
Top of the line.

1677
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,260
Highest resolution there is.

1678
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,580
There's no way, isn't it 720?

1679
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,540
I don't think so.

1680
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,700
Really, I got a 1080 14 years ago?

1681
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,180
Movies look great on it.

1682
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,020
I'm gonna have to look that up.

1683
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:30,860
Maybe that's right.

1684
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,180
Movies look a little too clear on some new TV.

1685
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,020
I don't, there's not time.

1686
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,420
Well, you gotta, there's settings for that.

1687
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,260
Movies are too clear.

1688
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,460
Let's get back.

1689
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,300
Islands.

1690
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,260
Notable, the first Universal park

1691
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,940
to have an original soundtrack.

1692
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,500
You know, Universal Florida is mostly movie.

1693
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,340
Hooray for Hollywood.

1694
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:55,660
And hooray for Hollywood and Back to the Future and E.T.

1695
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:59,140
But this as an original soundtrack,

1696
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,740
many years you could buy it on CD.

1697
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:05,180
Universal recently uploaded it to YouTube.

1698
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,580
It was on Spotify for a short time.

1699
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,940
It is not anymore.

1700
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,020
It's unclear why.

1701
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,860
Can you save it on Apple music?

1702
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,900
I can try.

1703
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,820
But yeah, I love this app.

1704
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:22,100
I was playing the call to adventure, the main theme.

1705
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,940
The only, so years ago I ripped,

1706
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:31,180
I downloaded a bunch of,

1707
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,700
I downloaded the full soundtrack

1708
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:38,700
and I changed the track order in a playlist

1709
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,420
because the track order on the CD

1710
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,260
has you going counterclockwise around the park.

1711
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,300
Where you would start, this is so,

1712
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,900
this is nasty to me.

1713
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,140
Where you would start with Cat in the Hat

1714
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,140
and end at Marvel, that's insane to me.

1715
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,940
You start at Marvel and you end at Cat in the Hat.

1716
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:02,180
This one, I'm curious if listeners feel the same way.

1717
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:05,700
Well does not, does though today

1718
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,900
the rush to get to Harry Potter

1719
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,420
or Velocicoaster change the equation?

1720
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,620
Is that not the priority for a lot of guests today?

1721
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,300
Yeah, I mean, for normal people, yes.

1722
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,820
But for me.

1723
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,100
But you're so, you're an advocate

1724
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,220
of starting with your dessert.

1725
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,220
Yeah, I am.

1726
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,660
Essentially.

1727
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:32,660
My version makes it, your day gets progressively worse

1728
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,580
as you go around.

1729
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:38,820
Are you saying, would you quantify

1730
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,300
Soos Landing as the worst of the islands?

1731
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,460
Well, I was never a real little kid

1732
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,740
and I never had real little kids.

1733
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,580
So I was-

1734
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1735
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,060
You used to be a real little kid.

1736
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,220
You mean when you were at Islands of Adventure?

1737
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,100
When I was at Islands of Adventure, I was like 13.

1738
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:57,300
So I appreciated Dr. Soos.

1739
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,340
I love Dr. Soos, but like-

1740
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,540
But he has a trash ass land

1741
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,180
when it comes to Islands of Adventure.

1742
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:08,180
At 13, I wanted to be at the bankrupt era Marvel island.

1743
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,100
I didn't wanna be-

1744
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,260
But in an adult way of reassessments,

1745
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,260
do you think Soos Landing is the worst

1746
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,420
land at Islands of Adventure?

1747
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:19,980
I, oh, in adult, well, hmm.

1748
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,220
Okay, how about I put it to you like this.

1749
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:23,060
Okay.

1750
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:26,540
I have a missile shooting device

1751
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,740
and it could blow up one of the islands

1752
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,380
and I'm gonna blow up either Toon Lagoon or Soos Landing.

1753
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,980
Oh, Soos Landing in a heartbeat.

1754
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:34,820
All right, well, that's it.

1755
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:35,660
It answers the question to the core.

1756
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,020
Because Toon Lagoon has these one of these,

1757
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,580
like two of the best water rides in the country,

1758
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,460
in the world. Soos Landing is the worst land

1759
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,300
in Islands of Adventure.

1760
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,740
And by default, and I'm sure it's different

1761
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,940
if you have kids, but even then,

1762
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:51,820
is that the strongest little kid land there is

1763
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,740
even on that property, I don't know.

1764
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,540
New DreamWorks thing opening might end up taking it.

1765
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,300
The DreamWorks stuff looks really fun.

1766
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,420
Yeah. Yeah, I agree.

1767
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,780
I gotta get them credit.

1768
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,260
And they've also been, I was saying to Jane,

1769
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,420
like I saw some vloggers and they were going through,

1770
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,740
like, you know, stores had a lot more

1771
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,620
DreamWorks characters merged, like unique merchant stuff.

1772
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:21,660
And I'm like, this makes me more interested in the land.

1773
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,500
Just seeing the commitment that we're going all in.

1774
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,980
We're doing merchandise, we're doing food,

1775
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:31,820
we're doing meet and greets and play area.

1776
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,020
I'm like, well, now I'm interested.

1777
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,140
Now you've got my attention.

1778
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,420
Now I'm interested. Now I'm interested.

1779
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,780
I was worried they wouldn't commit.

1780
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,740
I wanna wear this. And sell some shit.

1781
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:46,740
The troll headband, but it just seemed a lot less generic.

1782
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,420
And when parks, I feel like, commit to that,

1783
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:53,020
it just shows they're like, yeah,

1784
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,740
we're kind of going all out.

1785
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,580
Yeah, sure.

1786
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:59,420
Shrek's farting outhouse slide.

1787
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,580
Fantastic. Great.

1788
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,940
Why could I be mad about that?

1789
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,340
No, it's great.

1790
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,300
I can't find the islands on Apple Music.

1791
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,100
I see it on YouTube, the island soundtrack, excuse me.

1792
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,740
So I don't know, I don't know what happened.

1793
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:16,740
So like 10 years ago, I used probably a weird

1794
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:22,620
like Russian YouTube converter, downloaded the MP3s.

1795
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,940
It had to be, certainly you couldn't do

1796
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,340
one of the very common American ones.

1797
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,020
You had to go Russian.

1798
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,460
You recommended one a few years ago

1799
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,620
that I use a lot nowadays.

1800
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:39,180
But back then, I just couldn't find,

1801
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,820
like, it was just a million pop-ups,

1802
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,460
but I was like, I want these MP3s.

1803
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,180
And you took initiative and you changed it.

1804
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,660
I changed the metadata.

1805
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,500
Wow.

1806
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,860
So it goes in the order I want it to go into.

1807
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,340
Wow, wow.

1808
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:58,060
And how did that work in terms of it being a musical piece

1809
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,020
with emotion and builds?

1810
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,420
I think it worked well.

1811
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:02,380
Okay, okay.

1812
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,220
How often do you listen?

1813
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:06,620
Is it a soundtrack that you listen to now to relax?

1814
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:07,460
Is it something?

1815
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,300
I'll put it on the background every now and then.

1816
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,260
Okay.

1817
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,780
And is it, like, as far as theme park music,

1818
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,660
do you have any sort of ranking

1819
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,540
is this your favorite thing to listen to

1820
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,180
or would you rather listen to a Tomorrowland loop

1821
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,020
or is there anything you prefer?

1822
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,500
Is it just in the mix?

1823
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,140
Well, speaking of, it's in the mix.

1824
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,860
I like the, I have one that's like the Hollywood Studios loop,

1825
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,540
the main drag loop, and that's a lot of old standards.

1826
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,380
Oh, okay.

1827
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,860
That's a rate for Hollywood.

1828
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,300
Yeah, yeah.

1829
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,140
Thank you.

1830
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,620
As long as you're getting a rate for Hollywood somewhere.

1831
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:41,940
Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

1832
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,980
But yeah, this was the first Universal park

1833
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,740
with an original soundtrack.

1834
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:52,860
You could buy it, now you can kind of stream it

1835
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,140
a few places.

1836
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,060
It's on YouTube, yeah.

1837
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,420
It's on YouTube.

1838
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,460
Official uploads are on YouTube,

1839
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:00,020
so the quality is pretty good.

1840
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,780
What's the banger?

1841
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,020
What's the best one?

1842
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,740
I think the main, the call to adventure

1843
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:10,740
and is the last song when you're exiting,

1844
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,260
the adventure continues.

1845
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,100
The adventure continues.

1846
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:15,940
That's at least.

1847
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,100
Oh, that name before Star Tours became that.

1848
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:18,940
Yeah, wow.

1849
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:19,780
Wow.

1850
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,020
So that's something, that's a thing that,

1851
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,940
we always knew your son had good music.

1852
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,140
It's always been the case.

1853
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:26,980
Yes.

1854
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:27,820
We always bonded over the music.

1855
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:28,660
We always bonded over the music.

1856
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,300
In the end, it was about the music.

1857
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,700
Yeah.

1858
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,460
So that's, yeah, that's always been consistent.

1859
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,780
Is that port of adventure, port of entry,

1860
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:37,620
what the hell it's called?

1861
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:38,700
Port of entry, port of entry.

1862
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:43,460
Port of adventure, whatever, what is it called?

1863
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:46,500
The one with the pirates and the palm reader.

1864
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,660
Port of adventure.

1865
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,620
Port of, you made it too interesting.

1866
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:50,460
Port of adventure.

1867
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:51,460
Port of entry.

1868
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,900
Port of adventure is, adventure is better.

1869
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,700
Wow, that's, yeah, port of entry.

1870
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,940
And at the end of the day, it's the port of exit.

1871
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:01,420
The port of, yeah, port of entry and the inland sea.

1872
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,820
Some of these are a little flat, aren't they?

1873
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,900
Yeah, in hindsight.

1874
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,140
They get like dressed up in your mind

1875
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:10,340
because it's like interesting looking

1876
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,700
and there's music and stuff.

1877
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,420
But if you really analyze just the name,

1878
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,820
they are kind of, whatever.

1879
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:17,180
The international hub of walking.

1880
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,500
Take your steps, yeah, please.

1881
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,020
Steps, Stepsville, I don't know.

1882
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,300
This is, Stepsville is better.

1883
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,140
What am I saying?

1884
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,740
Stepsville.

1885
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,100
Yeah, so, I don't know.

1886
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,340
I was watching ordinary adventures

1887
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:39,220
at a video from Universal Beijing, which looks insane.

1888
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:42,540
Like, they just went so big with that park.

1889
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,820
And they, you know, they pointed out like,

1890
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:50,100
oh, you only see so many brand new theme parks

1891
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,220
open in your lifetime.

1892
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,500
You know, Shanghai, Beijing.

1893
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:59,380
But in the 90s, the one, two punch of Animal Kingdom

1894
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:03,180
and Islands of Adventure was so exciting.

1895
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:08,180
And who knew it would take another 26 years

1896
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,980
to get a new theme park in Orlando?

1897
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,620
Yeah, yeah, totally.

1898
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:15,460
Yeah, yeah, they both stopped, didn't they?

1899
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:18,900
Except for, I mean, one stopped seemingly forever.

1900
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,300
And, but Universal at least is back

1901
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,700
with something pretty spectacular.

1902
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,380
And what do you think in terms of,

1903
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,980
do you think it'll, you think it'll be better?

1904
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,580
Is it possible for it to be better to you?

1905
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,260
Can it, can it dethrone Islands of Adventure

1906
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,820
for you personally? Epic.

1907
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,740
Epic Universe. Yeah.

1908
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:39,540
I don't know if it can dethrone

1909
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,220
just because I have so many fond memories

1910
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,980
and such of fondness for Islands of Adventure.

1911
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:48,580
But there is a lot of cool stuff

1912
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:50,940
seemingly coming to Epic Universe.

1913
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:55,140
Just that center of the park, this celestial park.

1914
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:59,780
I'm like, I might be most interested in that

1915
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,500
just to see like what- We're gonna have to drag him

1916
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,580
through one of these pipes.

1917
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,860
He doesn't wanna go through a pipe.

1918
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,420
He's going celestial.

1919
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,660
Oh, there's a pipe at the entrance,

1920
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:11,820
but the Kronos is above it, so.

1921
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:14,740
Well, the Kronos is good. What's the but?

1922
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:15,860
Does the Kronos make trouble?

1923
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,500
No, the Kronos is cool.

1924
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,140
Oh, oh, okay. I'm into the Kronos.

1925
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,780
So you're getting a pipe no matter what.

1926
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,660
If you're in there, you already got a pipe.

1927
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:25,220
I just like the landscape architecture

1928
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,780
of like all the greenery and all the water and stuff.

1929
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:32,060
Okay, Jason, I have my missile launcher again.

1930
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,060
And now the missiles are trained

1931
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:38,220
on Toon Lagoon and Jurassic Park.

1932
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,660
Well, I thought this was gonna be your bullet.

1933
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,180
It's Islands of Adventure Epic Universe.

1934
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:48,020
I thought this was smaller stakes than I would imagine,

1935
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:48,860
so we have more questions.

1936
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,060
I thought it was gonna be Epic Universe Lands.

1937
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,540
Okay, fine. I'm gonna change my question.

1938
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:58,140
Toon Lagoon is in the crosshairs on one.

1939
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:03,140
And then let's say Monster Land in New Epic Universe

1940
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,140
is in the other.

1941
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,660
No, that's too hard. That's too hard.

1942
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,220
You gotta make a decision. Choose, choose.

1943
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,060
You gotta make a decision.

1944
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:10,900
It's going to your head.

1945
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,500
The missile's going into you.

1946
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,540
Sorry, Monster Land, I don't know what you are yet.

1947
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,260
I don't know what you are yet.

1948
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:18,460
Okay, all right.

1949
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,340
Now quickly answer me. Is there any scenario?

1950
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,140
Dracula doesn't have a cape.

1951
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,820
That's a good reason, yeah.

1952
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,700
Okay, now the missiles are different.

1953
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,060
The missiles transform things.

1954
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:31,380
They terraform. They don't necessarily just blow up.

1955
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,220
Oh.

1956
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:35,020
There's, okay, so the terraforming missile

1957
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:38,820
is trained at Hollywood Studios Entranceway.

1958
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:42,820
It'll be changed into, let's just call it,

1959
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,540
it's gotta be something sort of boring,

1960
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,260
so it's gotta be like, hmm.

1961
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:52,260
It'll be, let's just call it Office Land.

1962
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,660
And it doesn't have to be based on the American office

1963
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,660
or anything, the TV show,

1964
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,540
but just it's like sort of office buildings.

1965
01:10:58,380 --> 01:10:59,660
You take away the old Hollywood theme.

1966
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,500
It's still the stuff in Hollywood Studios.

1967
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,340
You're turning it into Scranton?

1968
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,380
Wait, I'm confused.

1969
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,580
Why is there Office Land?

1970
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,780
I'm just trying to give Jason a choice,

1971
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:07,700
where Hollywood Studios,

1972
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,700
he loses his beloved old Hollywood theme.

1973
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,380
It turns into a much more drab sort of Main Street

1974
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:15,620
that's maybe much more modern.

1975
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,660
It all looks like Apple Store aesthetic.

1976
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,820
Let's say that instead of Office.

1977
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:20,860
So everything is sort of like,

1978
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,540
it looks like an Apple Store and it looks new,

1979
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,100
and they've completely gotten rid of

1980
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,740
any of the old Hollywood stuff.

1981
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,300
There's no hooray for Hollywood.

1982
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:29,900
They're playing modern pop music,

1983
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,420
and they renamed the whole park

1984
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:35,060
to Disney's Cool Adventure.

1985
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,380
Okay.

1986
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,660
So that's one of your choices,

1987
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,100
or you blow up Toon Lagoon.

1988
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,980
Well, you know, I don't want to,

1989
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:52,500
I want to give you credit for that very strained idea.

1990
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,500
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1991
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,340
It seemed to be giving you.

1992
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,460
You noticed the strain.

1993
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,220
It seemed like it was hurting you,

1994
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:01,020
trying to come up with generic specifics.

1995
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,660
My brain was smoking.

1996
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,060
I think in that case,

1997
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,340
I would terraform Toon Lagoon.

1998
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:07,180
Really?

1999
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,020
I think maybe.

2000
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:08,860
You found one.

2001
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:09,700
Wow.

2002
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,340
So you would preserve Hollywood Studios as is.

2003
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:14,180
I don't know what I would do.

2004
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:16,300
Just to keep the 40s entrance?

2005
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,380
I don't think I would blow up Toon Lagoon.

2006
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,700
I would turn it into an Apple Store

2007
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,700
over to having Toon Lagoon going, right?

2008
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,540
I think I would too.

2009
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,660
Wow, look at that.

2010
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:25,500
Wow, that's funny.

2011
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:26,980
That's a shocking move.

2012
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:29,940
What that just shows is that we don't care about the 40s

2013
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:31,340
the way Jason cares about the 40s.

2014
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,740
I guess that's true.

2015
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:36,100
The Hollywood that never was and always will be.

2016
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,100
That is what that says, I guess.

2017
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:38,940
Because Apple, you're like,

2018
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:41,380
well, Apple Store's overdone as far as an aesthetic,

2019
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,620
but that's just the entrance away.

2020
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,940
You're not getting rid of Popeye.

2021
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:46,460
I like the Americana.

2022
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,660
I might like the Americana more

2023
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:50,220
than being on a little 40s street.

2024
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:52,380
Americana's now, baby.

2025
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,380
That's modern.

2026
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:54,220
Wow.

2027
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:55,420
Oh, you need that grow then.

2028
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,140
You don't want Hooray for Hollywood.

2029
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:58,980
You want.

2030
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,820
Like a Josh Groban song.

2031
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:02,420
Honestly, I think I do prefer Josh,

2032
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,660
and I don't like Josh Groban at all.

2033
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,660
Well, that's Michael Buble,

2034
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,340
but I would take,

2035
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:10,140
I do like either one better than Hooray for Hollywood.

2036
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:12,500
When it gets to the lines about silly,

2037
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,140
ballyhooey, screwy,

2038
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,340
I think I do not like that song.

2039
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,900
I'm not a big fan of the song Hooray for Hollywood either.

2040
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,620
Wow, it comes out.

2041
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,100
We don't, oh.

2042
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,500
This is supposed to be celebrating your son,

2043
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,980
and I apologize,

2044
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,540
but I'm not a big Hooray for Hollywood.

2045
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,260
I didn't like it when I was a tour guide.

2046
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,300
That was one part I didn't like

2047
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,820
is that you'd end up back there.

2048
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,740
Sometimes you'd have to do 10 minutes on a microphone,

2049
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:36,940
just like, hey, everybody keep heading down the escalator.

2050
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:38,420
Don't stop on the escalator.

2051
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,260
Keep moving.

2052
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:42,140
Remember, you remember how escalators function, right?

2053
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,860
Okay, don't,

2054
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:44,700
remember these are,

2055
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,540
don't let your shoes get torn up at the bottom here.

2056
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,980
It was like a kind of boring thing.

2057
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,300
It was not as fun as the rest of the tour,

2058
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:57,180
and every bit of that was covered by bam, bam, bam.

2059
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:58,860
I don't like Hooray for Hollywood, Jason.

2060
01:13:58,860 --> 01:13:59,700
I'm sorry.

2061
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:00,900
No business like show business

2062
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,460
is a little bit better in my mind.

2063
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,940
Oh.

2064
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,380
Yeah.

2065
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:06,420
It's a lot better.

2066
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,220
I mean, I still love Hooray for Hollywood.

2067
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,020
That's funny that that's like a duh for Jason.

2068
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,260
Yeah, Mike, of course.

2069
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:13,860
No business like show business.

2070
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,860
That's the meanest he's ever been to me.

2071
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,460
Like what's better, eating food

2072
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,860
or shitting it out is diarrhea, dude.

2073
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,660
Everything about it is appealing.

2074
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:24,900
I, look, I like old music,

2075
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,980
but those two, I'm not a big, huge fan of either of them.

2076
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:29,700
Okay.

2077
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,060
Are you reaching for your gun?

2078
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,740
Just my recording gun.

2079
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:36,460
I just, it's not loaded.

2080
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,820
Wow, I can't believe you would get,

2081
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:40,220
you would get rid of Toon Lagoon over that.

2082
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:42,180
That actually kind of blows my mind

2083
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,060
because I thought I was presenting some real hard choice,

2084
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:44,900
but in hindsight, and when Scott pointed it out.

2085
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:47,060
Well, if you ask me again tomorrow,

2086
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:49,580
I'd probably give a different answer.

2087
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:50,420
Oh, really?

2088
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,700
I feel like I'd go back and forth.

2089
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,540
I thought that was going to be,

2090
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:54,900
if you ask me again, you're fucking dead.

2091
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:55,740
I'm sorry.

2092
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:57,420
I will choke you out.

2093
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,220
Dead, I didn't forget.

2094
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,140
We should add something more positive for Jason.

2095
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,660
Yes, please, what else you got, Jason?

2096
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:05,460
We have just shit on his two favorite songs.

2097
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,940
Not counting, I guess number three would be

2098
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:09,780
from the soundtrack.

2099
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,180
Long Way to Tipperary.

2100
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:14,020
And then like one song by Postal Service.

2101
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,500
Yes, such great heights.

2102
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,340
Long Way to Tipperary.

2103
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:18,180
Such great heights, yeah.

2104
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,500
Long Way to Tipperary.

2105
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:22,420
Long Way for Hollywood, no business like show business.

2106
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,260
Jimmy Crack Corn and Muse.

2107
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,220
This is your birthday celebration for your son.

2108
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:35,060
Yeah, for my son.

2109
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,900
What do you want to get out before we wrap up?

2110
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:37,820
I think I got out.

2111
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:38,660
You did?

2112
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,500
Oh, okay.

2113
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,180
I think I hit everything I wanted to hit.

2114
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:44,820
I will say, oh, it hasn't,

2115
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,380
as we're recording it hasn't launched yet,

2116
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:50,700
but there was a podcast coming out on the 28th

2117
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,100
called Recalling the Adventure,

2118
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,500
where they talked to a lot of the show directors

2119
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:59,900
and creative people who worked on islands.

2120
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,140
And I'm very excited to listen to that.

2121
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:02,980
Great.

2122
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,340
Well, can I ask though, going forward,

2123
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,980
as your son turns 25 and he gets older,

2124
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,580
where do you want the Islands of Adventure

2125
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:10,860
to be at in 10 years?

2126
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,260
Where do you want your son to be at at 35?

2127
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,900
What do you want it to look like?

2128
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:15,740
We've heard the rumors.

2129
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:18,500
To look like 1999 forever.

2130
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,980
So your son still lives in the house

2131
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:24,220
and you are not encouraging him to move out?

2132
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:25,900
Well, he moved in the ADU.

2133
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,620
He moved in the guest house.

2134
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,140
Oh, you converted the garage.

2135
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,340
Yeah, converted the garage.

2136
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,180
Right, okay.

2137
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:32,540
So that's the most you want to change,

2138
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:36,060
is garage conversion level, because otherwise.

2139
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:36,900
Yeah.

2140
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:37,740
So even, and even Suzanne,

2141
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:39,820
I certainly miss the storage,

2142
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,700
but you know, you love your kids,

2143
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,500
so you make sacrifices.

2144
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:47,140
Would I rather have my old files or my son?

2145
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,540
Well.

2146
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,380
Well, okay.

2147
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,380
So you don't want a single thing to change.

2148
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:53,620
In fact, you want Lost Continent restored.

2149
01:16:56,460 --> 01:17:01,340
Yeah, I'd like some attractions in Lost Continent.

2150
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:04,700
I mean, I like the vibe of Lost Continent a lot.

2151
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,340
But the rumor, of course, is Zelda.

2152
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:09,140
I think you can-

2153
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:09,960
Is that of course?

2154
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:10,800
I didn't know that.

2155
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,640
Where's Zelda gone?

2156
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,460
Lost Continent.

2157
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,300
Oh, oh no.

2158
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:14,940
So Jason wants it out.

2159
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:17,100
That's what I'm asking.

2160
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:22,100
I think you can merge Hyrule and Lost Continent pretty easily.

2161
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,300
Merge Hyrule and Lost Continent?

2162
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,300
Hyrule is the land that Zelda takes place in.

2163
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,340
I think you don't need that.

2164
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,300
Well, I've outed myself as knowing not one thing

2165
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,940
about Zelda or Zelda coming to this park.

2166
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:33,780
That's the rumor.

2167
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,620
I mean, the rumor.

2168
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,460
What Orlando Informer is.

2169
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:39,300
Pokemon gonna replace Simpsons, that's the rumor.

2170
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,140
Okay, yeah.

2171
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:43,220
In Orlando, or excuse me, Main Universal.

2172
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:46,700
So you're comfortable with Zelda taking it over?

2173
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,740
I think so.

2174
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:51,980
I think they will find a way to keep

2175
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:55,740
Mythos and the Sassy Fountain.

2176
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,380
You think Mythos will last?

2177
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:01,140
Yeah, I think it's pretty popular.

2178
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,220
But they're gonna change it to, if it's Zelda land,

2179
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,060
you gotta have a Zelda theme.

2180
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,700
I think they'll tweak it a little.

2181
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:10,700
But also the exterior of Poseidon's Fury.

2182
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,580
I feel like you don't have to tweak that a lot

2183
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,700
if that's where you're gonna put a big ride.

2184
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,180
I mean, maybe, or it's a show.

2185
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:18,380
There's been rumors of show.

2186
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:19,620
Show, maybe, yeah.

2187
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,220
So you are comfortable with this.

2188
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:25,180
Seuss Landing, would you burn it to the ground?

2189
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:26,460
I don't think so.

2190
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,060
I like Seuss Landing.

2191
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:30,900
I like that they tried to really commit

2192
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,860
to the Seuss aesthetic.

2193
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:38,660
I think it's hard because the very flat color palette

2194
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:43,660
of Dr. Seuss in the Florida sun fades very quickly.

2195
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,180
Well, that's a problem with all the cartoon lands

2196
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,460
is that the colors tend to fade.

2197
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,300
So maybe it's a problem.

2198
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,420
Maybe you gotta get it out of there.

2199
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:52,980
Maybe you gotta replace it with another.

2200
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,020
And I think it's funny that the sun has been

2201
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,700
such a big factor in this episode,

2202
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:01,980
but Florida was regarded as perfect in the Phantasmic episode.

2203
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:05,540
Just think it was an interesting kind of shift of the rules

2204
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,580
that has been fully 180 on.

2205
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:09,260
This isn't just aesthetic purposes

2206
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,500
is that the sun is a problem here.

2207
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,900
Sure, it drains all color from Dr. Seuss,

2208
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,700
but keep in mind, sometimes it gets a little nippy at night.

2209
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,020
One bad day is what Jason was discussing

2210
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,980
when he said it was a hot day.

2211
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:20,820
The only bad day.

2212
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,700
It was bad.

2213
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,860
We were in tank tops and it was bad.

2214
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,540
They were sleeveless.

2215
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:27,620
That's how bad the day was.

2216
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,460
They were sleeveless.

2217
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:31,620
That's a not a regular Sheridan thing, or is it?

2218
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:36,140
When we were kids, I feel like tank tops

2219
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:38,260
and occasionally a muscle shirt.

2220
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:39,100
Oh, okay.

2221
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:39,940
Just cause we were vacationing.

2222
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:43,820
The whole fam in muscle shirts in Florida.

2223
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,660
No, just me and my brother.

2224
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,580
Now, follow up question.

2225
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,700
Do any of the Sheridans have muscles?

2226
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,100
How are you filling out those muscle shirts?

2227
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:58,820
I don't think we're the most muscle-focused clan, no.

2228
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:03,460
They are definitely not muscle-focused, that is for sure.

2229
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,500
So yeah, look, Happy Birthday Island Adventure.

2230
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,020
I wonder what this place looks like in 10 years.

2231
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,500
I wonder if they cling to Marvel

2232
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,540
just so Disney can't get it, or if something does change.

2233
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,940
Who knows?

2234
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,780
But it could look a lot different in 10 years,

2235
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,620
and I wonder, and I'm afraid for you,

2236
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,700
cause if that Marvel land goes away,

2237
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,300
I feel like you will not be able to step foot in this park

2238
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,460
because it'll be too dramatic now.

2239
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,300
I mean, yeah.

2240
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,620
Like, that's the draw.

2241
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:33,340
I think all the focus and money is going

2242
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:35,580
to be the epic universe, though.

2243
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:36,420
But that's true.

2244
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,020
So hopefully Marvel stays around for a while.

2245
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:41,140
And that's really why, ultimately,

2246
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,620
the excitement about epic universe

2247
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,660
is because it'll hopefully keep Islands of Adventure hidden.

2248
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,500
Exactly as it is.

2249
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,700
Never really touched up.

2250
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:48,540
Yeah, yeah.

2251
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:53,540
And it's just my special little boy, my special little guy.

2252
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:54,660
Yes.

2253
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,420
Do you want to wish a happy birthday

2254
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:59,500
to your special little guy, specifically?

2255
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:04,540
Special little guy, I've seen you grow and change

2256
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:06,300
and also not change.

2257
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,900
And I'm so proud of you.

2258
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:13,740
And the fact that you were, apparently,

2259
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:17,140
the last few years, the second most attended theme park

2260
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:19,740
in the world after the Magic Kingdom.

2261
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:20,700
So proud.

2262
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:22,940
Was there an end to that sentence?

2263
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:26,700
Happy birthday, son, and then how about a little kiss?

2264
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,340
All right.

2265
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,060
You survived Podcast The Ride of the Second Gate.

And we're still going to do the pandemonium circus,

2272
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,180
the beetle bailey tightrope.

2273
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:50,180
Beetle bailey on the tightrope is its own thing.

2274
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,220
That'll be sectioned off.

2275
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:52,060
Yeah, right.

2276
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:56,660
Bimbo spinning around in a big tire,

2277
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,620
and then the rest of it will be.

2278
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:01,020
So three episodes, ultimately, about pandemonium circus.

2279
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:01,860
At least.

2280
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,700
Okay, and then I'll, I'm sorry, that won't be here.

2281
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:06,500
That'll be main feed, but something will be here.
