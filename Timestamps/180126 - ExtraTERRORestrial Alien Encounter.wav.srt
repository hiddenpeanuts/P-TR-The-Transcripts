1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Warning, the following podcast is about extra-terrorrestrial alien encounter.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,600
The scariest ride Disney ever built.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,880
Be on the lookout for Tim Curry, Kathy Najimy, Ray J, and Cato Kaelin.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,680
And keep your ears peeled for multiple hair-raising mentions of the beloved character Spinlock.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:43,400
Seize the future on Podcast the Ride.

6
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,320
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast where three men reminisce about what

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,400
good little boys they were.

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,080
My name is Michael Carlson, I'm joined as always with Jason Sheridan.

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
Hello.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm really fumbling, this is the third time I've done the intro.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,040
And Scott Gardner.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,000
And hi.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,240
You powered through it, you got there, and now we're off and running.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,880
Today we're going to talk about Alien Encounter, which has a subtitle of extra-terrorrestrial,

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,000
is that right Jason?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,160
It's a super, in all caps, estrile alien encounter, but also it's one of those, there's like a

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,880
slash in it, like the universe of energy, where, because since 2003 it has been Stitch's

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,520
great escape.

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,480
Although maybe not for much longer.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,400
People wrote us on Twitter and encouraged this as a topic because we thought it might

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
be closing, but Disney says it's maybe not closing.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,000
Disney says it's coming back, yeah.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Was it 2003 or 2004?

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,120
2004, I guess the 2003 to 2004 was the changeover period.

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Oh, okay.

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,720
So they did all of the alterations on the ride.

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,640
They put a beard on the one robot that they couldn't otherwise replace.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,520
We'll get to all that.

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,640
Yeah, we'll get to all that.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,560
But Scott, you had some stuff before, right?

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,040
Oh yeah, well I wanted to take a little of your time to talk about a local Los Angeles

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
attraction.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,120
It's not in a theme park, but it's accessible to anyone who's strolling Hollywood Boulevard,

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,080
and it's a place called Hologram USA.

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,960
Now this is a place, shout out to Jason Walliner who turned me on to this place.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,680
You gentlemen have not been here, but have I told you anything about it?

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,120
No, I don't know anything about it.

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,000
From scratch, Hologram USA.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I think the actual, like extraterrestrial, it's got a more specific title.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,160
If you look at the marquee on Hollywood Boulevard, it says FilmOn.tv Hologram USA Theater.

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Oh boy.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,800
And it's been really big under that Billie Holiday Hologram show.

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,440
This used to be, I think, like a laser show theater?

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Is that right?

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
Or a laserium kind of thing?

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
Oh, it could be the laserium.

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,440
I'm not sure.

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,680
And maybe a porno theater before that.

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,080
I was looking up the site, and I think there's a few weird little seedy theaters on Hollywood

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Boulevard.

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,520
This particular one I think may have been a church right before its conversion into

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,160
a hologram, into the Church of Holograms, the Holy Temple of Holograms.

54
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,680
Was it a porno theater before it was a church?

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,560
I think it did some time as a porno.

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,360
If you're on Hollywood Boulevard, anything new.

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
You were a porno theater at a certain point.

58
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
You were a porno theater, and before that, a newsreel theater that very quickly slid

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,400
into pornos at a certain point.

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,840
And before that, a place where Charlie Chaplin used to live.

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
This is an observation.

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Yeah.

63
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,380
I'll credit our friend Ryan Perez for this, that we were at some bar where he's like,

64
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,480
they told us Charlie Chaplin used to live here.

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,040
And he's like, if I go to one more goddamn place where Charlie Chaplin once lived, I

66
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,360
think everywhere in Hollywood.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,480
I've been to a house that claimed that Charlie Chaplin lived there, yeah.

68
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Worson Wells.

69
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,120
Worson Wells, I feel like also had a similar thing, because Worson Wells was crashing a

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,480
lot later in life.

71
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,040
And I feel like, oh, Worson Wells lived here.

72
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,200
I feel like I've also heard multiple houses of like, Worson Wells died here.

73
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,680
And it's like, this is the third one I've heard about that he died in.

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,080
They were, they all moved around a lot.

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,720
Charlie Chaplin and Worson Wells, the original Pete Holmes.

76
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
It did a lot of crashing.

77
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,120
Yeah, it's so weird.

78
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,920
Is it that these people, is it a lie to get people into your place and give it prestige?

79
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,400
Or is it a, is it just people who heard of urban legend?

80
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,760
I think it's a, yeah, it's a game of telephone.

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Maybe.

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,640
Well, not telephone, I guess, because the names change.

83
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
It doesn't change.

84
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
So I've heard, I've heard Liz Taylor.

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,000
Whispers down the lane, whispers down the line, whatever you call it.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Right.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,840
My friend lives in Liz Taylor's old house.

88
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,560
He lives in the attic.

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,800
And it's just a, it's a, the whole house is just a big dump where a bunch of dudes live.

90
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,040
Although I think they recently moved.

91
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,160
That's a whole nother podcast, but yeah, there's a giant house where like seven people live

92
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,280
in, but it used to at one point be the wonderful Liz Taylor house.

93
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,160
Just her, not her and seven other actresses.

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
She didn't live with seven other dudes.

95
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Seven other dudes, dirty dudes.

96
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,160
No, it was just seven frat guys.

97
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,880
Lived with Liz Taylor.

98
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,560
She married all of them at once.

99
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,400
Her seventh husband was seven guys.

100
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Yeah.

101
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Okay, so anyway, whatever this once was today is the thriving film on.tv hologram USA theater.

102
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,520
And so this has been up for like a year or so on Hollywood Boulevard.

103
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,720
If you've, if you live in Los Angeles, you may have passed by this marquee that says

104
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,080
Billy hologram, Billy hologram.

105
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,280
That's why she was chosen was the proximity of her name to hologram.

106
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,360
Billy holiday hologram show.

107
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,280
And if you watch the ads for it, it advertises itself as being from the makers of the Tupac

108
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
hologram.

109
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,680
So that adds it some, some prestige and some pedigree.

110
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,040
But when you go into this place, well, first of all, several things I bought an E ticket.

111
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,440
This is an event that you're, the, your minimum of new hologram show that you're getting is,

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,680
is, uh, is an hour of material.

113
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
That's how it's presented.

114
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,600
You get an hour long hologram show and that is supposed to be $30 through some trickery

115
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,200
and means I got to do it for free.

116
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,360
But the, but then you go in and they try to like, they don't have the technology to scan

117
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,840
your ticket correctly.

118
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,360
Like the E scan doesn't work, which gets you very excited for the hologram technology waiting

119
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
just behind.

120
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,600
Uh, another weird red flag at this place.

121
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,760
They have a CBD oil popcorn.

122
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Hell yeah.

123
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Yeah.

124
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
Oh, CB.

125
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Okay.

126
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Uh, I don't know about this Jason lit up.

127
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Yeah.

128
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,720
So CBD oil is the, uh, non psychoactive, uh, part of marijuana THC.

129
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,120
CBD oil, uh, uh, widely like apple cider vinegar, uh, uh, people say has a lot of positive health

130
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,040
benefits as an anti-inflammatory as a sleep aid, uh, unprepared statement from you.

131
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,720
Uh, yeah, this is, I've been reading it.

132
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,320
Well, I have a CBD vape and it does, it is great for sleeping.

133
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,560
And it, it, it actually like when my shoulder has hurt before it's like helped, helped with

134
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
that.

135
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,600
I have that shoulder, like, uh, that shoulder, elbow ache we all do from holding our phones

136
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
all the time.

137
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Oh yeah.

138
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
That's just stress injury.

139
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Well, here we get, well, we're in the Jason wheelhouse.

140
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,640
So, so my, so they're selling CBD pop because the other thing about CBD oil, like up into

141
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,080
a certain point, you could buy a pretty weak version of it at like whole foods.

142
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
Like you could buy it as like an herbal.

143
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,400
I went to some hipster restaurant that had CBD oil cocktails, which, uh, I gotta say,

144
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,400
they've cost about as much as the hologram show and did absolutely nothing to me whatsoever.

145
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Yeah.

146
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,280
The other thing is like CBD oil, if you buy it, like if you have a medicinal marijuana

147
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,080
cart or I guess a recreational, anyone can get it now.

148
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,800
It is more expensive.

149
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,600
I don't know if it's more expensive.

150
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,240
Are you lobbying for the CBD industry?

151
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,320
I've never heard you high on CBD right now.

152
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
I'll take freebies of any listeners.

153
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,760
I've never heard you speak so eloquently about anything.

154
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,400
It's a current interest.

155
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Oh wow.

156
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,600
Well, the theaters got you covered.

157
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:03,200
CBD oil popcorn, which I'm sure works and is not just a bizarre scam that this place

158
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
is pulling.

159
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,840
Anyway, so the, the, just to get into the meat of it, you walk in and there is a, uh,

160
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,320
there's just shows happening all day.

161
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,120
First of all, so you get an hour's worth of hologram material, but also you could just,

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,920
it's open from noon to 10 PM.

163
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,560
So if you were a Hollywood Boulevard homeless person and you could get together $30 or probably

164
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,440
just go into the lobby, talk to the two stoners behind the registers, say, look over there

165
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,560
and then just go and sneak into the theater the other way.

166
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,040
You could, you've got a place to sleep for 10 solid hours in very comfortable chairs.

167
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,160
Did they not make you leave after the show?

168
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,320
No, you could stay in the hologram theater as long as you want.

169
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Okay.

170
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,840
You start at 10, you start at noon and you're in all day.

171
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,680
Uh, so there's just a constantly going loop of hologram attractions and also hologram

172
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,320
trailers, which is very exciting to see.

173
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,560
But the main show that you come in and watch is a Billy hologram, Billy holiday.

174
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,800
Keep doing that.

175
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,440
Billy holiday hologram show.

176
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,800
Uh, and you can immediately tell that this is not the same thing as the Tupac hologram.

177
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:10,320
It is not a Tupac's face melded onto a, a realistic, uh, living body.

178
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,320
It's you, they just got an actress to play Billy holiday and she just performs.

179
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:22,380
It's like watching a still shot of a concert filmed over black, uh, and, and just projected

180
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,880
life size in front of you.

181
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,160
It's like watching a concert video with no cuts is basically what you do.

182
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,400
So and she does lip sync the real Billy holiday songs, the recordings of them.

183
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,360
So you're watching a live concert of pre-recorded Billy holidays.

184
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
So he's not by real Billy holiday at all.

185
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,520
It's just some actress and also like, but sometimes there are magical elements.

186
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,200
Like when she'll start a song, her band will magically appear in a puff of smoke.

187
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,060
But there's another part where just a like modern white guy roadie comes in and gives

188
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,520
her a mic stand and then walks away.

189
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,800
And I can't tell if that was a joke of some kind or just like a way to poke through the

190
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
magic or if it was just carelessness.

191
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,800
Um, it's, it's one of the strangest things I've ever seen.

192
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Uh, but I actually wasn't there for the Billy holiday hologram show.

193
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,840
I was there for something else called, uh, let me make sure I get the title right.

194
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,120
Ray J and Kato's sexy Hollywood freak show.

195
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Oh good.

196
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
What?

197
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,960
It was a show co-hosted by Ray J who I believe was in the Kim Kardashian sex tape.

198
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,280
Uh, also on a show called for the love of Ray J and then, uh, Kato Kaelin, uh, the America's

199
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,840
most famous, uh, house gas eventful crashing that ever occurred.

200
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,680
He took the mantle from Orson Welles.

201
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Yeah.

202
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
He took the mantle from Orson Welles.

203
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,160
Um, so yeah, I don't know why these guys, we kept questioning what, where do they know

204
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,280
each other from?

205
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,640
Why are they friends?

206
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,600
Um, they come out and they're wearing sparkly spangled costumes.

207
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,100
Uh, and they do a lot of talking over each other material, the comedic crux of which

208
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,000
is calling each other gay.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,320
Like Oh, more like gay J, you know, more like Gato Galen.

210
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,800
Do they really say gay J?

211
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Yeah.

212
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,040
Wait, wait, and this is called, they call him gay J.

213
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,160
This is hollig filmed holograms doing.

214
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Yeah.

215
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,240
It's something that is, it is life-sized, but just projected.

216
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,200
And by the way, just this illusion, uh, it does nothing for you.

217
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
Nobody would walk in and go, wow.

218
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,760
It's you're just watching.

219
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,800
Like the way these things work, it's an illusion called pepper's ghost, uh, where there's,

220
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,880
it's very simple where something's projected from down on the floor and then via angled

221
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
glass.

222
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,080
It looks like it's, there's kind of a ghostly effect on it.

223
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,040
And, and this is in a lot of Disney rides.

224
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,760
It's basically how they do, uh, there was a, in the rock and roller coaster or they're

225
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,800
using it in the, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

226
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,600
Uh, the fast and furious attraction at universal has this very stiff part where a bunch of

227
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,760
like people, really well lit party goers all dance in one place.

228
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,160
You can tell they're very careful to not move from the one spot they're on.

229
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,520
Uh, so anyway, this is a thing that would be like a part of a separate Disney attraction.

230
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,840
It would just be like one thing in the line of a Disney ride, but they're masquerading

231
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,040
it as its own event and you're supposed to pay $30 for it.

232
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,440
You're supposed to pay like a third of a day at Disneyland to go watch.

233
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,760
And then, and then what's the thing gets going?

234
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:38,240
It's like after this, this, uh, like unlistenable clap trap between Ray J and Kato, then you're

235
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,120
watching, uh, then it's like, uh, it is a literal freak show where guys are banging

236
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,560
nails into their nose and there's like, uh, there's burlesque stuff.

237
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,320
There's sexy girls in forties lingerie spinning around on a, uh, like a carousel horse with

238
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,720
a bunch of dangly things coming down.

239
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,500
It's like, it's very lame Hollywood Boulevard kind of, uh, uh, yeah, like the, the freaks

240
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,680
and kooks and, uh, uh, like, Ooh, it's a little bit of Randy.

241
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:15,760
Um, but there's this stuff like, like the, the screen is split into three thirds and

242
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,200
like, here's a guy banging nails into his nose.

243
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,440
Here's a guy, here's a sword swallower and here's a sexy lady just dancing around and

244
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,160
those things don't, uh, interact with each other whatsoever.

245
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,880
There's just like three unrelated freak shows all going at the same time.

246
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,760
Um, it's, it's, it's one of the, one of the odd, Oh, on the website, they describe it

247
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,480
as having featuring many of Los Angeles is best alternative performers.

248
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,960
They miss, but they drop a lot of letters from all.

249
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,760
Um, and, and then it's just, and then it's, uh, it's over in 17 minutes after you've paid

250
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,520
$30 for 17 minutes of content and then it loops.

251
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Uh, yeah.

252
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,240
And then you see the sleaze again.

253
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Yeah.

254
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
If you stayed in there, you would get to watch it at least 10 times in a row.

255
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Wow.

256
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Watched it all day.

257
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,960
The big story with this thing is that it was, it's concocted by a Greek billionaire named

258
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:14,500
Alki David and, uh, Alki seems to be a very litigious man.

259
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,960
So I don't want, I want to be careful with what I say about him.

260
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,000
I want to really, really carefully say that, uh, he is very hot and cool and, uh, very

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
cut.

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,400
He clearly works out a lot and I think he's in, he runs a perfectly legitimate business.

263
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,200
Uh, that being said, uh, other people do not feel this way.

264
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,760
He's been sued many times.

265
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,000
He's currently, he basically like bought the, he did not do the Tupac hologram.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,880
He bought the technology after the fact so that now he can claim he's the owner of the

267
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,120
Tupac hologram.

268
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,360
No, he had nothing to do with it, but he's gone out of his way.

269
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,020
He's sued people who try to do holograms.

270
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,600
He sued Fox after Matt Groening appeared with a hologram Homer at Comic-Con.

271
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Wow.

272
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,640
He had something.

273
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,560
Uh, meanwhile he's getting sued by other people.

274
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,760
He was sued by a company called Roy's boys, which is literally the sons of Roy Orbison

275
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,280
who asked him to come up with a hologram of Roy Orbison.

276
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,240
And from the sounds of the synopsis of the lawsuit, he just didn't do it.

277
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,560
They would call and just like, uh, hang on, give me six months.

278
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
They check in again.

279
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,640
This is like the dark side of fame right here.

280
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,400
Like this is, this is something else.

281
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,440
The dark side is screwing over Roy's boys.

282
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,920
I mean, this is like, uh, Scott.

283
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,800
Buying the, buying the rights to the ghosts of dead celebrities.

284
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Yeah.

285
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Yeah, I guess that's true.

286
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
And either do it poorly or not at all.

287
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,080
Uh, Scott, I don't think I told, when you said you want to talk about this, uh, I decided

288
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,400
to say this for the podcast.

289
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,720
Uh, my experience recently with hologram USA almost simultaneously as you were, you posted

290
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,320
like some pictures or some video clips from there, uh, uh, you know, over the holidays.

291
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,080
And I was back visiting family in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

292
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,800
And uh, there was a night, I don't know if it was the same night, but it was around the

293
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,000
time you had gone to this.

294
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,760
Uh, I was watching, I think it was like one of those affiliates that's different in every

295
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,680
city, like my network TV.

296
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,880
So it's like my Cincinnati, my Philadelphia, my Los Angeles.

297
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Oh, sure.

298
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Sure.

299
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,440
Uh, uh, I think they were playing like two of the Daniel Craig Bond movies back to back

300
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,080
every commercial break I saw there was a commercial for a hologram USA on Hollywood Boulevard.

301
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
No kidding.

302
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:43,800
I went back at home back in Jersey and I don't see, I have cable in LA.

303
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,240
I don't see commercials for it and I live a mile and a half, two miles from it.

304
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:57,400
But I saw a commercial every commercial break and I remember the puff of smoke guy.

305
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,560
The big band appear behind the big band appear.

306
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,360
The best was when they did a time lapse of them building a stage for the hologram, but

307
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,340
because there is nothing on stage, it looks like they just time lapse the construction

308
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,680
of an empty state.

309
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,680
They took, they took black and made it more black.

310
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:24,160
They put 10 layers of black paint, but they, they showed it so many times.

311
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:31,120
Oh, I'm glad you, between clips of quantum in between quantum of solids segments.

312
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Weird.

313
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,000
Uh, if you Google Alki David harass, there are many pages of results right away.

314
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh boy.

315
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's a good sign.

316
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,040
Again, allegedly I'm not saying anything.

317
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,120
I'm just talking about your brother.

318
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,680
We love he's also an actor.

319
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Oh yes.

320
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,240
I'm looking it up on a Wikipedia.

321
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,440
He's directed a bunch of films and he's in all of the films as well.

322
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,160
And he'll be next to a more famous actor and they will present him right after as if you

323
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
know him.

324
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:05,040
So in the trailer it's like Judd Nelson, Alki David, they very confidently say, you know

325
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,800
Alki, you all know that.

326
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,440
The last thing he was in was Bob Thunder internet assassin and he played Mr. Network.

327
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:19,040
Scott is Dr. Modem is this a fever dream you had that you create?

328
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
You became a Tulpa.

329
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,520
It became an idea that became real.

330
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,120
It became like a person.

331
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm starting to wonder that.

332
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Yeah.

333
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,360
It had a very, uh, it also like it's, it smelled weird in the place.

334
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,000
Like paint was recently put in.

335
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,160
So maybe there was a, maybe there's a paint huffing aspect to this.

336
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,260
Maybe I just, was it the popcorn?

337
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,680
I think I took that CBD oil popcorn, watered into somewhere else.

338
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,840
Did they also have regular popcorn?

339
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Was that an option?

340
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
No, just yeah.

341
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Okay, just CBD oil.

342
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,160
So if you took a kid in there and you were paying attention.

343
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,680
You're gonna have to get real mellow.

344
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,600
You should not take a kid on Hollywood Boulevard.

345
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Well, you shouldn't take a kid.

346
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Yeah, not at all.

347
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't think you should take a kid anywhere near anything Alki David is doing.

348
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,400
I think he could be a good guest though on the show.

349
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,920
I think maybe we should try.

350
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Yeah.

351
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,220
Alki, if you're listening, please.

352
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,720
If you're listening to the definitely not a special cut of the episode that we sent

353
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,480
you that deleted a lot of materials.

354
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Yeah, yeah.

355
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,120
If you're listening to the regular audio that we have sent you, please come on.

356
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
Hook us up.

357
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
Hook Jason up with some CBD oil popcorn.

358
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Oh boy.

359
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Oh yeah.

360
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,760
Let's have a real chill conversation about your armada of holograms and your upcoming

361
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,680
hologram shows, including soul legend, Jackie Wilson also played by some actor you've never

362
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:41,640
heard of and the real not say not a deceased person, not CGI and not an actor.

363
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,360
The real John Lovitz will soon be doing the first ever hologram comedy show.

364
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Hologram comedy show.

365
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,400
He's taking a break from his residency.

366
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,080
He currently has a two man residency in Vegas with Dana Carvey.

367
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,440
And he's under lifetime contract at the laugh factory on sunset.

368
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,800
So he's gotten himself in a lot of messes and another one now is the hologram show.

369
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,320
Maybe the hologram is a way to ensure that he can perhaps fake his own death, but not

370
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,400
have to get sued by the laugh factory.

371
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,800
I think he's probably just trying to get back to to try it.

372
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,320
It's tie it back into our normal subject matter.

373
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,160
He's trying to get back to the John Lovitz comedy club, the former city walk.

374
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Yeah.

375
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Hollywood.

376
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Okay.

377
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,440
He's just trying to get the gang back together, get the John Lovitz comedy club reopened,

378
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,120
at the Kevin Smith podcast lounge in there.

379
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,440
Was it named after Kevin Smith?

380
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,480
Yeah, there was the Kevin Smith.

381
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Was the Smod Castle?

382
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,280
No, the Smod Castle used to be on Santa Monica Boulevard.

383
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Right.

384
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
By where we used to do improv shows.

385
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
By where we used to do improv.

386
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,400
It was a black box theater where people used to do improv and take classes.

387
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,720
And then it became the Smod Castle.

388
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,120
And now it's back to being a black box theater where people do improv.

389
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:58,680
Boy, the commonality of all this, if anyone listening is not already in Hollywood and

390
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
or in Los Angeles.

391
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
We're sorry.

392
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Come on out.

393
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,040
Come and say, look what you're missing.

394
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,200
You're missing the Smod Castle.

395
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,580
You're missing Hologram USA.

396
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,120
If you move here and don't immediately find a place to live, I'm telling you, Hologram

397
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,960
USA, you could probably hide in the rafters for a couple of months.

398
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
You can crash there for a while.

399
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Yes.

400
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
You can crash at Liz Taylor's house.

401
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,240
Live where Elizabeth Taylor and Orson Welles and Pete Holmes all lived once.

402
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
So there you go.

403
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Hologram USA.

404
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Check it out.

405
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,000
Uh, yeah, it gets five hologram stars from me.

406
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Scott Gartner.

407
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Great.

408
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's great.

409
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You can quote that, Alki.

410
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
All right.

411
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,320
We'll be right back.

412
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,400
Welcome back to podcast the ride.

413
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,480
We are now going to talk about an attraction that I have to confess I've never been on

414
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,160
because I was too scared.

415
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
What?

416
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
Alien encounter.

417
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,940
This is a revelation here.

418
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,640
Let me tell this quick story.

419
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,680
Uh, I saw, I was reading Disney adventure magazine.

420
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,760
We were going to Disney world.

421
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
It was a big trip.

422
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,160
I was very excited about it and I was reading about alien encounter and I kept talking about

423
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
it.

424
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,440
I kept telling my mom alien encounter is coming, but it's not going to be open when we're there

425
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
because it said, you know, opening whatever July.

426
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,840
I don't remember when it all right.

427
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,520
Uh, and I was very excited about it.

428
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,180
So we got down to Disney world.

429
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,080
We were at tomorrow land and my mom went, the ride is open.

430
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
This is crazy.

431
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:28,960
It was soft opening and my face dropped and I said, I, I, I don't want to go on it.

432
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
And I didn't.

433
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,080
Am I, my dad and my little sister did go on it.

434
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,560
I didn't, I sat outside and was just a little coward.

435
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
I was too scared to go on it.

436
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,360
It's a shame that I carry with me to this day and I'm revealing it on the show right

437
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,080
now because I am the polar opposite of this.

438
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,640
This is an all timer for me.

439
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
No, I know.

440
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,440
And I've never told, I've never, I've known you for almost 10 years now.

441
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,760
I've never told you that I didn't go on any of the other multiple times.

442
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,160
I'm ashamed of myself when I would go like this, this as a, as a kid, like when I was

443
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,600
like what, like 10 to 14 and we would go down like tomorrow, like that was my home base

444
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:16,280
because alien encounter, uh, the people mover and carousel of progress I could, and space

445
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,840
mountain, uh, before it started to beat the shit out of me.

446
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,800
Uh, I would just, just, I could be there just for hours, for hours.

447
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,600
And I would like run back there.

448
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,240
My family would be like, uh, we're going to go back to the hotel.

449
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,040
And it's like, all right, I'll be back in a few hours.

450
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,160
The park closing in 15 minutes, but I can knock out one more of these.

451
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Like you're forget, Hey, I want to make sure we don't, uh, forget.

452
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,720
Let's give a shout out to the visionarium.

453
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,120
We got the timekeeper and the vision.

454
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,640
I love the timekeeper too.

455
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,760
I love the timekeeper and I was sad when that went away.

456
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
Yeah.

457
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,360
Like tomorrow, the redo of tomorrow land, which came 94.

458
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Was that like tomorrow?

459
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,400
Land 94 and sunny eclipse.

460
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Don't forget.

461
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Well, sunny eclipse.

462
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,160
We all can agree on there was so much for anyone who doesn't know.

463
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Yeah.

464
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,160
They redid tomorrow land in 1994 at Disney world and added a lot of mythology.

465
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,640
They made it a land that all, it all connected.

466
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,640
The people, right.

467
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,760
It was no longer called the people mover.

468
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,280
It was called the tomorrow land transit transit authority.

469
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,200
It was like the bus that took you around to the different places like the tomorrow land

470
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,720
convention center, which is where alien encounter takes place.

471
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,440
They would, they justified every, why am I, why was I excited about this?

472
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
I loved it.

473
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
I, that's right.

474
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Into a municipality.

475
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,720
I, I, I got a new phone and it, for whatever reason didn't transfer over.

476
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,680
But my ringtone is, uh, the old man going now arriving rocket tower Plaza.

477
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,080
Oh, rocket tower Plaza.

478
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
That's right.

479
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,520
And it's just, and it's this old guy.

480
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,960
I forget the actor's name, but he, he was the voice of a lot of Disney rides for a while.

481
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,640
At some point they switched it out and it was like a young surfer dude.

482
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,880
And the last time I wrote it, like a few years ago, I was just so mad that they got rid of

483
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,120
this old man talking about all the different public transit.

484
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,720
Your favorite character, an old man.

485
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
I loved it.

486
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,520
But like alien encounter, I, it was so great.

487
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
I'm sorry.

488
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
It scared the hell out of me.

489
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
It scared.

490
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I wish I went on it.

491
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
I wish I had the courage.

492
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
I would go on it now.

493
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,840
Every year I had to re-psych myself up.

494
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
But like,

495
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Ritz, you were scared.

496
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
Oh, I was scared.

497
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
Yeah.

498
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,040
No, I was scared little boy, but I just like, I was a coward.

499
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,240
I was just a coward.

500
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,880
I couldn't, and no one like forced me.

501
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,480
My mom should have gone, go on it.

502
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
Somebody should have said something.

503
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
Yeah.

504
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
I also, I, same thing.

505
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,760
I haven't been on it either.

506
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,880
I'm not, I don't feel tormented about it.

507
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
I feel fine.

508
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,080
I've made peace with the, um, me being a little and scared.

509
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,000
Um, uh, I don't know.

510
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,280
I also, here's something I realized when I was looking at the timeline of the attraction.

511
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,320
Um, I realized that, so there was, uh, the, the, this attraction opened and it was, it

512
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,600
was too, too scary originally.

513
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Yes.

514
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Too scary.

515
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Too scary.

516
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,840
And it closed for six months to make it a little less scary.

517
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,840
A little less scary.

518
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
It was still horrifying.

519
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Yeah.

520
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Yeah.

521
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
I don't think they, they undid that.

522
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,400
And I feel like Michael Eisner too, was like, people are like, this is too scary.

523
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,200
And he's like, I think we can make some minor story tweaks.

524
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
And honestly, I don't think it's scary enough.

525
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,240
That's always the rumor.

526
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,280
He wanted to punish people more, but apparently the, the version, the, the kind of testing

527
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,820
out version, the beta version of alien encounter was only open for six weeks.

528
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,600
And I realized I was there in six weeks.

529
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,960
So I could have been, I might've been there too.

530
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
I might've been there too.

531
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,040
There was, it would have been like Christmas, 1994.

532
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
No, I wasn't.

533
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,640
And then it officially, the grand opening was in the summer of 95.

534
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,440
I was there before that opening.

535
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
It was soft over for like on and off for like six months.

536
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,600
It seemed like it was one of those.

537
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,280
I think when attractions are retooled, they don't get away with it in the same way that

538
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,320
movies do.

539
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,820
When you hear that a movie is having a lot of trouble and reshoots that could indicate

540
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,480
that it's a big mess and it's having a lot of problems, but it can come back full force

541
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,640
and be better than ever.

542
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,320
But I feel like if a theme park attraction is trouble, it almost never gets over that.

543
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,600
There's like, there's just an asterisk with it, like the rocket rods, another space.

544
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

545
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
That's right.

546
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,600
You know, they had to work out the kink of it killing people.

547
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Yeah.

548
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,240
They had to stop that, which it hasn't done that in a while, but like there's never a

549
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
line.

550
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
No one really cares about it.

551
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Like it was just a heart.

552
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,240
It was a harbinger of things to come.

553
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,440
All kind of in sort of the same era, roughly like 90s, early 2000s.

554
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
Yeah.

555
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,640
A lot of like Disney's attempts at scare attractions and thrill attractions have had a lot of trouble

556
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
in the recent past.

557
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:40,640
I mean, I think this is easily the scariest, like big budget, like big two Disney and Universal

558
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,960
theme park ride that they ever made.

559
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,720
And for me, like I really don't like to be scared that much, but this was like the exception

560
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,960
because like, did you guys watch a ride through of it?

561
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,080
Yeah, but you can't YouTube ride through.

562
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Yeah.

563
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,480
Shout out once again to Martin's vids who has a pretty good recreation of, you know,

564
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:10,160
has the source audio and has like a recreation of the pre-show and the ride itself.

565
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,800
It's a dark, not only is it scary, it's like very cynical.

566
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,440
Like it's a very dark ride.

567
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,280
There's a lot of dark jokes.

568
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:24,600
Tim Curry is like a very mean robot, a very mean animatronic who like tortures a very

569
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,080
cute animatronic, Skippy.

570
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:33,600
Like I can't stress enough, this watching the ride through of this is similar to me of like

571
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,600
watching classic Simpsons episodes where it's like, I may not remember it like every joke

572
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,280
in it, but it's just like, I am remember it, remember a lot of it like in my bones, like

573
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
subconsciously.

574
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Wow.

575
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,960
And like this is your favorite ride of this ride.

576
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,560
It's probably my favorite ride.

577
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:57,560
This in the, the adventurers club, like this of like built into the DNA of my personal

578
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
interests.

579
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,160
And you're sitting here with two wieners who wouldn't ride it.

580
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Should we leave you?

581
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,240
Do you want to just, we'll just go outside for a while.

582
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,080
Don't take the dog for a walk.

583
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,200
I was pretty busy leading up to this recording and it's probably for the best because I feel

584
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,120
like I would have gotten obsessed reading about this.

585
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,280
You would have been our first four hours, like going through a real emotional journey.

586
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,680
You would have bullied the two of us when we were little.

587
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Probably would have.

588
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,480
Cause another thing I liked about the ride was Stan.

589
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,600
Well, for one thing it emptied in into a gift shop.

590
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
I believe it's still there.

591
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,920
The merchant of Venus, uh, which in the day used to sell alien encounter merch, which

592
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,640
was all, I also was very into like, I have a lot of the merch.

593
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,960
I thought it was a very cool design.

594
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,840
What merch do you just with the logo or was there like a plush?

595
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:53,720
Uh, Oh, I have, uh, still in the box action figures, uh, one in, in, and the packaging

596
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,960
is the tube is the teleportation.

597
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,760
And so one is the monster.

598
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:04,160
And then the other is a set of Skippy sir, the robot, and then fried Skippy.

599
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,840
Uh, and I had no idea these existed.

600
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,060
I would, I would like these actually, though I would have to, if I had them and displayed

601
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,080
them in my home, I'd have to like write out a note that said, uh, this is from an attraction

602
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,000
that was too scary for me to ever ever.

603
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah.

604
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,440
Uh, I'm not a true fan of this.

605
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,160
The sign out front, uh, uh, the sign out front with the alien that says alien encounter and

606
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:32,880
like sort of a weird, I don't know, metal thing, uh, which is also next to the sign

607
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,360
that says excess tech, which is the fictional company in it.

608
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,960
I have both like lapel pins of the alien encounter logo.

609
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,280
I have a t-shirt of the excess tech logo that Mike and I, like we ordered up and Scott too.

610
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,720
Uh, uh, Disney puts out these throwback shirts every now and then.

611
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,360
And we, they're called, they're, they're a line of shirts called yester years.

612
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Yeah.

613
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,000
And sometimes we'll pull our orders.

614
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
So we save money on the ship.

615
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,080
Uh, sometimes it's like I to get one free.

616
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,440
And so we split the costs and, uh, uh, yeah.

617
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,520
And I, as soon as this line came out, we're like, oh, that, that Disney shopping village

618
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
one looks cool.

619
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm like, order me the excess tech one now.

620
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,160
Uh, uh, a real chairman clench.

621
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,720
Uh, yeah, it was a real, we should maybe back up.

622
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,120
I was going to say the basics of the, because like, my wife didn't know.

623
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,680
I mean, I'm going to need to lay down.

624
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Let's yeah.

625
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,920
Jason's overheating between the marijuana oil and the popcorn and alien encounter.

626
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,480
Jason may have 108 temperature right now and we may have to rush them to the hospital because

627
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,280
there's steam venting from his ears.

628
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,040
So the, so the, yeah, the origin of this ride is that they were trying to do an alien ride,

629
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,560
the movie alien or aliens.

630
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,520
Uh, they were going to do something like that.

631
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,800
Michael Eisen wanted to do like a scarier ride.

632
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,080
You were going to Disneyland originally, right?

633
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,680
And it was, yeah, it was going to be a Disneyland as well.

634
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Yes.

635
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Yes.

636
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,160
From alien and the company behind it, like Waylon, you Tony from the movies, the company

637
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,760
behind it was going to be the fake company getting you into this ride.

638
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
Okay.

639
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
Gotcha.

640
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
And then do we know, do we know what the plot would have been?

641
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,040
Like you're, you're in the, you're in the ship.

642
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,800
So it's like, it is the plot of the movie.

643
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,520
Like the alien gets loose in the shit.

644
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,280
Testing something and a xenomorph gets in or something like that.

645
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:25,440
And then that everyone's, uh, uh, the policy used to be that Disney rides had to be based

646
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,240
on P P G or G movies.

647
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:35,000
Uh, now the pirates of the Caribbean movies are PG 13, uh, uh, you know, movies.

648
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So that's, that's an exception.

649
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,640
They shattered it a little, uh, they did use the rights for alien to put into the great

650
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
movie ride.

651
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Yes.

652
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
That sequence.

653
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Yes.

654
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,520
But, but it was, I think the subject of a lot of, uh, infighting within the Imagineering

655
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
organization.

656
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,760
By the way, this whole thing, uh, apparently started because, uh, Michael Eisner, when

657
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,420
he took over the Walt Disney company, he took his son, Breck, uh, on the, uh, for a tour

658
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,240
of Disneyland and he came out of it going like, it's lame.

659
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,640
There's nothing cool here.

660
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,300
There's no right here.

661
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,160
So he wanted to do a ride that would impress his son.

662
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,640
So he, and he was, I think, uh, no way.

663
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,800
No, Michael Eisner was parent that before.

664
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
So he, uh, uh, nevermind.

665
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Uh, I thought maybe he had previous relationship with the aliens franchise, but he just wanted

666
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,520
to bring that property into the, yeah.

667
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,040
Uh, a lot of just a side note about Breck, uh, Michael Eisner's son.

668
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,880
I do believe that like Breck has a lot to do with decisions Michael made overall.

669
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,200
So like, if you like the approval of splash mountain and stuff, I think Breck has a lot

670
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
to do with that.

671
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,840
So we can thank Breck for some of the best attractions for going, dad, I want this ride.

672
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,660
This is a cool ride dad.

673
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,280
So like, I think, uh, kudos to Breck is what I'm saying.

674
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,640
Star tour splash mountain, a lot of more thrilling stuff.

675
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,200
Some of those early nineties, uh, late eighties rides.

676
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,680
He came up with the Indiana Jones Mara language.

677
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:09,920
She did like the, uh, did diagrams explaining how the rocket rods would work.

678
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,440
Uh, centrifuges, his, let's get Breck guys there on the show too.

679
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,360
In addition, did he become a director?

680
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,360
Is he a director?

681
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
That's a good question.

682
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
I have no idea.

683
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,040
I feel like there's a director Eisner, but I will have to look at that.

684
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
We'll look that up later.

685
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,120
Anyway, sure.

686
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,160
That being said, the three star review we do mostly do research.

687
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
Yeah.

688
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,840
I'm planning on doing a lot of Breck guys and your material.

689
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
I'll have it next time.

690
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,240
I'll never get over it.

691
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,400
Can he really review us and be like, they didn't know anything about Breck Eisner.

692
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,060
He probably, if he re-reviews this, he'll probably say I was attacked personally by

693
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,560
the podcast.

694
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,920
Well, we're, we're also treading the line too with this ride because there is a lot

695
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:54,400
of speculation online of like, you know, there was some imagineers that, uh, you know, really

696
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,120
want it to, um, you know, they just stuck with it because after the alien idea was scrapped,

697
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,840
like people kept pursuing, like we should do something with this alien idea, even if

698
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,720
it's not that movie.

699
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,680
And then they brought in George Lucas to like, you know, consult on or give them advice of

700
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,440
how to do this.

701
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:21,280
Um, but who, according to the Jim Hill synopsis of events, he kind of checked out once he

702
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,360
was given a producer credit, he was not terribly involved.

703
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,400
Uh, he was not a prequels level of involved in the creation of alien.

704
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Right.

705
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,320
And if you, if you are not in the entertainment industry, you know, sometimes the title of

706
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,720
consultant or producer, that can mean like people are very hands on and are very responsible

707
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,240
for stuff where it can mean they would pop by for an hour a couple of times and, uh,

708
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
collect money.

709
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Yeah.

710
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,680
And then collect, uh, a year's worth of middle-class, uh, uh, income, an average middle-class income

711
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,840
for a couple, a couple hours.

712
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,360
Grab more money than you make in a year to send a couple emails.

713
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
That's Hollywood baby.

714
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,640
So, so yeah.

715
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,680
So when that stuff kind of all fell by the wayside, the imagineers then had to make their

716
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,640
own like mythos with their own characters.

717
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,520
So they created all these different things.

718
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,680
They created this fake company that would be the basis for the ride, which is called

719
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
excess tech.

720
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,680
Is that?

721
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Yeah.

722
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,120
It's like XS and there's a lot of jokes of like, if something, something is only worth

723
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,200
doing with two excess.

724
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,600
So like this is with XS, it shouldn't be done.

725
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,800
And this is like a Halliburton type company that has like, it's dangerous.

726
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,680
Like they're really trying to give you the jokes, but they're trying to be like, this

727
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,440
is corporate overreach.

728
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,600
This is corporate, uh, corporation is the bad guy gone mad.

729
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Yeah.

730
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:49,560
Like Jen and Jurassic park where like you're trying to make a comment on human beings,

731
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
uh,

732
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:58,320
But within a theme park, corporations within Disney land and universal studios.

733
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,120
They're odd.

734
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,760
Uh, uh, yeah.

735
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,480
So, and so the basic premise of it is that this company excess tech is giving a demonstration

736
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,040
in the tomorrow land, interplanetary convention center,

737
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,120
Convention center, public transit systems.

738
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,120
I loved all this stuff.

739
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
Yes.

740
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,200
Of our night land 94.

741
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,480
I think the aesthetic too, that sort of like future that never happened aesthetic, like

742
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,320
every time I've been down there the last few years, I'm like, as long as the lights are

743
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,560
on, as long as the, like the purple and green neon and stuff, it's like, this still looks

744
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,040
pretty good.

745
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,480
Like I think it still looks good because it's, they leaned into like, yeah, this future never

746
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
happened.

747
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,360
So I did tomorrow land in Disney, in Disney world in 1994 and in Disney land in 1998.

748
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,240
And I think most people would agree the 94 Disney world was much more successful.

749
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Oh, for sure.

750
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,440
Uh, then the 98 tomorrow land tomorrow.

751
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,400
And I really kind of looks like she's Disneyland nerds.

752
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,880
Tomorrow land is sad and you w I walked by it on Saturday with my girlfriend and I just,

753
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,040
I went, I made that noise because there's just things I looked at this tomorrow where

754
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,720
tomorrow the, uh, the people mover would load in and it's empty and it's not moving.

755
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,120
And it's just sad.

756
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,840
It's very sad to see our tomorrow land right now.

757
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,720
And it won't be fixed for many years is also the problem.

758
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:23,320
There's so many, it's what makes me, uh, it's why I don't like some of these things like

759
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,720
Pixar peer, because why are we doing that when we could be improving picks our tomorrow

760
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,160
land, which tomorrow land in the, uh, as yeah, your, your love of Disney world tomorrow land

761
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,680
probably equal to my love of Disneyland tomorrow land growing up.

762
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,480
It was where all the best attract, it's where it's, it's star tours.

763
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,520
It's kept in EO still a lot of great attractions.

764
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
Yeah.

765
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,560
It's crazy how rough that land looks with like how many e-tickets and d-tickets are like

766
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
concentrated.

767
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,600
Yeah, I know.

768
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,560
Just like overloaded with so many strollers.

769
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,880
It's just, it's a lot of scrolling with like the strollers reproduce when they like strollers

770
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,760
get together with other strollers and breed and make new strollers while they're sitting

771
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
there.

772
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,120
So they've recreated like a smaller scale version of tomorrow land 94 out here.

773
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,080
Like again, I think it would still look good as it stands.

774
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:19,480
Like what was going to happen was a massive plan called tomorrow land 20, 55, uh, which

775
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,480
would have seen alien encounter reproduced in Anaheim as well as, uh, there was going

776
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:31,000
to be a flying saucer in the carousel of progress, like a new flying saucers, which was an original

777
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
opening day.

778
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,920
It was Plekdu's fantastic intergalactic review.

779
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,840
What I mean, I don't know a lot about, but I love that title.

780
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,640
I would have loved to have seen the, they, if you go to Disneyland today, it is for a

781
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,520
long time now, it's been the star Wars launch Bay, which is where you go meet Chewbacca

782
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,440
and there's some fun little things in there, but it's like massive real estate in tomorrow

783
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,560
land that you could do a pretty major show in.

784
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,120
And there has not been a, like a, a reasonable, uh, you know, well done attraction since America

785
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
Singh's closed.

786
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Yeah, I don't think there's been a circle vision thing in there.

787
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,600
I think they were talking about putting the timekeeper in there.

788
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,720
There were, I think they were talking about putting the timekeepers somewhere out here

789
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
too.

790
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,480
The alien encounter was supposed to go where the pizza port is right now.

791
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,600
Oh my God.

792
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:23,880
So the pizza port, which is regularly everyone's, our past guest, uh, Mike Mitchell loves pizza

793
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,880
port.

794
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,320
Um, but he's the only person I've ever heard say that a pizza port, I think is like everyone's

795
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
least favorite restaurant.

796
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,480
It's a cafeteria now that he's not here.

797
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Yeah.

798
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,680
That us, we're not afraid of bully Mike Mitchell, uh, had given us a blowback on pizza port.

799
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,840
No, it's like, uh, yeah, I think the graphic design in there is miserable.

800
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
It smells like a cafeteria.

801
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,960
It smells like a Chuck E cheese.

802
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
Yeah.

803
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
It's very Chuck E cheese.

804
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Yes.

805
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,600
Uh, but yet without robots, the thing that was the salvation of all, all they have to

806
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,480
do is plug Sony eclipse in there and we go, well, it smells like a Chuck E cheese and

807
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,520
it's the graphic design is terrible, but there's a fucking robot playing piano and alien robot

808
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
singer.

809
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
And we'd all be like, well, it's pretty good.

810
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
Yeah.

811
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
And then they do have a salad.

812
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
I like there.

813
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Okay.

814
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,200
I was, I get a decent, they can get a decent salad there.

815
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,560
If you scrub back on the podcast, like about a minute or two, I'm about to say they have

816
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,560
a decent salad.

817
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
I swear.

818
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
So go back and listen.

819
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,520
I'm about and then someone talks and I go, well, why do I have to fucking talk about

820
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
a salad?

821
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
I think you're making this up.

822
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,520
I think you're front and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

823
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,720
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

824
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,440
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

825
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
I'm just going to go back and listen to this.

826
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
I am trying to kiss up to Jason, but that is a thought.

827
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,440
I had my friend is scared of alien encounter and he doesn't even know about that cool salad.

828
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,960
I don't even podcast canceled.

829
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,160
And the thing that happened with tomorrow.

830
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,320
Land 2055 is that.

831
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:52,080
Uh, fuckin' uh, Disney, Disney, Paris was such a financial, uh, fuck up for a while.

832
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,240
I hate to, I hate to get off the top cause we keep getting off topic here, but that

833
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,120
happens all the time and that drives me nuts because there's certain things like

834
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,480
when Shanghai Disney was being built and it was going over budget then all of a

835
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,840
sudden there was garbage everywhere in Disneyland they had cut staff and like

836
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,280
garbage is overflowing from bathrooms and they had like yeah this is what

837
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,880
happens when other countries Disney parks start to go to shit or something

838
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,720
gets behind schedule is that we in Disneyland who have been supporting the

839
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,380
park for years we suffer because of it and it's upsetting and it's not fair but

840
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,800
then it swings the other way where it's like you know there hadn't been a new

841
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,600
attraction for a while and then you get a big new thing like Guardians of the

842
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,240
Galaxy and they're like two billion dollars infused into Anaheim over like

843
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,560
ten years yeah but that was 20 years after a new attraction and still not a

844
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,960
new attraction that's still a repurposed skin I don't want to put all this on just

845
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,560
Disney parks in other countries because that makes this a Trumpian well it's not

846
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,640
the other countries are dragging down our you know that's it's not the other

847
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,160
countries fault it is the Disney corporation that's true well the worst

848
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,360
they were the worst Disney parks probably are Disneyland Paris and I

849
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,360
haven't been to Hong Kong I could say it seems like kind of I think it's just a

850
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,560
smaller scale more money but I think they're they're they're sprucing it up

851
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,040
but also Disney's Disney World budget problems from things like the wristbands

852
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,920
the man yes the magic that's true too yes loan a lot of money something like

853
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,400
that Disney World it does some program that burns a lot of money and suddenly

854
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,800
we're cutting things from Star Wars land out here Disneyland which is doing great

855
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,880
hometown pride taking the fall for Disney World's mistakes they yes very

856
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,360
recently they had to cut a ride from Star Wars land there was gonna be you're

857
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,960
gonna like ride on the back of these beasts of burden the band there was a

858
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,120
bantha right a bantha yeah sure I'll assume I think it's a bantha but yeah

859
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,600
that because of Disney World Disney World didn't have the money to do that

860
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,600
so Disneyland lost it we would have had one more attraction a big cool creature

861
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,760
attraction that would have made it's crazy yeah yeah yeah this stuff suffer I

862
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,520
say what's the political version it's like it's like state funds versus

863
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,640
federal right oh yeah we need to like separate I agree well they've they've

864
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,420
recently I think separated because before there was a policy that Disney

865
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,440
World had control over decision-making for an or an I'm just crazy which is

866
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,920
crazy but I think they've stopped that now which is good I also think Disneyland

867
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,280
should just break off from the company and be its own thing like it should

868
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,920
totally be separate it should have its own budget so we can get regular new

869
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,160
rides and it doesn't have to be like oh well the Pirates of the Caribbean bombed

870
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:40,320
you guys aren't gonna get a new Tomorrowland until 2030 and their budget

871
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,800
should be 150 billion dollars a year yes that's I think it should be a public

872
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,440
service I think we should nationalize Disney World and Disneyland and that

873
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,720
just just like we should nationalize the internet as a public service and also

874
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,360
Amazon we're getting to the point where we're Amazon just needs to be a public

875
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,520
service that's true to be the path to get that to drilling in Disneyland yeah

876
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:09,400
that's a good way into the matter or no if you start going this way so I also

877
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,280
think I'd like to say I'm a little self-conscious I feel like this is one

878
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:17,200
of those where we're just like talking about our nerd issues yeah we definitely

879
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,320
are so apologies but look that's we've yeah apologize in episode one this was

880
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,920
gonna happen we're just we're gonna get all we're talking about our stuff you

881
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,960
know hey this one's one for us but people have told us they enjoy the

882
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,960
sincerity and I'm gonna tell you I mean there's very I I there's very few things

883
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:40,520
I'm this sincere about like alien account yeah I mean it's just yeah from

884
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,360
the pre-show through the ride I just love it take us through it explain the

885
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,560
the the attraction to us but I think the bells are the very fundamental basics of

886
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,280
it it's like a it ends up being a theater show in the same place where there

887
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,680
used to be an attraction called mission to Mars and before that flight to the

888
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,040
moon rocket to the moon yeah I think mission tomorrow well what what was there

889
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,240
when Disney World opened I think they did it was mission to Mars yeah a little

890
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,360
while and it was a but it was a circular theater with a bunch of seats that were

891
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,920
all surrounding a porthole where you could watch a rocket take off and you

892
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,680
could and you would land on on the moon or Mars depending on which iteration it

893
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,240
was so they took this same circular theater setting and they put a big tube

894
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,160
in the middle and created this experience where an alien teleports into

895
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,880
yeah into the theater and then using a technology that that they were very keen

896
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,880
on at the time binaural audio which is like very sophisticated sort of a lot

897
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:44,460
going on left to right speakers that combined with you know with like water

898
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:50,840
and and I guess I don't know the harnesses the harnesses that you're

899
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,640
strapped into would like push down on you as if the the alien was walking

900
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:01,080
across your shoulders as if it was walking through the aisle it was very it

901
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,560
was cool it was cool and people would scream every time also if you weren't

902
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,080
sitting up straight if you were slouching when those harnesses came down

903
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:14,120
it would really push down on you like it could be a tight fit I saw a complaint

904
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,840
about the new iteration about stitches great escape but which uses the same

905
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,960
harnesses but there was a Yelp review where somebody said if you were a mother

906
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,720
reaching out for your child you would not be able to reach them another reason

907
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,400
if I could for mommy why am I going on this ride I think it's pretty easy to

908
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,360
grab someone's hand but if you wanted to put your hand across maybe not uh-huh

909
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:40,320
and it's not a good place to make out you know it's not a good push your arm

910
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,760
around somebody strapped in you were strapped in strapping also if you start

911
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,000
to freak out you're fucked I'm sure there was an emergency release but they

912
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,560
I would have freaked out you and I Mike you and I could have both been in

913
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,240
institutions for most that's a good point if we have gone on this ride I'm glad

914
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,720
we didn't probably a good thing this ride takes place in total darkness I

915
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,000
told one of the first episodes I told the story of going on this really shitty

916
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,920
UFO ride that was in the dark where I thought like we were going into space

917
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,120
and I almost had a meltdown so yeah this would have sent me although I was old

918
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:19,040
too what was this 95 when did this open yeah 95 95 I was 11 that wasn't five but

919
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,360
this is probably one where it's okay to be scared because uh adults were scared

920
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:29,680
too yeah adults were scared too this so many of the jokes in this ride are about

921
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,320
how the employees of this fictional company these aliens don't give a shit

922
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:40,480
if you die like there's so many of me like it's a lot of the characters are

923
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,440
mean like there's a lot of dark there I mean what's interesting about it and I'm

924
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,280
trying to think of there's an equivalent other than like in Jen for Jurassic Park

925
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,880
is that the bad guys are all the people that are talking to you and entrolling

926
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,760
like all the yeah all of the aliens and that robot are bad guys they're hurting

927
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:04,720
people right yeah except Skippy I mean yes Skippy is good he is a good alien

928
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,800
but he gets hurt and they ate that robot at the start hurts him and he fucked the

929
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,680
robot hurts him a lot like he's constantly fucking with him honestly

930
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:18,080
like as a kid I thought that was like I love the dark jokes that like the Tim

931
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,600
Curry animatronic where he just like just him wasn't Phil Hartman the voice

932
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,440
to Phil Hartman was originally a voice and he was goofier and then they're

933
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,180
like no that this guy's got to be a darker yeah they had to make the pre

934
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:36,400
show scarier so that you weren't thrown by how scary the actual show was so for

935
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,800
those six weeks and now I wish I really wish I had done it but for six weeks

936
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,040
there was a Phil Hartman right animatronic yeah he was a different

937
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:49,320
character named Tom 2000 later Tim Curry became sir and then Phil Hartman

938
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,720
would not appear in the park again until enchanted Tiki Room under new management

939
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:59,920
right in which he plays one half of the bird agent team William and Morris oh

940
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:06,240
boy that is it right we will get to Tiki Room under that's another one 45 minutes

941
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,720
of complaints on another one where a beloved attraction becomes something

942
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,480
mystifying in the 90s or 2000s many of those and we covered this already with

943
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,200
Ellen's energy adventure yeah there's yeah you will find this is a common

944
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:26,280
umbrella topic for these episodes the bad 90s or 2000s reboot so just to hit

945
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,520
the big beats of this ride so you walk into like yeah what is a fictional

946
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:37,520
space age convention center lobby and and there's a video you know explaining

947
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,900
the history of this excess tech company and they're demonstrating this new

948
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:46,240
technology and this is also green aliens bunch of green aliens the makeup looks

949
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,560
really good on these aliens and they should say this is a star studded the

950
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:56,880
film stuff looks a little cheap like the actual quality of it sort of video but

951
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,960
there's like name actors underneath all that makeup there sure are the first

952
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,040
actor you'd see it's not her voice oddly enough but the actor playing it is Tyra

953
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,640
Banks under makeup and she's the one explaining the history of the company

954
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:18,120
and then you see the head of the company chairman LC clench played by Jeffrey

955
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:27,160
Jones we've not been able to avoid controversial figures because the world

956
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:32,880
is the world is horrible the reason why we'll come back around to that when we

957
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,960
come to the ride closing not Jeffrey Jones

958
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,240
Jeffrey Joe's of course had a child pornography no I know worse than that oh

959
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:50,720
yeah I think there's a taking photo taking photos in a shed it's the guy

960
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,520
he's the principal from Ferris to Rooney yeah very sad that he did bad things he

961
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,160
was so he was so great in many 80s and 90s films Howard the Duck he's in a lot

962
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,080
of stuff he still worked out he still worked after to which anyway insane

963
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:10,440
German clench yeah he played German clench and then the two alien scientists

964
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,800
dr. Femis is played by Kathy Najee me Najee me this is how I can tell you love

965
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,360
this right you said dr. Femis without any like attitude or any that just very

966
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,360
earn it and the dr. Femis and then of course the the instigator the one who

967
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:30,440
makes everything go wrong spin lock no trade by the great Kevin Pollock

968
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,280
Kevin Pollock we need to get we need to get Kevin on the show to talk about

969
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,560
spin lock on the show to talk about took his fedora off to portray we're all in

970
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,360
luck so after they tell you a little bit about the history of the ride you go to

971
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:53,120
like a second pre-show area with sir the simulated intelligence robotics that is

972
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,440
portrayed by Tim Curry the great Tim Curry and then he has like two

973
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,320
teleportation tubes there with an adorable animatronic named Skippy an

974
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:07,600
adorable alien who they would sell lots of stuffed animals of and he demonstrates

975
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,920
the technology and takes the light in torturing Skippy by using this

976
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,960
technology on him and teleports him from one tube to another tube where he's all

977
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,160
like fried like a loony tune after they've been shot with a cannon I have

978
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,920
I have a skippy toy as well from Park Stars oh yeah yeah yeah sorry I should

979
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:33,960
have been added early toys huh I would like us what is it what's coming politics

980
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,160
character name in luck I would love a spin lock toy oh you have a spin lock no

981
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:44,160
there weren't any alien action figures sucks I wish dr. famous the Kathy and

982
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,800
Jimmy character wears this very odd like plastic or tin looking dress like I

983
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,960
would like to have the full I'd like to have her weird shiny space dress it's

984
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,120
like a space dress but the design is kind of like when there is a nurse in

985
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,700
Downton Abbey when there was a matron lead nurse said they're wearing like a

986
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:09,000
tent yeah yeah yeah but it's in space so blue hey if you don't know the ride that

987
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,880
we were talking if we have not I have not convinced you to look up a ride

988
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,040
through of it yeah check out dr. famous's space dress so after Tim Curry

989
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:22,320
fucks around with Skippy for a while and then the thing is he teleports Skippy

990
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,720
Skippy gets fried and then he's like the best thing is like you can pause the

991
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,120
teleportation so then Skippy is disappears and he's just in the air he's

992
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:36,800
just kind of like hovering between like Mike TV and Willy Wonka yeah like Mike

993
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,320
TV that's perfect yeah and then there is footage of dr.

994
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,600
famous and spin lock telling you what's about to happen that one of you is gonna

995
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:50,400
get transported to their planet and then chairman clench bursts in and he says no

996
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:56,040
I'm going to transport to them and they're like alright alright dude what

997
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,040
is interesting is that that's supposed to be the better scenario but if you

998
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,880
think about it transporting Jeffrey Jones into a room full of children is a

999
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,240
lot less scary or a lot more scary excuse me than transporting the alien

1000
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,160
who are all locked in place who are a lot in place cannot reach them uh-huh

1001
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,320
yeah that's I think here's another maybe you and I just both had a bad feeling

1002
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,280
about Jeffrey Jones already in 1984 maybe that's so maybe we're just the

1003
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,400
universe is sending us a signal I mean signal you didn't get Jason even if you

1004
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:31,120
saw a clip of the pre-show you would know that chairman clench you know did

1005
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:36,960
not get to the head of this company ethically you don't make that many

1006
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,720
space dollars being an ethical businessman there's weird implications of

1007
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:47,720
what else excess tech did yeah yeah so they one of the things that their

1008
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:53,320
company does is like planet planetary restructuring which implies like blowing

1009
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,560
up yeah and it's I think yeah there's a whole list I should have written it down

1010
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,000
but yeah there's a whole list of of terrible things that this company is up

1011
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:07,080
to a little Easter egg there is like a receipt or invoice from excess tech in

1012
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:12,840
the collector's office in Guardians of the Galaxy oh yeah like they so the

1013
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,760
Tyvon collection did business yeah they did business there's a bill like

1014
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:21,440
there's a car there is there is some real great little Easter eggs in that

1015
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,960
Guardians ride for Disney fans collection of this of Vinicio del Toro

1016
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,600
and there's a lot of yeah and believe it or not the collector's a big Disney

1017
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:37,920
Parks fan yeah so he's got figment in one of his little cases anyway so then

1018
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,440
you're loaded yeah you're loaded into this theater and you're strapped in

1019
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:47,360
these harnesses like come down all at once like very slowly lower into this

1020
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:53,800
theater full of people and you know the film starts to play I think maybe it's

1021
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,000
in the room where like the film is like all right we're gonna transport one of

1022
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,360
you that's yes that's where it's explained the chairman clench we will

1023
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:07,200
not be transported but chairman clenched chairman clenched will be a very odd part of the ride where he says no I if only one of you

1024
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:13,000
came I could only meet one of you but instead I can shake each hand I don't

1025
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,520
know what he's after this whole I don't know the drama of chairman clench wants

1026
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,120
to meet us yeah they don't really set that up of like why he's so hell-bent I

1027
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,360
mean he's very much like a politician who's like I want to roll up my sleeves

1028
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:31,600
and go to a diner and shake some hands it's very weird it's unexplained but so

1029
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:38,040
what so you know it's dr. Femis is trying to reconfigure the machine for

1030
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:44,800
this this change and then spin lock goes like no fuck it just do it we gotta do

1031
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:50,520
it spin lock messes everything up oh it's his fault and and because a planet

1032
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:57,000
gets between the teleportation signal they transport clench to another planet

1033
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,500
and then he they're like oh we got to get him out of there we got to get him

1034
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,760
out we got to get into earth and they're like well there's this life form looks

1035
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,800
about right he's just just do it it's him it's him and then they transport him

1036
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:15,520
into a teleportation tube and that's when you realize like I think the wrong

1037
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,840
alien yeah there's a joke where it's like us since when does clench have wings and

1038
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,600
it's like it is a monster it is a monster scary shit yeah scary shit

1039
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:31,480
mm-hmm it's usually partially obscured by like fog a lot of the time which just

1040
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,360
makes it even more frightening does it appear in the tube kind of like

1041
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:40,280
screaming and writhing around oh it sure does breaks out okay yeah and then it's

1042
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:46,000
they it the glass like they do a cool effect like a lot of the fear in this

1043
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,840
ride comes from like classic like theatrical effects like playing the

1044
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:55,680
audio from different angles a lot of smoke and mirrors type of stuff and then

1045
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,320
like the tube is empty and the power goes out and so like the the implication

1046
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:05,280
being the alien this monster alien is crawling around the room mm-hmm and they

1047
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,080
had to know the fact that he has wings is one of the things that they had to

1048
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:13,880
change when they shut it down because that was like a lost story point they

1049
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,960
had to show that the alien has wings to let you know how it's flapping around

1050
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,560
and flying from one part of the theater to the other oh this was like this was

1051
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,840
one of the things that a lot of people like the problems that this ride had and

1052
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:33,520
the story issues kind of stemmed from that they wanted to do a the movie alien

1053
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,000
yeah that's an alien that you've seen that you understand you don't need the

1054
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,720
backstory because you're coming in aware of the franchise and a lot of the

1055
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:45,080
issues this ride had is that they had to like reverse engineer and tell you all

1056
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,200
this stuff about excess tech and since when does it have wings they had to

1057
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,920
explain the alien to you in a way they wouldn't have had to with the the

1058
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,480
xenomorph okay that this again this sounds like a note that is parodied in

1059
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,480
Hollywood movies a lot of just like well this character's at his house and then

1060
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,640
he's having lunch with his boss what happens in between like how do we how

1061
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,760
does he get to the restaurant it's like who gives a shit like the alien can

1062
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,000
climb I just solved it I fixed it the alien can climb the xenomorph has like

1063
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,040
limbs like long limbs that like can make him climb her climb but this also like

1064
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:23,000
this alien like the the model of it's like got like a dozen legs and it's got

1065
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,680
giant claws and it's got wings like okay it can get around the theater's not that

1066
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,060
big another important thing to note in terms of theme park exposition is that

1067
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:37,220
nobody is paying attention whatsoever only psycho little kids who are gonna

1068
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:42,720
start a podcast 20 years later are no no any have heard the words excess tech or

1069
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:48,720
dr. femis or any yeah so it is fun to imagine ears just remember no one is

1070
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,360
paying attention it is funny because you would how many people have done like

1071
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,680
this thing was open for how many years eight years just under ten years if you

1072
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:03,920
were to give a test to every dad who went on this ride do you recognize this

1073
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,960
logo the excess tech logo what is the percentage of dads who would know what

1074
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,840
that is is it oh very low two percent the main logo of the ride it's a no I

1075
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,040
know that I'm just saying if you were to give all this iconography and all these

1076
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,200
different things in the backstory and like would a dad ever remember anything

1077
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,880
would he remember spin lock show my photo of spin lock

1078
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:31,560
dad is so weirdo my dad my dad went on it I don't know if I go hey dad you know

1079
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:36,800
who spin lock is he would not know what I mean I remember seeing this face right

1080
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:43,120
right after I saw my son weeping openly in public that was another one of my

1081
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:47,120
favorite activities with this ride is standing in the gift shop which was full

1082
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,360
of stuff I bought or wanted to buy and watching people exit and I would just

1083
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:58,400
watch people crying scared children leave this ride and I remember my family

1084
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,400
like my me and my mom talked to like some of the employees once we're like

1085
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,360
hey do a lot of people come out really scared of that ride and they're like all

1086
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,400
day all day long all day every day yeah they got constant complaints complaints

1087
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,880
from people because they didn't know how scary this thing was and their child

1088
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:17,360
would be traumatized it was I mean it just made it that much better like

1089
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,280
there's never been like a better yeah I mean it's scary it's just such an odd

1090
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,480
thing to have it in Disney then that's what adds to it I mean Halloween Horror

1091
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,040
Nights has nothing on this right you know what you're getting into there this

1092
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:39,120
is like it's a fucking convention center it is a great misdirect because you're in

1093
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,560
Disney and Tomorrowland and it's so bright and cheery and then right off of

1094
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,680
the hub yeah it's right there you're looking at the castle and then you're

1095
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,680
about to get eaten yeah it's I think it's pretty great that story is crazy to

1096
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,920
me it was effective that for as much as we you know we had we're like we were

1097
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,320
too scared to go on it it really did like mess kids up I am curious if like

1098
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:04,800
if people if there was like legitimate psychological I'm sure people I mean I

1099
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,720
got it I got a thing so pretty amazing and I like I just like that it was like

1100
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,800
a bold thing I like that they do something very different yeah yeah and

1101
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,000
they'd ever done before it's like yeah noticeably different than any other

1102
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,560
attraction this the next big thing that happens in the ride they send a

1103
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:25,400
maintenance person in and so there's like this is again another smoke and

1104
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,840
mirrors trick where it's like someone is in the rafters above the theater and

1105
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:33,120
there's like a dangle a light that moves so it looks like a flashlight walking

1106
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:39,360
around and they go to repair it and then they they they he has like a night vision

1107
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:45,480
camera on that he's wearing and like on the one screen you once he plugs it back

1108
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:50,120
in you see what he sees and it's the monster and the monster eats him

1109
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:56,880
multiple people die in this ride like this guy dies horrifically he is

1110
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:04,280
screaming you there they drop droplets of water on you as if it's his blood

1111
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,960
they use the droplets of water to be the breaking glass too like when the monster

1112
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,880
breaks out you they spray water at you so it feels like you got sprayed with

1113
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,880
like little shards of glass like it's it's really wild and then did you still

1114
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,800
like when you do you remember specifically like first time second time

1115
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,560
third time like do you were you able to brace yourself how bad was it the first

1116
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:30,320
I think every trip the first time I would be scared because I would forget

1117
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:37,680
stuff and then after the rerides I would just like I just liked all the beats of

1118
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,440
the ride I also like like to laugh at everyone who hadn't been on I like to

1119
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:46,280
scream I remember talking to people like I've been on this before and they're

1120
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,560
like no and I'm like this is it's great let me have great let me ask you this

1121
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:57,760
did you have a secret fantasy that you would get eaten I mean oh maybe I mean

1122
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,520
I've always longed for death sweet touch that's what I mean long to touch the edge

1123
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,800
no I know so I was wondering if you were like this is the time it happened this

1124
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,400
is the time it happens I feel like there is and I can't remember if I read that

1125
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,760
there's like one broken seat there's always one broken seat with like an

1126
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:19,160
excess cover on it hmm I forget but like there they left a lot of the excess I

1127
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,720
mean they reused a lot of the stuff for stitch we haven't even gotten to the

1128
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,880
stitch I know as well and so then eventually the power comes back on they

1129
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:33,320
lure the alien back into the tube this is at the very end when you get the

1130
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:37,640
fullest view of him and he's the alien is screaming they're flashing lights

1131
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,400
everywhere there's there's he's leaning through the broken glass and then they

1132
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:49,300
slide the tube up and I think they're like they don't even try to teleport

1133
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:53,840
him out of there they just like full power he's gonna explode and then he

1134
01:05:53,840 --> 01:06:00,320
like explodes oh which gets me to another thing he explodes right as the

1135
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,440
tube starts to close and they do spray the water again so like you got the

1136
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:10,960
like you got a water and you got alien parts and there's also some piped in

1137
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,960
dialogue and from as if it's audience members saying it and at that point like

1138
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,120
when you first see the alien there's a very faint cry of someone goes like oh

1139
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:26,760
what is this my mother-in-law and then at the very end when the alien explodes

1140
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:32,720
someone goes oh my mouth was open like this is these weird wow these comedy

1141
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:39,560
guys it's a real like theater actor man my mouth was open yes a real hammy joke

1142
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:45,420
and then like you're tourist I forget what the closing lines but like Dr.

1143
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:50,400
Femis and spin lock come on the screen they do not address the fact that

1144
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,400
Chairman clench is stranded on a strange planet and probably dead he's

1145
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,480
probably dead or injured depending on the atmosphere yeah depending that or

1146
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,880
not they say like and at that point they're not even sorry they're like well

1147
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:09,120
the future you know you got a break some eggs to get to the future like there I

1148
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:14,280
forget what the line is probably another play on excess and then the lights come

1149
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,800
up and do you believe having survived what is essentially a traumatic

1150
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,680
experience you try to walk out with your knees shaking with your knees shaking

1151
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:28,960
yes yeah if you can manage to not faint and on your steps to the gift shop I

1152
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,880
mean besides like yeah I mean I saw some kids coming off crying but most people

1153
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,000
were like laughing going off you know most people were like wow that was crazy

1154
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,240
like that was great and you know better and like a better area that was more

1155
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,000
appropriate for it I think it would have been a big hit like if it was in a

1156
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
universal park or something I think because because this is a beloved

1157
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,120
attraction actually like yeah as much as this thing got because it you know gets

1158
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,720
ripped on for being scary it's just because people weren't expecting it and

1159
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:01,120
kids are expecting a fun much more pleasant experience at Disney long lines

1160
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:05,600
like once all that our land stuff like that Tomorrowland everything was pretty

1161
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,160
popular there except carousel progress which is slow and for old people and I

1162
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:13,320
still love it and the people mover which never stops running so there's rarely a

1163
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:18,920
line because you just walk into the car so I agree oh boy I've been

1164
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:26,040
transported to 94 tomorrow I loved it there so eventually this ride but

1165
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:31,240
eventually they're like this is people are complaining too much and they I mean

1166
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:35,920
I don't know what the hourly capacity of it was either I'm not sure if it was

1167
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:42,800
huge it always had long lines but they they did close it in 2003 mm-hmm and why

1168
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:48,480
is the quiz because why well there's yeah there's two schools of thought it's

1169
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:53,820
a mix that it was like too scary and then also like it didn't help that a

1170
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:58,340
child bluster was one of the main characters and a villain a sinister

1171
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:02,720
villain leering at you I'm guessing it had mores to do because you can redo a

1172
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:07,360
video you can refill that you can refill you get who's a villain at the time who

1173
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:13,040
was like a character actor who was evil who should have in 2003

1174
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:21,600
oh Billy zane that's a little late that's a little late yeah I mean Nick

1175
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,320
Cage would have been a get surely an a-lister probably want to put all that

1176
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:28,920
maybe he's a big Disney Parks fan who should have been clench if you could

1177
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,280
reclass recast clash right now would be a mocap that man now clench yeah oh it

1178
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:40,700
would all be mocap and it would all be a simulator and yeah yeah yeah the mess it

1179
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:47,420
up yeah what was gonna say I think that like this is an area too now they've

1180
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:51,880
talked about putting like a virtual reality Wreck-It Ralph mm-hmm thing in

1181
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,280
that because it's a small area so so yeah it's a small theater I mean and

1182
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:00,800
it's it's like the it's built into the infrastructure of other stuff like the

1183
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,280
people mover track and multiple gift shops so like they kind of can't totally

1184
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,880
destroy it they just keep reusing this theater they keep trying to figure out

1185
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,800
how to reuse the infrastructure yeah yeah it's so it's lit it's limited in

1186
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,080
what they can do with it well which is why they closed the ride and gave it

1187
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,880
this overhaul this was an under an underwhelming over underwhelming over

1188
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,200
that would that is called stitches great escape and if you had to synopsize this

1189
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:31,680
ride it would be everything we just described but with stitch and it's

1190
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:37,120
wacky Tim Kurt the Tim Curry robot has a police uniform and a beard now it's nice

1191
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:41,920
and he's nice and the projections on the screen or the the film segments are all

1192
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:50,400
animated you know I oh and and instead of the alien dripping his slime on you

1193
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:58,200
stitch burps a chili dog smell in your face yeah that is the main headline when you a lot of

1194
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,900
different theme park websites and listen Pica a lot of theme park media has

1195
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:07,160
declared this the worst attraction in all of Disney World and but the really

1196
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:13,560
the the crux of the argument is always stitch burps chili dog not like it's not

1197
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,520
fun it's not pleasant it's not I mean you listen to the audience they're all

1198
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,280
just like like stick I mean I guess it's I'm it makes sense like why I mean

1199
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:26,360
stitch Leo at stitch was like a pretty big hit right and it's like the one

1200
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:30,120
thing that's like survived from that era of Disney animation that people like

1201
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:34,640
yeah the treasure planet era the home on the home yeah Lilo and Stitch is the one

1202
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,040
thing I think people actually do have affection for I do find it a very

1203
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,760
endearing yeah it's cute but this is they very much were like alright let's take

1204
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:47,400
out the family stuff and the ohana means family family means no one gets left

1205
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:53,560
behind let's get rid of all that yes let's get the alien scientists who

1206
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:59,480
torture him but but not like torture like the old alien scientists do torture

1207
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:05,600
people no no it's like I'll admit this I've never been on this one either I have

1208
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,920
not I think I've been and I guess I've been using world yeah it's just you're

1209
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,000
too it's just too much stuff to do in Disney World both times I've gone in the

1210
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,200
last ten years it's like well I'm gonna go gonna go on Stitch's great escape or

1211
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:21,640
go on Space Mountain or go over animal kingdom like I would imagine your

1212
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:26,320
girlfriend similar to my wife who has does not have the pain tolerance that I

1213
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:32,360
do I need to experience every horrible attraction she could love she would love

1214
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:38,360
to never again go on journey into imagination or sit through the I mean

1215
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:42,480
this isn't a bad attraction yeah American Adventure I remember oh just

1216
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:47,320
staring daggers that the American Adventure rules like the American

1217
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:55,880
Adventure so but also again this is the the climax of the show is Mark Twain and

1218
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:01,880
and Franklin and shaking hands poorly shaking hands it's great I don't I'm not

1219
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,880
gonna blame my wife here I'll say that no no it's not I didn't go on and there

1220
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,520
was that nothing to do with Lindsay I just we were like under the gun to get

1221
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:15,240
other stuff done it does feel I mean it's very melancholy for me when I've

1222
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:20,320
written it's been very because the old ride meant so much to me and I was like

1223
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:26,560
smile like a friend I used to recognize but it's so much is gone similar same

1224
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,600
harnesses I so much of it they barely changed and the other thing is the time

1225
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,080
key I used to love the timekeeper too I didn't ride that as much because it was

1226
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,440
just a movie and it was a little long I have never written the Monsters Inc

1227
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,680
last year I don't even know what it is and just because I'm like no absolutely

1228
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:49,360
not to I think pretty dynamic interesting new attractions not based on

1229
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:54,560
in other intellectual property alien encounter and the timekeeper which will

1230
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:00,640
cover at some point I am sure but the these were replaced by these I think yeah

1231
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:06,040
these these very lame quick you know like shove them in kind of attractions

1232
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,600
based on the only popular movies Disney had at the time yeah right that that

1233
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,400
Monsters Inc thing seems so I guess they are for little children this is what I'm

1234
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,680
forgetting yeah but people like them the other thing is what I've read in stitch

1235
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,120
kids still kind of cry and scream because it's still pitch black a lot of

1236
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:30,200
the time and weird noise and it's invasive yeah I mean we touching you

1237
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,720
we'll do honey I shrunk the audience which I did do and I scared the shit out

1238
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,520
of me as a little kid yeah I was so scared like those snakes I don't even

1239
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,200
like Shrek 4d when they poke you in the back when I don't like poke in the back

1240
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:47,480
do people like this to people like it's tough to be a bug when like the bugs all

1241
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:53,840
crawl yeah I hate anything like this it's I'm not scared of it yeah it's so

1242
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:58,160
people like you're being molested by these people like being scared some

1243
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,600
people like being scared and that's what's what's different about the three

1244
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,400
of us is that most theme park people not most I shouldn't say but a lot of theme

1245
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,120
park is a big contingent now of Halloween Horror Nights people that like

1246
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:14,120
this they like being touched by college students and masks they like like

1247
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:18,080
constantly going ah like I don't like that I got six minute haunted house the

1248
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,440
old house of horrors at Universal I had a headache after it I was so like stop

1249
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:27,400
stop yelling at me college students I got a I have a story I'll save for

1250
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:31,680
another day on that but yeah I friends maybe go through that once and it sucked

1251
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:36,240
and then I got the biggest fuck you at the end of it and yeah I would have

1252
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:40,000
saved that for another yeah yeah we're really over freaks who were taken over

1253
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,320
yeah our nice cute attractions get out of there you're a bad element and yeah

1254
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:52,560
look at least tallow at least Universal shoves them into the night the unruly

1255
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,320
nighttime we're nice these people these weirdos out of my daytime parks yeah

1256
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:01,320
we're nice boys want a pleasant experience yeah nice park or at the very

1257
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,760
least if you're gonna make it scary spend a lot of money on it and get some

1258
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:11,400
character actors in there yeah yeah more yeah more indelible characters like

1259
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:16,520
we're just Tim Curry just get put Tim Curry in there you know big influence

1260
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:22,760
for me Tim Curry sure yeah the also it's just this isn't about this right but I'm

1261
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:27,560
in my the fact that the monsters ink laugh floor was a ride where you can text

1262
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:31,920
in a joke and then they'll tell a joke you text what an unpleasant I might as

1263
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,280
well say it now because I'd love to not do an episode about the monsters ink

1264
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:39,360
laugh I think if we're doing it we're doing this in three years I think we'll

1265
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:43,720
will have already gotten to monsters ink lab floor scraping the bottom of the

1266
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,520
barrel will be we'll be doing that on the roof of one of our apart that'll be

1267
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:52,040
our like the Beatles that'll be our last episode as long as you think Lord we're

1268
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:57,760
doing on a roof for a crowd you know you know that it's been rough our

1269
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:03,000
relations our personal relationships afraid and yeah people gather down while

1270
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,760
they're doing it one more time Jason's got some cool new girlfriend

1271
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:13,960
dressed like dr. famous we don't like to dress this way I didn't tell her it was

1272
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:17,400
alright you was dressed this way when we met she's sitting in the corner for

1273
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:22,400
recording and healthy together I think this is probably an attraction where we

1274
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:28,240
should do the thing that we often forget to do which is plus it up keep it as is

1275
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:32,920
yeah burn to the ground for insurance money because that it's a big question I

1276
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,000
don't know what you do the rumor is like you said that this record Ralph

1277
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,480
attraction is coming in although there's sort of a rumored issue with that is

1278
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,200
that there's a really amazing Super Mario Kart attraction on the way they

1279
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,480
don't want to look like shit that because this would be in the rumor is

1280
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:54,040
it's a ride based on sugar rush the go-kart yes game that they play a race

1281
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:58,960
game that is in wreck at Ralph so is that sort of is that does that end up

1282
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,200
being a lesser version of what probably yes well also like those VR sets of

1283
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,920
parks are experimenting with putting on people not only is it time-consuming to

1284
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:15,040
put them on people and secure them the technology out paces in event

1285
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:20,920
innovation out paces like people's expectations so like if it looks good for

1286
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,800
six months it's gonna look like shit in a year yeah you know and also people can

1287
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,720
do it from their home people can buy VR for their home so you got to compete

1288
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:33,440
with that right yeah I think I always think that stuff is weird like shove the

1289
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:38,900
idea that I mean I think some fun rides came out of Disney wanting to do video

1290
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:44,900
games in the parks I like Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters and I really like Midway

1291
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:49,400
mania but I think you there's still think you can't go nuts with that I did

1292
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:56,120
not like the Knott's Berry Farm video game right Oh journey to the iron reef

1293
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:01,600
that was yeah that's bad that's that's a headache inducing ride sure so yeah

1294
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,840
this video game stuff I don't know in the VR I don't know I'm really not sure

1295
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,800
what you do here but I bet this the idea has occurred to you guys as well that

1296
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,960
with the Disney Fox merger well we talked about it on the last show they

1297
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,960
could do the original version on the astromo with a xenomorph and I'm all

1298
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:24,920
for it yeah if we're doing the scale like I would say bulldoze the one in

1299
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:29,400
Tomorrowland build the original version but let's get crazy with it so plus it

1300
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:34,120
up like have people in there always that are plants maybe that get like sucked

1301
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:39,100
out of their seats and or like bloodied up or like have half the audience kind

1302
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:43,960
of like like have part of have part of the things move so like the seats go

1303
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,040
met like people go missing so like lights go back on and maybe the person

1304
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:53,560
next to you is gone dad is gone have the Prometheus the weird Prometheus God

1305
01:19:53,560 --> 01:20:00,880
creatures oh in there have and then of course I mean fold spin lock into the

1306
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:08,680
Wayland Yutani mythology yes everything is alien but also spin lock and Dr.

1307
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:12,160
females are there and make Ridley Scott do another one of these alien movies but

1308
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:16,420
spin lock is in it and he's interacting with fast benders what David is that the

1309
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:20,520
character the robot character so yeah put David on the ride to David is out

1310
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,980
the eyes like obviously get talking to you before the ride and then like spin

1311
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:27,920
lock like knocks him over like gets him wet because he's a robot and that's bad

1312
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,480
and like he starts the short circuit or something you have a little levity

1313
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:40,840
before the horror yeah Paul riser goes in Ripley goes in I think alive yeah live

1314
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:45,400
actors that was what I thought like a live that's Lee yes see two 3d that'd be

1315
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,720
fun yeah there's a lot of stuff you could do I think and I think the grand

1316
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:52,200
finale you do it like the I don't know why they didn't do this this would have

1317
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,780
been good in the original the alien encounter like in the movies you blow

1318
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:59,920
the alien out of an airlock and you got fans blasts that's great like that that's

1319
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:06,560
so that's a cool effect yeah yeah big whirlwind of wind a whirl of wind yeah

1320
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,560
I'm very well spoken this would be great right and I think you know obviously

1321
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:15,840
it's tough like you know to set the mythology and you know well I think we

1322
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,780
need to change it from Phil Hartman to Tim Curry so that we know that it's a

1323
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:24,440
scary ride and so that kids are why don't you put up a big red sign say no

1324
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:29,800
says no kids there was this attraction maybe too scary and

1325
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:34,800
intense for young children but people so rarely they made it look like one of the

1326
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,920
like more bored like one of the like we legally have to put on this like fine

1327
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,800
print ride they say that about everything but not every ride yeah little

1328
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:48,160
Mike's and Scott's Peter pants yeah and so I mean business here some cast

1329
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:51,440
members would be like you know what this is right it's like you know this super

1330
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,480
scary right and others would be like hi welcome to access tech come to our

1331
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:59,760
presentation and hey welcome back Jason welcome back you small little butter

1332
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:08,920
ball you weird weird little butterball your I heart for future mr. femis did

1333
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:15,000
you get tired of riding the people mover for an hour because if it's not

1334
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,120
busy at night they'll just let you sit on it they'll let you stay on it hey

1335
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:23,520
there's a hack yeah that's that's that's not a people mover hack but a

1336
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,480
Tomorrowland Transit Authority hack yeah that's another one too where it's like I

1337
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,720
mean it's great it's still there I love that it's still there but last time I

1338
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:36,760
was there I was like could I rip an mp3 of the old people mover narration and

1339
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:41,080
listen to it through headphones so I don't have to hear this teen like I

1340
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:45,080
could queue it up and have my own little experience and then my old character

1341
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:49,200
actors give me this old man and then when you ride stitches ride you can put

1342
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:55,160
on hurt by Johnny Cash during the ride oh yeah or just spin lock I just yell

1343
01:22:55,160 --> 01:23:02,640
spin locks lines during you cosplay is spin lock too at most conventions yeah

1344
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:08,840
conventions day jobs whatever have what have you when stitch comes out you yell

1345
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:19,400
lock him up check your privilege stitch riders so I think we have agreed it's

1346
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:25,200
somewhere between yeah plus it up somewhere else but it's a head it was

1347
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,040
ahead of its time because I don't even think at this like horror nights wasn't

1348
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:32,000
a big thing in the mid 90s I think it was just they were starting but it was

1349
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,440
now it's a hole it's a phenomenon it's the most popular thing that Universal

1350
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:41,760
does people want to piss in their pants that's not not us but people want it so

1351
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,640
they this would they were really kind of forward-thinking in a lot of ways yeah

1352
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:51,480
maybe just set up a different land entirely called this and Trump robot can

1353
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:58,120
go and piss land to also dark dark humor like again like dark humor usually like a

1354
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,680
little bit of it and ride it's fun and different it makes it stand out with

1355
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:06,880
dark mother-in-law jokes nothing darker than that that's that's the the seed of

1356
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:13,040
my getting into comedy was like this dark humor and then the hammy nonsense

1357
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:17,920
of the Adventurers Club and it's just never gone away and so I remain

1358
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:24,200
incredibly niche and unmarketable so so when you're on Marin when you're on WTF

1359
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:31,480
and he asks you who your guys are you're gonna say spin lock you a sure guy

1360
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,980
you're sir kind of guy the Colonel puppets and the giant idol from the

1361
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:38,720
Adventurers Club oh yeah and he's gonna go like yeah you know you and I aren't

1362
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:44,960
so different you are I heard so different you ever do heroin no mark oh

1363
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:51,200
boy well look forward to that episode coming up yeah of WTF and we'll be right

1364
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:58,880
back all right welcome back we now are presenting our second edition of our now

1365
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:05,360
recurring segment animatronic of the month and before we get going with that

1366
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:09,280
I want to congratulate the last winner of animatronic of the month striped

1367
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:13,340
shirt pirate trying to get the key back from the dog from Pirates of the

1368
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:19,240
Caribbean thank you so much congratulations to you I hope you

1369
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:23,720
animatronic have felt some increased pride while doing your repetitive work

1370
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:29,880
over the last month two months I don't remember when we did this last but feels

1371
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:36,720
like forever ago but hey striped striped shirt pirates where does a badge of

1372
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:41,940
honor on your on your striped shirt and but now it's time to yank the badge away

1373
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:46,640
from you and give it to another deserving animatronic who does such

1374
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:50,520
excellent work every day in a Disney park somewhere on the globe Mike I think

1375
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:58,240
you're first hello my pick for animatronic of the month is uncle Orville

1376
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:03,040
the drunk man drying out in a bathtub on the carousel of progress move over Bobby

1377
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:07,640
Moynihan this is the original drunk uncle uncle Orville you're great because

1378
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:12,280
of your meld blank voiced out of tune singing your weird uncle Sam costume and

1379
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:17,000
also being a very rare thing at Disney World a naked robot it's a thrill being

1380
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,120
able to see a naked relative of that character John up close so today I

1381
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:26,800
salute you uncle Orville I hope you do as your brother John asks stop being a

1382
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:34,840
leech and start looking for a job so what are we determined here in the theme

1383
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:40,360
of the episode where Jason is a lot more active and agitated than usual you just

1384
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:46,600
you convulsed when that began well Scott I guess my animatronic of the month is

1385
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:51,000
an example that we should probably talk to each other before doing this segment

1386
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:57,440
because my choice is also old uncle Orville tell us about him oh he as Mike

1387
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:02,960
said is a lazy man who spends all of his time in a bathtub specifically wearing a

1388
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:09,480
giant uncle Sam he is the permanent houseguest of John and his family and

1389
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:15,480
he miraculously invented a system that John calls air cooling which in this

1390
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:21,880
case is a giant ice cube sitting in front of a fan and so this lazy idiot

1391
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:28,920
somehow invented air conditioning to make his time engaging in the sin of

1392
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:36,840
sloth that much more pleasant lazy lazing around enjoying cool air why those are

1393
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:44,560
two of my favorite pastimes so I'm also throwing it my hat into the rig for

1394
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:51,280
uncle orville so god bless you uncle orville you're also my pick for

1395
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:56,040
animatronic of the month wow this could be a race yeah well I was that well I

1396
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,840
think we could do the vote we could do the vote a couple ways it could we could

1397
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:04,380
put on the Twitter where you cast your votes Mike's uncle Orville and Jason's

1398
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:08,960
uncle Orville but maybe here's where we really form a little difference would

1399
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:14,320
you like to declare different years or decades well let's I'll say this

1400
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:19,920
uncle Orville did change he used to be cousin Orville in the original and he

1401
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:25,760
didn't have the uncle Sam costume on for a while oh so we both talked about the

1402
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,680
uncle Sam costume so honestly we cannot we have to do the same we have to do

1403
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,760
this all right because he shows up at the in the last segment of carousel of

1404
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:38,600
progress but it's just a toilet flushing as if to imply uncle Orville now is

1405
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:43,280
also a houseguest but just takes long shits all right well since I'm not

1406
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:48,200
taking that one since it's just a shit sound effect and not not a fully built

1407
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:54,480
robot why so it'll be it'll be my choice versus your two and I have a feeling one

1408
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:58,160
of yours is gonna win because mine I might is a little bit more of a of a

1409
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:02,120
point I'm making is this the best animatronic I don't know but I think it

1410
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:06,840
might be the most put upon I'm talking about from the 3d movie it's tough to be

1411
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:11,720
a bug at the villainous animatronic hopper hopper is already hated and booed

1412
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:16,440
by children in two different theme parks plus he's straight out of Pixar's fourth

1413
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:21,080
worst film according to kid film critic lights camera Jackson not to mention

1414
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:25,360
he's typically most of the year stuck lifeless in the rafters of his own

1415
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,960
theater while Disney changes out the tough to be a bug theater to show

1416
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,760
trailers for things like I don't know their live-action reboot of chicken

1417
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:37,680
little but the worst burden that animatronic hopper faces is that he is

1418
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:42,680
cursed with a voice that most people assume is Kevin Spacey it is not and

1419
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:47,680
never was Kevin Spacey in both the attraction and the video game hopper is

1420
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:52,220
voiced by Pixar director Andrew Stanton Stanton is a two-time Academy Award

1421
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:57,000
winner the man behind Finding Nemo Wally and two episodes of stranger things

1422
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,640
there is almost no animatronic with a higher pedigree of voice talent and yet

1423
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:06,400
everyone assumes hopper that you are voiced by a creep so today I raise a

1424
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:12,760
glass of bug juice to hopper and his Oscar-winning non harassing voice it's

1425
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:19,120
tough to be a bug but it's extra tough to be animatronic hopper Wow Wow great

1426
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:23,560
choices all around isn't it a shame that because I think that you heard to me

1427
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,280
that people think that they're getting yelled at by an animatronic Kevin Spacey

1428
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:31,240
and yet it is not him and the voice in the movie he is the voice in the movie

1429
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,960
not on the right of the rider the game the grass the grasshopper we're all

1430
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,160
making a lot of assumptions that we've assumed that you remember who hopper was

1431
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:45,640
we assume certainly that you know who John is for to the memorably named

1432
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:50,040
protagonist progress throughout the years on his journey and he's also

1433
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:55,720
another another character that is exactly like Jason yeah a kindly old man

1434
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:01,600
in a rocking chair with a thick sweater who's eternal I do like the I like the

1435
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,640
idea that we there are hundreds if not thousands of robots and the second time

1436
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:11,080
we did this Jason and I picked the same character he's the seven about the same

1437
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:16,240
thing the seventh most prominent robot on that ride this 45 presidents alone

1438
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:21,560
hundreds of pirates right hundred nine hundred ninety nine ghosts you manage to

1439
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:28,000
choose a large man in a bathtub it makes a lot of sense yeah somehow

1440
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:34,280
