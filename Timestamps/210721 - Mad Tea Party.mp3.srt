1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,800
There's a lot, you know, there's a lot to do here

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,080
on Podcasts to Ride the Second Gate.

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,040
We're down the rabbit hole already.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,960
The rockin' rabbit hole, as I like to call it.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,040
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always.

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,600
My Cheshire cat, Jason Sheridan.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,920
That's right, today's password is rock and roll.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,240
And DJ White Rabbit himself, Scott Gardner is here.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,240
Yeah, look, I wanna get right to it.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,000
Mike, you're outta your fuckin' mind.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,840
This thing, this is not a good thing.

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,720
This is, I've been giving you the benefit of the doubt

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,400
on this for a long time.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,280
You've brought this up so many times over the years,

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,280
and I imagined, like, okay, maybe there is a 5% chance

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,680
that I would look at a video of this and sort of get it.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,660
And having looked at some video now, maybe not enough,

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,280
maybe that's the issue, but the video that I did look at

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,120
makes me get it to no percentage.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,360
What video did you watch, first of all?

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,360
I watched the Mad Tea Party Band.

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,200
Okay.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,920
I watched the last night that they performed

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,920
when they are, everybody's hyped, everybody's super hyped.

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
They had changed the set list at that point, you know?

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,840
Yeah, it was so melancholy, closing night of a big show,

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,280
you know, that's a melancholy time.

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,640
Yeah, that's not the most exuberant performance

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,520
of the whole run.

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,680
Well, it should be, any sampling that I take

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,760
should give me some, look, I looked at other one,

33
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,120
the costumes were always the same.

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,680
The costumes were the same, yes.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,760
The Jack FM songs were always the same.

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,080
Whether you're watching the Mad Tea Party

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,000
or the Diamond Man Tea Party,

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,120
you might be getting a different vibe.

39
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,520
You know what, look, I wanna calm down here, okay?

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,160
I wanted to settle down.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,160
I have made special Mad Tea Party drinks for everyone.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,800
Oh my, well this'll, all right.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
So I just want everyone to, yeah, drink me.

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
This is of course my glass,

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,840
it's an official Mad Tea Party glass that I have had

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,120
since going to the show many years ago.

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,480
That's right, I saw these glasses

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,760
and I thought they were candles.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,360
You wanna hand one of these to Scott?

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
What is it?

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,040
What is it?

52
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,840
It is a thing I've, it's elderberry, vitamin C,

53
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,480
it is strawberry sparkling water and vodka.

54
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,560
So it's not too sweet.

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,960
It might be bad, it's not bad,

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,280
it just kinda tastes like sparkling water.

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,640
I was getting worried there would not be an alcoholic

58
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,480
component. Oh no, there is.

59
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,600
That was the biggest fear.

60
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,440
Yeah.

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
All right, okay. I think it's okay.

62
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,040
Get on the same page here. I think it's enough right

63
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,960
for enough sweet.

64
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,480
It's not a perfect drink.

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,440
I like it.

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
But it's a casual.

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,880
That's pretty refreshing.

68
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,720
Pretty good.

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,520
The elderberry is, the vitamin C gives you the flavor

70
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,440
but it's not the too sweet that you might get from

71
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,800
like a sugar syrup.

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,200
This is a terrific dinner, terrific dinner chaser

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,640
to my meal of a Burger King chicken king sandwich.

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,480
Oh, you had the chicken king?

75
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,680
In frozen Coca-Cola.

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,880
I have had the chicken king multiple times.

77
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,720
Wow, really?

78
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,440
Because I think it's that good.

79
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,280
How?

80
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
I like it.

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,640
Of the other chicken sandwiches you've had

82
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,680
that we've had together.

83
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,200
I mean, I, Popeye's, a good version of the Popeye's one

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,560
is good.

85
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,720
The chicken king I would think is nipping at its heels.

86
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,560
Wow.

87
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,380
Is it a similar vibe?

88
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,220
What are the components?

89
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,560
Similar vibe, it even comes in the same sort of like

90
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,680
envelope sort of thing.

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,160
But it's kinda like a mayo and pickles.

92
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,840
There's a hot one that's like dipped in a hot wash,

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
hot liquid.

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,520
Hot wash?

95
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
That one is just hot.

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,200
Hot wash.

97
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,040
When we get hot chicken, it's kinda dipped in a hot.

98
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,080
Like a batter?

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,920
Yeah, isn't it?

100
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,740
No, it's just.

101
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,320
It's a fried dough or a batter.

102
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,880
No, there's like a wash.

103
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,480
I think wash is the term.

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,320
It's like a chili.

105
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,160
Really?

106
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,380
Would it be scraped on, not scraped on,

107
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,320
but brushed on, like a brush?

108
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,160
Would a brush do the job?

109
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,520
I guess you could brush it on a little bit.

110
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,120
Usually I just see them take this kinda chicken

111
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,280
and dip it in.

112
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,840
Pre-dip wash, I guess Jason's right.

113
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,680
Yeah.

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,240
Chicken wash, okay.

115
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,720
So I didn't think that was good.

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,560
Chicken wash.

117
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,240
Popeye's just the spicy one.

118
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,880
Jason's full of chicken wash.

119
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,720
I'm just full of chicken wash.

120
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,800
Jason's chasing it with vitamin C and elderberry.

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
And did you hear he had a frozen Coke as well?

122
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,520
Frozen, yeah, that was kinda muttered towards the end.

123
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,360
Well, in the app, it was free.

124
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,920
And that's why.

125
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,320
They give away the bank in the app.

126
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,800
Yeah, in the apps right now, they're really going to town.

127
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,440
Like you can get a frosty Chino for free at Wendy's

128
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,280
with purchase of any item.

129
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,400
Is there a frosty with a caffeine component?

130
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,240
It's exactly right.

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,600
I see, it's great.

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,360
It's like drinking coffee ice cream.

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,200
Wow, wow.

134
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,680
I don't recommend it every day, but.

135
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
Sure, sure.

136
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,640
So anyway, we're calling down now.

137
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,320
No, we're getting on the same page here.

138
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,440
You did an excellent job of hiding the drinks.

139
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,280
That was great with very little.

140
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,200
I think he saw them.

141
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I saw them, I didn't really know what it was.

142
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,960
I thought it was just, you were having a beverage or,

143
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,840
yeah, like I said, they could be candles.

144
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,880
He was going to play them, play the glasses.

145
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,760
He was going to like, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

146
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,640
The man tea party, yes, the man tea party glass

147
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,840
is just so ubiquitous.

148
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,320
I've seen it in your various homes.

149
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,440
I think you probably with me when it was purchased.

150
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,280
Probably.

151
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,120
It's ubiquitous if you've been where Mike lives a lot.

152
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,360
If you've been where Mike lives,

153
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,880
and I have a very strong memory of me and Mike at the bar.

154
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,040
At the man tea party.

155
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,480
The man tea party at Drink Me.

156
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,120
At Drink Me, at the man tea party.

157
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,960
It was the bar, okay.

158
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,520
And we ordered mad,

159
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,200
I didn't think we'd get to this as quickly.

160
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,240
I do have it here.

161
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,320
Mad hatino, mad hatio.

162
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,840
If you're struggling to find it,

163
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,240
you don't know how to say it.

164
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,440
Matititos.

165
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,240
It was a mojito, and I remember watching them.

166
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,920
A madhito, is that what it was called?

167
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,560
A madhito.

168
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,480
That would make a lot more sense

169
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,320
than whatever you were trying to say.

170
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,160
Matititos.

171
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,840
They didn't have the J in it.

172
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,360
Anyway, I watched them pick up the milk jug,

173
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,400
like the gallon.

174
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
Oh, you've told this story three times on the show.

175
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,560
Probably.

176
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,520
Like just pour this goo.

177
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,520
You realize, yeah, you were like,

178
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,760
they're not making this fresh.

179
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,600
What?

180
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
They have a jug of sugar drinks right there.

181
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,480
These are not mixologists picked by the mad hatio himself?

182
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,320
No.

183
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,400
I realize I didn't cue this up,

184
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,520
but I have a photo from the mad tea party.

185
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,400
And this is again,

186
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,280
okay, real quick.

187
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,280
The mad tea party was a music celebration,

188
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,600
festival of fun,

189
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,840
celebrating Lewis Carroll's great story,

190
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,680
Alison Winland.

191
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,400
In addition to some of the greatest hits,

192
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,680
modern pop hits of the day and of yesteryear.

193
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,560
And it was there for a couple of years.

194
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,960
And there was a lot of staging, a lot of decorations.

195
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,880
It really filled up the space from the boring,

196
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,280
now kind of defunct area, nothing area.

197
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,840
The monster zinc and Muppet vision.

198
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,680
Yes.

199
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,040
The bad Hollywood courtyard.

200
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,880
Right.

201
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,360
And when it was mad tea party time,

202
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,240
the state, everything was full in there.

203
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,280
It was full of life, full of fun,

204
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,880
full of friends and love.

205
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,640
Full of friends, yeah.

206
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,120
And yeah, so that's what we're talking about today.

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,480
It's really what I'm getting at.

208
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,120
I don't get it because I wasn't there, man.

209
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,640
This is like a festival.

210
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,480
I'm not feeling the plur, whatever.

211
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
Here's a photo of me.

212
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
Here it is.

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,280
And look how happy.

214
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,120
2012 iPhone 4 photos.

215
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,440
Yeah, they're a little low res.

216
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
I look, trust me, I'm happy there.

217
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm a little skinnier too.

218
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,560
Wearing a shirt of Mickey showing his seat,

219
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,200
rubbing it like, thrusting his seat at you.

220
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,720
I kind of look like, my eyes are like,

221
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,560
I look like a cartoon character in this picture.

222
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
You're tripping out on the glow heat.

223
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,920
On the sights and sounds of the mad tea party.

224
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,640
I would regularly, and Lindsay's walking around,

225
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,560
I would regularly during this period say,

226
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,600
are we going to get mad tonight?

227
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,760
Yes, he would.

228
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,080
He would do this a lot, especially if it was later in the day

229
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,040
and DCA was very crowded.

230
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
He's like, well, the always mad tea party.

231
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
Can always get mad tonight.

232
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,320
I knew it was one of the, I knew this was,

233
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,800
I took one look at a video and I'm like,

234
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,400
oh, this is one of those Mike things that he's always like,

235
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,640
cheeky smile, like maybe we could do it.

236
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,280
And depending on the group.

237
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,120
That's right.

238
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,280
The group is perhaps, I mean,

239
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,360
certainly no one is as on board as you.

240
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,840
Jason seems like a good percentage.

241
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,680
Yeah.

242
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Well, I, I mean, I'd kill,

243
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
we're still getting back to collective experiences

244
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,960
that I would kill to be at the mad tea party right now.

245
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,400
I feel like I'm appreciating stuff a lot more.

246
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,280
Strangle someone to death.

247
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,120
Sure.

248
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,160
And the life to hear a band play a ponjo be covered.

249
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,000
That's right.

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,320
In a Dormouse hat.

251
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,440
But one thing I've forgotten about this was that

252
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,440
this was like opening with DCA two-part,

253
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,840
the excitement was in the air.

254
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,720
The excitement was in the air.

255
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,080
Radiator Springs racers zooming along.

256
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,840
All of the cars land.

257
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,400
Trollies are there.

258
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,240
Trollies.

259
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Newsboys singing songs.

260
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
The glory of the 1910s.

261
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Free newspapers.

262
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,920
Suitcase in a dream was new,

263
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,880
a fresh new song being showcased.

264
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
People are saying, look,

265
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,600
there's a new statue of Waltz and Mickey's like

266
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,480
kneeling on him and he's wearing a cap.

267
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,040
And then they headbutt each other.

268
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,120
They were so aggressively happy about the statue.

269
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,960
Yeah.

270
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,560
I mean, so you were there, Scott.

271
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
You just didn't do this.

272
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
I, when this was open 2012 to 2016.

273
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
Well, there was a break in between.

274
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,320
There was a break and then it came back

275
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,160
bigger than ever seemingly for the anniversary show.

276
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
For this.

277
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,720
I was at specifically California Adventure

278
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,800
in that time so much.

279
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,440
And I didn't sit foot in this.

280
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,280
I didn't do.

281
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,120
I didn't even know what it was over.

282
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,280
It was there.

283
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,320
I think I probably caught the name and the vibe

284
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,120
and was like, no, thanks.

285
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,720
That's okay.

286
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,680
Leave that for the 15 year olds.

287
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,240
15 year, are you kidding me?

288
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,520
This is full grown adults.

289
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,160
But this was, look, this was two year olds.

290
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,120
Old grown adults in big cartoon hats.

291
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,960
And I couldn't find the video.

292
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,840
There's a video we had,

293
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,760
there were like dance circles of kids

294
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,160
breaking out of the middle of this thing.

295
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh yeah.

296
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,280
This was the closest to my Videopolis that existed

297
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,600
of like a bunch of people having fun

298
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,840
at like a concert environment.

299
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,720
Now it wasn't as hip and cool as Videopolis.

300
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,560
I know that.

301
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,680
I'm not crazy.

302
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,520
Okay.

303
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,600
But this was fun.

304
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
The hippest thing that ever happened.

305
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,200
Videopolis is like pretty.

306
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,120
It's hip.

307
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,920
CBGB, you know.

308
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,480
It was a scene, man.

309
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,320
Gelman Street, punk rock.

310
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,400
Green, that's Green Day where Green Day was from.

311
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,240
Gelman Street.

312
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
Gelman Street.

313
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,000
Do they present this as like,

314
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,840
it's down on Gelman.

315
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,480
We're part of that Gelman scene.

316
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,320
I'm pretty sure.

317
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,160
No, don't Google more about Gelman.

318
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,000
Put your phone down.

319
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
I just wanted to make sure it was right.

320
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,360
Back to Mad, no, back to Mad T, forget I asked it.

321
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,680
That lonely road he was walking had a name, okay.

322
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,960
There's a song, they have an early song called

323
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,800
Christy Road before that road.

324
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,640
So there was a different sad road.

325
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,120
Why do you say that excited?

326
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,960
What was I gonna do about Christy Road?

327
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,800
Christy Road's a good song.

328
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,640
Oh, Christy Road, that changes everything.

329
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,440
Bruce has Highway Nine,

330
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,840
Green Day has Christy and Gelman Road.

331
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Well, Gelman Street.

332
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,400
Gelman Street, sorry.

333
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
I think that was the name of the venue.

334
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Gelman, there's a song about you.

335
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,840
Yes, there's a street name down here apparently.

336
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,680
Regis and Cavaliers.

337
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,600
There's a, Green Day's the name of the band.

338
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,960
Kelly, what is it, Kelly and Michael now?

339
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,440
No, Michael's gone, Kelly and Ryan.

340
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,480
Sorry, I couldn't think of what the current version

341
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,320
of Regis and Cavaliers was,

342
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,080
and it's Kelly and Ryan, Ryan Seacrest.

343
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,200
Megan McCain's gonna come.

344
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,840
Megan, it's Kelly, Ryan, and Megan now.

345
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,720
So yeah, this was, a couple years this existed,

346
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,560
no joke, I wanted to go to it all the time.

347
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,400
Yes.

348
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,000
And I know it's funny, but I do really like it.

349
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,920
I know it's absurd and ridiculous,

350
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,480
but I do legitimately like it

351
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,680
and really wish it was there.

352
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,760
I really miss it.

353
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,680
It does, I mean, that area is dead right now.

354
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,760
There's nothing going on.

355
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,640
There's nothing going on right now.

356
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,520
I think this kind of lived and died

357
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,720
on the numerous annual pass holders.

358
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,400
Annual passes, much less expensive at the time too.

359
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,800
I was getting a haircut once around,

360
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,000
shortly like within the first six months of this opening,

361
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and the hairdresser had like a tiny little top hat on,

362
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,120
and I was like, oh, that's an interesting hat.

363
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,600
And it was kind of pinned in her head,

364
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,200
but I was like, I think it's got a string under her chin.

365
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,400
And she was like, thanks, do you know what the mad,

366
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,640
do you know about the mad tea party at Disneyland?

367
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,480
I was like, I actually, yes, I know exactly what,

368
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,880
I do know the mad tea party.

369
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,560
And she's like, yeah, I'm there like every weekend.

370
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,400
And so-

371
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,360
The locals love it.

372
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
It's fans, yeah.

373
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,400
Yeah, it did.

374
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,480
I'm surprised they got rid of it.

375
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,680
I don't know, cause Electronica,

376
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,800
we've talked about this before,

377
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,520
the Electronica Festival,

378
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,400
whatever they called it was there before.

379
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,960
Yeah, and Glow Fest before that.

380
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,360
And Glow Fest was before that.

381
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,680
These were all like music, I don't know,

382
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,840
show performances every night.

383
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,760
Yeah, nighttime stuff.

384
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,600
With a vibe.

385
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,680
And with a heavy bar component,

386
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,800
like themed bar.

387
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,720
An Electronica had the arcade,

388
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,360
and then the arcade basically stayed for this

389
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,520
and was transformed.

390
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,360
They still had-

391
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,800
Kind of more carnival game sort of arcade games.

392
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,600
Yeah, black light in there, not the neon of Tron.

393
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,640
So some of the components were saved.

394
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,480
I think some of the structures they reused as well

395
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,920
for the stage.

396
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Electronica, I feel like always more empty.

397
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,840
More empty when I walk through it.

398
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,040
This was so much more popular than Electronica,

399
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,880
I feel like.

400
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,800
This was insanely popular.

401
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,280
I mean, a lot, the early,

402
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,400
like people wrote about it.

403
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,200
It kind of seemed like they were visually going for like,

404
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,080
yeah, the Tim Burton house in Wonderland,

405
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,520
I think had been successful.

406
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,360
But then it seemed like they were also going for like,

407
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,200
it's like the Electric Daisy carnival,

408
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,080
but without the MDMA and death.

409
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Yes.

410
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,280
It is have, it has a vibe of like a douchey

411
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,000
Southern California music festival.

412
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,640
It has elements of that,

413
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,720
where like what you're talking about,

414
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,800
where it's like, you could see some of those structures

415
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,600
being like sitting on the middle of it.

416
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,520
I don't know if it's not burning.

417
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,080
Burning Man isn't that, it's not the vibe,

418
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,720
but like it's a little more Coachella or-

419
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,560
Yeah, but-

420
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,400
What you just said.

421
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,560
The music varieties, like on one website where it looks at

422
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,120
is trance, new wave, and dance pop.

423
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,520
And I don't think that it's accurate.

424
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,720
I think in theory on paper that was the case,

425
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,720
but dance pop is maybe, that's a reach even.

426
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,600
This is my, this is some of my,

427
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,080
because this came up a couple of weeks ago

428
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,960
with Jordan Morris and we were talking about bands

429
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,160
and is Disneyland ever been in step with current music.

430
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,920
And then Mike, you, like right at the top,

431
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,160
veer it over here.

432
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
We're not anywhere close to talking about this.

433
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,960
So you can breathlessly say how this was,

434
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,480
you know, it was really kind of a way for Disneyland

435
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,600
to reflect the EDM, the electronic music culture

436
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,440
that was going on.

437
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,800
Which I feel like was very progressive for them.

438
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,840
And it was, you know, amazing, you know,

439
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,320
to be so in sync with the current pop culture.

440
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,120
And then I watched one video of it and like,

441
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,840
you're not as mad as you seem to me.

442
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,560
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

443
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
Okay, DJ White Rabbit was-

444
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,360
The DJs are different.

445
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
My point was electronica.

446
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,480
And then when the DJs would play,

447
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,720
it's the closest thing to hip.

448
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,000
I wasn't saying the setlist of the rock band.

449
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,960
But that too, I'm watching the White Rabbit

450
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,800
and it's like,

451
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,240
what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what,

452
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,160
like yeah, this is, this is a grandmother's idea.

453
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,520
For Disney I'm saying.

454
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,600
For Disney and they got Uptown Funk in the rotation

455
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,440
pretty quickly. And Uptown Funk

456
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,120
is in the diamond setlist.

457
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,960
Uptown Funk is in the diamond setlist.

458
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,040
It's in the diamond setlist.

459
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,640
Open the show on the diamond setlist.

460
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,840
Wait, hang on a second.

461
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,760
The arrangement-

462
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,640
Everyone stop.

463
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,760
What's the diamond setlist?

464
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,080
Why are you shouting diamond setlist at me

465
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,000
as if I know how that's different than anything else?

466
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,200
Because when the show came back,

467
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,760
it was during the diamond celebration.

468
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,200
So- For the anniversary.

469
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,560
So when I go to the website

470
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,880
that I got all this information on,

471
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,040
which of course is mousertainment.com,

472
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,640
it refers to that specific setlist as the diamond setlist.

473
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,360
So the diamond setlist is more important somehow?

474
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,400
Why is diamond- No, no.

475
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,240
It's just saying that-

476
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,000
But you were touting that as like a reason it was good.

477
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,080
That was the marketing.

478
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,360
Jason brought up Uptown Funk

479
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,960
because it was a pretty new song at this point.

480
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,800
It wasn't like it was 10 years old.

481
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,840
It is impressive.

482
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,680
That's what she was saying.

483
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,960
That's remotely within the calendar year

484
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,480
that they're using in a-

485
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,600
Yeah, now was the third song,

486
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,760
"'What I Like About You'?"

487
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,600
Sure.

488
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,920
Was there a medley of Jessie's girl

489
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,920
and the summer of 69?

490
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,760
Yes.

491
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,840
Yeah.

492
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,680
Was there the time warp and also in the air tonight?

493
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,520
Yeah.

494
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,360
This is what-

495
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,920
We are describing a wedding band setlist.

496
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,560
This is a wedding band that is dressed like that

497
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,760
where one has a Mad Hatter hat and there's an Alice.

498
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,400
And the costumes are great, but what-

499
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,120
And they did, we are family.

500
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,000
And they did it with a diamond next to it.

501
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,760
That means it's an extra important song.

502
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,120
There are little treats in there that you wouldn't expect.

503
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,920
They did do Rhythm Nation by Janet Jackson at one point.

504
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,760
That's pretty good.

505
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,600
So that's pretty cool.

506
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,440
Yeah, that's good.

507
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
They did, there's a Prince song in there.

508
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
Obviously it's, let's go crazy.

509
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,640
It's not like a wonderful ass.

510
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,920
It's not much would be, but B-side.

511
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,360
It's not Jack you off.

512
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,200
It's not Jack you off.

513
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,440
It's not Pussy Control.

514
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,600
It's not those Prince songs.

515
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,640
They did, somebody told me,

516
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,320
which was not the killer song I thought they would do.

517
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,480
Somebody told me it's not my favorite killer song.

518
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,200
They did Shut Up and Dance too.

519
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,160
They have, yeah.

520
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,360
But these still were not in exactly encounter culture.

521
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,200
No, we are.

522
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,000
I completely agree with that.

523
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,040
They had, let's see, I'm looking here.

524
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,320
They did Wrecking Ball by Miley Cyrus,

525
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,800
which was fairly new at the time.

526
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,640
That was pretty new.

527
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,760
A couple of years old, which is a song I like.

528
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,600
I like that song.

529
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,560
I like that song, yeah.

530
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,880
Scott, how do you feel about Wrecking Ball?

531
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,120
I don't really like Wrecking Ball.

532
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,760
I'm coming off, look, I know.

533
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,680
It's all edge lordy with me.

534
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,640
I understand.

535
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
There's people, I know I'm losing listeners.

536
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,600
You like the Miley Cyrus Mark Ronson songs, you know.

537
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,920
Oh yeah, that one.

538
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,760
I forget the name of it.

539
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,600
Nothing breaks like a heart.

540
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,920
Nothing breaks like a heart, yeah.

541
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,760
Yeah.

542
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,920
It was my issue with Wrecking Ball is like,

543
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,760
why she had never sung like that before.

544
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,520
All of a sudden, one day.

545
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,920
Say it, I don't say it.

546
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,680
Like, why do you, why have you suddenly started?

547
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,360
You're against artists evolving?

548
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,080
Is that what you're saying?

549
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,920
Okay.

550
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,760
I'm against.

551
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,800
Interesting.

552
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Like, sudden hard turns into trendy ways of singing.

553
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
Like CIE.

554
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

555
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,000
I see what you're saying.

556
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,560
Suddenly you're just doing the current.

557
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,000
Yeah, I'm looking at the Diamond Set List.

558
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, they did do Come On, Eileen in the set list,

559
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,360
in the Diamond Set List.

560
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,560
But these are crowd pleasing classics.

561
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,200
8 to 80, we're at, you know, California Adventure.

562
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,040
And I'll say this, and this is, you should know this,

563
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,320
I mean, maybe I've said this in the show before about me.

564
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,880
If you have a free ticket, excuse me,

565
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,480
I suddenly was about to cry.

566
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,000
I was burping, I swear.

567
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,840
Have you?

568
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,320
Just tell me, these shows mean so much to me.

569
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,400
If you invite me to a concert and it's free,

570
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,800
I will go to any concert.

571
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,320
I don't, I don't, if it's outside, that's even better.

572
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,280
I'll go see Nickelback tomorrow.

573
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll go see, pick the worst band and see if you can get me

574
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,320
to say I really don't wanna see that.

575
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,480
That's how you ended up following

576
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,040
the deplorable choir on tour.

577
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,000
What is that?

578
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,360
That was those three women who wore the Trump hats

579
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,160
and sang songs about Donald Trump.

580
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,680
I do not know the deplorable choir.

581
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,520
Well, you're lucky.

582
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,800
Would I go to see the deplorable choir in concert?

583
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,640
Is that what you're asking?

584
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,460
Yeah.

585
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,480
Okay, no, I would not go see them.

586
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,440
That would be no, I would say no.

587
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,160
I'm curious, I would read a review of a set.

588
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,000
You know what, you're right.

589
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,520
You know what, it's all originals

590
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,800
and like Francis Scott Key, you know.

591
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,320
Well, there was a band around the time of Bush

592
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,720
called the Wright Brothers,

593
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,100
and they had a song called Bush Was Right.

594
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,140
And it sounded a lot like Billy Joel's

595
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,620
We Didn't Start the Fire,

596
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,120
only a list of like things that Bush had gotten right,

597
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,060
which of course are all things he got wrong,

598
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,580
which are all things that are opposite.

599
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,420
But of course Bush was right.

600
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,300
All those weird phrases,

601
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,700
that was how you're supposed to say it.

602
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,640
That won't get fooled again.

603
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,620
Yeah.

604
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,820
He did have it right.

605
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, he said the right things at the right time.

606
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,820
But yeah, I would see, like I guess I would if it was free,

607
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,180
if I wasn't giving the Wright Brothers

608
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,860
whatever they were called, money.

609
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,700
The Wright Brothers.

610
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
This is up there in obscure references.

611
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,540
I gotta see if that's the name of that one.

612
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,380
I like this, and like the bad T-Birds,

613
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,980
this is a more recent obscure,

614
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,460
this isn't from the 1930s.

615
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,100
The Wright Brothers are from this very century.

616
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,020
Yeah, they were the Wright Brothers, R-I-G-H-T,

617
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,260
because they were right wing.

618
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,220
And they're also from the Gelman Street scene, I believe.

619
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,180
No, they were, but kicked out of Gelman Street.

620
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,740
Gelman Street was punk and left wing.

621
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,660
No way.

622
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,380
So yeah, so I would go to most concerts.

623
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,700
I like, I just like that live music.

624
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,300
I don't care if it's good.

625
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,780
I don't care if it's current.

626
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,260
Well, what you need to do is just like,

627
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,500
just go to weddings,

628
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,780
just get invited to as many weddings with bands,

629
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,620
or just start walking into them.

630
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,280
No one will mind that you're crashing,

631
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,460
because you'll be the most excited person there.

632
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,860
You're gonna love every song.

633
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,780
You're gonna love...

634
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,580
I've said this before,

635
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,660
I do sometimes get annoyed at weddings,

636
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,340
because sometimes I do feel like the playlist

637
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,260
is a little too boring.

638
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,460
They don't throw in a rhythm nation.

639
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,260
I need a thing here and there

640
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
that's kind of interesting or new.

641
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,100
Because I do, I don't...

642
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,740
They're not mixing uptown funk

643
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,540
with Morris Day in the time.

644
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,860
Right, which they do in this.

645
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,700
Which they do.

646
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,540
Did you see that, Scott?

647
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,380
And that's kind of a little,

648
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,940
people were saying at the time,

649
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,780
the reviews of uptown funk were like...

650
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,940
Of course, we were all saying

651
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,980
that this sounds like Morris Day in the time.

652
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,620
Yeah, and they do a little oh yo yo in the song.

653
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,180
That's pretty great.

654
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,220
A little bit of commentary.

655
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,060
Commentary, yeah.

656
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,780
Commentary, so this is subversive,

657
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,620
is what you're saying.

658
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,940
It is subversive,

659
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,440
because there's a flirtiness between Alice and the Hatter,

660
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,060
and that just wasn't present in the original cartoon,

661
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,380
because it was a child and an insane man.

662
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,460
So they got to do it at the show.

663
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,220
Now, okay, so I guess we really even didn't say that.

664
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,780
Yeah, we have an exclusive band, really.

665
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,260
Yeah, well, it's only one part

666
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,180
of the man-tea party experience.

667
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,580
Yeah, that's true.

668
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,820
There's multiple stages and acts.

669
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,660
Yes, that's true, but the band itself, yeah,

670
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,740
Alice and the Mad Hatter,

671
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,300
both dressed in dep, Johnny Depp,

672
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,060
Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton style outfits,

673
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,460
a little, probably more colorful.

674
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,660
First of all, the Alice in,

675
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,380
Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland.

676
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,900
When this twisted genius gets his hands

677
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,460
on the most twisted story of all time,

678
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,460
you'll feel like you took a little opium hit.

679
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,900
When you see that, what if,

680
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,900
like what if a spiral was crooked?

681
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,820
That's the kind of thing you're gonna get to see.

682
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,140
What if a fence was a weird, gnarled fence?

683
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,340
That's the kind of thing that the twisted,

684
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,540
the king of twistedness, Tim Burton's gonna show you.

685
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,380
That's messed up.

686
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,100
You'll think you're on Laudanum,

687
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,500
like it was still widely available.

688
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,580
Is that a weird old drug?

689
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,740
That was a weird old drug.

690
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,220
What is it? Laudanum?

691
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,060
Yeah, Laudanum.

692
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,020
He stumped us twice in seven minutes.

693
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,860
Wow.

694
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,300
Not, you guys are on Laudanum.

695
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,420
He's on Laudanum.

696
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,300
Jason's on Laudanum.

697
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,340
My ether rag ran out earlier, so.

698
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,980
And you tried to order a phosphated Burger King.

699
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,180
Yeah, they just didn't understand.

700
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,020
They know what you meant, yeah.

701
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,860
Just said mobile order number, please.

702
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,380
Coca-Cola phosphate, please.

703
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,860
You're trying to type it into the app.

704
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,180
Override name, P-H-O.

705
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,020
Yeah.

706
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,380
So, yeah, so.

707
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,860
I think this is part of it, I think, is this movie.

708
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,700
I don't want it.

709
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,180
I have no. I've never seen these movies.

710
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,020
There's two of them. Yeah, I haven't either.

711
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,700
I've never seen them. Not for me.

712
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,260
The first one is like, what?

713
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,660
The highest grossing movie of all time or something?

714
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,500
It's up there.

715
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,820
It's an insane success.

716
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,380
It's hugely popular in China

717
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,220
to the point that they made the, like a garden,

718
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,460
like a walkthrough, like hedge maze sort of garden

719
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,060
designed like the Tim Burton,

720
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,660
Alison Wonderland characters.

721
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,500
Oh, really?

722
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,660
In Shanghai, you're saying?

723
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,780
In Shanghai, yeah.

724
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,620
Yeah, you know, I put it on before this.

725
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,460
I was like, what is the,

726
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,340
I don't think I've ever heard the Mad Hatter talk.

727
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,220
I haven't heard the Depp Mad Hatter talk.

728
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,340
And then I put it on and it's like, hello,

729
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,180
and the Mad Hatter.

730
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,140
It's like, it just exactly what, like,

731
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,020
Johnny Depp, he's gonna create this character.

732
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,460
He is an artisan for characters.

733
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,780
And when you see, now,

734
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,300
now let's cut to something totally different.

735
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
What's Mordecai?

736
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,380
Hello, I'm Mordecai.

737
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,540
All right, now he's going to play General Norman Schwarzkopf.

738
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,780
It's a very serious, a Gulf War,

739
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,100
but it's a very gritty film.

740
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,780
Now let's see, hello, I'm General Norman Schwarzkopf.

741
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,980
What about his cameo in Yoga Hosers?

742
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,100
What does he sound like in that?

743
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,700
That is different.

744
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,180
That is a, that is a,

745
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,340
Yoga Hosers.

746
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,300
He's reprised all of the characters.

747
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,980
Oh, right, he was in Tusk, right?

748
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,820
That's correct.

749
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,180
I've blocked out of my memory that,

750
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,260
whatever he did, he's like a bizarre Canadian in that.

751
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,340
Kind of like an Inspector Clouseau riff, you know?

752
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,940
Like Mordecai.

753
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,500
Is Mordecai an Inspector?

754
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,140
Another Inspector, probably.

755
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,260
What if Mordecai met the Love Guru?

756
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,420
What if they all met the Master Pistachio Disguisey,

757
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,740
the Master of Disguise?

758
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,580
All right, all right.

759
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,940
I thought I didn't know his name,

760
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,780
but then I was like, you fool.

761
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,980
Of course, it's Pistachio Disguisey.

762
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,900
His family is the Disguiseys.

763
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,220
To be the Master of Disguise.

764
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,220
I like Master of Disguise so much more.

765
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,220
You're not wrong to group them together,

766
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,300
but in terms of film quality,

767
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,900
if I had to watch one of them.

768
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,340
Yeah, I watched Love Guru not too long ago.

769
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,180
And I was pretty upset.

770
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,940
We watched it two weeks ago.

771
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,380
The child faced, when his head is on a little boy.

772
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,580
Child face is bad.

773
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,900
I very rarely find myself calling comedy films,

774
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,220
stand-up can be very mean,

775
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,340
but I'm like, oh, that comedy film wasn't mean.

776
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,420
But that is a mean movie.

777
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,260
It is just.

778
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,220
Oh yeah, he's like mean to Verne Troyer.

779
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,660
It's like so much shit.

780
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,500
Verne Troyer.

781
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,020
It's like not even a little mean.

782
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,620
It is, as mini-me, he's like,

783
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,420
Dr. Evil loves mini-bees.

784
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,580
He gets kicked and stuff,

785
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,140
and maybe called some weird things.

786
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,260
But yeah, this one, it's all like.

787
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,780
This little shit.

788
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,860
Yeah, it's really weird.

789
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,100
Like, why is he so mean to him?

790
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,940
Yeah.

791
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,140
It's like, yeah, I'm sure some of that stuff

792
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,100
doesn't hold up in Austin Powers,

793
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,900
but man, does it not hold up in the Love Guru.

794
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,100
Master of Disguise, a joy.

795
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,220
Just a, it's a breezy 70 minutes.

796
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,700
It'll be done.

797
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,660
Lickety split.

798
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,620
Can't they be out of,

799
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,780
I can't they run out of like ideas with stuff

800
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,540
that's popular and that was popular

801
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,620
and start like remake it,

802
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,820
like just a Master of Disguise 10 episode HBO Max show.

803
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,300
Yes, please.

804
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,140
Like, why not?

805
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,380
Dear God, I think everyone would enjoy that.

806
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,220
I think so.

807
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,140
So we're all losing our minds so much.

808
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,940
I think we need up Master of Disguise, the anthology.

809
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,820
As I said, let's roll in the slop.

810
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,660
Let's do it.

811
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,140
True Detective season four just is Master of Disguise.

812
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,180
Just hand out, combine the franchises.

813
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,420
Reveal it at the start of the episode.

814
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,100
Like a teaser graphic that it's like,

815
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,620
True Detective's coming back,

816
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,740
and it's just one where it just says disguise,

817
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,860
and everyone's like, what is it?

818
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,500
What could that be?

819
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,340
What is it?

820
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,180
It's a me.

821
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,820
Yeah.

822
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,660
Yes.

823
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,100
And then Mordecai shows up.

824
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,940
I'm here too.

825
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,780
I'm here too.

826
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,940
I'm here too.

827
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,180
I mean, thank you.

828
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,700
Is he kind of doing an Edwin, like a little Edwin?

829
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,140
Is that sort of what it is?

830
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,260
That's too fun for it.

831
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,980
It's like just kind of like odd British is what it is.

832
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,700
The thing that all of his stuff is.

833
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,460
I'm just like,

834
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,300
Yes.

835
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,140
Depth-phobe British.

836
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,060
Regardless of whatever's happening

837
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,180
with Amber and whatever.

838
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,700
I don't, let's take all that,

839
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,900
let's put that in another box.

840
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,860
I just, no more depth anyway.

841
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,540
We've got separate issue.

842
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,900
The movies have been eating shit for so long.

843
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,740
Just no more depth, please.

844
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,140
I think we saw what depth can do.

845
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,380
You're just here like begging,

846
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,980
like go back to Hunter S. Thompson.

847
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,820
Like go back to the Hunter Thompson riffs.

848
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,660
That was good.

849
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,060
Yeah, he was good at that.

850
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,900
Edwin was good.

851
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,940
Like I liked him.

852
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,180
Scott's declaring war on a certain Twitter account.

853
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,060
That's all I hear when he says that.

854
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,500
It truly, we made fun of them for only talking

855
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,780
about Johnny Depp and Gina Carano.

856
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,540
And it's only gotten worse.

857
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,300
They just got, no, they just tweeted Gina Carano

858
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,580
snubbed for.

859
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,420
Stuff for Amy.

860
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,420
She was on one episode of the fucking season.

861
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,260
What is?

862
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,860
Whoever believed that there was a possibility

863
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,220
of Gina Carano pre-cancellation,

864
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,060
getting an Emmy nomination.

865
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,540
You know, that being said,

866
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,940
Don Cheadle did get a nominated for like one scene

867
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,420
on the open in the first episode of

868
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,900
For 78 seconds of screen time.

869
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,860
And he was like, yeah, I don't get it either.

870
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,380
So maybe Gina could have gotten it.

871
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,420
That's kind of a fun one.

872
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,380
I'm rooting for him.

873
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,380
Of course he's great.

874
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,220
Yeah.

875
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,540
He deserves an Emmy, but I think he is surprised.

876
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,620
Like I was in that for a second.

877
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,420
What?

878
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,260
One day.

879
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,500
I found more of this, more set lists.

880
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,340
All right.

881
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,740
Although we didn't finish the explanation.

882
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,660
Explain the band.

883
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,500
What are you looking at?

884
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,020
So yeah, you're looking at like, as I said,

885
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,740
like brighter colored,

886
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,820
brighter colored versions of the Tim Burton now.

887
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,820
And then you're looking at like the

888
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,180
Alice in Wonderland and Alice in the Mad Hatter

889
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,060
are two young people, I assume from the area

890
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,460
that are just singing.

891
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,700
They're not playing guitar or anything.

892
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
They're just like the two dual singers.

893
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,860
And then the band is like,

894
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,380
has outfits that suggest other Alice in Wonderland

895
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,220
characters.

896
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,700
Like the drummer as the Cheshire Cat.

897
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,780
Drummer Cheshire Cat.

898
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,300
The keyboardist is the Caterpillar.

899
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,140
I think that's right.

900
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,100
War Mouse.

901
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,940
Okay.

902
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,420
And then one of them, or is the bassist the March Hare?

903
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,260
I don't know.

904
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,100
The guitarist is one and the other.

905
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,420
They sort of just look like they're in like wigs.

906
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,260
It's not, yeah.

907
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,100
It's not.

908
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,420
It's, it's, they look.

909
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,260
Like a marching band.

910
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,060
The outfits actually look a lot like the descendants.

911
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,820
Like that Disney, those Disney movies, The Descendants.

912
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,660
Oh, that's true.

913
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,620
Yeah, very popular.

914
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,540
Very popular.

915
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,020
The song Chillin' Like a Villain, I like,

916
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,620
from the second Descendants movie.

917
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,140
But they did not play that at the manatee part.

918
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,980
I don't know, maybe it wasn't even out yet.

919
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,700
They play a handful of rockin' covers of Disney songs.

920
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,540
There's a few.

921
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,620
They do on birthday.

922
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,780
They do rock and roll on birthday.

923
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
Which is interesting,

924
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,420
because then it kind of brings it back more towards Disney.

925
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,340
You know?

926
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,980
It's not, then it's sort of, it's a different vibe going on.

927
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,980
They're not off in the wiles of Bon Jovi and Time Warp anymore.

928
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,940
The crazy niche.

929
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,180
They do, okay, yeah, they go, they,

930
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,780
I'm looking at one of these set lists here.

931
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,500
On birthday, and then they go right into

932
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,380
Rock and Roll All Night by Kiss.

933
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,220
Whoa.

934
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,060
Which is pretty fun.

935
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,780
Let's be honest.

936
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,620
Pretty fun.

937
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:50,500
Explain, with one more sentence, explain why that is fun.

938
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,700
The song Rock and Roll All Night is fun.

939
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,540
So when they play it, it's fun.

940
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,980
And on birthday is fun, okay.

941
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,820
Uh-huh.

942
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,660
Okay.

943
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,500
I mean, I guess you're right,

944
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,060
the juxtaposition isn't anything special.

945
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,820
I guess you're right about that.

946
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,780
But the playing of that song is fun.

947
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,020
Okay.

948
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,820
Let's see, they move like Jagger, which is modern.

949
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,660
Recibly modern.

950
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,260
In the broad, in this era, and that was the classical era,

951
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,980
that was the Renaissance era, yeah, it's technically.

952
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,180
Here's what I think you found,

953
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,580
and here's why I think you're so upset,

954
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,820
is that they play If You're Wondering,

955
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,900
If I Want You To, I Want You To by Weezer.

956
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,100
I didn't know that.

957
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,940
Okay.

958
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,620
No, no, this is all, well, we're not,

959
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,060
we're just digging the hole deeper, the rabbit hole deeper.

960
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,460
They did a medley of Hit Me Baby one more time

961
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,340
into an N Sink song, what was it?

962
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

963
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,220
Gonna be me, I think.

964
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
I think so.

965
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,500
I like that, I watched that clip.

966
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
I thought that was fun.

967
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,620
And the crowd, for most of these, the crowd loves it.

968
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,740
The crowd is going wild.

969
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,540
Well, that's not a question, Jason.

970
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,620
Yeah, I'm just trying to let the listeners know,

971
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,300
maybe they weren't there.

972
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,180
Yes, if the listeners were not there

973
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,500
and they didn't get to watch Are You Gonna Be My Girl,

974
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,460
My Jet. This is, I'm the most curious about this,

975
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,660
because am I getting just flamed when this comes out?

976
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,420
Are people gonna be furious?

977
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,740
If you see a picture of this,

978
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,860
I think you probably go, what is this shit?

979
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,820
But if you were there, man,

980
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,460
I think you know what I'm talking about.

981
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,540
I think you get it, if you were there.

982
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,020
I think that's the whole thing.

983
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:21,020
If you felt the rumbling bass of Jackson 5 ABC,

984
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,780
with you, when you felt those drums.

985
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,540
Okay, you know what, let's do this.

986
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,300
Let's go watch a little video,

987
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,820
we don't have to even have this sound on,

988
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,620
just to get a little walk through.

989
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,100
I think this is opening night.

990
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,020
And I think we mentioned on the other episode,

991
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,300
they had, it wasn't just the band,

992
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,900
it was big props, big set pieces,

993
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,180
this giant clock that would count down.

994
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,660
I think we would walk by the clock

995
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,100
and I'd say, it's almost time to get mad.

996
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,940
I think I would regularly-

997
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,780
I think you would, Michael.

998
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,060
I think I regularly point that out.

999
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,820
You were right in my case.

1000
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,300
Yeah, so they would also have, as we said,

1001
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,260
two guys doing a cockney accent.

1002
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,980
Well, they're Tweedledum and Tweedledee

1003
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,340
and they're the bouncers.

1004
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,180
Yes, and they act as the bouncers.

1005
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Doing a little bit of business,

1006
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,340
they're doing some funny.

1007
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,180
Yes, I remember interacting with them

1008
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,860
and they're wearing lifts and they have weird costumes

1009
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,260
and they look strange.

1010
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,060
Here's the concept art for them, Scott.

1011
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,660
They're big guys, you can get them on a pin.

1012
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,980
They're in like Avril Lavigne boots.

1013
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,100
They are wearing Avril Lavigne's boots.

1014
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,660
And of course the hatters are the ones

1015
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,900
who walk around the park and encourage you to come

1016
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,500
and tell you the password to get in.

1017
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,980
Of course, cause there is like still,

1018
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,020
yeah, it's a K-Fabe password or whatever you'd call it.

1019
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,820
No, all right, I like this.

1020
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,340
I like that there is a buildup.

1021
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,180
I like that.

1022
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,420
You see there they are right there.

1023
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,020
They're like kind of standing guard

1024
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,700
before the show starts.

1025
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
I like that there's like a little culture here

1026
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,820
and like you're being invited to a secret thing.

1027
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,020
Exactly.

1028
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,860
That's all fun.

1029
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,140
There's a lot of smoke.

1030
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,380
There's a lot of fog.

1031
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,580
Is it Six Flags?

1032
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,340
I mean, it is maybe Six Flags level fog.

1033
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,100
That's a lot of fog if you're watching this video.

1034
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,500
So I'm just trying to get you there.

1035
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,340
I'm just trying to get you there.

1036
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,860
You're going through in the background.

1037
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,300
Yeah, I mean, they could have covered, you know,

1038
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,420
Monsters Inc, whatever up, but then, you know,

1039
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,300
they get up, they do some fun and you know,

1040
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,340
you walk through and then you get to the, you know,

1041
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,180
the musical performance here.

1042
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
And then let's go from here to-

1043
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,140
Is this where they play like another one bites the dust?

1044
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,260
I forget what it is.

1045
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,660
I did see this video.

1046
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,060
I think it might be another one bites the dust.

1047
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,660
I can volume up.

1048
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,500
Let's see.

1049
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,260
I forget which one the first performance is.

1050
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,340
We are the champions.

1051
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,180
No, it's any way-

1052
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,260
Any way you want it by Journey.

1053
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,100
Okay.

1054
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,220
But I will say is I completely agree with you that I,

1055
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,780
if I'm critiquing this as like a guy playing a set on it

1056
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,540
as a DJ, I go, well, this person has very normie

1057
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,460
taste in music.

1058
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,580
And I might turn up my nose at the playlist a little bit,

1059
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,020
even though I like a majority of these songs.

1060
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,220
I would say, okay, but in the context of Disneyland

1061
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,540
and the context of these dumb costumes

1062
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,020
and this bizarre stage setup, I enjoy watching this.

1063
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,500
And especially if it's live music,

1064
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
you can play any normie song you want

1065
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,860
and I'm going to enjoy it.

1066
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,660
So I just want to add that bit of context as well.

1067
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,620
Cause I am half music snob, half normie idiot

1068
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,820
when it comes to music.

1069
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,940
And the live component.

1070
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,780
You're just-

1071
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,620
And the live component.

1072
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,740
And especially when you add fucking these guys

1073
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,860
in these leather.

1074
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,140
You know, I realized also as soon as I saw a video of this,

1075
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,300
I'm like, of course Mike loves this.

1076
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,860
This is the lead singer is so much the vibe

1077
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,660
of 2010s Aerosmith.

1078
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,100
This is like, this is latter day,

1079
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,020
not even 70s, 80s Aerosmith, but recent Aerosmith.

1080
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,060
These are like, it's like aesthetically so married.

1081
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,460
I direct messaged the Park MGM and I said,

1082
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,620
is there any update on Aerosmith returning

1083
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,420
for the Deuces Are Wild Las Vegas residency for Aerosmith?

1084
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,700
They said, Mike, there's no plans right now

1085
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,540
for Aerosmith to return.

1086
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,700
No, Bruno Mars is coming.

1087
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,540
A few days. Yes he is.

1088
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,380
Yes he is.

1089
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,100
But yeah.

1090
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,740
Half of Steven Tyler's face fell off.

1091
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,940
Was it COVID or something?

1092
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,700
No, it just, we knew it was buckling and the day came and-

1093
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,860
He grinned too hard.

1094
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,780
His grin was as big as a Cheshire cat.

1095
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,700
He thought about making love in an elevator too hard.

1096
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,460
Now, Mike, that clip you played us,

1097
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,660
I think one of the shortcomings of this whole area is

1098
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,380
it looks remarkably better at night.

1099
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,220
When it's dark.

1100
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,060
When it's dark.

1101
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,580
I will say you get the, the Monsters Inc.

1102
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,860
almost blends in.

1103
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,900
Well, cause they like paint it like

1104
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,420
blacklight paint on some of the door frames.

1105
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,620
So like it kind of blends into the background

1106
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,460
when it's dark out and it's lit.

1107
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,300
Jason, great point.

1108
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,140
The show was a little better at night.

1109
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,860
So that was for sure true.

1110
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,860
Especially like when they would just like not have the like

1111
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,220
clock turned on.

1112
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,060
It was just looked like-

1113
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,380
Sometimes the clock would not be turned on.

1114
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,300
Yeah, a set.

1115
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,140
Just a set.

1116
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,460
During the day and nothing's happening.

1117
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,540
The whole area looks a little trashy and you might,

1118
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,700
and the whole area is trashy in general.

1119
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,820
None of us like this area.

1120
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,500
So maybe you walk by it and don't explore further.

1121
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,740
So you see that they had like all these different

1122
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,980
pieces of furniture set out.

1123
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,740
These big gaudy pieces of like pink plastic furniture,

1124
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,100
which I think are cool and were fun to sit in.

1125
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,660
It's again, I'm burping cause of this drink,

1126
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,740
not because I'm emotional looking at a pink plastic chair.

1127
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,220
That's too much.

1128
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,020
I swear I'm not going to cry tonight.

1129
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,020
I swear I'm not going to do it.

1130
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,860
So you, yeah, they had all this stuff.

1131
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,140
I mean, for like looking at the different,

1132
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,380
like any type of band offering that Disney has,

1133
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,700
this is so much above and beyond what they would normally do.

1134
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,140
I feel like they'll know Mr. Chaypeck will never give us

1135
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,700
the level of theming for a cover band performance

1136
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,180
of all of our favorite hits of the last 30 years.

1137
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,700
And you know what?

1138
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,540
And you know what?

1139
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,380
The level of Chaypeck hatred.

1140
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,260
See that nighttime, but that looks fun.

1141
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,100
That looks fantastic.

1142
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,940
That looks pretty good.

1143
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,780
It does.

1144
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,780
Look, I like light up Disney things.

1145
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Yeah, I do.

1146
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,860
This is not my complaint.

1147
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,340
This is cool.

1148
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,100
So there's Tootledee and Tootledum.

1149
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,420
There was so many light, like there's this area

1150
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,820
that they're standing in front of here

1151
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,020
was just like a light show dance area.

1152
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,620
And that's where I'm saying there would be like

1153
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,460
dance circles with like,

1154
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,700
children would be going in and doing stuff.

1155
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,860
Teenagers would be going in.

1156
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,940
Well, this entrance is the rabbit hole.

1157
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,620
You're going down the rabbit hole.

1158
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,460
Thank you, thank you.

1159
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,740
This was the rabbit hole.

1160
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,420
There was so much more thought put into this

1161
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,300
than almost every, there's no like,

1162
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,100
tomorrow in band stages is fine.

1163
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,740
You hear all the same songs,

1164
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,460
but the amount of theming to theme,

1165
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,540
let me look at the list for it to pull up a song

1166
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,100
we haven't heard before.

1167
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,940
This is Halloween?

1168
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,780
To hear, to hear.

1169
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,900
Okay, that was too specific.

1170
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,380
Karma chameleon.

1171
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,420
To hear.

1172
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,260
To hear.

1173
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,660
Bring me to life from the Deer Devil soundtrack.

1174
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,220
Rolling in the Deep by Adele.

1175
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,060
You know, the amount of theming.

1176
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,500
The lyric censored covers of Nirvana.

1177
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,340
To hear.

1178
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,980
Think again, we've talked about this,

1179
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,700
this whole show is about theming, you know?

1180
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,180
Cause if you take away all the theming

1181
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,020
of your favorite ride,

1182
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,220
what is it, a little boat?

1183
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,060
That's boring.

1184
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,900
Yeah.

1185
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,740
So yes, if you take away all the theming

1186
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,820
of the Mad Tea Party,

1187
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,180
it's just moves like Jagger.

1188
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,780
Which I agree is not so spectacular.

1189
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,500
But down the rabbit hole,

1190
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,980
with your two English friends here,

1191
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,780
with the neon, with the drink me menu

1192
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,180
that we haven't even gotten to yet.

1193
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,060
Yeah, doing bits, gently teasing you.

1194
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,740
Yes, gently.

1195
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,580
That's what I'm saying.

1196
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,820
It's all the fun.

1197
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,860
They're calling out.

1198
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,020
They have, look at this.

1199
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,420
On the back of their head,

1200
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,580
they had tattoos.

1201
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,500
They had D and dumb.

1202
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,220
That said D and dumb.

1203
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,500
Again, this is above and beyond.

1204
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,820
This is Eiger, this is Eiger, I think,

1205
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,260
at the top of the money spending time

1206
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,460
in Disney California Adventure.

1207
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,300
Because they needed to bring people back.

1208
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,540
You think that Eiger put a lot of time

1209
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,460
into the D and dumb tattoos,

1210
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,780
and that Chapek spends most of his time

1211
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,860
ensuring that this disrespectful crap

1212
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,780
never happens on my watch.

1213
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,980
Well, I'm hoping to be proven wrong.

1214
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,500
I'm just worried that that is the case.

1215
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,660
Those Tweedle D and Tweedle dumb,

1216
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,060
making a mockery of fully bald folks.

1217
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,820
I won't have it.

1218
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,860
I am not a fool.

1219
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,180
I am not dumb.

1220
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,020
Yes.

1221
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,020
I think maybe, yeah,

1222
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,500
I think there will be no more head tattoos.

1223
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,060
And there's no reason they couldn't put this all back up

1224
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,260
in like a long weekend.

1225
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,100
This could all be back.

1226
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,260
Jason, I've been saying that every time

1227
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,860
we go to Disneyland since this thing got taken away.

1228
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,060
This area really hasn't changed.

1229
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,540
Like nothing besides like the one sound stage

1230
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,660
is Marvel shopamania right now.

1231
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,540
This whole thing, sorry, Kennedy.

1232
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,900
Oh, I was just gonna say.

1233
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,180
They could have this up and running.

1234
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,780
Actually, the shortcoming of it would be

1235
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,100
there's no annual pass holders at the moment

1236
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,900
to be regular.

1237
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,740
That woman cutting her hair would go probably

1238
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,180
because she was an annual pass holder.

1239
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,380
She would, for sure.

1240
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,300
She'd get her little hat out and get her pass

1241
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,140
and then go do it.

1242
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,980
But yeah, then until.

1243
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,540
That little hat's just like tumbling

1244
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,020
through a dusty alley right now.

1245
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,700
She like, she just like tossed it with a tear in her eye

1246
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,180
knowing this would never return.

1247
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,300
Yeah, it's sad.

1248
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,300
I do get also a Vegas vibe from a lot of this stuff too,

1249
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,020
which is what I really enjoy as well.

1250
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,700
It's very Vegas-y.

1251
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,100
This drink me bar sign is not so aesthetically pleasing,

1252
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,260
especially in the daytime.

1253
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,420
But this feels like, you know, Chris Angel,

1254
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,300
a Chris Angel like drink area or drink bar,

1255
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,140
whatever you'd call it.

1256
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,380
And then they had, look at this.

1257
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,700
This is on the ceiling.

1258
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,540
Look at that.

1259
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,540
That's not where it's a table.

1260
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,740
It's a cocktail table.

1261
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,580
It has a bar.

1262
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,780
The drinks are upside down.

1263
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,620
That's right.

1264
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,540
It's upside down, you know.

1265
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,020
Look at that, look.

1266
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,860
Look at it.

1267
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,700
The audience, look.

1268
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,540
Like it, like it.

1269
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,780
Big key.

1270
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,620
And then, yes.

1271
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:51,460
So Jason, do you have the menu closer to you?

1272
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,300
I don't.

1273
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,140
Here, I can find it though.

1274
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:53,980
Okay, yeah.

1275
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,980
So this is- Well, from here,

1276
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,260
I can see Coca-Cola, Sprite, Dasani,

1277
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,300
several types of Fuse.

1278
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,580
Did they still carry Fuse everywhere in Disney?

1279
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,580
I think they switched to Gold Peak.

1280
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,340
Okay, because Fuse was their like tea of choice

1281
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,380
for many years, but I don't think I've ever ordered a Fuse.

1282
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,380
Have you ever had a Fuse?

1283
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,940
I have, it's not great.

1284
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,820
Yeah.

1285
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,460
That was always, I think Fuse is just as a word put me off,

1286
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,020
but maybe that's just because I never had it.

1287
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,860
Yeah.

1288
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,300
I think it was Coca-Cola's offering at the time,

1289
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,980
and then they switched to, yeah, Gold Peak.

1290
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:33,100
I can't read it so good, but I do see Mad Hat Edo,

1291
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,620
and I see what you're saying, Jason.

1292
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:39,220
Without the J, the pun is more difficult.

1293
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,420
Yes, it's the Mad Hat Edo,

1294
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,500
the Mad Long Island Ice Tea Party.

1295
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,380
Pretty good.

1296
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,460
I think I read one of each over the few years.

1297
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,300
You did every one of them.

1298
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,340
Not in one night.

1299
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,180
Wow.

1300
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,340
But I went to this so much.

1301
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,820
Although what's funny is, and we'll get to,

1302
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,340
I guess we'll get to it at the end,

1303
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,900
there's something they would do at the end of the show

1304
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,060
that I didn't even know, because who I was with,

1305
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,380
usually after 30 minutes would be like,

1306
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,500
okay, we can go do something else, right?

1307
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,900
No. Even if they weren't mad at me.

1308
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,220
No, we can't.

1309
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,180
Yeah, well, that's sort of what I would say, but.

1310
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,740
I was so curious, what was Lindsay's?

1311
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,340
What did Lindsay think of this?

1312
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,020
I think she was, I mean, she's not a big concert person

1313
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,860
in general.

1314
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,340
Oh, you're blaming it on concerts, not this.

1315
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,820
She's upstairs, I don't want to bother her.

1316
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,460
It's like she wouldn't, I don't know,

1317
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,740
she's not that into a time warp

1318
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,420
followed by Boys of Summer.

1319
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,380
Love is never having to say you're sorry, so.

1320
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,420
Croquetini.

1321
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,980
Love story, love story.

1322
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,500
Love story, that's right.

1323
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,980
Ride or deal. Ride or deal.

1324
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,020
Yeah, so she, no, she wasn't a huge fan

1325
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,660
of the Mad Tea Party or anything,

1326
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,660
but she would go watch some songs with me.

1327
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,300
She would go indulge me.

1328
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,540
That's very nice of her.

1329
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,500
Very nice of her, yes.

1330
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,780
But they also, look, she likes old timey crap.

1331
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,900
She likes, she likes, you know,

1332
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,500
I describe her music taste as like an old lady

1333
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,100
singing in a little box.

1334
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,220
Like that's her favorite, like.

1335
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,060
Ba-da-ba-da-da-da-da.

1336
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,820
Like that, she likes that stuff, so.

1337
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,140
So she likes.

1338
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:06,980
She likes modern songs.

1339
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,500
Does she then like Suitcase in a Dream?

1340
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,420
She, does she like.

1341
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,420
They do sing California Heroic.

1342
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,020
There's like a kind of a modern beat

1343
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,220
in Suitcase in a Dream, but it is an old timey song.

1344
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,100
I forget if she likes Suitcase in a Dream or not.

1345
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,700
We'll have to ask her.

1346
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,260
Busy time for live entertainment right at this front

1347
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,860
of the park between Suitcase in a Dream

1348
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,700
and the Mad Tea Party.

1349
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,460
They're hiring a lot of singers, dancers,

1350
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,700
hottest deck in town, the dance crew.

1351
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,540
That's right.

1352
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,780
The suited dance crew.

1353
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,580
I don't know what any of this is.

1354
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,140
Oh, they're dancers dressed like, you know,

1355
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,740
kind of playing card inspired garb.

1356
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,660
And they would dance.

1357
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,500
That's in this.

1358
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,620
Yes, there's more fun.

1359
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,020
There's a whole other stage.

1360
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,780
A whole other stage with dancing, with fun.

1361
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,660
Yeah, it would be like over on the other side, basically.

1362
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,500
Yeah.

1363
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,980
Like across the area, what do you call it?

1364
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,700
I guess it would be closer to like the arcade.

1365
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,540
Yes, and it kind of,

1366
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,420
it's supposed to look like a house of cards.

1367
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,420
Really, it looks like, you know, girders and like metal.

1368
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,300
Do we have a picture of that?

1369
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,500
Lighting rigs.

1370
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,340
Probably.

1371
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,860
Yeah, there's a big drink me.

1372
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,700
I have.

1373
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,420
Cotton candy lemonade.

1374
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,700
Oh yeah, I didn't realize some of these are just here.

1375
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,740
I have a couple of those Disney cube light up cubes,

1376
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,740
but that's from many different ridiculous drinks.

1377
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,580
Yeah, I find cubes.

1378
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,100
Pro-K, teeny.

1379
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,300
Oh, the fuse truck.

1380
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,100
There was a truck, fuse, ice tea truck.

1381
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:32,940
That might not have been,

1382
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,580
oh, I guess it was because it's got heart on it.

1383
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,220
That's so gross.

1384
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,140
Fuse truck.

1385
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,100
You know what fuse is probably doesn't go as far as brisk.

1386
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,340
There's the cup, there's the hat.

1387
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,620
What was in there?

1388
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,460
I don't think it was.

1389
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,660
Is that what you had to drink to have this?

1390
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,540
I guess it was.

1391
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,740
I guess I had actually had to have drink fused

1392
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,580
to get this.

1393
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,700
Go down, what's the caption?

1394
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,740
What are we, Cheshire Chiller.

1395
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,420
Desert pear.

1396
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,220
Oh, I just wanted the cup, you know.

1397
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:02,140
No, you would hate to choke down a bright pink icy,

1398
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,100
maybe, am I getting this right?

1399
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,780
Non-alcoholic.

1400
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,860
I think it was non-alcoholic, yeah,

1401
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,940
because it probably was in a fun like child's cup.

1402
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,980
Jabberwocky juice.

1403
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,780
Hatter's Mandarin Fury.

1404
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,620
It's a Mandarin,

1405
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,100
you don't know it has Mandarin origin

1406
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,100
and that is truly inexplicable.

1407
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,180
Yeah, that would be very confusing.

1408
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,500
This is some of the costuming for the people working.

1409
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,940
This whole thing is great if you love Russell Brand.

1410
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,780
You're a big brand head.

1411
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,620
Oh, I didn't mention that I was.

1412
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,900
But you don't wanna hear him talk about atheism.

1413
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,140
If you're like, I want my brand without my atheism.

1414
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:44,260
Just want him to feel the flow, man, you know what I'm saying?

1415
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,060
I just, I feel like we need to hear more from him lately.

1416
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,460
That's all I think.

1417
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,100
Cause he had a really hot couple of years

1418
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,420
and now he's like just doing a podcast.

1419
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,780
I met him once.

1420
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,620
When was that?

1421
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,180
I was interning at UCB

1422
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,980
and he was testing out his monologue for the movie awards.

1423
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,940
I thought you had to drive him,

1424
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,900
you had to get him to the Greek.

1425
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,740
I didn't have to get,

1426
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,660
oh, I wish I had to get him to the Greek.

1427
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,900
It was this weird, this unforgettable night where.

1428
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,780
And a person, a woman came in,

1429
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,500
she's like, can I sneak in and watch a little?

1430
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,660
And the manager was like, yeah, sure, go ahead.

1431
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,780
And she was like, do you know who that was?

1432
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,180
Cause I didn't really react.

1433
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,020
I was like, no.

1434
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,980
And she was like, that was Katy Perry.

1435
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,500
But she had just changed her haircut.

1436
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,300
So I did not recognize her.

1437
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,140
No, I didn't know it.

1438
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,300
She had like Uma Thurman kind of Pulp Fiction-y kind of hair.

1439
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,220
Very tall, both of them hugely tall.

1440
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,980
Russell Brand and Katy Perry, yeah.

1441
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,860
She might've been the shoes.

1442
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,700
Let's look up the height.

1443
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,340
She's wearing those T-D, Trill D, Trill Dumb shoes.

1444
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,780
I mean, they both might've been wearing little heel.

1445
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,860
I'm looking up Katy Perry height.

1446
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,700
I mean, everyone looks tall.

1447
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,260
I bet she's five, eight.

1448
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,580
Yeah, I don't think, yeah, she seems short.

1449
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,820
Audience.

1450
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,100
Katy Perry is five, seven.

1451
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,420
She had heels on her platforms or something.

1452
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,260
Must've been the heels.

1453
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,100
Because he's pretty tall.

1454
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,060
Yes, okay, so here's in the arcade.

1455
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,260
And this is like the black light, which this is fun.

1456
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,780
This is legit fun.

1457
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,740
I would like to have round one over in Burbank

1458
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,460
with all the games had this like color scheme.

1459
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,700
I think that would be pretty fun.

1460
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,900
Instead of just like fluorescent lights.

1461
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,620
Yeah, a little heavy on the fluorescence

1462
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,460
at the round one.

1463
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,700
There's a lot of fluorescence at that round one, I agree.

1464
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,820
Look at this character,

1465
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,140
the walk around nightmare character.

1466
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,780
Now let's talk about him since he came up.

1467
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,900
This is a show, this is a character called Who Are You?

1468
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,420
And he is like a giant walking around slinky thing.

1469
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,460
I did not know about Who Are You?

1470
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,420
But when I started researching,

1471
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,860
he was the first thing I saw.

1472
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,340
And I was like, I gotta say,

1473
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,980
Who Are You dances to that song, Wear Your Head At?

1474
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,900
Because he don't have a head.

1475
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,500
And he is weird.

1476
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,580
Like if you see video.

1477
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,420
He's a big rainbow, he's like a slinky mixed

1478
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,860
with like a rolly polly.

1479
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,860
Yeah, if he wasn't a fun multicolored scheme like that,

1480
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,380
I think I would hate him.

1481
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,580
But because of the colors,

1482
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,460
I think I still have to say I like him.

1483
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,300
But it is nightmarish.

1484
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,700
Technically impressive.

1485
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,540
Yeah, it's nightmarish.

1486
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,300
It is a nightmarish kind of design

1487
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,100
for like an anthropomorphic being.

1488
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:18,300
Everyone is a very highly skilled professional.

1489
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,060
The musicians and the dancers and Who Are You?

1490
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,580
But I don't know about Who Are You?

1491
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,100
I think I would be scared if I saw him in person.

1492
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,660
We'll link you to this Disney food blog.

1493
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,100
It did such a great job of hitting all the highlights.

1494
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,940
Right here.

1495
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,940
And there's plenty of footage on YouTube.

1496
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:39,580
They're really the Hunter S. Thompson of the Mad Tea Party.

1497
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:43,060
Fear and loathing at the Mad Tea Party.

1498
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,100
That's right.

1499
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,660
I was about 50 feet from Who Are You?

1500
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:52,660
When the clod, when the Cheshire chaser kicked in.

1501
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,940
You stood on the House of Cards stage.

1502
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,820
You could gaze out into the distance

1503
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,340
and see where the wave had crested

1504
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,620
and the water rolled back.

1505
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,700
Yeah, so this is the stage

1506
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,020
which Jason was talking about earlier.

1507
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,260
Yeah, where you would get playing card dancers

1508
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,500
who were really impressive as my recollection.

1509
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,780
Yeah, and Tweedledee and Tweedledum would introduce them

1510
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,580
and do some bits, you know.

1511
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,900
It was a lot.

1512
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,740
There was a lot there.

1513
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,540
And then there's a man himself.

1514
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,460
DJ White Rabbit.

1515
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,460
DJ White Rabbit.

1516
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,380
And there were many DJ White Rabbits.

1517
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,580
So he's got a backwards hat and with glowing,

1518
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:33,340
backwards white hat with glowing white rabbit ears.

1519
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,940
There were five prominent DJs.

1520
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,140
I guess I have to list them now.

1521
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,380
DJ Adam Auburn, Vindt3R.

1522
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,740
Move on, didn't get it fast enough, next name.

1523
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,940
They did get to say their names.

1524
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,700
They got to say DJ. DJ Michael Paul,

1525
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:51,700
DJ Jason Jass, DJ Missy B, DJ David Bullock.

1526
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,900
And then, this is somebody we haven't talked about

1527
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,740
on the show before,

1528
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,100
but we are very familiar with her.

1529
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,500
DJ Wendy Walker.

1530
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,500
Does that name mean anything to you too?

1531
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,580
There is a woman named Wendy Walker

1532
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,940
who DJs everywhere in Disneyland.

1533
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,020
And Lindsay and I have just run into her.

1534
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,780
We don't know her, but we've run into her

1535
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,100
DJing at the 80s night.

1536
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:15,940
She's DJed at the Fantasy Fair area where people dance.

1537
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,020
She DJed as the White Rabbit.

1538
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,700
She plays maybe keyboard or DJs at the Tomorrowland stage.

1539
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,900
We've run into her everywhere.

1540
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,940
And she's like one of the most prominent

1541
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,580
Disneyland DJs there is.

1542
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,660
And her name is DJ Wendy Walker.

1543
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,020
And she's everywhere.

1544
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,660
And she also would do the White Rabbit here.

1545
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:36,820
So I bet she's probably got the most Disney DJ experience,

1546
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,940
at least at this point.

1547
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,300
The White Rabbit, that seemed like a,

1548
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,980
I'm not going to say an easy gig,

1549
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,340
but it seems like a pleasant gig.

1550
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,260
Like they would do in between the bands.

1551
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,140
They didn't have to do a lot of movement.

1552
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,420
You could just kind of DJ.

1553
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,260
I don't know.

1554
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,460
Do you think being a DJ seems like it's easy?

1555
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,780
No, no, not at all.

1556
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,540
I don't think, I'm sure it's a craft that takes a lot of,

1557
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,500
you know, learning and work like anything.

1558
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,740
I was really hoping you said, yeah.

1559
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:05,620
Oh, I don't want any beef with the DJ community.

1560
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,260
Yeah, you fucking hit a button.

1561
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,100
What do you mean?

1562
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,580
Start throwing records at you like ninja stars.

1563
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,420
Yeah.

1564
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,700
I just mean in terms of like labor

1565
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,260
for like people doing these shows.

1566
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,780
Like even the like main band,

1567
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,420
like the singers had like some light choreography.

1568
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,260
Oh yeah.

1569
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,540
Well, they're still like singing,

1570
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,260
like singing three shows a night.

1571
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,820
Oh, that yeah, that'll wreck your vocal.

1572
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,660
Yeah.

1573
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,500
But as far as like,

1574
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,340
very draining.

1575
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,740
For the one button that a DJ has to push every five minutes.

1576
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,620
Sounds like you have the few DJs.

1577
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,980
Sack of shit, DJs.

1578
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,620
You were hoping Jason was on your own board with you.

1579
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,100
You've been waiting to make this rant.

1580
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,180
Oh, I'm so mad at DJs.

1581
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,380
All of them, but Wendy.

1582
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,220
All of them, Wendy.

1583
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,460
Wendy's great.

1584
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,380
Yeah, I don't want to make Wendy mad.

1585
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,020
So yeah, so that's DJ White Rabbit.

1586
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,020
And it was just like, there was so much going on

1587
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,100
and the show was so long.

1588
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,260
You wouldn't like,

1589
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,540
you would catch different parts of the show.

1590
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,860
I mean, again, cause nobody would let me

1591
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,420
just stay there the whole time.

1592
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,260
Then this guy.

1593
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,500
Did you ever do it by yourself?

1594
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,220
Yeah, maybe.

1595
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,060
I may have walked over there and somebody was like.

1596
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,780
In your ideal, are you like one of these days,

1597
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,460
I have to go do this for five hours.

1598
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,140
I don't know how long it ran for.

1599
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,980
That's a good point.

1600
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,660
I don't think I ever had that thought.

1601
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,180
I don't think I was thinking.

1602
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,860
I guess I was thinking it would never go away.

1603
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:29,300
If I, I think it kind of went away quickly all of a sudden.

1604
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,940
And I think if I knew we should have gone down

1605
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,380
for the last one and I would have done the whole thing.

1606
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,180
Well, the second engagement was like a year, right?

1607
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,140
Right, yeah, yeah.

1608
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,780
So no, I didn't have that thought.

1609
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,180
But as you say that, I'm regretful that I didn't.

1610
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,220
So were you upset that like, so it just went away

1611
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,060
and it's like Anderson Cooper wasn't even talking about it.

1612
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,060
Like the media didn't even address it.

1613
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,780
They didn't, yeah, there was no ABC special.

1614
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,460
Why is no one talking about this?

1615
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,740
Farewell for it.

1616
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,860
And it was replaced by a much worse thing

1617
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,900
that lasted very.

1618
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,020
I don't even remember.

1619
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,620
I forget, there was some like generic

1620
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,060
sort of like summer festival thing and never,

1621
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,900
it couldn't even, they barely put any work in it.

1622
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,740
It was the Lone Ranger rave.

1623
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,260
People are pretty pissed.

1624
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,100
The Lone Raver.

1625
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,100
DJ Tonto.

1626
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,500
It's me, DJ Taboo.

1627
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,940
It's me, DJ Tonto.

1628
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,940
It's me, Tonto, DJ Tonto.

1629
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,060
Now there's a funny picture of a person here

1630
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:26,220
who was obviously upset about Electronica going away.

1631
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:30,020
I heart Tron, but this will do for now.

1632
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,820
So he was a big Electronica fan,

1633
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,940
which I also like Electronica a lot.

1634
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,900
It was much more sinister.

1635
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,620
But Electronica, yeah, was like a dark, more of an EDM.

1636
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:45,620
Some of those like kind of dark, death punk score songs.

1637
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,660
Well yeah, they played this stuff.

1638
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,900
The dance party, the world that they're going into,

1639
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,460
when they get to the rave, the Tron rave in Tron Legacy,

1640
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,620
it is a very, it's a grim scene.

1641
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,260
That's not really a fun party.

1642
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,100
Right.

1643
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,860
Not like the one at, yeah, it should have been fun.

1644
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,220
Like the Zion rave in The Matrix.

1645
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,060
The Matrix 2, yeah.

1646
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,260
The Matrix 2.

1647
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,100
The horn.

1648
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,940
Who's got those theme parts?

1649
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,300
Nobody's, there's no Matrix going on.

1650
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,140
That's a good question.

1651
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,980
It's Warner, so they're screwing, all right.

1652
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,860
Nothing Warner can ever be anywhere else.

1653
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,020
Warner Brothers, I mean, Warner Brothers did experiment

1654
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:19,180
with kind of like haunts and stuff that won Halloween season.

1655
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,780
Well, they had, no, I was just thinking this.

1656
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,500
I've seen people, there's like a new

1657
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,060
kind of elaborate studio tour.

1658
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,460
Oh, they buffed up the studio tour.

1659
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,740
And like you hear like part of it's like

1660
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,220
Harry Potter or something.

1661
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,060
Yeah, yeah.

1662
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,780
Should we get free tickets and do that?

1663
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,300
I mean, of the high of us, sure.

1664
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,140
I mean, because it's very close.

1665
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,500
We can go drive by the minute.

1666
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,340
That's true.

1667
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,180
It's a good way to do it.

1668
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,060
Yeah, yeah, I've never done that tour.

1669
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,060
Yeah, I've never done it.

1670
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,900
But if they, yeah, they have like more themed stuff,

1671
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,740
I think to walk through, it's not haunts, but.

1672
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,580
Yeah.

1673
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,500
Yeah, okay, we'll do that.

1674
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,900
So yeah, Matrix will never,

1675
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,380
you would think there would have been a generic

1676
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,660
like Six Flags, Coat Maistre, Matrix Coaster.

1677
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,660
That's just green lights and that's it?

1678
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,820
That's, well, like maybe it like hangs you

1679
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,380
and it's like bullet time or something.

1680
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,020
Like it's some, like it doesn't really apply,

1681
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,380
but they use the phrase.

1682
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,300
Dr. Smith, or what is it?

1683
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,460
Mr. Smith? Dr. Smith.

1684
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,820
Dr. Smith, no, wrong.

1685
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,820
That's the, that's the.

1686
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,020
That's why Matrix 4 is coming, you know?

1687
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,660
Oh yeah, yeah, there's always this time.

1688
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,100
Mr. Anderson.

1689
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,620
Okay, is it not even Smith?

1690
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,300
Oh, Mr. Smith, yeah, he's the bad guy.

1691
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,060
Okay, okay, let's say Mr. Smith Spinners.

1692
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,180
Agent Smith. Agent Smith.

1693
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,900
Agent Smith and Mr. Anderson.

1694
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,740
Okay, okay.

1695
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,460
Is it what Dr., what Agent Smith says.

1696
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,300
Yeah.

1697
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,260
He calls him Mr. Anderson.

1698
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,100
And they're all being played by the Merovingian,

1699
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,900
the master manipulator.

1700
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,740
Wait, who?

1701
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,500
The Merovingian?

1702
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,500
That was one of the other weirdos in the sequels.

1703
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,700
Oh, is that three?

1704
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,420
No, he's in, I think that he's the one

1705
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,660
they're trying to get to in the second one.

1706
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,180
I've been stumped again. Stumped again.

1707
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,020
Stumped again.

1708
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,940
You stumped us for the third time.

1709
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,780
Ding, ding, ding.

1710
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,660
He's not the guy with the TVs.

1711
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,660
He's like the guy who's like very rich.

1712
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,780
Look up how tall he is.

1713
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,220
Oh, is he five seven?

1714
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,020
I think Russell Brand might be tall,

1715
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:05,860
but am I taller than him?

1716
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,180
I bet I'm taller than Russell Brand.

1717
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,780
Okay, I'm gonna have to talk about something.

1718
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,700
You're both Googling facts.

1719
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,780
I don't have, I've got nothing.

1720
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,020
I didn't look up what this is.

1721
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,900
There's a guy in a, you're making me cover.

1722
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,420
Six one. There's a guy in a blonde wig.

1723
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,500
I have nothing here.

1724
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,820
Six one. Find your facts and be six one.

1725
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,660
Oh, a blonde wig like the twins

1726
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,980
from the Matrix Reloaded.

1727
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,300
Six one is what he is.

1728
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,980
Dr. Smith one and two, the twins.

1729
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,060
Oh, okay, wait, I found the replacement.

1730
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,140
This guy, the Merovingian.

1731
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,820
Remember him? The Merovingian?

1732
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,620
Oh, he's the guy in the restaurant.

1733
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,420
He's the guy in the restaurant with Dr. Women.

1734
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,860
There are two women with him.

1735
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:43,860
Yeah, I remember that.

1736
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,700
Find the next drink name or something.

1737
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,140
We've talked about the Merovingian.

1738
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,860
Yeah, I didn't remember that was his name.

1739
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,900
That's a good poll, by the way, if that's accurate,

1740
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,340
unless you've just completely butchered the character.

1741
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,780
The replacement was a temporary Freeze the Night,

1742
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,300
a family dance party inspired by Frozen.

1743
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,540
Yeah, anything they threw in related to Frozen

1744
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,620
is all trash and I don't think it's the fault of Frozen.

1745
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:10,860
They didn't anticipate it and then we need as much Frozen

1746
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,500
as humanly possible.

1747
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,580
We don't care what it is.

1748
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,060
The quick Frozen solutions didn't really work,

1749
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,220
which yes, no fault.

1750
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,220
And then of course, yeah, so,

1751
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,580
I mean, that's the gist of the band Tea Party.

1752
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:26,620
They had a Halloween set list,

1753
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,100
where they would do a lot of the same songs,

1754
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,940
but they would do Enter Sandman.

1755
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,780
And this is Halloween from Nightmare Before Christmas.

1756
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,900
And Thriller in one way or another.

1757
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,700
Oh, because it's a case, but getcha.

1758
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,300
I'm gonna getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha, won't, yeah.

1759
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,860
It's kind of about a pursuit.

1760
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,700
It's about a pursuit.

1761
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,340
That is a scary song, if you think about it.

1762
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,340
There's a lot of, people have to do Halloween adjacent.

1763
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:58,340
You have to, what's that word about co-opting retcon?

1764
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,500
You have to retcon, rock well,

1765
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,740
somebody's watching me into Halloween.

1766
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,420
I see things like that happen.

1767
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,660
You have to like, all right, that's kind of,

1768
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,420
yeah, it's scary, it's a paranoia.

1769
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,780
Who could it be now?

1770
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,460
That's Halloween, that's a Halloween song.

1771
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,500
We all agree it's in.

1772
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,500
Because they have a mask on, a killer has a mask on.

1773
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,900
Like Myers has a mask on.

1774
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:16,740
I mean, they know it's in.

1775
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,580
Who can it be now?

1776
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,380
Like, who are you, the slinky guy?

1777
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,180
Who are you by the who?

1778
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,020
Well, who are you?

1779
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,940
Yeah, it's a mystery, that's a scary song.

1780
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,580
It could be Dracula.

1781
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,420
It could be Dracula.

1782
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,060
The Caterpillar says, who are you in Alice in Wonderland.

1783
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:30,900
I think that's why.

1784
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,740
Oh, who are you?

1785
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,580
So he should sing Who Are You by the who.

1786
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,180
Have we talked about the, this is like a,

1787
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:42,060
Kevin Perger in Defunct Land discovered this fact

1788
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,980
long ago, and this was it.

1789
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:47,100
He, I give him credit for making this prominent.

1790
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,620
But I was a real latecomer in,

1791
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,860
there was the show Adventures in Wonderland,

1792
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,700
the Disney Channel show.

1793
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,380
And do you guys know where I'm heading with this,

1794
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,260
the bizarre fact about this show?

1795
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,100
I don't know.

1796
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,540
There was like, there's a number of episodes,

1797
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,340
whatever, 80 episodes or so,

1798
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,220
but only 79 exist and can be seen anywhere

1799
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:09,580
because the one episode that they don't show anywhere

1800
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:12,100
has a guest appearance by OJ Simpson.

1801
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,020
Oh, right.

1802
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,900
And this was filmed and ready to air in 1994.

1803
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,860
Like it was like on the cusp when it happened.

1804
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:25,860
And it's about like the rabbit,

1805
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,060
maybe I'm wrong on the character,

1806
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,020
but it's like the rabbit wants to be an athlete

1807
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:30,940
or play football or something,

1808
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:34,900
and then real OJ Simpson walks into his room

1809
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,620
and hey, it's me, OJ.

1810
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:39,100
And then OJ is in Wonderland then later.

1811
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,700
And they didn't do this ever.

1812
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,020
They didn't have real people in the show.

1813
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,900
So just in this one instance,

1814
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,860
hey, it's me, like the rabbit.

1815
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,900
Oh, if only I could meet someone, a great athlete,

1816
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,700
like OJ Simpson.

1817
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,100
But weirdly, images of it are pretty prevalent

1818
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:57,420
because they made a book of the episode.

1819
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,820
There were only like three or four that they were.

1820
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,940
Let's rush out our little paperbacks

1821
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,500
of Adventures in Wonderland.

1822
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,580
And one of them happened to be this OJ episode.

1823
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,540
And it was already off to presses too late,

1824
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:09,700
can't pull it back.

1825
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,540
That's insane.

1826
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,980
Copies on eBay, I looked immediately,

1827
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,780
copies are like $600.

1828
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,620
Yeah.

1829
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,020
You bid $600.

1830
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,740
Have to have this.

1831
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,540
Well, no, Aaron caught me doing it and said,

1832
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,540
no, no, no, no.

1833
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,100
Kicked the mouse out of your hand.

1834
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,420
The baby doesn't need formula every day.

1835
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:31,420
The baby needs a story to be read every night.

1836
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,580
This is for the baby.

1837
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,900
And so the rabbit wished and wished,

1838
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,780
and who should walk in but OJ.

1839
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,500
Hey, how did you learn to read?

1840
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,700
Like did your parents read to you when you were younger?

1841
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,380
Oh yeah, well, what were some of your favorite books?

1842
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,220
You really-

1843
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:50,740
This Alice in Wonderland book that had, you know,

1844
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:53,180
Alice, OJ Simpson, the March Hare.

1845
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,420
All my favorite Alice characters,

1846
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,580
Tweedledum, OJ, Tweedledee.

1847
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,420
That's like when I sent you a screenshot of,

1848
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,220
I forget what, maybe it was Tooby,

1849
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,020
if Tooby has the Here's Lucy catalog on it.

1850
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,700
I was like, this is a shot of Gale Gordon,

1851
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,340
Lucille Ball and OJ in like 1978.

1852
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,860
Anyway, here's some names of the arcade games

1853
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,300
from the mad arcade.

1854
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,340
While you pull those up,

1855
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,060
let me try and refresh your guys' memory.

1856
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:23,860
The Merovingian is married to Persephone.

1857
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,300
Monica Bellucci's Persephone.

1858
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,140
Yes, okay.

1859
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,260
She was one of the big, you know.

1860
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,100
Yeah, she's in there.

1861
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,580
Just start reading the names.

1862
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,500
Read the names.

1863
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,780
Okay, the mad arcade, okay.

1864
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:37,420
And it had games such as Whack A Hat

1865
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,780
and the Bandersnatch Ball.

1866
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,460
So that's it.

1867
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,940
The arcade kind of makes less sense at this dance party

1868
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:44,780
than like Ventron.

1869
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,660
They didn't want to do too much yet.

1870
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:47,500
They had to keep some of the stuff from Tron.

1871
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:52,500
They yanked all the vintage games for Wreck-It Ralph.

1872
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,340
So.

1873
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,620
Right, that's true.

1874
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,500
So that was a little bit of an afterthought.

1875
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,180
But still, I'm talking like Johnny Depp now.

1876
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,220
The effort was there.

1877
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,500
The effort was everywhere in every aspect of this show.

1878
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,940
And that's what I very much appreciate about it.

1879
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,860
Because yeah, you take this and you put it,

1880
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,820
what was the cover band at Tomorrowland?

1881
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:15,620
Suburban Legend.

1882
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,460
The Crash.

1883
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,460
Suburban Legend.

1884
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,620
If they did this song, I'd say all these songs,

1885
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:24,620
I would be like, yeah, great fun Disney set for the normies.

1886
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,420
But I would not be doing a Patreon episode about it.

1887
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,700
It's because there's the whole approach.

1888
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,980
They really made a little world back there.

1889
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:33,820
Yes.

1890
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,980
They took, you know, it is what raves do

1891
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,780
where they take a rundown derelict warehouse

1892
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,100
that feels not even safe to be in

1893
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,500
and they fill it with life and a party.

1894
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:47,380
And that's what that Hollywood area has felt like

1895
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,740
for many decades now.

1896
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,580
I found this-

1897
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,740
It's true to the rave experience.

1898
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,380
I found this video, somebody cut together

1899
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:57,340
a mad tea party experience it.

1900
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,460
And this gives you really, like you were there,

1901
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,780
this makes you feel kind of the vibe.

1902
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,060
Now, I don't know what this music is.

1903
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,580
I don't know if they played this at the mad tea party,

1904
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,260
but this is how excited people were.

1905
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,740
They were dancing.

1906
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,580
They were being themselves.

1907
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:14,660
They were just being their authentic selves.

1908
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,700
Look at this guy in a tank top dancing.

1909
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,740
They were being fireworks, baby.

1910
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,100
They were, yes.

1911
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:23,500
Make them shoot up as they shot into the sky.

1912
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,500
Right.

1913
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,660
You don't see people dancing like this anymore.

1914
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:29,940
These people don't feel like plastic bags.

1915
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,260
No.

1916
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,980
No, they don't.

1917
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,460
I'm probably in one of these shots.

1918
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,300
Let's be honest.

1919
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:39,780
June 2012, you know, between the dog on top of his station

1920
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,020
wagon and the binders full of women,

1921
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,860
the Romney campaign's over.

1922
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,980
A second Obama administration is a foregone conclusion

1923
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:49,140
at this point, and these people are celebrating.

1924
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,940
Yeah, like Jason's gonna be in this video

1925
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:54,820
like spinning on his head in the middle of the circle.

1926
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,580
And I'm cheering him on.

1927
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,980
You know, this doesn't seem fun.

1928
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,500
Even taking all the irony out of it.

1929
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,740
I'm not saying this is as good as like a cool rock concert.

1930
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,300
I could see, here's what,

1931
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,060
all right, you have not gotten me on board

1932
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,940
with liking this, but you have gotten me on board

1933
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,740
with that maybe I would have stopped at this

1934
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,740
and enjoyed it for 20 minutes.

1935
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,740
I mean, that's a victory as far as I'm concerned

1936
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:17,940
with this episode.

1937
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,460
In the episode, I knew this was a battle uphill

1938
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,020
and I didn't think I was gonna win.

1939
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:26,300
Rewatching all these clips, it's really,

1940
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,100
I did not appreciate it at the top.

1941
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,220
I think I enjoyed revisiting it now.

1942
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,460
You were right before, Jason.

1943
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,300
You shot past the correct dancers.

1944
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,220
No, I like Lindsay.

1945
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,220
I don't like big crowds usually, especially back then.

1946
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,420
But now I'm like.

1947
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,460
You don't usually go to a concert with me

1948
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,740
because you were more of a,

1949
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,140
no, we went to new pornographers at the Ace Hotel.

1950
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:46,980
It's all new pornographers.

1951
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:47,820
There's the dancing.

1952
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,660
Who are you?

1953
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,500
Who are you, yes.

1954
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,900
Yeah.

1955
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,820
But yeah, when I would suggest that you would laugh

1956
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,460
and you would go with, but you weren't like

1957
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,980
nearly as excited to see this as I was.

1958
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,380
No, because you went post up.

1959
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,740
You were ready to post up.

1960
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,940
Yeah, I'm glad to hear that you regret

1961
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,020
how you felt about it at the time.

1962
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:06,500
Can you, would you mind apologizing to me now?

1963
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,340
I'm very sorry.

1964
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,060
I'm sorry, you know.

1965
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,020
I just put more like elaborate on it more.

1966
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:15,500
Yeah, I'm sorry that I was like a little more anxious.

1967
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,300
Didn't want to hang out back there for too long.

1968
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,180
And now I'm a little more level down

1969
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,620
and I would love to be at the bad tea party right now.

1970
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,020
I'd kill to be there, honestly.

1971
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,100
And I'll kill again.

1972
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,540
I've killed before, I'll kill again.

1973
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,380
Keep killing.

1974
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,420
I'll kill as many people as it takes.

1975
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,820
Say, accept that apology.

1976
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,620
Whatever it takes to summon DJ White Rabbit

1977
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:36,180
to his MacBook Pro, I'm ready.

1978
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,140
That lazy piece of shit rabbit.

1979
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:38,980
Okay.

1980
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,420
Hey, Jason's so lazy.

1981
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,020
That's you, that's you talking.

1982
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,260
Isn't that it?

1983
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,100
Did we survive?

1984
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,940
No, wait, no, no, there's one more thing.

1985
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,860
One more thing that I do think is funny and bad

1986
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,860
and I need to play it because I did not,

1987
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:54,220
I never knew Jason, Jason this couple hours ago texted me,

1988
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,540
did you know about this?

1989
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,180
And I went, Jason, this is the exact thing

1990
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,460
I said I needed to play.

1991
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:00,220
And so I do want to set up.

1992
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,220
So when the second time they brought it back,

1993
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:06,100
that big teapot, that big like kooky teapot behind the band,

1994
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:08,060
but taken away.

1995
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:10,700
It seemed like that had been moved or taken away.

1996
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:13,420
And it seemed like the screens really amped up.

1997
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,580
Episode before we explained that the giant teapot on stage

1998
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:19,500
was taken away for the last run of the show.

1999
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,300
It was taken away and the graphics and video content

2000
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,180
kind of amped up.

2001
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,020
Yes.

2002
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,940
So Jason's getting emotional too, is what's happening.

2003
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,180
So yeah, this is, I really shouldn't play all of this,

2004
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:32,820
but there's little chunks here.

2005
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,860
This was like kind of the closing thing.

2006
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:38,300
And it is pretty embarrassing.

2007
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:43,340
You're saying that after all this, now here.

2008
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,340
Hey brother.

2009
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,180
Yes, brother.

2010
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,460
I think it's time.

2011
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,300
Absolutely.

2012
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:50,780
Not this part, these guys are great.

2013
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,780
So this is the big finale, basically.

2014
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,380
What's that, we'll set the stage.

2015
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:02,820
Well, that's a little like music box kind of wind up toy.

2016
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:05,140
And Tweedledee and Tweedledum have started it

2017
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,700
and now it's playing and you can hear it.

2018
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,380
And the motion graphics are just starting

2019
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,900
because they go wild.

2020
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,860
And again, I did not know about this.

2021
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:15,820
I would regret, I apologize to the show for never seeing it

2022
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,060
because I really would have liked to have seen this.

2023
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:21,260
This is a cutesy moon crescent.

2024
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:24,940
And there's video, I think of the opening

2025
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:28,580
of the second run of this, where you tumble down

2026
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,580
the rabbit hole and you go buy a bunch

2027
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:33,060
of vintage Disneyland tickets and you go buy

2028
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:36,100
the modern annual pass holder logo

2029
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:39,260
and then it opens the door to the tea party.

2030
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:42,900
Yes, so there's a rock is got point up rocking guitar

2031
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:43,820
when you wish upon.

2032
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:48,020
So Walt, okay, by the way, we should go back actually.

2033
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:48,860
No, Walt.

2034
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,500
There's more, there's more.

2035
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,420
Walt just started talking by the way.

2036
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:57,740
And then they go from when you wish upon a star

2037
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:01,140
into the song, best day of my life.

2038
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,220
What's this song?

2039
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:03,140
Is a song that.

2040
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,060
Oh, it's in a lot of insurance commercials,

2041
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,980
gap commercials, fast food commercial.

2042
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,500
Like that's really where I do it.

2043
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,420
I had to look it up.

2044
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,820
It's by the American authors.

2045
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:12,660
I've never heard this.

2046
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:13,780
Never heard of this.

2047
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,620
Yeah.

2048
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,580
It's not, it's not a song.

2049
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:21,660
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh.

2050
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:25,540
Please, let music keep being this for more decades.

2051
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,700
How many ohs and ahs?

2052
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:31,180
Yeah, this is a real, you've never heard this?

2053
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:33,500
This is, you know, peacetime decadence.

2054
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,540
We didn't know what was coming four years later.

2055
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,380
We had no idea what was in store for us.

2056
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:43,420
Everything is, stems from the politics of the era, but okay.

2057
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:49,500
Oh, Walt in a bunch of frames.

2058
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,780
So Walt has appeared now in the back of a bunch of frames.

2059
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,140
You can hear him talking.

2060
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:54,500
They have spliced in.

2061
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,140
Wow.

2062
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,780
And they're all masturbating to the, just at seeing Walt.

2063
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,380
They all have big boners.

2064
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:07,300
So there's like all these pictures in the back

2065
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,660
and like of Disney.

2066
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:12,700
As if they're like saying goodbye to Disney.

2067
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:16,420
The American authors, I guess, are paying tribute now

2068
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,060
to Walt somehow.

2069
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,940
And then yeah, they just go like this.

2070
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,660
More Walt clips.

2071
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:24,060
And yeah, they just bliced in Walt for some reason

2072
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:25,620
at the end of this.

2073
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:30,020
And as the dancers come up on stage and do a big finale.

2074
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,220
Hottest deck in town.

2075
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,780
The hottest, thank you, the dancers

2076
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:34,540
that are the hottest deck in town.

2077
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,700
And I never got to see this live.

2078
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,500
I never got to see this big finale

2079
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:44,820
that I think is really funny because of...

2080
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:49,940
I don't know, why would you put, what gives a shit?

2081
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,220
Why would you put Walt in there?

2082
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,660
You know, the anniversary was all about

2083
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,420
the history of Disneyland.

2084
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,700
Yeah, but the, it's not like the whole show

2085
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,260
was like a salute to Walt.

2086
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:03,020
No, but if you scroll to the very end.

2087
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:03,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2088
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:06,980
Yeah.

2089
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,580
Is that what you were talking about?

2090
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,900
Yeah, it's just the Disney, like a giant Disneyland logo

2091
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,180
that flips to a giant man tea party logo

2092
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,620
that explodes into diamonds.

2093
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:26,460
Yeah, I don't know.

2094
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,300
Because they were really pushing the diamond thing.

2095
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,140
I guess to like figure out.

2096
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:31,020
Because they didn't have a new fucking ride

2097
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,140
for that person.

2098
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,660
Yes, I remember we were disappointed

2099
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:34,980
that there was not a crazy,

2100
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,020
they put the Hatbox ghost on Haunted Mansion.

2101
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:37,860
That was it.

2102
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:39,980
And they coasted on the fantasy fair for a piece.

2103
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,740
But they decided they put some clips of Walt

2104
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,740
in the mad tea party and maybe the audience

2105
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:45,580
will be satiated.

2106
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:48,100
They coasted on the fantasy fair.

2107
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,140
Yeah, we're good for a while.

2108
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:52,260
We put one thing in one corner.

2109
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,260
There really wasn't much new stuff until Galaxy's Edge.

2110
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,220
They did.

2111
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,580
In Disneyland Classic.

2112
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,740
I think I've told this story before

2113
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:02,060
is that they had a big event a year prior

2114
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,500
to the diamond anniversary.

2115
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,820
And I, because I was clicking fast,

2116
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:09,820
I got tickets to the like special fan event.

2117
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,300
And they were supposedly gonna announce a bunch of rides

2118
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,140
and then they didn't.

2119
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:15,060
But instead they gave us a bunch of free stuff.

2120
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,980
Yeah, you got a big paperweight.

2121
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,980
Got a big paperweight.

2122
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,300
I got like a fast pass,

2123
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,780
like classic fast passes to everything.

2124
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,980
I got like a food.

2125
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:25,340
We got like free food at Disney.

2126
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,100
And it was like, we forgot real quick

2127
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,580
that it was like supposed to be an announcement

2128
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,220
of like the great stuff coming.

2129
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,040
It worked.

2130
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:31,880
But it worked.

2131
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,700
Yeah.

2132
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,540
It was great.

2133
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,260
We took a picture with Anna and Elsa.

2134
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:38,740
We were like, we got fast passes, wow.

2135
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,940
No one was like, there's rides aren't going to be here.

2136
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:43,100
We're not happy with the offerings.

2137
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:43,940
Didn't matter.

2138
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:46,660
You just wanted to party with Mad Hatter.

2139
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,700
Just wanted to party with Mad Hatter.

2140
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,820
Look, also, because I flipped through this too

2141
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,500
and a lot of the videos are from the last night

2142
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,500
that this band performed.

2143
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,140
And look, I don't hold it against them.

2144
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,580
Emotions run high on the last night of anything.

2145
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,900
I know some shoot ends of something

2146
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,060
that nobody ends up seeing

2147
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,820
and you still make a speech

2148
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,140
because you really went through something.

2149
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,740
I don't hold the emotion against them.

2150
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:11,380
But you do, I just flip it through.

2151
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:16,160
They're doing like a Conan Last Tonight show level.

2152
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:18,860
I want to say one thing.

2153
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,260
One thing before we leave the stage.

2154
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,220
And that is to be kind.

2155
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:26,820
Because kindness is what makes the world go round.

2156
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:29,620
And maybe if everyone was a little bit kinder.

2157
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,500
Like, okay, look, you are dressed

2158
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,660
like the Johnny Depp Mad Hatter.

2159
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:37,220
You just did a cover of Separate Ways.

2160
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:41,420
You did a medley of Jump, Drive and Whale

2161
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,340
and Stray Cat Strut.

2162
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:47,780
And now like, because if you, me, all of us work together

2163
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,700
to bring love into this world.

2164
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:51,820
I mean, it's very funny.

2165
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,500
But also maybe they touched as many hearts

2166
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,260
as Conan did on The Tonight Show.

2167
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,100
Yeah.

2168
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:57,940
You know?

2169
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:00,540
I mean, the declining viewership of late night television

2170
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:02,380
for the last 10 plus years, you're probably right.

2171
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,900
In a lot of ways, Jay was right.

2172
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,700
Conan wasn't getting the ratings.

2173
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,380
So, he wasn't getting the ratings.

2174
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,380
His ratings were way down too.

2175
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,660
Yeah, but no, I'm just saying Conan, like,

2176
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:14,420
look, if you're not getting the ratings.

2177
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,340
Might be more overall.

2178
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,620
But there is a video of like one,

2179
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,020
it's probably one of the last nights.

2180
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:22,740
And they say, I know some of you have been here all weekend.

2181
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,420
Like, they're regulars.

2182
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,260
Yes!

2183
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,100
That's what Conan said too.

2184
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,340
You've been here in the rain.

2185
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:28,260
You've been like.

2186
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,260
Oh yeah.

2187
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:33,580
People, yeah, people protest.

2188
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,660
People tried to burn the park down.

2189
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:40,260
Team, team, what's the team Coco for the tea party?

2190
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,100
Team Tea.

2191
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:41,940
Team Tea.

2192
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,180
Yeah, Team Tea.

2193
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,020
We're Team Tea now.

2194
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,580
TNT to the park and said,

2195
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,660
bad tea party goes, we all go.

2196
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:49,500
Yeah.

2197
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,500
They got, there were so many suicide bombers

2198
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,860
in the last weekend of this.

2199
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,220
A very popular show.

2200
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,460
I mean, look, we can still try to get it back, I think.

2201
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,620
I think there's still a chance.

2202
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,780
Again, there's like nothing over there.

2203
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:03,620
I know.

2204
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:06,500
I don't, I'm sure it costs a bit of money

2205
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,340
for all of these.

2206
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:09,340
That Summer of Heroes,

2207
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:11,220
because they can't call it Marvel or something.

2208
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,940
The Summer of Heroes is rough.

2209
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:13,780
Yeah.

2210
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:15,420
Yeah, with the Guardians ride's great,

2211
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:16,420
but that Summer of Heroes where you just get

2212
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,740
to like watch Black Widow drive around in an armored vehicle.

2213
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,060
And that was basically the entertainment.

2214
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:23,500
But I was like, they have,

2215
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,820
the Guardians of the Galaxy is a good soundtrack

2216
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:28,420
that a regular person would like.

2217
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,780
Why don't you just have a band play that?

2218
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:31,780
And they did not do that.

2219
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:33,660
Yeah, they have a little dance party.

2220
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:35,980
Actually, yeah, having a band kind of dresses

2221
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,180
all the characters.

2222
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,540
And if there's a raccoon drummer.

2223
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:40,380
Yeah.

2224
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,380
They did, they did a little more

2225
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:43,540
of a version of it in Epcot.

2226
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,340
They do it like outside with a boom bop.

2227
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,180
They do a tiny show.

2228
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:47,180
Yeah, tiny show.

2229
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:48,980
But yeah, play those songs.

2230
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:49,820
They didn't do that.

2231
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:52,420
And then it doesn't feel like there's any room for fun.

2232
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:55,420
Like a fun thing like that in Avengers campus.

2233
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,180
No, because it's just the, you know,

2234
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:01,740
spy agency torture of just the Avengers soundtrack

2235
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,340
played forever.

2236
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,580
I wonder if it's still like that.

2237
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,420
I'm so curious.

2238
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:07,260
That is so miserable.

2239
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:08,100
I am too.

2240
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:08,940
Yeah.

2241
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,380
It seems like right after we were there,

2242
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,820
like a week or 10 days later,

2243
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,780
all restrictions were pretty much dropped.

2244
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:18,500
So people just walk into the land.

2245
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,340
Yeah, sure, sure.

2246
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,180
Just everyone just walking through.

2247
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:22,100
And I was like, okay, oh man.

2248
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,180
I made the wrong call on that one.

2249
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,780
But yeah, Dr. Strange should come through the portal

2250
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:31,860
and be like, this is the best day of my life.

2251
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:32,700
My life.

2252
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,860
But I don't think that's gonna happen.

2253
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,940
They're gonna have to build another stage or something.

2254
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,580
Marvel rocks.

2255
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:44,900
Yeah, I'm on board with all of it.

2256
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,740
So much more.

2257
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:48,860
What is it, theming wise, do you think the same set list,

2258
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:51,260
but if you put a different property on it

2259
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:52,900
or a different aesthetic,

2260
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,620
would that go a long way into your liking?

2261
01:17:55,620 --> 01:18:00,140
I think the Jack FM set list is a big roadblock for me.

2262
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,100
Okay.

2263
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,700
So that's probably the primary.

2264
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,260
But you know, one thing, I think just,

2265
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:08,100
request number one,

2266
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,380
have we not experienced Don't Stop Believing enough?

2267
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,220
I agree with that.

2268
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,500
Have we not, have we like,

2269
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,340
Yes.

2270
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,980
This, I think we've all had our time with it.

2271
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:19,580
We've all, it's time to say goodbye.

2272
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:20,420
Yeah.

2273
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,300
It's time to, like this,

2274
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,820
it's time for it to explode into diamonds

2275
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,860
and never be played by a band again.

2276
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:26,900
There's a lot of those.

2277
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:29,060
I mean, we should do a Patreon of songs we all think

2278
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:30,620
should never be played again.

2279
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,140
There's those, I don't know that I even put that one on there.

2280
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:37,700
We've turned this box as many times as it can be turned.

2281
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,460
I'm no sweet,

2282
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,060
Sweet Caroline is out for me.

2283
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:41,900
Of course.

2284
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:42,740
Yeah.

2285
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,580
I think that's retired.

2286
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:46,180
Jason, do you have one to throw in the pile?

2287
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,380
I don't know.

2288
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:49,980
So good, so good, so good.

2289
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:50,820
Yeah, I don't like it.

2290
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:54,660
I have nothing, that's in my top 10 things that annoy me.

2291
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:57,260
Yeah, I really, it annoys me, yeah.

2292
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,860
I don't even think I put Don't Stop Believing

2293
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:02,220
in this like top 10, but I get that.

2294
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:04,020
But you have one, no?

2295
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:06,660
No, Don't Stop Believing was up, that every,

2296
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,180
I feel like every party I went to in college,

2297
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:11,460
like in the 2000s, someone would put that.

2298
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,660
Everybody like discovered it.

2299
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,500
And I kind of liked, I don't know,

2300
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,180
I didn't feel like I had my time with it.

2301
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:19,580
I feel like I discovered Journey,

2302
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:21,580
and then the Journey ended.

2303
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:23,980
We're covered on that.

2304
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:25,980
Enough dueling piano bars.

2305
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,180
Played waste to this.

2306
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:32,740
The problem is your average person doesn't go hard

2307
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:34,300
on the B sides of anything.

2308
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,620
Like the average person knows 20 songs.

2309
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,020
And the people at these places are like,

2310
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,820
we wanna make those people happy.

2311
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,260
Makes sense.

2312
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:46,380
But you're saying add another.

2313
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,780
Yeah, if you could, yeah, take any property,

2314
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:51,700
probably Disney, just for the mental exercise.

2315
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:56,020
Just like to overlay it with an aesthetic,

2316
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,180
with the same set list that you think

2317
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:01,660
maybe would improve this 25%.

2318
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,780
What do I wanna see a rave of?

2319
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:09,060
I mean, I, you know, some sort of like,

2320
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:13,420
I'd be interested in a 2013 glam Winnie the Pooh,

2321
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:15,860
where it's like guys in big,

2322
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:20,660
it's a bright, like British trench coats.

2323
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:23,300
These people are meant to represent rabbit and Eeyore.

2324
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,260
Okay, yeah, that's good.

2325
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:27,580
I am way on board with that.

2326
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:29,580
That's really weird.

2327
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,100
That would be very, very odd.

2328
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,540
Yeah, 100 acres of rock.

2329
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,500
Yeah, there's stuff that makes sense.

2330
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,300
Like, not, it doesn't have to be a hyperspace hoopla,

2331
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,020
but I like elements of it, like just have a band,

2332
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:43,460
have a Figurine Dan and the Modal Nodes or something.

2333
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:44,300
Well, I would, yeah.

2334
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,500
That would make too much sense to do.

2335
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,340
I guess I'd need.

2336
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,820
No, I wanna see like Darth Vader playing a guitar.

2337
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:52,460
Like a hyperspace hoopla, like six,

2338
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:54,100
and it's battle of the bands.

2339
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,660
Like that would be very fun.

2340
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:57,500
Best day of my life.

2341
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,340
Yeah, I agree.

2342
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,180
Yeah, dumb.

2343
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:05,140
I want it to be dumb as hell.

2344
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:08,140
Or the Avenger, yeah, even just all the Avengers.

2345
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,500
Like people in Avengers costumes.

2346
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,340
Sure.

2347
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,180
You know.

2348
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,620
Yeah, but that makes, yeah, it would have to be,

2349
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,140
that would have to be 10 years ago.

2350
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:19,700
Everything is too serious, I think.

2351
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,540
Yes.

2352
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:21,780
So it would have to make sense.

2353
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,620
They would have to have a character

2354
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:25,020
that plays music in the movie, I think.

2355
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,420
Or they'd have to have Hawkeye do it,

2356
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:28,460
because Cherry Renner.

2357
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,620
Hawkeye rocks.

2358
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:32,220
Hawkeye is Rock Eye, and now,

2359
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,460
and he does the Jeremy Renner song.

2360
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:35,300
Yeah, yeah.

2361
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,140
If he did the medicine. Heaven Don't Have A Name?

2362
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,980
Oh man, if he did, yeah, Heaven Don't Have A Name,

2363
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:42,700
medicine, the Jeremy Renner cover of

2364
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:43,540
House of the Rising Sun.

2365
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,300
House of the Rising Sun.

2366
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,740
And then he takes his guitar picks and puts them on arrows

2367
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,380
and shoots them into the crowd.

2368
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:51,220
Yeah.

2369
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:52,060
That's good.

2370
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:52,900
Yeah.

2371
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,380
I mean, for my, yeah, the answer for me is just,

2372
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:57,220
there's no bad suggestion for this.

2373
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:59,740
There's no bad overlay to put on this,

2374
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,900
to put on these songs.

2375
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:01,740
Yeah.

2376
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,220
Take any Disney property.

2377
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:05,820
Take Bringing Down the House with Steve Martin.

2378
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:06,660
Great, yeah.

2379
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,300
The Kids from Prom.

2380
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,540
Doing prom, actually, that's a good idea,

2381
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:15,140
doing prom back here.

2382
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,340
Everybody goes to prom.

2383
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:17,180
That's true.

2384
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:19,340
That is a movie that I only mostly know

2385
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:22,780
because they had posters of it back in this area.

2386
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:23,620
Yeah, yeah.

2387
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:24,460
I was like, what is prom?

2388
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:25,300
I don't really know what it is,

2389
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:26,620
but if it's prom, you know what I would like

2390
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:29,380
is a prom-themed thing where all the drinks are,

2391
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,180
the bar is kind of hidden,

2392
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:34,060
it's meant to evoke that you're sneaking it in,

2393
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:37,420
so they give you drinks in an old water bottle.

2394
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:40,580
Oh yeah, dirty Gatorade bottle,

2395
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:42,900
or a Gatorade bottle with the label removed.

2396
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:46,460
Yeah, a little bit of the paper sticking around,

2397
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,300
it's all torn up.

2398
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,140
Yeah, some sticky on it.

2399
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,820
Yeah, that's good.

2400
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:54,420
Artemis Fowl and his many friends and cohorts.

2401
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:55,820
Run, Cougar Run.

2402
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:58,860
Oh yes, which we just discovered

2403
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,660
in the Masked In Tears episode.

2404
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,540
Any of those.

2405
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:05,100
It's bullwhip, it's bullwhip.

2406
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:08,940
I will say also just from going to Videopolis

2407
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,980
when the 80s night they had,

2408
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:15,020
it is nice to have, I feel like these places,

2409
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:15,860
you get a little energy,

2410
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,380
you get a little jolt at like a 9 p.m.

2411
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:18,220
If you're going all night,

2412
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:19,420
if you're going to midnight,

2413
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,140
you get a little live music, you get a little bass,

2414
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,620
and then you're ready for another three hours.

2415
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:25,380
Yeah, wake people up a little.

2416
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,420
I do like stopping by a thing,

2417
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:31,420
dancing for one minute, like no longer than that,

2418
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,700
doing a quick little pass through,

2419
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,380
and yeah, you're right, it does give you,

2420
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:35,580
it gives you a little speed ramp.

2421
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:36,620
A little boost.

2422
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,460
Yeah.

2423
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:39,340
And then if you happen to be like,

2424
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:40,700
when they played like Rhythm Nation,

2425
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,500
then you would be like, wow, very impressed,

2426
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,340
and then you would have,

2427
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:45,300
if there was a chance you could have just wandered by

2428
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,140
during Rhythm Nation and thought that they were playing

2429
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:49,060
like some cooler songs,

2430
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,980
and that it would've colored your whole impression

2431
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:53,540
for a decade, that didn't happen.

2432
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:55,180
Well, I just didn't walk back here at all,

2433
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,500
but now I've taken a long walk back here.

2434
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,660
A long walk back.

2435
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,500
Now we've had, we've achieved your fantasy.

2436
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,020
Do you believe it's only been an hour and 24 minutes?

2437
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,340
Jesus Christ, you survived podcast the ride.

2438
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:09,020
That's what we gotta do on that, right?

2439
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:11,820
Unless you have any, now do you want to have

2440
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:13,820
any tearful last words?

2441
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:14,820
No, I just.

2442
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:15,940
And I mean last words,

2443
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:19,100
because there's no mad tea party too, I'll tell you that.

2444
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,900
Well, they did get to say goodbye twice.

2445
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,380
They did get to say, there is no-

2446
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:24,500
Wasn't there a conversation where we were talking about,

2447
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,060
you suggested that we do this,

2448
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,540
and then I think Jason said,

2449
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,020
well, what if we combine it with electronica,

2450
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,780
and you were like, Jason, no, that can't, no.

2451
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:31,980
No, no. That's two different things.

2452
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,380
I was pitching a month of the others.

2453
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:35,220
Oh, I see.

2454
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:37,580
I thought you were pitching doing them combo,

2455
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:40,020
and Mike got like, hang on, no, no.

2456
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,300
We make a lot of fun on this podcast,

2457
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,380
which Jason says sometimes, but he would never,

2458
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,220
I would have never.

2459
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,980
Ever, ever suggest combining those into two episodes.

2460
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:49,340
He knows.

2461
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:50,180
Jason's aware.

2462
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:51,020
We'll get to the others.

2463
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,340
Well, now, all right, we're gonna try it.

2464
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:54,340
Now my heart fell apart, I'm very sorry.

2465
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,020
I do think-

2466
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:00,100
Who even knows what the playlist for Glowfest

2467
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:00,940
or electronica was like?

2468
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:02,620
We'll have to look into it, Glowfest.

2469
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:04,980
And also, I keep floating the idea of doing a musical,

2470
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,380
a live musical podcast, all right,

2471
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:09,180
and I just think maybe we find some of these costumes.

2472
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:11,700
Dear God.

2473
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:16,820
I gotta end this episode before you get any more ideas.

2474
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,780
It's always a good time.

2475
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,860
Scott doing, oh, don't stop believing.

2476
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:23,860
It just doesn't matter.

2477
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,660
How many more of these elderberry drinks

2478
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,060
are you gonna have to give me?

2479
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,380
You'd have to take the pill, take the pill.

2480
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:34,300
You need to know that if you ever see this happening,

2481
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,780
that I am not okay, I am in distress.

2482
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:39,140
If this is in a live setting audience,

2483
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,580
stand up and say, Scott's not okay.

2484
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:45,060
He would have never, this is my will right now.

2485
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:45,900
In my dream.

2486
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,900
Wow, Mike and Scott are dressed like the walrus

2487
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:50,380
and the carpenter and they're doing Shake It Off.

2488
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,140
In my dreams.

2489
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,140
In my dreams, yeah.

2490
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:57,220
Jason's dressed like the young oysters, the baby oysters.

2491
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,140
In my dreams, yeah.

2492
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,620
This is just, the whole complexion of this music show

2493
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:05,020
has changed now that I've been thinking about Manti Party.

2494
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:06,860
All right, we're wrapping this up.

2495
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:09,980
Keep, stay, say, keep on surviving.

2496
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:13,620
Don't stop surviving Podcast the Ride with Second Kate.

2497
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,100
Three bonus episodes a month.

2498
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,860
Keep it here.

2499
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,420
Yeah.

2500
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:19,780
All right, let's, this is it.

2501
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:20,660
I'm pulling the plug.

2502
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,460
He's just a small town boy.
