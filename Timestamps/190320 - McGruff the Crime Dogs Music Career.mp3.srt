1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:26,716
This is Podcast the Ride, the second gate hosted by three guys who are about to totally blow out their voices.

3
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:29,996
Talking like this for an hour straight.

4
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:32,936
It's not an easy one to do.

5
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,596
I'll be suffering the rest of the day.

6
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:43,396
My name is Mike Carlson and I love to talk like this and warn kids about drugs.

7
00:00:44,176 --> 00:00:44,716
Jason Sheridan.

8
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:51,016
Hey, this is Jason Sheridan encouraging you all to buy timers for your lamps that go on at 5pm

9
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:53,336
and then go off at about 2am.

10
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:54,736
I like this different McGruff.

11
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:55,736
This is the I.

12
00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:57,076
Hey there, what's up?

13
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:57,976
I'm McGruff.

14
00:00:58,076 --> 00:00:59,076
Hey, it's McGruff.

15
00:00:59,996 --> 00:01:04,836
So we are today talking about, I don't want to declare this the best episode we've ever done,

16
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,396
but it might be, at least I'm very, very excited about it.

17
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:08,776
It's a solid shot.

18
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:10,456
It's a solid shot at it.

19
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:12,976
It's barely tied into theme parks.

20
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:15,216
It just, there's a costume character.

21
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:22,176
I think maybe what we're finding is that the one a month of the Patreon is like sort of adjacent,

22
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,736
which I think is fine.

23
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,516
Look, it's a costume character and it's very silly.

24
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:32,176
It's definitely the theme park spirit and silliness.

25
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,056
So it's justified in my mind.

26
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:38,896
And we have talked before about sometimes when you look at the world,

27
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:41,076
it seems like everything is theme parks.

28
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:44,176
Yes, everything is theme parks and everything is wrestling, I've found.

29
00:01:44,176 --> 00:01:45,196
It's all the same.

30
00:01:45,196 --> 00:01:47,676
Politics is wrestling and everything else is theme parks.

31
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:49,696
So that's basically how the world is.

32
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:50,556
That's my world.

33
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:52,436
That's a little philosophy for me.

34
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,236
That's your Patton Oswalt spaceship horseman.

35
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:57,196
Yes. What is it?

36
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:59,136
I don't remember, but I know what you're talking about.

37
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:03,056
Yeah, I don't remember. Ninja pirate horseman is his book, correct?

38
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:03,576
Yes.

39
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:04,336
I think I got it.

40
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:05,516
Yeah, it's a horseman.

41
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:11,456
If you read the, you know, I've talked before, Jason Woellner got me into this Blue Loop website,

42
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:14,956
which is sort of like a trade magazine for not just theme parks,

43
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:19,196
but themed and experiential and entertainment in general.

44
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:23,596
And it's the main things they report on our theme parks and then museums

45
00:02:23,596 --> 00:02:27,836
because museums are starting to do a lot more, you know,

46
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:31,816
interactive stuff for themes sort of stuff.

47
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:36,856
And then there was an article where I was like, all right, I got to stop reading this

48
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,016
because the made up terms are making me mad.

49
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:44,316
But experiential shopping of like getting people back into malls

50
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:47,056
with like, how can we gamify the mall?

51
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:50,476
Or like, sort of what the void is about a little bit.

52
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:52,076
Yeah, that's true.

53
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:55,176
And there's I well, I don't know what else is an example of that,

54
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:59,396
but I did go into a Disney store and there was some like interactive

55
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:05,796
augmented reality thing involving like last Jedi that you played in the store.

56
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:10,236
Yeah, I think stuff like that or Instagram like backdrops.

57
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:13,576
And then like even still hanging on from like eight years ago,

58
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:19,016
Q, you know, scan this QR code like that was a yeah.

59
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:22,876
And of course, indoor hurricane machines.

60
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:29,376
That's long before that's that's experiential shopping or whatever the term was.

61
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:32,496
We'll we'll get to our episode about indoor hurricane machines.

62
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:34,296
Yeah, we'll experience all of them.

63
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:38,096
I assume we'll travel across country and find the best one and rank them.

64
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:39,396
Sure. I think so.

65
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:42,196
Yeah, find the difference between the manufacturers.

66
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,296
Yeah, this like this one's a better hurricane experience.

67
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:50,876
But upkeep is suffering a little and I think the font is better on the

68
00:03:50,876 --> 00:03:55,236
you know, the hurricane saga, indoor hurricane saga.

69
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:58,136
Oh, no. Yeah, it's what we're doing it.

70
00:03:58,516 --> 00:04:01,496
So we have as I was just about to say before we start recording,

71
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:03,656
there is too much material.

72
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:06,916
So today's episode is specifically about not just McGruff.

73
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:09,496
It is about McGruff's music career.

74
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:15,856
And I was like, I wasn't totally sure about the rules myself because I know nothing.

75
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:18,796
I'm not prepared to talk about McGruff in general.

76
00:04:18,996 --> 00:04:19,736
Right. No, we're not.

77
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:22,216
Now, you and the reason I know about this because we were walking.

78
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:24,776
The three of us were walking to eat lunch after recording.

79
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,396
And there's a police station around here.

80
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:30,196
And I believe you said there's a full McGruff suit.

81
00:04:30,356 --> 00:04:32,636
You told me that there's a full McGruff suit.

82
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:36,436
If you look through the window and always in the lobby of the police station.

83
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:37,296
And I was like, holy shit.

84
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,496
And then you're like, you know, there's a McGruff album.

85
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:41,116
And I went, what are you? What?

86
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:44,456
And then I went home, immediately looked it up and I've been obsessed

87
00:04:44,456 --> 00:04:46,036
with it for like eight months.

88
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:48,416
Yeah, you you bit even harder than I did.

89
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:50,196
I poked around a little bit.

90
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:54,076
But but my I mean, I bit I bit harder.

91
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:56,876
Bit like I was biting a cat in half.

92
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:58,896
They're putting me down tomorrow.

93
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:01,196
I'm rabid.

94
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:03,336
I'm a minister society.

95
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:07,136
I know a priest, no funeral.

96
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:09,796
Unmarked grave.

97
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:15,836
So what I my my takeaway that I did not dive as deep as you,

98
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:18,136
but my takeaway right away was,

99
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:22,916
you know, something like this is is is catnip for me.

100
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:24,256
Ironically catnip.

101
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:27,136
And I like a good bad album.

102
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:29,916
I always have or, you know, a silly.

103
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,256
Why does this exist album?

104
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:37,456
But my in poking around initially the songs better than they have a right to be.

105
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:39,216
The songs compelling here.

106
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:40,456
That is what's compelling.

107
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:45,536
And the thing it's not just how funny it's an anti-drug album or, by the way, two albums.

108
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:48,256
Yeah, it's too full. And also there's some of it.

109
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:52,996
I will ask the listeners to find the rest for me because they're not all archived on YouTube.

110
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:56,416
So there for sure is at least a part two lurking somewhere

111
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,376
because all the songs have not been heard by us.

112
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:08,236
Are you talking about OK, the first one of which I know I'm more familiar with is McGruff's smart kids.

113
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:12,596
Yes, McGruff smart kids 1986 was released.

114
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:16,576
Yes. And that's the one that I listened to the first for the one you told me about it.

115
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,616
And then there was a different album I discovered from 1991,

116
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:25,296
which came out exclusively at Burger King and it's called McGruff cares for you.

117
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:34,136
Well, now that sounds like it could be like an like Delilah would play like that's like it would be soft rock hits like.

118
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:37,216
Well, there's a lot of soft rock on both of these albums.

119
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,016
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:47,156
So that's like really my musical alley and one that I didn't know till yesterday that I threw on with my wife,

121
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:53,816
Aaron and the beginning made us go, oh, like it's the it is like the kind of thing we would just listen to anyway.

122
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,856
I was smart smart kids.

123
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:58,976
Yes, I think it might be the song smart kids.

124
00:06:59,476 --> 00:07:02,796
I think I know exactly what you're talking because I was just listening to them again before you got here.

125
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:07,396
And I that one started and I think that's it's like a bit of the sax very like a lot of sax in this.

126
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:08,336
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

127
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:09,256
I think that's what I think.

128
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:16,116
I know we're talking about very I have this whole there and I have both gotten into this is going to sound really contrived,

129
00:07:16,116 --> 00:07:20,796
but we have both gotten into Kenny G and that's really yeah.

130
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:24,636
Because some early Kenny G pretty good.

131
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:31,856
He's got ties to legit early 80s instrumental funk with this guy Kashif who's super respected.

132
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:36,156
He like Kenny G played on some stuff that is fantastic.

133
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:39,636
I encourage people to look up a video called Hi, how you doing?

134
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:41,536
That is a fucking blast.

135
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:47,536
It is not I get what's lame about him in the 90s, but he came out of some pretty cool stuff.

136
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:49,276
I'm not kidding. There's good Kenny.

137
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:54,696
And this thing, the this thing reminded me of the of the Kenny G that I like.

138
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,816
Yeah, there's a lot of my first thought is and this is not really equivalent,

139
00:07:58,816 --> 00:08:07,596
but like if you were just hearing Rod Stewart in the last 10 years, you'd go, oh God, this is just lame old standard crap.

140
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:09,736
But like he was cool in the 90s.

141
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:13,036
Yeah, he was sort of like over the Hill.

142
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:17,616
Perhaps the most prominent raspy voiced singer besides McGruff.

143
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:18,616
Yeah, right.

144
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:21,876
Me and Rod, we're recording together.

145
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,876
We blew our voices out like Lennon and Nielsen.

146
00:08:25,976 --> 00:08:27,716
But now it just gives us character.

147
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:30,896
There have been legends about either of us aren't true.

148
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:33,796
That McGruff is a little bit of a pirate.

149
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:37,416
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

150
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:39,076
Yarg.

151
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:41,276
So I believe.

152
00:08:41,276 --> 00:08:42,796
Now, I'll listen to old Kenny G.

153
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:43,596
I don't know.

154
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:48,636
I'll make I'll try to whittle down what I consider the good Kenny.

155
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:49,816
The essential G.

156
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:52,016
Yeah, G was a G.

157
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:57,236
So we'll do a quick little in case you don't know McGruff.

158
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:58,796
Yeah, McGruff the crime dog.

159
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,176
If you're a young listener, perhaps you're not so familiar with him.

160
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:10,496
He's a giant dog in a trench coat who would appear on commercials and in other various media and tell you not to do drugs.

161
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:12,376
Tell you watch out for strangers.

162
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:15,256
I primarily know him from commercials.

163
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,076
I think I don't there was there were specials.

164
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:19,156
There's a Drew Barrymore special that he's on.

165
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:19,936
Oh, that's right.

166
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:23,956
Which we'll talk, I'm sure another time we don't have time for that.

167
00:09:23,956 --> 00:09:29,096
But he has some other interesting media ventures that that exist.

168
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:35,136
And he's he alternates between being a cartoon character and being a suited.

169
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:35,696
Yes.

170
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:45,836
On the McGruff Smart Kids album, it's got this wonderfully plain cover of him as a suited character.

171
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:48,756
Just like leaning up against some fake brick.

172
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,836
You know what it looks like, Jason?

173
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,536
This one. Sorry, I can't turn this over.

174
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:53,976
Like Sesame Street.

175
00:09:54,236 --> 00:10:03,296
Yeah, I think it's a really pleasant like pretty cheap photo, but it's like really sets the tone right and creates the character for this album.

176
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:08,416
A cheap photo for like fully produced songs, because that's the thing that gets me.

177
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,416
They made two albums and one in the late 80s.

178
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:13,696
The other in 91, did you say was that?

179
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,956
Yeah, that's what it says.

180
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:25,316
And doing anything with media, I feel like before at least Windows Media Player before Pro Tools was so much work.

181
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:32,036
It's so much labor to do to record songs for like a throwaway like.

182
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:38,936
And this, you know, these are very synth laden, but since they're already to do, and there's some real instruments.

183
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:41,116
I was just complimenting the saxophone work.

184
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:42,616
There's a lot of great sex work.

185
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:43,956
There's a lot of first one.

186
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:44,196
Yeah.

187
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:46,556
So this is not some like you'll hear.

188
00:10:46,556 --> 00:10:50,096
You'll hear it up the quality of this music as much as we can.

189
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:51,236
No, no, but you're absolutely right.

190
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:55,916
Like it's like it's legitimately produced music.

191
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,456
It's not Shinse MIDI.

192
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,556
Yeah, I couldn't find.

193
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:01,116
I cannot find credits.

194
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:02,836
No, I tried.

195
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:08,236
I looked at all the places you go to find out who what session players played on things.

196
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:09,876
And I don't think it exists.

197
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:16,696
The tape is on discogs.com, which is the best source of who played on what right is on there,

198
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:19,956
which is like a collector site that also gives you like a worth of an album.

199
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:22,636
And I think the worth of this is because it's only on cassette.

200
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:25,036
I think the worth is literally one cent.

201
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:29,256
Although it seems to be hard to find and all the YouTube comments are very.

202
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:31,776
Can I can somebody send me this?

203
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,056
Here's my people just give their email address right in the comments.

204
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:37,316
Please just get me this album.

205
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:42,776
Yeah, but the YouTube gets the job done unless you really need to be listening to this on a cassette.

206
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,796
Like when you're out and about like a walkman.

207
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:47,536
Do you feel Mike?

208
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:49,116
You're more into this than anybody.

209
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:54,236
Are you do you feel like you want you need these on your mobile device?

210
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:59,056
Do you are you ever driving around and like God, I wish I could play the I have played it from the YouTube

211
00:11:59,056 --> 00:11:59,836
in my car.

212
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:00,456
Sure.

213
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:01,056
Uh huh.

214
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:03,176
So that's that's all I need really job done.

215
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:09,776
It eats data, but I did rip this though for this purpose just so it wouldn't be tied to the Internet.

216
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:11,096
We're not sitting through an ad.

217
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:11,856
Yes.

218
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,796
Or anything that we've you the patreon listeners.

219
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:15,856
We've done you the service.

220
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:18,576
Yeah, I'm making you listen to a Verizon ad.

221
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:21,996
You is now that all right.

222
00:12:22,056 --> 00:12:23,356
Yeah, you'll listen to other ads.

223
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:25,636
Yeah, not you're not on this.

224
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:26,336
Not on this feed.

225
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:28,416
No, I just feel like that's been the pre-roll.

226
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,036
I've gotten on YouTube a lot recently.

227
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:36,496
It's like a little if we get a blue shoe sponsorship, you are exclusively going to read the ads.

228
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:37,896
Oh, that's fine.

229
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:39,636
I'm going to test the product.

230
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:40,536
Oh, okay.

231
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:41,676
It's blue shoe again.

232
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:45,236
It's generic Viagra and Cialis and stuff.

233
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:53,816
What is generic mean like like it's not it's not it's what's the term for pharmacist over the counter?

234
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:56,836
No, it's just not name brand.

235
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:57,856
It's like it.

236
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:04,976
Well, but blue shoe is a name brand, but they're just providing like we're going to they are.

237
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:12,436
So they don't make the they get pills from elsewhere and they get a reaction pills and they send it to you without the hassle.

238
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:13,316
It's generic.

239
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:18,936
It's like if you're just buying like the up and up brand Loretta Dean instead of Claritin.

240
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:23,476
Okay, but they don't ever why is this this is we don't have time for this.

241
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:30,456
Why is why would they have a branding like blue shoe because the generic drugs generally just name the real drug?

242
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:40,236
Yeah, well, I think they're I think they're just the mid they're the middle blue shoe is a company that find that generic Viagra and gives it to you.

243
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,156
The pill you're taking is not blue.

244
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:47,716
I think they also do like a digital consultation because you still need a script for a lot of the consultation.

245
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:49,836
It's just do you get erections?

246
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:51,016
No, are you all right?

247
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:51,616
Are you horny?

248
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:52,916
Yes, I try to be.

249
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:56,516
Well, this will help you if you're going to take erection medicine.

250
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:58,576
Make sure you trust the source.

251
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,456
Don't eat anything generic.

252
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:05,816
Make sure your digital doctor knows what he's doing giving blue shoe test of it.

253
00:14:05,836 --> 00:14:08,316
So like it works if you're alone too.

254
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:13,976
So so my boner is like two feet because I'm a big dog.

255
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:17,836
My fuzzy boner.

256
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:20,996
Try the biggest lipstick you ever see.

257
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:22,916
I guess it's not fuzzy because it was a dog.

258
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:23,956
It's the yeah.

259
00:14:23,956 --> 00:14:24,236
All right.

260
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:25,316
You get it.

261
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:27,676
So what's it puts Edwin to shame?

262
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:28,096
Sorry.

263
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:32,836
And Edwin, by the way, has a large penis and I'm not saying that to be funny.

264
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:33,656
It happened.

265
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:35,576
It came out once and we were shocked.

266
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:36,096
Whoa.

267
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:37,416
He is a tiny dog.

268
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:45,756
I we were like, oh my God, like it was shocking for him to be like a 15 pound dog.

269
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,236
Did you trip on it?

270
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,796
That's how you found out wasn't out that long.

271
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:50,316
He trip.

272
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:51,856
It just it did.

273
00:14:51,976 --> 00:15:00,416
It was like a horror movie that when it emerged anyway, so sorry to trash up the podcast with this talk back to false dogs.

274
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:07,616
So Jack, Jack Kyle real quick is the guy who created McGruff and he just died two years ago or a year and a half ago.

275
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:16,576
And he was like in his 90s and I he had his obituary in the New York Times and I'm looking through some of it and he

276
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:19,276
was talking about McGruff because he loved McGruff.

277
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:24,316
He was an advertising guy and he felt this was a good fit character and would teach kids.

278
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,296
And he really believed in it.

279
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:31,576
Major figure at the ad agency is like one of the top people at this gigantic ad agency.

280
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:37,736
And then like as this ends up with his whole other career, it's kind of like six years later.

281
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,996
He does an album, which is also because McGruff debuts in 1980.

282
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:41,976
Oh that long ago.

283
00:15:41,976 --> 00:15:43,596
Then he does six years later.

284
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:50,156
He's like time to make an album, which also when we do the McGruff voice, we're doing a more fully for McGruff because on the album,

285
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:51,796
you'll hear his voice.

286
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:57,116
You know, it's a lot like Steven Tyler doing dream on, you know, he doesn't quite sound like the Steven Tyler from Aerosmith.

287
00:15:57,316 --> 00:16:03,216
You'll recognize later dream on his voice is not as scratchy, not as doesn't have the years on it.

288
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,796
So you'll hear McGruff smart kids.

289
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:07,576
He's still kind of talking like this versus like this.

290
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:09,536
Do we even know that it's him?

291
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:10,236
We don't.

292
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:15,336
I think this article leads me to believe he never didn't do the voice.

293
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:15,896
Wow.

294
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:25,436
So I as far as I know, I McGruff not originally though used as an anti-drug campaigns, but like from what I was reading,

295
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:28,296
he was originally like lock your doors.

296
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:30,336
Yes, your lights on to deter burglars.

297
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,596
Well, there's a I don't have a cute up.

298
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:40,076
There's a very famous very famous commercial or PSA where he's talking about like fake movers stealing stuff from people's houses.

299
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:41,296
Great.

300
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:46,196
Where it's like look, there's a Johnson's they're moving except they're not.

301
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:52,456
Make sure, you know, if you're like there's like a fake like, I don't know if that was a real thing in the 70s or the 80s

302
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:56,636
where people would fake bring fake movers and then loot someone's house.

303
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:03,476
If a cop shows up at your door before you go on a trip to Paris, make sure that he's not actually a crook.

304
00:17:03,476 --> 00:17:07,876
Check to make sure he doesn't have a silver tooth that shines when he smiles at you.

305
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:14,936
If you're in a courtroom and the flag has golden fringe on it, the validity of the judge is in question.

306
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,796
So John Burt's society.

307
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:21,796
There's too much.

308
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:22,476
All right.

309
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:26,276
Let me I will now I had this cute up and then I was thinking I won't play it, but I will play this.

310
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,416
So, oh wait, no, no, I'm getting ahead of myself.

311
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:29,156
So Mr.

312
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:31,376
Kyle said about McGruff, I just like this quote.

313
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:36,716
He wasn't vicious not tremendously smart maybe but he had but he was no wimp either.

314
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:39,956
He was a father figure or possibly an uncle figure.

315
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:46,576
Just an uncle in a trench coat looking out for just a dog uncle.

316
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:54,956
So he a couple years ago, maybe or maybe a year ago, we were looking through McGruff stuff.

317
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:55,496
I don't know.

318
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:57,756
Maybe it's after the smart kids album, whatever the timeline.

319
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:00,476
He was doing this till he died.

320
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:05,056
Like he was doing McGruff and we found this commercial 30 seconds long.

321
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,336
That is hilarious.

322
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,956
It looks like it was shot on a phone.

323
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:13,776
Maybe I don't know who paid for this, but it's on McGruff's official YouTube channel.

324
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:15,236
It's kind of a latter day.

325
00:18:15,536 --> 00:18:18,416
It's not it's January 18th, 2017.

326
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:22,176
Wow, because McGruff has certainly like been now licensed for like Geico commercials.

327
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:26,096
And I think the estate or whatever just like he can think of we paid for McGruff.

328
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:27,456
We could get him.

329
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:30,356
I think come in here and be a guest on the podcast.

330
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:31,336
Yeah, I think so.

331
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:34,216
I think we would have to voice him maybe but like not about it.

332
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:36,736
He's just going to like I want to talk about the teacups.

333
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:37,776
Yeah.

334
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,536
My favorite attraction.

335
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:40,936
I get a kick out of them.

336
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,016
So real quick here.

337
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:45,056
I'm going to play this commercial because it's so funny.

338
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:59,216
When you're saving those once in a lifetime memories, why try to save a few

339
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:04,616
bucks on a counterfeit battery because unlike us you can't just rewind and start over.

340
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:08,536
Genuine batteries are a safer option and you can count on their performance.

341
00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:10,876
So you won't miss those special moments.

342
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:11,756
Get real.

343
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:12,816
Protect yourself.

344
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:14,576
Buy from legitimate sources.

345
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:20,156
And that's obviously his voice because he sounds like he's dying.

346
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:21,116
It's the real.

347
00:19:21,396 --> 00:19:22,636
It was in his 90s.

348
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,396
Legitimate sources.

349
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:26,396
Battery.

350
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:27,976
Like who paid for that?

351
00:19:27,976 --> 00:19:30,996
He does sound like a real like on the way out dog.

352
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:31,356
Yeah.

353
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:35,396
So we were like, oh my God, that's like his last that one of his last performances is

354
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:35,696
McGruff.

355
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,176
So he was still doing it.

356
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:38,976
What a micro issue.

357
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,556
I know batteries.

358
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:41,916
We were like, what is that?

359
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:42,996
What is that?

360
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:48,556
I have to say I was recently at a 99 cent store and just without looking grabbed like

361
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:49,996
a four pack of double A's.

362
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:50,936
Oh you're part of the problem.

363
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:57,656
And I it lasted a set of double A batteries last about a month and I was like, what the

364
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,136
hell like an electric toothbrush?

365
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:00,516
And I was like, what the fuck happened?

366
00:20:00,516 --> 00:20:04,436
And I looked and I was like, wait, why did these not say alkaline?

367
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,276
Why did he say like aluminum?

368
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:09,856
I I was like, what the fuck are these non alkaline batteries?

369
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:14,596
Because I just remember any game boys or game gears growing up.

370
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:19,636
They're like only alkaline batteries and we're like, where would you find non alkaline?

371
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:24,996
And then every now and then you do see double or triple A non alkaline batteries and

372
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,896
Street ruffians who sell them to you in the back alley.

373
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,156
Don't get there.

374
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:33,316
Make sure it's a copper top, not a bronze top.

375
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:36,876
Counterfeit batteries were brand.

376
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:40,236
They were Panasonic branded like shit batteries.

377
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,936
That's the weird thing.

378
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:45,856
Also sometimes the 99 cent store they're like close to expiring as well.

379
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:46,216
Yeah.

380
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:51,296
So that that also kicks you in the ass, which is funny because it is always recognized.

381
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,636
It's like Sony Sony Maxwell.

382
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:57,576
Like it's but then you're like, wait, when have I ever had Sony batteries?

383
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:59,896
Unless it came with the TV, you know?

384
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:00,536
Oh, yeah, they are.

385
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:03,096
Yes, that's a name you trust, but not for batteries.

386
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:03,756
Yeah, right.

387
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:08,176
It's yeah, the 99 cents or two, like you have to like vitamins will be like three

388
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:10,316
months away from expiring or something.

389
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:12,056
So you gotta watch out.

390
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,156
You know, don't need expired vitamins.

391
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:20,656
It's it's good for like the limited edition cereals where it's like orange

392
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:23,276
creamsicle Golden Grahams or something.

393
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:25,936
So many I got something.

394
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:27,916
Where am I going to find that?

395
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,676
I know they're not going to be around forever.

396
00:21:29,676 --> 00:21:32,296
I mean, you don't orange creamsicle Golden.

397
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:33,276
Is that what I got?

398
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,136
Didn't I buy something like that up in Santa?

399
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:41,916
We were at Santa Barbara and I was buying peanut M&Ms, but I found some crazy

400
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,136
Captain Crunch or something.

401
00:21:43,156 --> 00:21:45,236
You found a weird category and you did buy it.

402
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,056
I did buy it.

403
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,816
Anyway, we have we are 20 minutes in.

404
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:51,956
We have to we have 45 minutes worth of music to play.

405
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:55,236
We don't need to play the full.

406
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:58,456
We won't, but I just want to make sure we'll see.

407
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:00,016
We'll see if we get to all of it.

408
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,756
Amount, but yeah, for sure.

409
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:04,836
Because also the problem with Smart Kids 2 is like I'm like, okay, what tracks can

410
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:07,756
we skip and then I keep playing each track and I go, we can't skip that.

411
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:08,636
We can't skip that.

412
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:09,556
We can't skip that.

413
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:10,036
All right.

414
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:13,576
So McGruff's Smart Kids 1986.

415
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:18,976
It starts with a song that a lot of people might know because this was used in

416
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:23,776
the commercials and the PSA's and there's a famous very famous commercial of McGruff

417
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:29,316
playing cartoon McGruff playing a piano on someone's lawn, which is this song.

418
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:32,136
So I'm asserting the very famous.

419
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:32,516
Very.

420
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:34,276
I don't think I know any of these.

421
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:37,676
Did you have the McGruff commercial out here though, where he would say Scruff

422
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:39,876
McGruff, Chicago, Illinois, 606-52.

423
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:41,796
And take a bite out of a crowd.

424
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:43,896
It sounds that that's like a meter that's familiar.

425
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:48,916
He got Scruff from McGruff, Chicago, Illinois, 606-52.

426
00:22:49,216 --> 00:22:49,656
Wow.

427
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:51,116
I certainly don't know what that was.

428
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:54,336
That's that's like a real 588-2300 Empire.

429
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:58,656
Someone pointed out online that is just a city and a zip code.

430
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:01,316
Like there's no PO box or address or anything.

431
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:02,916
You're just sending it to a city.

432
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,256
But like they.

433
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:04,636
All right.

434
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,716
I'll play this for you, Scott.

435
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:06,796
See if you recognize this.

436
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:08,396
I know we don't have time for this, but whatever.

437
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:11,556
Here's my nephew Scruff about to run into trouble again.

438
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:12,396
Hey, Bobo.

439
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:13,616
Where's your video game?

440
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:14,296
In here.

441
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,616
Look at this.

442
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:16,676
Oh, again.

443
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:18,256
Pull the gun out.

444
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:19,816
You'll see.

445
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:21,816
But that's not the only problem he has.

446
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:23,156
I haven't thought about Scruff in a while.

447
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:23,916
Hey, here's a shortcut.

448
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:25,576
Not down there, Square.

449
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:26,776
I don't think it's safe.

450
00:23:26,956 --> 00:23:27,436
Come on.

451
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:28,476
The coast is clear.

452
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:30,376
I'm not taking a chance, Lance.

453
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:32,776
Scruff is a fucking idiot.

454
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:34,736
Hello, dogface.

455
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:36,336
That's his nephew, though.

456
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:38,916
So he wasn't actually raising him.

457
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:40,156
What are you going to do now?

458
00:23:40,276 --> 00:23:40,976
I don't know.

459
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:41,436
Why he's an uncle?

460
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:42,396
I hope this is sad.

461
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:43,636
I've been doing activity book more.

462
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:44,896
I've never had kids of my own.

463
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:48,816
You'll find out what you can do about bullies, drugs, and guns.

464
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:50,356
Am I the hero again?

465
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:51,436
You'll see.

466
00:23:51,656 --> 00:23:53,076
And you'll see lots of games.

467
00:23:53,196 --> 00:23:53,616
Cool.

468
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:56,256
For your free copy of my new comic activity book,

469
00:23:56,376 --> 00:24:00,416
Bright Scruff McGruff, Chicago, Illinois, 60652.

470
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:03,556
I don't know what it is.

471
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:04,876
60652.

472
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:06,996
See, the singing voice came out there.

473
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:10,736
He hadn't released an album in seven years, but he still had it.

474
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:11,736
He had the hankering.

475
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:13,276
So a couple of things with that one.

476
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:17,196
I never realized that if you wrote to that, you were writing to the nephew.

477
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:19,896
That you weren't writing to McGruff.

478
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:22,296
You were writing to Scruff McGruff, the nephew.

479
00:24:22,576 --> 00:24:27,316
The other thing to reiterate from earlier, that is a fully 2D animated

480
00:24:27,316 --> 00:24:32,856
advertisement and not like pre-flash, pre when you could just grind out.

481
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:33,496
There was money.

482
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:34,576
There was money.

483
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:35,256
Money was coming in.

484
00:24:35,296 --> 00:24:36,716
I think money from the ad council.

485
00:24:37,136 --> 00:24:39,176
Yeah, the government was paying for a lot of them.

486
00:24:39,536 --> 00:24:42,076
I wonder if the government funded his sessions.

487
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:46,516
Well, and I think the networks and affiliates would donate the airtime.

488
00:24:46,516 --> 00:24:51,076
They could write off using those ads and filling slots when they needed to.

489
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:55,356
So this thing went for six months like Brian Wilson doing good vibrations.

490
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:57,436
Studio after studio.

491
00:24:57,736 --> 00:24:58,796
We got to get it right.

492
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:01,376
We got a recording Tahiti.

493
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:03,836
The vibe ain't right.

494
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:08,456
The salty air is going to help get molecules out of the saxophone.

495
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:09,816
Makes sense.

496
00:25:10,396 --> 00:25:11,416
Those are my mind.

497
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:13,516
It's the government's time.

498
00:25:13,556 --> 00:25:14,336
Who cares?

499
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:17,736
Uncle Sam is paying for rock and roll.

500
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:19,356
All right, we got to do this.

501
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:19,936
All right.

502
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:23,736
McGruff Smart Kids 1986 starts with a song that we all know.

503
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:25,016
Famous song.

504
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:26,836
Very, very famous.

505
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:29,356
Winners don't use.

506
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:33,956
McGruff here.

507
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:38,176
I want you to learn a song that tells people to say no to drugs.

508
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:42,136
Users are losers and losers are users.

509
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:43,636
So don't use drugs.

510
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,536
Don't use drugs.

511
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:48,756
Winners don't use and users don't win.

512
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,476
So don't use drugs.

513
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:51,956
Don't use drugs.

514
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:52,316
All right.

515
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:54,376
That's the like that's all we need from that one.

516
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:59,536
What is somebody pointed out on a YouTube comment calling a drug user a loser?

517
00:25:59,816 --> 00:26:02,016
Perhaps not great for their self-esteem.

518
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:06,396
May it is like it's a problem and you know, it's hard to overcome it.

519
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:08,236
Kind of a misunderstanding of addiction.

520
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:08,796
Yeah.

521
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:09,836
Sober up loser.

522
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:14,136
That song very much in the same family as Mr.

523
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:19,036
Belvedere and the and the flasic pickle song.

524
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:22,336
Oh, this is a close relative of Leon Redbone.

525
00:26:22,516 --> 00:26:22,676
Right.

526
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:22,916
Yeah.

527
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:32,076
I think it's general ragtime piano and kind of on my what's like that vibe like when

528
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:34,476
I have blossom in my head blocking the Mr.

529
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:35,076
Belvedere.

530
00:26:38,276 --> 00:26:38,676
Yeah.

531
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:41,536
Why can't I fake that Mr.

532
00:26:41,636 --> 00:26:41,896
Belvedere?

533
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:43,856
What a failure on my I can't think of it either.

534
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:46,736
I don't know if I've ever seen a single episode.

535
00:26:48,036 --> 00:26:49,756
Never met before.

536
00:26:51,096 --> 00:26:55,836
Leon Redbone clearly inspiration for you.

537
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:59,316
When you told me the songs were good on this album and I think I think you may have

538
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:03,016
hinted like what type of songs were but I was maybe thinking more along those lines.

539
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:04,676
So yeah, this song is about that.

540
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:05,436
I don't care about that.

541
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:06,356
I don't care about it either.

542
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,636
It's fine, but I don't care.

543
00:27:07,856 --> 00:27:11,276
It doesn't I wouldn't we wouldn't be doing this episode of all the songs were in that

544
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:11,496
vein.

545
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:11,936
Absolutely.

546
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:12,256
Yeah.

547
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:17,656
So right off the gate, there's a song called No, No, No.

548
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:18,276
Okay.

549
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:23,136
And does that prevent there from being a later song called Just Say No?

550
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:26,336
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

551
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:27,056
All right.

552
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:27,416
Here we go.

553
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:28,576
This is called No, No, No.

554
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,680
You hear it across the nation, just say no.

555
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:51,772
Just say no.

556
00:27:57,848 --> 00:27:58,948
I'm gonna say no.

557
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,540
Yes.

558
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,500
And then a major key.

559
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,100
You've got some courage to show.

560
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:27,548
Like this is like, I can't think of better to hold steady fist pumping like we're all gonna do it

561
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:32,248
We're gonna make something of ourselves. I think that that oh

562
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:32,848
That's like

563
00:28:32,848 --> 00:28:40,208
You can see the big Coachella fields

564
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:47,248
Course of kids out to do it like yes

565
00:28:53,628 --> 00:28:54,148
I

566
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:58,828
Halfway through a set or the end of a set that suddenly a children's choir comes out like

567
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:06,208
What do you like with a kid's choir I would do one more chorus no turn this one off

568
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:09,628
You've got some courage to show

569
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:16,368
And let yourself respect

570
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,308
You've got some courage to show

571
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:31,748
And let yourself respect bro

572
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:44,228
It's just it's it's great it's already great right out the gate it's great that's the state stadium rock yeah stadium rock he I

573
00:29:44,228 --> 00:29:49,328
Want to know so much about this like did he did he think it's like kind of fun that he's singing

574
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:52,648
He's not a great singer, but that's sort of the charm of it because I think that's the great

575
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:57,048
I think it's kind of fun that he's like a bad singer and he's doing a voice of a dog

576
00:29:57,048 --> 00:30:01,268
It seems like he's singing and trying his best at singing and then every 20 seconds

577
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:06,608
He remembers like oh, I gotta still be McGruff. I'll gravel it a little for this word. Yeah

578
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:11,908
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure and he wasn't he was still a man of in his 40s or 50s

579
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:17,548
40s I think at this time an odd person to be doing music that like I was I've been trying to think of

580
00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:23,968
For a lot of it I think that one has sort of a early Madonna thing yes

581
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:30,428
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah before it brightens up when it's a little minor sad at the beginning it kind of reminds me of Papa

582
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:35,568
Don't preach yeah, yeah, and then the chorus is also sort of in a Madonna thing, but with this

583
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:40,368
Yeah, this is a guy. This is a 50 year old man doing like 80s teen pop

584
00:30:40,368 --> 00:30:46,488
It is probably then closer to Papa only once what's best for you the Danny I yellow

585
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:50,388
Oh

586
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:57,328
That was lost in my brain, I'm so glad you brought it yeah Papa just wants what's best for you

587
00:30:57,328 --> 00:31:04,368
because Danny I yellow is in the music video, but then was like upset by how it turned out and felt like he'd betrayed his

588
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:10,608
Okay, his his Catholic Christian values or whatever so he needed to like read address, right?

589
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:16,568
Yeah, and you know guys like that are the best Papa's you know they're the most warm-giving

590
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:24,468
Emotionally intelligent sort of yeah, what's the that's like the it's a similar character to Andrew Dice Clay in

591
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:25,468
Star is born

592
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:30,968
Yeah, that kind of Papa. Oh that he actually was very supportive

593
00:31:30,968 --> 00:31:35,528
I thought but a little miscott but like he's around all these jackass

594
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:37,948
Buddies

595
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:43,548
By the way I said earlier like I like when the when I said the children's choir in this case

596
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:47,068
I was thinking because it's clearly supposed to sound like kids thinking singing

597
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:52,968
You know larger picture. I like when musicians bring out the local

598
00:31:52,968 --> 00:31:57,548
Choir the local orchestra like cuz that's a big deal for like the local thief

599
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:02,968
But like a huge deal for them kind of happened with the Rolling Stones at old chela

600
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,968
Like we got that you can't always get what you want with a choir

601
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:09,188
Yeah, I'm questioning kids choir specifically

602
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:13,708
The big thing holding me back from really liking this album too much kids

603
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:17,668
Oh, okay kids, and I'm way more in I don't think I realize that

604
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:23,448
Yeah, when we if it was McGruff performing, and I do think you'd have to have a kids choir

605
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:29,788
I think that's probably a part of it when the idea that I just had in my head when we perform this album front to back somewhere

606
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:36,408
We can do it with a different like adult choir or maybe with no choir at all. We'll see well, but depends

607
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:40,148
But we need to do it with the singer of fun guesting

608
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:45,588
Soaring Nate Ruess. Yeah, well, there'll be a whole set of guest stars doing each song

609
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,668
It'll be a sort of tribute album with a lot of different singers

610
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:52,688
Alright, let's get to the next song

611
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:53,528
marijuana

612
00:32:53,528 --> 00:33:03,328
This is the real I don't want to downplay side two, but this is one of those records were like oh my god

613
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:08,788
This is all killer no, this side a is all hits side is all hits

614
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:12,688
But then side B there's a lot of sleepers on there and there's a lot of good stuff

615
00:33:12,688 --> 00:33:16,088
Yeah, but yeah, you're right side a is just like oh, it's like

616
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:20,088
I'm trying to think of what's just a great, you know

617
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:25,128
I was gonna say enema of the state and that's not a good example exactly

618
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,828
Here we go marijuana

619
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:37,808
Marijuana don't try it at all

620
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:47,468
It's like beating your head on a wall pan am I mean it's not awkward we want to say Jason's man though

621
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:57,568
Cause it's doing you know good at all Jason

622
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:04,648
You can lose

623
00:34:04,648 --> 00:34:15,868
Cause your life is a gift don't abuse it

624
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:17,008
If you gamble with life

625
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,620
Soaring.

626
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,780
Yeah, very, the chorus, great chorus.

627
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,080
Oh.

628
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,160
Let it rip.

629
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,720
I imagine eating McGruff soloing.

630
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,800
Yeah, it's always if it's a sax or guitar.

631
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,400
I don't tie it at all.

632
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,940
Yeah.

633
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,220
It's a fender, it's great, right?

634
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,220
Just ripping a solo.

635
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,780
I picked it up late, but I can play with the greats.

636
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,540
Gotta use, Guy didn't know what he had on his hands.

637
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,340
That one, that to me gives me a little shade

638
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,720
of like Bon Jovi's Runaway.

639
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,320
Yes.

640
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,220
Very like fast.

641
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,440
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

642
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,740
There's a, the next one is a Bon Jovi,

643
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,820
the next one is my thing, my favorite on the whole album

644
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,940
and it also reminds me of like Living on a Prayer.

645
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,500
The bass line is a very Living on a Prayer style bass line.

646
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,000
It's all calling to mind, but not in a rip-offy way.

647
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,160
None of them are clear rip-offs of anything.

648
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:17,680
Right.

649
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,980
They're all just, I don't know,

650
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,900
he's like exploring influences.

651
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,220
Yeah, he's just, he's taking what any artist does

652
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,080
and just I'll take all his inspiration

653
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,460
and make it into something new.

654
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,100
Because if I try to do a Bon Jovi song,

655
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,460
it's not gonna sound like them

656
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,640
because it's run through the filter of McGruff.

657
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,500
Bring my own thing, do it.

658
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,440
Marijuana though is the only, is the one specifically

659
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,700
because they were still pushing the gateway drug thing

660
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,060
with marijuana, so that's, Jason, I just wanna explain that.

661
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,620
You know, you feel that, so don't get so mad at McGruff

662
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,220
is what I'm saying.

663
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,620
Well.

664
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,920
He was, he had the best of intentions is what I mean.

665
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,520
He's just worried you're gonna move on to inhalants

666
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,760
or cocaine and crack.

667
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,280
Right. Or worse, alcohol.

668
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,260
Uh-oh, he ran out of marijuana.

669
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,520
Guess he's gotta go to his backup crack.

670
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,560
Well, as Scott, you might not have known,

671
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,860
Scott was just listing the names

672
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,500
of the next few songs on the album.

673
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,880
Yes, that's where we're headed.

674
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,620
Yep. So this is my,

675
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,680
I think my favorite one.

676
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,080
It's just class A to B,

677
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,080
like all the class substances.

678
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,280
Literally ending with alcohol.

679
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,560
This one may have slipped to number two,

680
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,880
but for a while this was by far number one for me

681
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,920
on the album, inhalants.

682
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,720
Song is called inhalants.

683
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,380
We have to play most of it.

684
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,920
Let's just get right to it.

685
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,300
Great.

686
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,920
Wait, wait, shit.

687
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,640
I'm queuing up.

688
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,360
I don't wanna scramble your brain.

689
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,460
Here we go.

690
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,960
Nevermind, take two.

691
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,780
So this is like living out of prayer

692
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,860
or Billie Jean or something, that bass line.

693
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,800
A little bit of Rockwell.

694
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:48,620
Yeah.

695
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,000
But like, I think you could see if you go back,

696
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,680
you could, it could work for Billie Jean

697
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,600
or it could work for like.

698
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:02,892
Donnie used to work on the Donnie, yes.

699
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:05,052
Yeah, the union's been a strike.

700
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:09,232
It's so true, there's danger in inhalants.

701
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:16,952
They can break you in two, so never sniff inhalants.

702
00:37:19,012 --> 00:37:21,272
Breathing them is really no thrill.

703
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,292
Don't you know inhalants really can kill?

704
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,472
Don't do inhalants.

705
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:28,552
You'll be suffering pain.

706
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:30,092
Don't do inhalants.

707
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:32,252
They will damage your brain.

708
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:33,892
Don't do inhalants.

709
00:37:34,412 --> 00:37:36,052
Cause it's really insane.

710
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:38,752
More can't stay now.

711
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:40,552
Cause inhalants kill.

712
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:46,532
Learn a lesson so true.

713
00:37:47,852 --> 00:37:49,692
There's danger in inhalants.

714
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:56,892
They can break you in two, so never sniff inhalants.

715
00:37:59,232 --> 00:38:01,092
They can break you in two.

716
00:38:01,892 --> 00:38:04,732
Don't you know inhalants really can kill?

717
00:38:05,252 --> 00:38:06,772
Don't do inhalants.

718
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,852
You'll be suffering pain.

719
00:38:08,892 --> 00:38:10,512
Don't do inhalants.

720
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:12,492
They will damage your brain.

721
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:14,132
Don't do inhalants.

722
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:16,232
Cause it's really insane.

723
00:38:17,012 --> 00:38:18,952
More can't stay now.

724
00:38:19,152 --> 00:38:21,312
Cause inhalants eat ill.

725
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,192
Oh, he talks, he talks here too.

726
00:38:24,612 --> 00:38:26,872
Just because something is safe to use one way

727
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:29,292
doesn't mean it's safe to use another way.

728
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:34,512
Cleaners, sprays, and other household chemicals can become deadly poisons when inhaled.

729
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,932
Don't ever try it. Just say no to inhalants.

730
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:41,732
Most of the songs have spoken words.

731
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:43,352
No inhalants really can kill.

732
00:38:43,352 --> 00:38:46,812
So it's like a Springsteen rap or like you know in the middle of the song.

733
00:38:47,352 --> 00:38:47,792
Exactly.

734
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:49,692
Something like that.

735
00:38:52,152 --> 00:38:55,812
So the inhalants one was, this is one you've definitely,

736
00:38:56,012 --> 00:38:59,532
we were driving somewhere and you pulled up the YouTube video.

737
00:38:59,772 --> 00:39:03,532
I think I also kind of have a memory of you sitting on your couch here at one point.

738
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:07,412
You picked up like you were noodling on a guitar or a keyboard and you were like,

739
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,352
that's a bass line to inhalants.

740
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:13,212
Oh well I was playing you the bass line and inhalants earlier today on my guitar.

741
00:39:13,632 --> 00:39:16,952
But before I learned it on the keyboard as well.

742
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:20,952
I also had a very Jason thought as I was listening to that which is,

743
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:25,952
well I don't think I've ever done inhalants unless I inadvertently did a whip it

744
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,452
while shooting whipped cream into my mouth.

745
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:35,492
Accidental inhalants are still inhalants.

746
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:39,752
There's so many cans of it around the holiday season with all the pies around.

747
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:43,312
Whipped cream is great and it's fine to enjoy on its own.

748
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:45,812
But make sure you don't do it right out of the can.

749
00:39:45,812 --> 00:39:48,932
You may be doing it into a spoon and then consume it that way.

750
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:52,392
You're leaving germs behind for anybody else using it.

751
00:39:52,472 --> 00:39:53,952
Well, keep it far enough away.

752
00:39:54,012 --> 00:39:56,212
Make sure the whipped cream can is clean.

753
00:39:56,492 --> 00:39:59,732
Unless of course you're using a solo can of whipped cream,

754
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:02,192
which in Jason's case I imagine is true.

755
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:05,992
Maybe stick to Cool Whip.

756
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:12,312
No long term side effects from that thing mostly made of excess tire rubber.

757
00:40:12,512 --> 00:40:14,552
Unless you hit your teeth with a spoon.

758
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:19,232
Oh my gruff. We should get rights to my gruff.

759
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:20,792
Inhalants is a real jam.

760
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:23,912
And also, but yeah, what a strange flow.

761
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:27,432
I think what we're finding is while we really like all of the songs,

762
00:40:27,452 --> 00:40:29,892
I think there is a way to order this and have it build

763
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:35,732
and have it be more of a the wall type situation that kind of tells a story

764
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:42,512
because we've now bounced from marijuana, pretty tame, to sprays, household cleaners.

765
00:40:42,512 --> 00:40:43,132
Yeah.

766
00:40:43,472 --> 00:40:47,132
And then we're going to get harder and then go way backwards.

767
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:48,652
Yes. Yeah.

768
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,012
Rubber cement.

769
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:58,872
Yeah. The next song is cocaine and crack.

770
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:04,152
Group together. Y'all have to share a song. Sorry.

771
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:07,292
Yeah. Sorry. But here we go.

772
00:41:09,672 --> 00:41:11,532
The happiest song ever.

773
00:41:17,032 --> 00:41:17,692
Crack.

774
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:21,192
That's what you see a lot.

775
00:41:22,072 --> 00:41:24,752
It's really the dress you do user.

776
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:26,312
Yeah. Right. Are you thinking?

777
00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:43,512
Come on.

778
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:49,572
This one, I get kind of like a manic Monday.

779
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:51,572
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

780
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:54,292
A little bit of the 60s by way of 80s. Yeah.

781
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:57,912
I'm not sure this one's a tougher genre to figure out, but I really like it.

782
00:41:57,912 --> 00:42:02,052
I feel like there's one or two moments where I was like, this almost sounds like an indie rock song.

783
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:07,432
Somebody pointed out, and I don't think it's wrong, that this whole thing sounds like an Ariel Pink album.

784
00:42:07,732 --> 00:42:10,352
Yeah. Oh, yeah. That little synth solo.

785
00:42:10,352 --> 00:42:11,592
This odd noodley.

786
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:13,932
Yeah. Like it's a lot of genres.

787
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:18,932
It's kind of a little lo-fi in its production, but like it's very kind of cool and groovy.

788
00:42:19,232 --> 00:42:24,252
And like if you slowed it all down 20%, it would sound exactly like Ariel Pink.

789
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:26,832
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll try that for the next McGruff.

790
00:42:27,072 --> 00:42:33,312
Do you think anyone working behind the scenes on this album was like, I got to hit a deadline on this.

791
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:36,352
I got to get some coke.

792
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:45,572
If McGruff was doing coke to finish the album, I mean, no one's written about McGruff's drug problem, but it's possible.

793
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:54,672
Well, and what there isn't is a song about LSD, also famously the source of many great 60s albums.

794
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:58,092
LSD is fine. It opens up your creativity.

795
00:42:59,312 --> 00:43:02,252
I just need some ludes to get through the day.

796
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:04,592
Mushrooms too. Good for mental health.

797
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:09,392
A doctor gave me one and a shaman gave me the other.

798
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:16,132
Because yeah, we go from crack and cocaine and crack to alcohol.

799
00:43:16,612 --> 00:43:22,772
Yeah. Okay. Well, before alcohol, can I also just say I think the funniest spoken word on the album is cocaine.

800
00:43:22,972 --> 00:43:24,332
Oh, sorry. Let me go back.

801
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:31,232
Because this one's a little bit less of like, so remember, there's a pretty specific directive.

802
00:43:34,692 --> 00:43:39,312
Cocaine, there's terrible trouble behind it.

803
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:40,292
Consent wallowing.

804
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:42,952
That's the whole quality of the video.

805
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:44,712
Making a mess of your mind.

806
00:43:44,712 --> 00:43:46,152
Also, very low-fi.

807
00:43:46,572 --> 00:43:46,912
Yes.

808
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:52,252
There is help available for people who have a problem with cocaine or crack addiction.

809
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:55,972
Have them call 1-800-COCAINE for advice.

810
00:43:56,352 --> 00:44:01,452
And if someone ever offers you crack or cocaine, be smart. Just say no.

811
00:44:02,832 --> 00:44:09,832
Because nobody's needed that crack and cocaine. There's terrible trouble behind it.

812
00:44:10,392 --> 00:44:13,292
And sooner or later you burn in your brain.

813
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:15,292
Make it a mess of your mind.

814
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:20,452
If we slow it down and it sounds cool, we should put that as a tag at the end of the episode.

815
00:44:20,652 --> 00:44:25,432
Just like, here's our fucking, here's our Pitchfork entry remix.

816
00:44:25,752 --> 00:44:30,092
So here's our vaporwave re-edit of cocaine and crack.

817
00:44:30,892 --> 00:44:33,512
But I like the, I love the phone number.

818
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:36,372
1-800-COCAINE.

819
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:41,032
That's not a number you call to get cocaine. Let's be clear about that.

820
00:44:41,252 --> 00:44:42,272
Oh man, really?

821
00:44:44,632 --> 00:44:50,132
I also, one thing I want to say, oddly, is that in a rare, very rare event,

822
00:44:50,492 --> 00:44:53,592
the YouTube comments on all of these videos are pretty funny.

823
00:44:54,252 --> 00:44:58,192
And mostly pointing out, boy, this would be great to listen to while blazed.

824
00:44:58,352 --> 00:45:04,792
But in this case, somebody says, so like imagine a kid going up to their dad and saying,

825
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:09,372
I think you have a problem with cocaine. You should call 1-800-COCAINE and get help.

826
00:45:09,612 --> 00:45:13,492
And they say that would be the child's last words.

827
00:45:13,492 --> 00:45:18,932
Life, oh, what the fuck did you say about me?

828
00:45:19,332 --> 00:45:24,192
Or the guy starts calling it because he's just like, my fucking kid lied. They're not bringing me cocaine.

829
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:27,872
We need to look into what that number was.

830
00:45:28,032 --> 00:45:31,032
Yeah, the full history of when it was that McGruff affiliated.

831
00:45:31,332 --> 00:45:32,472
Yeah, and why was it?

832
00:45:32,752 --> 00:45:34,252
It's me, waiting for a human operator.

833
00:45:35,352 --> 00:45:39,272
Or it was him and he just was fielding calls at his home as McGruff.

834
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:41,972
I've been there, pal. Hang in there.

835
00:45:43,512 --> 00:45:47,612
I'm a dog. I sniff whatever's in front of me. I didn't know what it was.

836
00:45:48,732 --> 00:45:52,652
But I got smart. Adults can get smart too.

837
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:54,352
I'll come over.

838
00:45:54,352 --> 00:46:00,372
I'll play you my album. I'll chill you out.

839
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,212
I got some new stuff I'm working on. Want to get your feedback?

840
00:46:04,332 --> 00:46:06,672
We've really been ripping some peace lines lately.

841
00:46:06,912 --> 00:46:09,232
And there's time we can look at my screenplay.

842
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,972
Did McGruff play all the instruments?

843
00:46:12,092 --> 00:46:12,852
I think so.

844
00:46:12,852 --> 00:46:13,532
Like Prince or something?

845
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:17,612
That's what I'm a man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's like, he's firing drummers left and right.

846
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:19,092
Fine, I'll just do it.

847
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:23,172
When Paul told Ringo to move during the making of Back in the USSR.

848
00:46:23,352 --> 00:46:26,472
Ringo also fired from this.

849
00:46:27,772 --> 00:46:30,232
Fuck you, Ringo.

850
00:46:30,512 --> 00:46:34,472
His resume looked good. I mean, the Beatles, what have you.

851
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:36,132
I've never heard of him before.

852
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:38,292
Didn't know what he was doing.

853
00:46:38,612 --> 00:46:43,232
Some British druggie. He was all messed up in the brain.

854
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:48,232
But he did give me a good idea for a song. A song with the word no in it a lot.

855
00:46:49,312 --> 00:46:52,532
No, no, no, no. I know you should have covered the no-no song.

856
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:54,512
That's a big missed opportunity.

857
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:56,912
Well, we'll make a McGruff cover of the no-no song.

858
00:46:57,492 --> 00:47:01,132
That's the most Mike Wheelhouse projects there could ever be.

859
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:02,432
That's my dream project.

860
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,672
But the most, maybe the most Scott Wheelhouse.

861
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:06,312
Other what?

862
00:47:06,872 --> 00:47:12,152
Other, although on the flip side, getting Ringo to cover a McGruff song, also a dream project.

863
00:47:12,172 --> 00:47:13,972
Either way, it's a two way street.

864
00:47:13,972 --> 00:47:19,032
But my, I think my personal wheelhouse is the song alcohol.

865
00:47:19,492 --> 00:47:20,612
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

866
00:47:20,732 --> 00:47:33,672
Because what we have here is a child mascot, an 80s nostalgia thing doing a song that is very clearly a Steely Dan homage.

867
00:47:34,112 --> 00:47:36,572
This is straight 100% Steely Dan.

868
00:47:36,852 --> 00:47:38,032
Yeah. Well, it's just.

869
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:38,732
Let's hear you.

870
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:40,172
I might.

871
00:47:40,452 --> 00:47:43,052
Let me just chill out here.

872
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:45,992
I mean, this is you got to get high to this.

873
00:47:45,992 --> 00:47:46,992
Yeah.

874
00:47:48,352 --> 00:47:51,252
Hey, open up your eyes.

875
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:54,392
You've got to see.

876
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:56,412
Guitar is right on.

877
00:47:56,612 --> 00:47:59,072
Alcohol fills your world with lies.

878
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:01,632
Listen to me.

879
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:02,992
Fills your world with lies.

880
00:48:03,572 --> 00:48:04,452
Don't be a go.

881
00:48:04,532 --> 00:48:06,972
It's no good when you're drinking.

882
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:08,412
Tell your friends now.

883
00:48:08,492 --> 00:48:10,652
It won't show you the way.

884
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:11,892
Try using your own.

885
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:14,772
Hey, you better start thinking.

886
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,592
Being straight is.

887
00:48:18,712 --> 00:48:21,292
It seems so very nice.

888
00:48:22,912 --> 00:48:25,032
But you best be looking twice.

889
00:48:25,272 --> 00:48:26,112
Coming up.

890
00:48:26,432 --> 00:48:28,732
Cause you will have to pay a price.

891
00:48:29,732 --> 00:48:32,352
You're going to lose.

892
00:48:33,092 --> 00:48:34,452
Someday.

893
00:48:35,772 --> 00:48:36,592
I just.

894
00:48:36,752 --> 00:48:37,632
I just.

895
00:48:37,632 --> 00:48:39,152
I embroidered.

896
00:48:39,152 --> 00:48:41,812
It's so good.

897
00:48:42,012 --> 00:48:42,572
Right on.

898
00:48:43,812 --> 00:48:45,612
Good is my point.

899
00:48:45,612 --> 00:48:46,532
It is good.

900
00:48:46,592 --> 00:48:47,552
It is really good.

901
00:48:47,712 --> 00:48:48,132
Yeah.

902
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:52,412
That's, I mean, that's more, that's the most appealing to my musical sensibility.

903
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:54,812
But here's the reason why I found out about the whole thing.

904
00:48:54,812 --> 00:48:59,052
Cause the podcast, as I showed it out previously, I found out about this from beyond

905
00:48:59,052 --> 00:49:00,092
Yacht Rock podcast.

906
00:49:00,212 --> 00:49:04,532
I'm very fond of that is a great way, a great source of chill,

907
00:49:04,532 --> 00:49:08,592
I'm a fan of the 70s, 80s, Yacht Rock, AOR, the kind of bullshit I like.

908
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:13,032
And they're incredible catalogers of this kind of music.

909
00:49:13,392 --> 00:49:17,412
And one day, and they, they do episodes called Yachter and Yacht where they decide

910
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,152
is the honor with a very mathematical scale.

911
00:49:20,272 --> 00:49:22,812
Does this qualify as Yacht Rock or does it in Yacht?

912
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:28,492
And the top, the hundred on a scale of zero to a hundred, a hundred being what a

913
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:30,832
fool believes the most Yacht song.

914
00:49:31,072 --> 00:49:34,392
So you're calibrating backwards off of what a fool believes.

915
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:40,192
And so this song, an over 50s Yacht and below 50s.

916
00:49:40,472 --> 00:49:44,972
Now this song I looked up, totally caught me by surprise in the episode.

917
00:49:45,252 --> 00:49:47,532
Like I still remember driving around and like, what the fuck is this?

918
00:49:47,712 --> 00:49:49,832
And I don't think they even said it at first.

919
00:49:49,952 --> 00:49:51,412
She's like, what is this weird song?

920
00:49:51,412 --> 00:49:52,952
And then, oh my God, it's McGruff.

921
00:49:53,272 --> 00:49:55,872
And they, then they ended up rating it Yacht.

922
00:49:55,872 --> 00:49:56,432
Oh yeah.

923
00:49:56,432 --> 00:50:02,892
And they adopted at 61 on a scale of a hundred, an exact tie with Lionel Richie's

924
00:50:02,892 --> 00:50:03,692
All Night Long.

925
00:50:03,952 --> 00:50:04,472
Wow.

926
00:50:04,512 --> 00:50:06,852
It's as much of a Yacht Rock song as All Night Long.

927
00:50:06,852 --> 00:50:07,232
Wow.

928
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:09,332
So that's, and they're critical.

929
00:50:09,412 --> 00:50:11,032
They'll throw shit down the drain.

930
00:50:11,032 --> 00:50:11,532
Right.

931
00:50:12,212 --> 00:50:17,972
So this is about as good of a tribunal as could have reviewed the thing.

932
00:50:17,992 --> 00:50:19,632
And yeah, it's, it's legit steely down.

933
00:50:19,972 --> 00:50:25,192
And culturally, like this was, so this is still 1986 album.

934
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:25,632
Oh yeah.

935
00:50:25,752 --> 00:50:28,132
We're halfway through McGruff's Smart Kids at this point.

936
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:34,912
So like, this is still an era when everyone is smoking in the office and people taking liquid lunches and stuff.

937
00:50:34,972 --> 00:50:40,112
Although I looked up cause I was like, well didn't there used to be something about hard liquor ads on TV?

938
00:50:40,492 --> 00:50:44,872
And I had to stop reading cause it seemed like a very interesting article I want to read later.

939
00:50:45,532 --> 00:50:47,672
But there are hard liquor.

940
00:50:47,752 --> 00:50:52,412
There was a ban on hard liquor ads until like 1994.

941
00:50:52,412 --> 00:50:55,672
And it was self-imposed by the liquor company.

942
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:58,772
Like you would, they wouldn't, they were not advertising on TV.

943
00:50:59,052 --> 00:51:03,652
And then Seagrams broke it in 1994 and then kind of opened up the floodgates.

944
00:51:03,692 --> 00:51:12,032
I think there's still a law that you cannot show like any alcohol ads until a certain hour of the day on broadcast at least.

945
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:12,992
I don't know about cable.

946
00:51:13,012 --> 00:51:15,712
Former Universal Studios owner Seagrams.

947
00:51:15,712 --> 00:51:16,412
Seagrams, yeah.

948
00:51:16,412 --> 00:51:16,652
Uh huh.

949
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:18,192
That ties back to theme parks.

950
00:51:18,292 --> 00:51:18,712
So.

951
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:19,152
Finally.

952
00:51:19,232 --> 00:51:19,812
Oh, thank God.

953
00:51:19,812 --> 00:51:22,892
I, I, if they, I don't know.

954
00:51:22,972 --> 00:51:30,172
Like, yeah, it's, it's always funny to see like the, the PSAs about alcohol and tobacco and then think about like,

955
00:51:30,752 --> 00:51:37,712
so, uh, the government has allocated money to urge caution and restraint on these things,

956
00:51:37,712 --> 00:51:44,092
but there's still a million politicians who get alcohol and cigarette lobbying money or like.

957
00:51:44,412 --> 00:51:44,432
Sure.

958
00:51:44,472 --> 00:51:47,932
Jewel lobbying money, like e-cigarette lobby money.

959
00:51:48,212 --> 00:51:50,052
It's all really backwards, isn't it?

960
00:51:50,172 --> 00:51:53,572
And cigarettes not really addressed too much on this album.

961
00:51:53,892 --> 00:51:54,512
Not nearly.

962
00:51:54,652 --> 00:51:57,832
I mean, they don't get there's, there's in a dedicated cigarette song at least.

963
00:51:57,992 --> 00:52:02,492
Well, cause all cops probably smoke it cause I've had my grumps smoked like a chimney.

964
00:52:02,572 --> 00:52:02,992
Oh yeah.

965
00:52:03,032 --> 00:52:04,172
You think I sound like this.

966
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:04,652
Yeah.

967
00:52:04,772 --> 00:52:13,072
The irony though of the chill ass, just that is a like literally last night I was drinking a glass of wine and listening to the song alcohol.

968
00:52:13,532 --> 00:52:14,472
If you can believe it.

969
00:52:14,472 --> 00:52:16,192
Let's give it a little more like just cause it's so.

970
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:16,992
I won't complain.

971
00:52:16,992 --> 00:52:19,492
I can like picture a live concert.

972
00:52:48,572 --> 00:52:48,292
Very nice.

973
00:52:49,692 --> 00:52:56,012
Ah, but you'd best be looking twice cause you will have to pay a price.

974
00:52:56,712 --> 00:52:59,432
You're going to lose.

975
00:52:59,952 --> 00:53:01,432
Shonday.

976
00:53:01,692 --> 00:53:04,412
It's no good when you're naked.

977
00:53:04,412 --> 00:53:05,192
What a reach for this man as a singer.

978
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:08,212
It won't show you the way.

979
00:53:08,212 --> 00:53:10,252
And he didn't go with the kids choir here.

980
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:12,692
Yeah, I think it's maybe what I like it the most.

981
00:53:13,532 --> 00:53:13,532


982
00:53:13,872 --> 00:53:14,712
Kids abandoned.

983
00:53:16,712 --> 00:53:15,172
I'm straight.

984
00:53:17,912 --> 00:53:22,552
Do do do do the good little bass part at the end.

985
00:53:22,552 --> 00:53:23,052
Yeah.

986
00:53:23,172 --> 00:53:26,332
I can picture a concert version of this.

987
00:53:26,472 --> 00:53:36,792
And in my head, when it's just instrumental and he's not singing, he is walking over to a stool with a scotch and soda on it to have a sip.

988
00:53:36,792 --> 00:53:45,312
And then he's like, I'm instantly imagining the live performance and someone like grooving along when they don't have to sing or play and like taking a drink.

989
00:53:45,512 --> 00:53:48,052
And then like, yeah, we're one sec quick sip.

990
00:53:48,232 --> 00:53:49,192
And then, all right, here we go.

991
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,172
But first three.

992
00:53:50,172 --> 00:53:50,712
Yeah.

993
00:53:51,032 --> 00:53:54,412
Alcoholics are worse than terrorists.

994
00:53:56,072 --> 00:53:58,372
Send them out of the country.

995
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:08,752
The this song feels like like there's a Rolling Stones Miss You, one of the best songs ever.

996
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:12,352
There's a lot version of it that's nine minutes and it's an extended jam version.

997
00:54:12,492 --> 00:54:20,472
This song could have six, seven, eight, nine more minutes of just free association like jazz guitar solo.

998
00:54:20,752 --> 00:54:23,912
Like it would be you would not get sick of you wouldn't get tired of it.

999
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:26,712
And that's how they that's how Steely Dan does it, man.

1000
00:54:27,252 --> 00:54:31,172
Yeah, yeah, you're getting some big spoken word entry.

1001
00:54:31,372 --> 00:54:33,352
Maybe this one is missing a spoken word entry.

1002
00:54:33,592 --> 00:54:33,752
Yes.

1003
00:54:33,752 --> 00:54:39,272
But I want it to be some weird like about a, you know, about like a trip he took to the islands.

1004
00:54:39,312 --> 00:54:41,352
I don't want it to be about some phone number.

1005
00:54:42,852 --> 00:54:45,772
And then I met a little Caribbean girl.

1006
00:54:46,772 --> 00:54:49,712
A couple of bleary nights later.

1007
00:54:51,552 --> 00:54:57,932
Well, when we do it live, we'll do a we'll insert a three minute like rap like in the middle there.

1008
00:54:57,932 --> 00:54:58,292
Sure.

1009
00:54:58,312 --> 00:55:03,352
Where he talks and then another three minutes of guitar soloing and then maybe a little more rap.

1010
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:04,052
Who knows?

1011
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:04,492
Yeah.

1012
00:55:04,612 --> 00:55:11,752
You know, the locals, they, you know, they like to say I'm one of them and I tell this story a lot.

1013
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:16,772
Second home for old McGriff.

1014
00:55:16,872 --> 00:55:17,692
Cabo.

1015
00:55:17,692 --> 00:55:19,612
They're in my mind right now.

1016
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:21,472
Cabo, wabo, canine.

1017
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:25,332
Like like Clooney talking about that fucking lake.

1018
00:55:26,712 --> 00:55:30,732
That lake they all that they shot Oceans 12 at by all their vacation homes.

1019
00:55:31,472 --> 00:55:36,772
Well, that's how McGruff is in kind of an oceans posse with Smokey the Bear.

1020
00:55:36,852 --> 00:55:37,652
Yeah, yeah.

1021
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:42,192
With the with the Vlasic Pickle mascot voiced by Leon Redbone.

1022
00:55:43,032 --> 00:55:45,132
I mean, he doesn't know who is it?

1023
00:55:45,132 --> 00:55:46,392
It's what's it's like.

1024
00:55:46,392 --> 00:55:49,272
Hey, who's who's the guy?

1025
00:55:50,052 --> 00:55:53,492
The voices narrates Frosty the Snowman, Jimmy Durrani.

1026
00:55:53,492 --> 00:55:57,492
Yeah, maybe maybe the Vlasic voice is not one of those people.

1027
00:55:57,652 --> 00:56:02,292
No, he's like a soft sweet kind of hmm.

1028
00:56:02,812 --> 00:56:06,332
While other things happen, I'll check into who voiced the Vlasic.

1029
00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:07,392
Do you even know who I'm talking about?

1030
00:56:07,612 --> 00:56:08,652
Oh, I 100 percent.

1031
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:10,992
He's like a stork or something.

1032
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,592
Yeah, he's a dignified stork.

1033
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:15,072
He's kind of on par with Mr.

1034
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,892
Peanut. They have a certain.

1035
00:56:16,892 --> 00:56:18,172
He's probably in the game.

1036
00:56:18,632 --> 00:56:18,772
Oh, yeah.

1037
00:56:19,132 --> 00:56:20,332
Dignity about them.

1038
00:56:20,632 --> 00:56:26,712
Though like Smokey and McGruff have causes and Vlasic Pickle is more of a.

1039
00:56:26,712 --> 00:56:28,152
His causes eat pickles.

1040
00:56:28,172 --> 00:56:30,072
Oh, don't buy counterfeit pickles.

1041
00:56:30,372 --> 00:56:34,732
I feel like sometimes he has that sort of like Ed Winnie voice and other times.

1042
00:56:34,972 --> 00:56:36,212
I do think he has different voices.

1043
00:56:36,252 --> 00:56:40,372
I feel like there's a CGI one of him now that's a little upsetting.

1044
00:56:40,912 --> 00:56:41,812
And Bill Hader is Mr.

1045
00:56:41,892 --> 00:56:42,552
Peanut now.

1046
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:43,252
Is there Ed?

1047
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:43,832
Yeah.

1048
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:48,232
He's a he's one of the only mascots that isn't Chris Parnell.

1049
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:48,932
Oh, yeah.

1050
00:56:48,932 --> 00:56:50,552
He's always all of them.

1051
00:56:50,752 --> 00:56:53,892
OK, the next song is called Just Say No.

1052
00:56:54,712 --> 00:57:00,472
And it's not as good as the other songs, but part one part of it is hilarious.

1053
00:57:00,472 --> 00:57:01,652
So we'll just play.

1054
00:57:12,132 --> 00:57:20,952
Maybe other kids are doing drugs and saying that you really ought to come along.

1055
00:57:21,112 --> 00:57:24,612
Maybe they don't know that we will be staying.

1056
00:57:25,412 --> 00:57:29,992
So, you know, you are saying this song.

1057
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:39,192
Just say no.

1058
00:57:50,636 --> 00:57:52,956
I mean, that is a good synth, too.

1059
00:57:53,556 --> 00:57:54,396
Good harmonies.

1060
00:57:54,536 --> 00:57:58,016
And never be afraid to walk away from trouble.

1061
00:57:58,856 --> 00:58:01,736
Taking drugs is really not the way.

1062
00:58:03,336 --> 00:58:06,496
And never hesitate, just get out on the double.

1063
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,736
This one's a little busy.

1064
00:58:07,816 --> 00:58:10,396
And you know exactly what to say.

1065
00:58:10,496 --> 00:58:12,876
He's lacking a primary to any bells and whistles.

1066
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:14,856
Just say no.

1067
00:58:15,276 --> 00:58:16,976
Just say no.

1068
00:58:18,456 --> 00:58:19,656
Just say no.

1069
00:58:21,856 --> 00:58:24,136
Just say no.

1070
00:58:25,016 --> 00:58:26,216
Just say no.

1071
00:58:26,376 --> 00:58:27,656
Just say no.

1072
00:58:27,656 --> 00:58:33,656
You could overlay this to like the music videos from the Disney parades when they're dancing around the hotel.

1073
00:58:33,656 --> 00:58:37,096
You know kids, your friends don't have any right to tell you what to do with your own body.

1074
00:58:37,216 --> 00:58:38,376
I can't hear you at all.

1075
00:58:39,796 --> 00:58:44,976
So if someone tries to get you to amuse drugs, don't waste time arguing with them.

1076
00:58:44,976 --> 00:58:47,496
You don't have to say why you don't take drugs.

1077
00:58:48,096 --> 00:58:49,556
Just say no.

1078
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:52,896
Just say no.

1079
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:53,916
No.

1080
00:58:55,336 --> 00:58:57,176
Just say no.

1081
00:58:57,536 --> 00:58:57,576
No.

1082
00:58:59,616 --> 00:59:01,196
Just say no.

1083
00:59:01,256 --> 00:59:01,636
No.

1084
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,316
Alright, alright.

1085
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:38,656
I think I'm just upset that so much real estate was devoted to maybe the lesser...

1086
00:59:38,656 --> 00:59:39,716
I screwed up.

1087
00:59:40,016 --> 00:59:41,596
We can go back and play alcohol again.

1088
00:59:41,616 --> 00:59:52,356
You can overlay that, what I was saying, you can overlay that onto like the music video sequences from Disney parades where they're dancing to Gloria Estefan at a new hotel they want to showcase.

1089
00:59:52,376 --> 00:59:55,136
There's a lot of, this is a real Miami Sand Machine vibe in here.

1090
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:59,616
I think the harmonies remind me a little bit of Huey Lewis and the News.

1091
00:59:59,616 --> 01:00:03,276
It's an 80s update of the 60s harmonies.

1092
01:00:03,576 --> 01:00:06,776
It's sort of a do you believe in love kind of vibe.

1093
01:00:07,116 --> 01:00:14,276
So more great, I think I'm doing a little like kind of wine flavor profile thing here with this album.

1094
01:00:14,576 --> 01:00:18,396
Oh yeah, I detect a little bit of Huey with Shades of Gloria.

1095
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:21,296
Like if you were DJing you would maybe play that after.

1096
01:00:21,556 --> 01:00:25,116
Yeah, I could see mixing that into...

1097
01:00:25,116 --> 01:00:51,636
I talked about this when I was on Jordan Jesse Goh, but how Jordan was asking me about how at my wedding, a real thing, my number one, one of the top moments of the wedding was when the DJ successfully segued into Erotic City out of the song Hot Drinks, the Wendy's instructional song.

1098
01:00:51,636 --> 01:00:52,736
Oh right, right, right, right.

1099
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:55,996
It's a very like oddly good, it's a really relative of the drop.

1100
01:00:55,996 --> 01:00:59,776
I just was sent this. I was just texted Hot Drinks a week ago.

1101
01:00:59,776 --> 01:01:00,836
Have we not talked about it before?

1102
01:01:00,836 --> 01:01:02,916
I don't think we have. I had never seen it, yeah.

1103
01:01:02,976 --> 01:01:03,656
Oh that's crazy.

1104
01:01:03,776 --> 01:01:04,336
Oh yeah.

1105
01:01:04,336 --> 01:01:19,316
This was a huge thing in the funnier dive basement and I, there was a DJ who was a very good DJ, bless his heart, he was nice and amenable to everything, but he like, I remember explaining, so there's a couple songs that we really, that must be played.

1106
01:01:19,316 --> 01:01:22,756
And one of them is a song from a Wendy's training video.

1107
01:01:22,756 --> 01:01:31,276
And he was like, okay, well, you know, keep in mind, I do weddings all the time and you know, you really want some crowd pleasers just to get, you know, grandma out of the dance floor.

1108
01:01:31,456 --> 01:01:39,276
And we were like, I know, but the kind of people who will be at this wedding and truly Hot Drinks tore the dance floor up.

1109
01:01:39,536 --> 01:01:47,116
It was like such a dream because we always begged at funnier dive, like holiday parties, like, will you just, will you put this in the mix?

1110
01:01:47,176 --> 01:01:50,896
We're all going to go insane if you put it on and they always, they just said no.

1111
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,616
And so that was our chant.

1112
01:01:52,736 --> 01:01:56,456
It was a fucking jam at the wedding and then he said did it in a prince perfectly.

1113
01:01:56,456 --> 01:01:57,016
That's great.

1114
01:01:57,016 --> 01:01:58,236
Incredible moment.

1115
01:01:58,456 --> 01:01:59,516
Thank you DJ Dennis.

1116
01:02:00,396 --> 01:02:04,376
The phrase, not particularly pleasing, the phrase Hot Drinks.

1117
01:02:04,896 --> 01:02:05,716
Have you heard the song?

1118
01:02:05,796 --> 01:02:06,536
Oh yeah, yeah.

1119
01:02:06,576 --> 01:02:08,496
I've seen all those Wendy's videos.

1120
01:02:08,496 --> 01:02:09,556
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1121
01:02:09,556 --> 01:02:12,476
Because it doesn't sound like a cold drink sounds refreshing.

1122
01:02:12,756 --> 01:02:13,376
A hot, you don't like.

1123
01:02:13,536 --> 01:02:14,016
Hot drink.

1124
01:02:14,156 --> 01:02:18,496
Hot isn't really the aspect that you like of a, unless it's like the winter.

1125
01:02:18,656 --> 01:02:26,216
In the context of those videos, they're talking about the, how you, as you, a Wendy's employee would present coffee and tea, right?

1126
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,216
But I think the fact.

1127
01:02:28,216 --> 01:02:29,836
The line to which you need to fill it up.

1128
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:34,996
Yeah, which is a real safety issue dealing with boiling hot drinks.

1129
01:02:35,036 --> 01:02:37,136
Came to a head not long after with McDonald's.

1130
01:02:37,136 --> 01:02:38,076
With McDonald's.

1131
01:02:38,876 --> 01:02:42,416
And it did turn out that McDonald's cooking that coffee too hot.

1132
01:02:42,536 --> 01:02:43,176
It was way too hot.

1133
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:43,936
Yeah, it's colder.

1134
01:02:44,356 --> 01:02:51,636
But I, I think the association with Wendy's where I think fast food restaurant, soft drink soda.

1135
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:54,076
And then the phrase Hot Drinks.

1136
01:02:54,156 --> 01:02:56,516
I'm just imagining like warm soda.

1137
01:02:57,076 --> 01:03:00,276
It's just the most unpleasant thing.

1138
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,436
Hot Coke really gets you going.

1139
01:03:03,476 --> 01:03:10,136
Although that is, I think there are old recipe books or like cure all things of like, you know, no, not feeling well.

1140
01:03:10,136 --> 01:03:11,336
Enjoy a hot doctor.

1141
01:03:11,556 --> 01:03:12,876
Serve hot Dr. Pepper.

1142
01:03:13,276 --> 01:03:14,636
Like I have heard that.

1143
01:03:14,636 --> 01:03:16,596
And that sounds like something you would have had as a child.

1144
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:17,816
Well, okay.

1145
01:03:18,856 --> 01:03:19,316
Of course.

1146
01:03:19,556 --> 01:03:21,576
All right. All right. Next we got, we got, we got a roll here.

1147
01:03:22,096 --> 01:03:25,716
Next song is Smart Kids, which I think is the song we were talking about before.

1148
01:03:25,716 --> 01:03:26,396
Yes. Yeah.

1149
01:03:26,396 --> 01:03:27,676
And this is an intro.

1150
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:29,536
All right. Here we go.

1151
01:03:29,576 --> 01:03:30,616
The song itself loses me a little bit.

1152
01:03:30,616 --> 01:03:31,256
Boy, it starts.

1153
01:03:31,256 --> 01:03:32,396
But the intro is strong.

1154
01:03:32,796 --> 01:03:32,896
Yeah.

1155
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,700
And the smart kids know that it's wrong, feeling good.

1156
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,860
Smart kids know they belong, moving up.

1157
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,280
Smart kids reaching a star, being sure.

1158
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,800
Smart kids know who they are.

1159
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:55,220
And it's true, truly it's true.

1160
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:59,340
You should never do drugs, you can just say no,

1161
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,860
because it's true, truly it's true.

1162
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:05,720
You don't need to do drugs, and the smart kids

1163
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,620
know that it's true, it's so much true.

1164
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,940
They know that it's true.

1165
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:10,540
Oh wait, wait a little more sex.

1166
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,840
Oh yeah, double sex, make her straight style.

1167
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:17,060
Double sex, make her straight style.

1168
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,120
That's a delight.

1169
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,440
That's fantastic.

1170
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,460
I haven't got nothing else there,

1171
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,200
I just like that intro a lot.

1172
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,740
The next song is my favorite.

1173
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:28,700
What are we up to?

1174
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,560
It's now replayed, we are now up to nine,

1175
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,340
track nine, the song Make Your Body Last.

1176
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,240
Yeah, I think this became your number one.

1177
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,380
I think it's become my number one.

1178
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,080
Yeah, yeah, and I know there's the part

1179
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,740
that you're into specifically, that I agree,

1180
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,500
I know you've hummed the melody.

1181
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,240
Yeah, I think I know what you're saying.

1182
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,080
It's just, I think it's some-

1183
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,340
It's like a little step down thing, it's very cool.

1184
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,580
Yeah, there's a lot of hooks,

1185
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:58,420
it's just like packed with hooks, I love a hooky song.

1186
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,260
The irony is sailed, we're just straight up,

1187
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,880
oh yeah, this is not this little part.

1188
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,320
Yeah, there's no irony there.

1189
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,320
All right, here we go, Make Your Body Last.

1190
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,420
It's not a song about sex, by the way.

1191
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:10,420
Thank God.

1192
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,980
It's about not doing drugs to make your body last.

1193
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,180
You need blue chew, blue chew.

1194
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,340
All right, here we go.

1195
01:05:27,704 --> 01:05:31,824
Our kids are making drugs and want you to play.

1196
01:05:32,264 --> 01:05:39,984
Today, if you care, we will care about what goes inside you, you'll say, no way.

1197
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:47,556
You've got to make it last as your body, treat it right.

1198
01:06:08,504 --> 01:06:12,844
Out of touch, and the sax feels very hollow,

1199
01:06:12,904 --> 01:06:17,604
and also the little cut up samples reminds me a lot of

1200
01:06:17,604 --> 01:06:20,924
like adult education or I don't know how much you know

1201
01:06:20,924 --> 01:06:21,624
the hollow notes.

1202
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:22,364
I don't know that one.

1203
01:06:22,884 --> 01:06:26,824
But the little, like they're starting to do that kind of

1204
01:06:26,824 --> 01:06:29,204
thing, like editing the vocal samples.

1205
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:31,424
Yeah, cause you can hear the cut, but that's a style

1206
01:06:31,424 --> 01:06:33,404
and it's kind of cool sounding like it's cut off

1207
01:06:33,404 --> 01:06:34,884
as opposed to just doing it.

1208
01:06:34,884 --> 01:06:35,264
Yeah.

1209
01:06:35,664 --> 01:06:40,404
The people making these songs and the parents of the

1210
01:06:40,404 --> 01:06:45,664
children listening to it, likely children had their youth

1211
01:06:45,664 --> 01:06:48,824
in the sixties and seventies and probably destroyed

1212
01:06:48,824 --> 01:06:52,684
their bodies and brains with substances and alcohol

1213
01:06:52,684 --> 01:06:53,044
and cigarettes.

1214
01:06:53,044 --> 01:06:54,784
That's why they're trying to pass on this knowledge.

1215
01:06:55,624 --> 01:06:58,364
We did it, you shouldn't do it.

1216
01:06:58,704 --> 01:07:01,604
We still do it on the weekends when you're not around.

1217
01:07:02,864 --> 01:07:05,784
But we're gonna make you feel like shit.

1218
01:07:06,524 --> 01:07:10,344
This is a real, can you go to the spoken word of that

1219
01:07:10,344 --> 01:07:11,184
if you can locate it?

1220
01:07:11,184 --> 01:07:15,204
We can just keep, it's a real, it's an incredibly

1221
01:07:15,204 --> 01:07:16,784
convoluted message in spoken word.

1222
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:19,264
I'm just gonna play it through cause I like it so much.

1223
01:07:19,764 --> 01:07:19,784
Sure.

1224
01:07:19,784 --> 01:07:24,524
Cause it's your body, you've got to make it last.

1225
01:07:24,644 --> 01:07:27,244
Cause it's your body, treat it right.

1226
01:07:28,204 --> 01:07:31,584
Cause it's your body, you've got to make it last.

1227
01:07:31,584 --> 01:07:35,104
Cause it's your body, treat it right.

1228
01:07:36,884 --> 01:07:39,904
Just think, in all the world there's only one you

1229
01:07:39,904 --> 01:07:42,864
and anything you ever do will be done in your body.

1230
01:07:43,284 --> 01:07:45,784
Since bodies are made to last a good long time,

1231
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:48,064
don't hurt yours by putting drugs in it.

1232
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:49,424
Just say no.

1233
01:07:49,844 --> 01:07:52,084
Anything you do will be in your body.

1234
01:07:52,644 --> 01:07:54,884
The only thing you, it'll always be in your body.

1235
01:07:54,924 --> 01:07:56,324
So you have to be careful.

1236
01:07:56,444 --> 01:07:57,684
Don't put drugs in it.

1237
01:07:57,904 --> 01:07:58,104
Yeah.

1238
01:07:58,104 --> 01:07:59,024
Not you in it.

1239
01:07:59,184 --> 01:08:01,724
Don't huff paint, don't swallow gum.

1240
01:08:02,624 --> 01:08:04,344
Don't put paint in your body.

1241
01:08:04,384 --> 01:08:06,624
But he's also sort of examining like what is the self?

1242
01:08:07,224 --> 01:08:08,184
What is the body?

1243
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:12,584
You know, like it's a vessel to travel this spaceship earth

1244
01:08:12,584 --> 01:08:12,964
with.

1245
01:08:13,804 --> 01:08:15,824
There is a theme parky message of like,

1246
01:08:15,824 --> 01:08:17,004
there's only one you.

1247
01:08:17,364 --> 01:08:18,804
You know, you're great, you're special.

1248
01:08:18,884 --> 01:08:20,364
There's only one you.

1249
01:08:20,504 --> 01:08:23,324
Well, we're in brain bender territory again.

1250
01:08:23,324 --> 01:08:23,704
Yeah.

1251
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:26,244
Where if there's a little buzzy in our brain,

1252
01:08:26,244 --> 01:08:28,284
he should not pick up a can of paint

1253
01:08:28,284 --> 01:08:31,864
and shove it down his 12 year old boy's throat.

1254
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:32,244
Yeah.

1255
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:33,604
It's also kind of like he's saying though,

1256
01:08:33,604 --> 01:08:34,584
there's no afterlife.

1257
01:08:36,264 --> 01:08:38,404
We only go around this earth one time.

1258
01:08:38,544 --> 01:08:40,024
I'm a humanist.

1259
01:08:41,164 --> 01:08:45,104
I'm happy to go over this with you.

1260
01:08:45,404 --> 01:08:48,544
You know, let's hang and talk about it with drugs.

1261
01:08:48,564 --> 01:08:51,524
You can find a lot more about it in the work of Kurt Vonnegut,

1262
01:08:51,744 --> 01:08:53,084
a close friend of mine.

1263
01:08:55,184 --> 01:08:56,264
Oh, my gruff.

1264
01:08:56,264 --> 01:08:58,424
Shame what he's done to his body.

1265
01:08:58,664 --> 01:09:04,884
I think he smoked in the hospital at the end.

1266
01:09:05,704 --> 01:09:09,344
What is interesting is that as McGruff's creator

1267
01:09:09,344 --> 01:09:13,404
lived into his nineties and he made his body last.

1268
01:09:13,744 --> 01:09:15,244
He truly did like as much,

1269
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:17,584
almost as much as you can do right now in this day and age.

1270
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:20,564
So he was whatever he was doing,

1271
01:09:20,584 --> 01:09:21,784
he was doing something right.

1272
01:09:21,784 --> 01:09:25,944
But it's all very counter to, you know, Keith Richards.

1273
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,884
He has done everything that McGruff warns against.

1274
01:09:29,484 --> 01:09:30,904
He has not treated his body right.

1275
01:09:31,104 --> 01:09:32,644
He's just said yes.

1276
01:09:32,804 --> 01:09:35,604
I don't want to accuse Keith Richards of doing inhalants,

1277
01:09:35,824 --> 01:09:39,744
but I mean, I don't know about spray for sprays, but maybe.

1278
01:09:40,184 --> 01:09:43,164
He also fell out of a tree, a coconut tree and hit his head

1279
01:09:43,164 --> 01:09:47,064
and had to have his skull opened up to remove like the

1280
01:09:47,064 --> 01:09:49,704
swelling from his brain for let his brain breathe essentially.

1281
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:50,604
Oh my God.

1282
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:51,564
But he's fine.

1283
01:09:51,684 --> 01:09:53,104
Don't fall out of a coconut tree.

1284
01:09:54,304 --> 01:09:56,804
But they're, hey, the Rolling Stones are playing

1285
01:09:56,804 --> 01:09:59,544
the Rose Bowl soon, so everything's fine with Keith.

1286
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:02,424
Keith has stopped drinking though.

1287
01:10:02,544 --> 01:10:02,864
Oh really?

1288
01:10:02,884 --> 01:10:03,384
I read.

1289
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:07,404
So that like he had gone down, I think from me reading

1290
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:08,624
some interview with him 10 years ago,

1291
01:10:08,644 --> 01:10:11,604
where it's like his assistant came in and poured a solo cup

1292
01:10:11,604 --> 01:10:14,644
full of vodka at 10 a.m. or at noon.

1293
01:10:15,324 --> 01:10:15,704
Yikes.

1294
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:20,284
So he's, you know, maybe McGruff has gotten through to Keith.

1295
01:10:21,404 --> 01:10:22,984
We're saying that's why.

1296
01:10:23,024 --> 01:10:23,824
Yeah, that's why.

1297
01:10:24,884 --> 01:10:27,224
Did you guys hear the stories a few years ago

1298
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:28,664
when they were doing a reunion tour?

1299
01:10:28,744 --> 01:10:31,364
Of course they played like a warmup show at the Echo

1300
01:10:31,364 --> 01:10:33,064
in Los Angeles, but they.

1301
01:10:33,424 --> 01:10:34,524
I don't want to talk about that.

1302
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:35,804
You missed it?

1303
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:36,404
Their practice.

1304
01:10:36,404 --> 01:10:37,684
Well, I was in line.

1305
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:41,044
I got out of line because I thought my number wasn't

1306
01:10:41,044 --> 01:10:41,844
going to be called.

1307
01:10:41,944 --> 01:10:44,824
And then if I had just stuck around, they were giving to like,

1308
01:10:44,964 --> 01:10:46,324
they didn't have enough people.

1309
01:10:46,364 --> 01:10:48,144
So if you were just there in front,

1310
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:49,624
you would have walked up and bought the ticket

1311
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:50,404
and gone to see them.

1312
01:10:50,984 --> 01:10:52,764
It's a whole, I hate it.

1313
01:10:52,764 --> 01:10:53,864
I'm so mad at myself anyway.

1314
01:10:53,984 --> 01:10:57,304
But their practice space was like in a warehouse

1315
01:10:57,304 --> 01:11:00,344
or rental space over by the Burbank airport.

1316
01:11:00,664 --> 01:11:00,904
Oh yeah.

1317
01:11:01,244 --> 01:11:03,484
Like people would be walking by

1318
01:11:03,484 --> 01:11:04,664
because there were other businesses

1319
01:11:04,664 --> 01:11:06,424
or other companies located around there.

1320
01:11:06,424 --> 01:11:07,144
And they'd be like,

1321
01:11:07,244 --> 01:11:09,804
who's playing the Rolling Stones so fucking late?

1322
01:11:09,824 --> 01:11:12,124
And they're like, oh, it's the Rolling Stones.

1323
01:11:12,244 --> 01:11:14,884
And then I think they, the other anecdote from that

1324
01:11:14,884 --> 01:11:18,904
is that like McCartney was like, you know,

1325
01:11:19,224 --> 01:11:22,324
rehearsing in the same complex or in the same area.

1326
01:11:22,884 --> 01:11:23,344
So like,

1327
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:24,004
Wow.

1328
01:11:24,224 --> 01:11:27,564
All sharing walls with Chili John's.

1329
01:11:27,564 --> 01:11:28,064
Yeah.

1330
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:30,584
Chili John's is shaking with the sounds of the stones.

1331
01:11:30,624 --> 01:11:31,984
And the Big Dog garage.

1332
01:11:32,324 --> 01:11:34,064
A lot of Burbank.

1333
01:11:34,304 --> 01:11:35,664
I don't know the Big Dog garage.

1334
01:11:35,684 --> 01:11:36,304
That's Jay's.

1335
01:11:36,304 --> 01:11:38,244
Jay's, where all his cars are.

1336
01:11:38,284 --> 01:11:40,364
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1337
01:11:40,364 --> 01:11:41,384
Isn't it called the Big Dog garage?

1338
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:42,004
Yeah, it is.

1339
01:11:42,024 --> 01:11:43,184
Oh, I didn't know that offhand.

1340
01:11:43,244 --> 01:11:44,944
I didn't know that terminology.

1341
01:11:45,324 --> 01:11:47,784
Unrelated to the apparel company we all love.

1342
01:11:48,264 --> 01:11:49,644
Big Dog clothing.

1343
01:11:49,664 --> 01:11:50,284
Big Dog clothing.

1344
01:11:50,804 --> 01:11:52,464
Which we usually wear when recording.

1345
01:11:52,664 --> 01:11:53,464
Yeah, most, yeah.

1346
01:11:53,824 --> 01:11:55,424
We forgot to start posting those photos.

1347
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:56,024
Yeah.

1348
01:11:56,684 --> 01:11:57,124
All right.

1349
01:11:57,204 --> 01:11:58,344
We're heading to the end.

1350
01:11:58,344 --> 01:12:00,124
We got two more on this album.

1351
01:12:01,284 --> 01:12:03,584
How much more is there in the other?

1352
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:07,784
Eight songs on the other album.

1353
01:12:08,404 --> 01:12:11,324
We could, we'll see where we're at after these two songs

1354
01:12:11,324 --> 01:12:13,304
and we'll assess what we're gonna do.

1355
01:12:13,344 --> 01:12:13,584
All right.

1356
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:16,264
So this song is called, I'll Decide On My Own.

1357
01:12:17,284 --> 01:12:18,684
Wait, no.

1358
01:12:18,684 --> 01:12:19,724
No, it's your body.

1359
01:12:20,004 --> 01:12:20,764
It cut back, sorry.

1360
01:12:21,144 --> 01:12:22,284
I'm doing this live, folks.

1361
01:12:23,024 --> 01:12:24,284
I've done pretty good so far.

1362
01:12:24,304 --> 01:12:25,144
Here we go.

1363
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,460
I'm trying to find you herpes.

1364
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,780
I know they're wrong.

1365
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:43,460
My brain may laugh at me, but this is my song.

1366
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,280
Got a sigh, I itemize.

1367
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,460
They'll never make me.

1368
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:48,220
Got a sigh, I itemize.

1369
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,360
They'll never shake me.

1370
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,160
Got a sigh, I itemize.

1371
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,240
They'll never make me.

1372
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,080
Got a sigh, I itemize.

1373
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,460
I itemize.

1374
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,620
It's kind of the Phil Collins 50s hearkening

1375
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,640
mixed with the 80s.

1376
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,420
It's that sax specifically that sounds like

1377
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:03,340
the Clarence Clemens.

1378
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:05,540
You're a friend of mine intro at least.

1379
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:08,440
But that song is, or maybe that's my least favorite.

1380
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,080
I agree.

1381
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,420
It sounds to me, it reminds me too much of like,

1382
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:12,820
you know, like Christian cassettes

1383
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,060
that I would have had to listen to growing up.

1384
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:16,580
We can skip that.

1385
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,120
You guys obviously go and listen to all the side of my own

1386
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,260
in your own time.

1387
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:20,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1388
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,380
But we'll skip to.

1389
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,620
Is there a single playlist that has these?

1390
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:27,620
There's a YouTube video that has the full thing.

1391
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,820
That's what I've ripped and listening to,

1392
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,260
but they're also have been broken up into singles.

1393
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,520
Though warning, make your body last

1394
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:39,420
on that particular dub has some cassette warbling issues.

1395
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,700
Yes, and I should have played,

1396
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:44,140
I should have ripped make your body last

1397
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,700
from the other rip of it.

1398
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:48,500
Which was taken from an undamaged cassette.

1399
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,220
It's really funny that we know that,

1400
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,240
that we've gone into it and are aware of the varying

1401
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,980
audio fidelity issues between the YouTube copies.

1402
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,020
I'm gonna let you collate all the links for this episode

1403
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:00,900
for the description.

1404
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:01,700
Oh sure.

1405
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,140
It's probably already done.

1406
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,280
Yeah, I mean it's all here.

1407
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,040
Okay.

1408
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,540
Yeah, so I apologize to the listener.

1409
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,920
You all post a full high quality version

1410
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,240
of make your body last.

1411
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,040
In a very Steely Dan move,

1412
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,720
apologizing for audio fidelity issues.

1413
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:20,080
They had to like one of their albums,

1414
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,520
they had to put a big note on it.

1415
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,580
Like we are not comfortable with the way this way.

1416
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:25,540
And it's like, it's fine.

1417
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:27,300
What do you guys, you guys are maniacs.

1418
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,200
Hey, they wanna be just,

1419
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:30,200
they wanna be very professional and I get it.

1420
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,480
So this song is called,

1421
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,960
it's not one of my favorite songs either,

1422
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,160
but I appreciate how weird it is.

1423
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,520
I'm glad I'm me is the song.

1424
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,260
Oh, no, okay.

1425
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,560
Well, here, let's play it

1426
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,620
and then I'll say what I think is going on musically.

1427
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,400
I think it's a pretty fun ending.

1428
01:14:52,056 --> 01:14:52,976
I like being me.

1429
01:14:52,996 --> 01:14:55,636
And I know that you agree.

1430
01:14:57,096 --> 01:14:58,796
It is so very true.

1431
01:14:59,396 --> 01:15:01,656
You're the best at being you.

1432
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:05,176
Yeah, I like every day.

1433
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,496
I can work and I can play.

1434
01:15:09,376 --> 01:15:11,016
Every day when it's done,

1435
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:13,156
I look back on all the fun.

1436
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:17,756
Yes, I'm glad I'm me.

1437
01:15:18,316 --> 01:15:20,876
Yes, I'm glad I'm me.

1438
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:24,556
Because my life is really great.

1439
01:15:24,556 --> 01:15:27,336
I'm gonna celebrate.

1440
01:15:27,516 --> 01:15:30,296
Well, I'm glad I'm me.

1441
01:15:30,596 --> 01:15:33,056
Yes, I'm glad I'm me.

1442
01:15:33,736 --> 01:15:36,676
Because my life is really great.

1443
01:15:37,656 --> 01:15:39,716
I'm gonna celebrate.

1444
01:15:40,496 --> 01:15:43,496
Drugs are not for me.

1445
01:15:43,736 --> 01:15:45,976
You know you've got a lot going for yourself.

1446
01:15:46,176 --> 01:15:49,556
I'm so glad I'm free.

1447
01:15:49,996 --> 01:15:52,396
Everything's fine, everything's super duper.

1448
01:15:52,676 --> 01:15:55,596
Drugs are not for me.

1449
01:15:55,696 --> 01:15:58,396
You have to keep your body strong, your brain sharp.

1450
01:15:58,576 --> 01:16:01,736
I'm so glad I'm free.

1451
01:16:02,376 --> 01:16:03,816
Feeling good, like I should.

1452
01:16:04,976 --> 01:16:06,136
I like being me.

1453
01:16:06,156 --> 01:16:08,376
And I know that you agree.

1454
01:16:10,116 --> 01:16:11,836
It is so very true.

1455
01:16:12,496 --> 01:16:14,096
You're the best at being you.

1456
01:16:15,236 --> 01:16:18,336
Yeah, I like every day.

1457
01:16:18,576 --> 01:16:20,736
I can work and I can play.

1458
01:16:20,736 --> 01:16:24,196
Every day when it's done,

1459
01:16:24,916 --> 01:16:26,296
I look back on all the fun.

1460
01:16:27,756 --> 01:16:30,736
Yes, I'm glad I'm me.

1461
01:16:31,496 --> 01:16:32,876
Yes, I'm glad I'm me.

1462
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:33,676
I think we got it.

1463
01:16:34,096 --> 01:16:37,056
No, no, no.

1464
01:16:37,576 --> 01:16:39,836
You had an idea of what it's from.

1465
01:16:40,076 --> 01:16:43,196
I created a YouTube comment for making me...

1466
01:16:43,196 --> 01:16:45,556
Do you offhand know...

1467
01:16:45,556 --> 01:16:47,936
It's very clear what they're tributing.

1468
01:16:48,316 --> 01:16:53,676
The very beginning I was like a little Fred Schneidery.

1469
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:54,056
Oh, sure.

1470
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:57,176
You're right, that too.

1471
01:16:57,596 --> 01:16:59,956
B-52 like shouting and kind of a little weird.

1472
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:03,216
That was my thought.

1473
01:17:03,276 --> 01:17:05,416
Totally. I think it's extremely Devo.

1474
01:17:05,676 --> 01:17:10,636
I also think that song with zero

1475
01:17:11,276 --> 01:17:13,116
change of the lyrics or anything,

1476
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:14,676
just give that to Devo.

1477
01:17:14,716 --> 01:17:17,956
They play it and you're like, that's a really subversive song.

1478
01:17:18,436 --> 01:17:22,856
There's a song called That's Good and a song It's a Beautiful World.

1479
01:17:23,476 --> 01:17:25,056
It's like the exact same thing.

1480
01:17:25,076 --> 01:17:28,556
It's so positive that something's weird about it.

1481
01:17:29,676 --> 01:17:31,536
I think they could just straight up...

1482
01:17:31,536 --> 01:17:33,276
And if they had straight up covered that,

1483
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,856
you'd be like, oh, in a devilish Devo move,

1484
01:17:37,456 --> 01:17:39,776
they appropriated this Reagan era...

1485
01:17:39,776 --> 01:17:40,836
Child song.

1486
01:17:41,076 --> 01:17:44,236
I think that's a pretty good...

1487
01:17:44,236 --> 01:17:49,116
Just behind Dare to Be Stupid as far as Devo homages go.

1488
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:50,496
I was hard on it.

1489
01:17:50,496 --> 01:17:52,356
There's a lot of interesting moves in there.

1490
01:17:52,476 --> 01:17:53,616
The synth is weird.

1491
01:17:53,876 --> 01:17:57,216
I apologize to the song for saying it's not one of my... It is good.

1492
01:17:57,396 --> 01:17:59,236
And the robot. Oh, man.

1493
01:17:59,236 --> 01:18:02,096
Yeah, when the robot comes in, I wonder what's wrong with me.

1494
01:18:02,196 --> 01:18:04,016
That's the great... The robot's giving him advice.

1495
01:18:04,156 --> 01:18:06,296
Who is the robot? Why is it there?

1496
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:11,836
If you were a kid and someone was like, you have to listen to both sides of this cassette,

1497
01:18:12,176 --> 01:18:14,776
at a certain point, I feel like you'd either be like,

1498
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,416
all right, I get it. Don't do drugs.

1499
01:18:16,656 --> 01:18:20,356
Can you tell me how to deal with bullying or something else I'm dealing with?

1500
01:18:20,356 --> 01:18:22,316
Or just like, okay, great.

1501
01:18:22,356 --> 01:18:25,436
You've listed off all the drugs I would like to try.

1502
01:18:25,436 --> 01:18:30,456
Now I know which drugs to try despite whoever's making me listen to this.

1503
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,616
I know the differences between the types.

1504
01:18:32,736 --> 01:18:33,936
Yeah. Yeah.

1505
01:18:33,936 --> 01:18:38,736
Also, you start showing up at school and saying, I'm glad I'm me.

1506
01:18:38,736 --> 01:18:40,636
I'm good at being great.

1507
01:18:41,236 --> 01:18:43,676
Then now you end up with a bullying problem.

1508
01:18:43,676 --> 01:18:49,016
Your favorite teacher takes you aside like, hey, I don't want to tell you to not be yourself.

1509
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:51,636
But like, maybe chill.

1510
01:18:51,816 --> 01:18:53,396
Chill. Let's chill it out a little.

1511
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:54,196
Just calm down.

1512
01:18:54,216 --> 01:18:58,016
That is the Scott Gardner elementary school story big time.

1513
01:18:58,196 --> 01:18:59,856
Teachers try to help me.

1514
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:06,196
Just maybe don't just like, because I had a much more falsetto voice too.

1515
01:19:06,236 --> 01:19:09,336
So I'm coming in like, I'm talking about Disneyland.

1516
01:19:10,116 --> 01:19:13,896
I think you might, some trouble might be ahead for you.

1517
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:16,876
A kid is smoking and you're like, hey, you need to make your body last.

1518
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:19,896
Come on, buddy.

1519
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:23,376
But now I have the confidence to proudly say,

1520
01:19:23,376 --> 01:19:25,436
I totally present myself as a good boy.

1521
01:19:25,436 --> 01:19:26,876
Yeah. Yeah.

1522
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:30,436
Finally, I don't really, I don't fear repercussion.

1523
01:19:30,436 --> 01:19:31,136
Sure.

1524
01:19:31,136 --> 01:19:35,096
Don't use those match books to smoke. Use them to start a match book collection.

1525
01:19:35,316 --> 01:19:38,856
You can keep them in a large glass jar so you can see all of them.

1526
01:19:38,876 --> 01:19:41,436
It'd make a nice decoration for your room on a shelf.

1527
01:19:41,836 --> 01:19:44,316
Do you, Jason, have a match book collection?

1528
01:19:44,816 --> 01:19:48,116
I mean, just casually, but I use them.

1529
01:19:48,516 --> 01:19:50,016
I thought you might. Yeah.

1530
01:19:50,176 --> 01:19:54,676
All right. So we are at one hour, 20 minutes here.

1531
01:19:54,676 --> 01:19:55,716
Oh my God.

1532
01:19:56,656 --> 01:19:58,516
So do we feel like...

1533
01:19:58,516 --> 01:20:00,396
How robust is the number two?

1534
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:04,696
We could certainly make a meal out of number two, but we also could just go to the highlights.

1535
01:20:05,276 --> 01:20:08,896
I mean, if you want to save number two for a future episode.

1536
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:12,396
Well, the thing is there are four sides or four cassettes.

1537
01:20:12,436 --> 01:20:13,876
Four-sided cassette.

1538
01:20:14,836 --> 01:20:16,556
This is cassette three.

1539
01:20:17,496 --> 01:20:20,836
So there are two, a full other or three, excuse me.

1540
01:20:20,996 --> 01:20:25,856
I believe three other cassettes that are not online that are Holy Grail.

1541
01:20:25,876 --> 01:20:31,756
So we could just play a couple things from here and then if a listener knows where to find this.

1542
01:20:32,216 --> 01:20:33,136
And do a full deep dive.

1543
01:20:33,336 --> 01:20:35,956
Right. Because we could also do more McGruff.

1544
01:20:36,156 --> 01:20:38,936
Clearly there's a lot. There's a lot more McGruff to come. Yeah.

1545
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:42,636
Let's do, you know what? There are two songs specifically I want to play.

1546
01:20:42,716 --> 01:20:45,776
So now we're on to what is the name of this album?

1547
01:20:45,776 --> 01:20:50,456
So this is McGruff Cares for You, the 1991 album that was exclusively available at Burger King.

1548
01:20:50,856 --> 01:20:56,656
And from the title is it him like on a velvet bed looking like Laverte?

1549
01:20:57,316 --> 01:21:04,216
It is a little drawing of McGruff and just says McGruff and has a little magnifying glass.

1550
01:21:05,436 --> 01:21:11,236
If only it was him with a champagne flute with a second one waiting for you, rose petals on the bed.

1551
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:15,616
All I want to do is write new McGruff songs too.

1552
01:21:15,956 --> 01:21:19,876
I wish he was still around to like, I'd be like, I got an album for you.

1553
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:28,236
And then I like, it was like a late period McGruff album, you know, like a Loretta, Jack White Loretta Lynn situation.

1554
01:21:28,236 --> 01:21:32,716
Where it's like, oh my God, we forgot how good McGruff was.

1555
01:21:33,176 --> 01:21:34,716
This is his return to form.

1556
01:21:34,716 --> 01:21:40,756
I need to warn kids nowadays about like vodka tampons, like a child chorus.

1557
01:21:41,156 --> 01:21:44,956
Don't chug beer in your asshole.

1558
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:47,156
Yeah, don't butt chug.

1559
01:21:48,856 --> 01:21:51,716
I'm going to find the movie Blockers funny.

1560
01:21:52,936 --> 01:21:54,736
That John Cena is an actor.

1561
01:21:55,056 --> 01:21:58,916
Is that a gag in Blockers? Like years after?

1562
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:02,756
Of course it takes like five years for something to end up in a movie.

1563
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:06,116
In fact, I'd recommend not putting a funnel in your asshole at all.

1564
01:22:06,356 --> 01:22:09,336
For no reason, unless a doctor's doing it.

1565
01:22:09,676 --> 01:22:12,416
Unless it's medicine to make your asshole better.

1566
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:16,736
Be careful with your asshole.

1567
01:22:17,936 --> 01:22:21,396
Hand sanitizer, only use it for hands.

1568
01:22:22,016 --> 01:22:24,636
Don't put liquids up your butt willy nilly.

1569
01:22:25,236 --> 01:22:27,396
Make sure you know just what it is.

1570
01:22:28,016 --> 01:22:31,456
Like that's a, we need to make that song.

1571
01:22:31,856 --> 01:22:35,636
All right. Okay. So this song, I like this.

1572
01:22:35,636 --> 01:22:38,936
This song falls a little more in line with what you would think the album would be.

1573
01:22:38,956 --> 01:22:40,496
The songs are a little less good.

1574
01:22:40,676 --> 01:22:45,636
It's a little more instructional, but there are some gems on it and there's still some good beats.

1575
01:22:46,096 --> 01:22:50,076
This song, I don't think there is a Burger King.

1576
01:22:50,376 --> 01:22:52,356
Like he goes, be nutritious.

1577
01:22:52,356 --> 01:22:55,456
But again, once in a while Burger King wouldn't be bad.

1578
01:22:56,416 --> 01:23:00,496
Everyone deserves a drink. Hershey's chocolate pie for dessert, please.

1579
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:03,796
So this song is called Alphabet-er.

1580
01:23:06,656 --> 01:23:10,296
So here, I'll just, I won't even say anything about it. Here we go.

1581
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:22,816
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

1582
01:23:22,816 --> 01:23:24,636
This song's got a good groove that I like.

1583
01:23:25,016 --> 01:23:27,536
Okay gang, let's take the alphabet lesson.

1584
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:40,920
What's the matter?

1585
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,320
Hey, prime watch.

1586
01:23:52,248 --> 01:23:53,268
Hours to care for.

1587
01:24:11,632 --> 01:24:14,112
It's dangerous cross out the light.

1588
01:24:14,112 --> 01:24:18,132
J walk exclamation point don't parentheses.

1589
01:24:18,132 --> 01:24:18,892
L

1590
01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:22,492
And then when it comes back here I really like the group again.

1591
01:24:26,032 --> 01:24:29,232
McGrath the crime dog, join with his team.

1592
01:24:30,012 --> 01:24:31,012
N

1593
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:34,032
Neighborhood, keep yours crime free and clean.

1594
01:24:34,252 --> 01:24:34,852
O

1595
01:24:34,852 --> 01:24:35,692
Help S

1596
01:24:35,692 --> 01:24:36,892
Skip to the end of the alphabet.

1597
01:24:38,892 --> 01:24:42,572
Prevention, youth patrols are a helpful tool.

1598
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:43,692
Q

1599
01:24:43,692 --> 01:24:44,632
Youth patrols.

1600
01:24:44,872 --> 01:24:46,052
Ask them so you'll learn all about youth.

1601
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:50,960
I'm gonna touch.

1602
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:51,820
S.

1603
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:55,120
Shoplifting, it's not yours unless you pay.

1604
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:55,740
D.

1605
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,360
Telephone, down that one one when you need aid.

1606
01:24:59,380 --> 01:24:59,880
U.

1607
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,620
Users are losers.

1608
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:03,380
Winners know that's true.

1609
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,200
Fuck, wait, wait, wait, here we go.

1610
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,700
Volunteer, there is so much you can do.

1611
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:08,320
W.

1612
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:12,040
Watch out, how about you've heard him say it?

1613
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,740
X.

1614
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:13,560
Xylophone.

1615
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,400
Xylophone.

1616
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,260
Yeah, he can play it.

1617
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,160
Fuck off.

1618
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:19,420
No, no, no.

1619
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:20,760
U.

1620
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:23,460
The key to all we sung today.

1621
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:24,200
Z.

1622
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,480
Zap our song and son, let's go and play.

1623
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:30,980
You kids are pretty good, that's great, I need to say.

1624
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:34,960
So that's certainly more what you would think

1625
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,380
a McGruff album would be.

1626
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:39,000
A lot of things to be fearful of,

1627
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,460
like a lot of things I worried about as a kid,

1628
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,500
strangers, home invasion, fire drills.

1629
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:45,380
But I do think-

1630
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:46,280
Being asked to play a xylophone.

1631
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,600
Being asked to play a xylophone.

1632
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,340
That beat is very Ariel Pink.

1633
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,320
That beat alone without the kids,

1634
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:53,080
I think is a cool little groove.

1635
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:53,760
Yeah.

1636
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,000
But then the kids obviously take it down

1637
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,540
because it's like a child song.

1638
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,180
The other novelty song that was played at my wedding

1639
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,820
was a boy band song that I made at Funny or Die

1640
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:05,760
with Nick Kurosi and Charles Ingram.

1641
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,480
Those are the two oddity requests.

1642
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,580
And it has like a little rap part,

1643
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,040
like boy band songs might have had.

1644
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:14,900
And it has the exact beat where there's an x

1645
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,620
and you don't know what to say for it.

1646
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,640
X is for the xylophone.

1647
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:19,060
Yeah.

1648
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,580
There's a joke of,

1649
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,160
this is a little tossed off joke,

1650
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,700
it's something I made.

1651
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:28,380
And then he does it, that is how he handles x for real.

1652
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:30,000
Yeah, we can play it.

1653
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:32,080
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

1654
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:35,100
X is for Xander Cage, he protects us.

1655
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,840
I just realized we have to play two more songs, sorry.

1656
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:40,020
Okay.

1657
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,840
I don't know what-

1658
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,180
That at least had a variety of topic matter.

1659
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:44,800
Yes.

1660
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,780
Not just drugs.

1661
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:48,520
And this album does have different topics.

1662
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:51,900
Now this song is so goddamn confusing.

1663
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,800
And I will just say the name of it

1664
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,380
and we will try to figure it out.

1665
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:57,800
It is called Who Has Zards?

1666
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:00,080
Z-A-R-D-S.

1667
01:27:07,384 --> 01:27:14,704
They're stinky, they're sly, they lurk in neighborhood.

1668
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,720
This feels problematic already.

1669
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:01,740
Yeah, creepy.

1670
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:11,600
This is kind of like Octopus's garden.

1671
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:17,020
Yeah.

1672
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:21,280
It's a Zard. I have no idea. I don't know this term.

1673
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:27,660
I should look it up. I think this would have to be a slow down Aerial Pack thing too.

1674
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:42,980
Also very experimental because it just switches before it's like...

1675
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:46,940
This album is more experimental than the other one. I believe.

1676
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,980
Sweets.

1677
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:54,080
Predator. I think they're talking about Predator.

1678
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,840
Zard is not a term anyone has ever used.

1679
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:05,260
Or used since...

1680
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:14,760
It's like Slender Man. It sounds like they're warning about the dangers of Slender Man.

1681
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:22,280
Yeah, you get the gist of it. Zards. I don't know if that was a term maybe he was trying to get to take off and then somebody was like,

1682
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,900
That's confusing. Why would you say that in a PSA?

1683
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:32,620
Officer, a Zard is after me. Okay, kid. All right, you move it along. We need... there's people here with real problems.

1684
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:34,580
Goes back out police station.

1685
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,500
This kid is captured by Zard instantly.

1686
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:42,860
He's like on the phone, Mom, there's a Zard has got me. What are you talking about? A Zard.

1687
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:46,400
You're very creative, aren't you honey? I'll see you for dinner.

1688
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:49,580
You're just calling from Brian's house obviously. You're watching one of your little shows.

1689
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:55,040
Let's find you someone trustworthy to get you home like a wrestling coach or a priest.

1690
01:29:55,040 --> 01:30:01,340
Always trust a priest. Always trust a wrestling coach, Congressman.

1691
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:10,200
This actually leads in to track seven. Strangers Don't Look Strange.

1692
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,020
And it's a similar... Some of them do. Some of them do.

1693
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:22,260
This song spells it out for you and it's a lot of kids singing. So again, it's not nearly as good as the other album song, but it is... you'll hear.

1694
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:26,100
Hi kids. Hi, McGruff.

1695
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:32,000
I think the toughest job for me and for your parents is teaching kids to stay away from strangers.

1696
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:40,100
Strangers aren't people who look strange or dangerous. A stranger is anyone your family doesn't know real well.

1697
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:48,800
If a person has never been to your house for dinner, that's a stranger. If you don't know his kids or where he lives, that's a stranger.

1698
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:58,440
Even people you think you know can really be strangers. Let me ask you about different people and you tell me whether they're strangers or not.

1699
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:00,260
How about the mail carrier?

1700
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:07,160
I've known him a long, long time, but I guess he's really a stranger. I don't even know where he lives.

1701
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,120
Right. How about the school crossing guard?

1702
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:16,020
He's really nice and he helps us. But he's not a good friend of my family.

1703
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,120
These people you see every day?

1704
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,540
Yes he is. How about the woman who works in the ice cream store?

1705
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,360
Oh Jason, that's a friend.

1706
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:26,540
She's never been to our house for dinner. So she's a stranger.

1707
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:30,800
She sure is. Is the school bus driver a stranger?

1708
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:37,460
I see him every day. He knows my name, but my family doesn't know him. He's a stranger.

1709
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:39,320
Yep, he's a stranger.

1710
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:39,900
These kids are good.

1711
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,280
Is your uncle a stranger?

1712
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:44,880
I don't see him every day, but he's not a stranger.

1713
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,400
No, he's not.

1714
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,040
Sorry we had to do this quiz. I have a kid.

1715
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,800
I've been evicted from my office.

1716
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:56,880
You can't talk to strangers because you only have to talk to the wrong one once to be in real trouble.

1717
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:03,080
Grown-ups know better than to try to talk with kids. So when you don't talk to a stranger, don't worry about it.

1718
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,260
It's not bad manners.

1719
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:04,700
You mean you don't what?

1720
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,720
It's good sense.

1721
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:06,840
Alright, here we go.

1722
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:10,500
There are people coming to this country who don't come from here.

1723
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,540
They're not sending their vets.

1724
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:22,180
Jesus.

1725
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:25,340
It's like from Labyrinth or something.

1726
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:27,880
Strangers look well dressed and clean.

1727
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,760
Just a bad Jesus.

1728
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,840
It's a nightmare song.

1729
01:33:15,064 --> 01:33:21,864
What do you do about strangers? Stay away from them. Don't look at them. Don't walk near them and don't talk to them.

1730
01:33:22,404 --> 01:33:28,384
If a stranger talks to you, don't answer. Just keep walking. If a stranger gets near you, grunt.

1731
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:33,124
If a stranger follows you, run someplace safe and yell.

1732
01:33:35,824 --> 01:33:39,404
Everyone is a threat. The suburbs are a hell.

1733
01:33:40,024 --> 01:33:46,944
At the end of the song is, and yell. I wish it had echoed. And yell, yell, yell, yell.

1734
01:33:47,044 --> 01:33:49,864
Yeah. Well, we can make that change.

1735
01:33:50,084 --> 01:33:51,784
We can remix this thing.

1736
01:33:52,024 --> 01:33:56,344
Yeah. So I was interested that you, do you believe that the crossing guard is not a stranger?

1737
01:33:57,464 --> 01:34:01,544
It depends. I feel like, you know, I was...

1738
01:34:01,544 --> 01:34:05,764
You were upset with their classification of those people at the start as strangers.

1739
01:34:06,504 --> 01:34:11,744
My mom would talk to like cross... Like there were like, not a lot of crossing guards because we were

1740
01:34:11,744 --> 01:34:17,764
in like suburban sprawl. So there wasn't, it was far to walk anywhere. But the bus drivers, my mom,

1741
01:34:17,904 --> 01:34:24,964
like all knew. But I'm saying even if, McGruff's lesson is you see the crossing guard every day.

1742
01:34:25,004 --> 01:34:28,424
You say, hello, he seems perfectly nice. But if the crossing guard comes up to you and goes, hey,

1743
01:34:28,444 --> 01:34:32,524
you want to come over to my house? You tell your kid, don't go to the house. He's a stranger.

1744
01:34:32,624 --> 01:34:36,384
Yeah. You learn. I'm just trying to explain McGruff's message.

1745
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:43,404
But it is reinforcing like the world, you know, it sounds like the fucking water world of like,

1746
01:34:43,404 --> 01:34:48,624
the world, dry land is gone. The world is covered. The oceans have taken back the planet.

1747
01:34:49,144 --> 01:34:50,804
The suburbs are a war zone.

1748
01:34:50,904 --> 01:34:56,564
I agree that my mother's raised me and I was too sheltered, but I think McGruff's lesson is good

1749
01:34:56,824 --> 01:35:02,044
here. I think it's an important distinction to make that the crossing guard is friendly,

1750
01:35:02,044 --> 01:35:07,684
but don't go with him. You've done every bit. We don't go to his house. He could be a secret

1751
01:35:07,684 --> 01:35:11,584
pedophile. Well, I think they are, I mean, nowadays, certainly it's like I'm friends on

1752
01:35:11,584 --> 01:35:16,864
the internet or like I know them from Fortnite. It's like, well, okay. The internet is not.

1753
01:35:17,424 --> 01:35:25,184
I think it's a weird message to convey via this like soaring, frightening song.

1754
01:35:26,404 --> 01:35:30,584
I guess. This like, I'm trying to think what that it's, I don't know. It's like a scary,

1755
01:35:30,744 --> 01:35:35,764
like it's like a tears for fears outtake. It's like really big and echoey and frightening.

1756
01:35:36,824 --> 01:35:42,624
It certainly is. I'm just saying McGruff is spot on with this message. I think it is a good little

1757
01:35:42,624 --> 01:35:49,084
distinction to make, but what a strange thing to do. Oh, it's bizarre. It's terrifying. And

1758
01:35:49,084 --> 01:35:53,504
I was just scared of everyone. Yeah. Well, that's fair. That's good. I mean,

1759
01:35:53,504 --> 01:35:58,224
that's better than the other raised your right. Yeah. Be afraid of everyone. Don't trust me. Be

1760
01:35:58,224 --> 01:36:04,264
afraid of this tape. In fact, trust the people on Nick at night. They're all long dead. They can't

1761
01:36:04,264 --> 01:36:15,784
hurt you. Maury Amsterdam. Get into a van. Oh, Maury. It's not the first time he's come up on the

1762
01:36:15,784 --> 01:36:20,804
podcast. I don't think Maury Amsterdam. All right. So there are, I'll list the names of the songs.

1763
01:36:20,804 --> 01:36:24,964
You guys can listen to them in your own time. We will dissect them on a different show. I'm sure

1764
01:36:24,964 --> 01:36:32,304
number two, anger. Number three, little bit of litter. Number five, cool rules. Number six,

1765
01:36:32,544 --> 01:36:37,464
buddies. And then the last track is number eight, unique about, which is a very similar,

1766
01:36:37,664 --> 01:36:42,684
like send them off with a good feeling about themselves kind of a message. So, but I think

1767
01:36:42,684 --> 01:36:49,264
you're closed with the right one. That felt like the album closer. Yes. That's like this like

1768
01:36:50,224 --> 01:36:57,424
unsettling notes that echoes out. And then with the word yell and a scary drone after a bunch of

1769
01:36:57,424 --> 01:37:03,804
like, all the songs have had kids, but that was a frightening kid. Oh yeah. And I, yeah. And I think

1770
01:37:03,804 --> 01:37:08,184
it's good. I liked that McGruff was experimenting on the second. I liked that he didn't just rest

1771
01:37:08,184 --> 01:37:13,384
on his laurels and do the same song type of stuff he did, you know, cause so many artists do that

1772
01:37:13,384 --> 01:37:17,964
and they just go back to the well. McGruff was taking a risk there. That's not, nothing on the

1773
01:37:17,964 --> 01:37:23,164
first album sounds like that. Yeah. Well, McGruff's always been about shaking the box, even within an

1774
01:37:23,164 --> 01:37:27,764
individual McGruff album. He's covering a lot of territory and that's what I'm impressed with.

1775
01:37:27,764 --> 01:37:33,384
Having surveyed this whole thing. Yeah. Look, he made that the last song was almost like industrial

1776
01:37:33,384 --> 01:37:40,764
or something after a bunch of, you know, kind of a sort of Marimba Miami sound machine kind of like.

1777
01:37:41,084 --> 01:37:46,264
It's like McGruff's tin machine, David Bowie's tin machine. You know, they was trying something,

1778
01:37:47,144 --> 01:37:51,184
trying to do the 90. Like he was trying to get ahead of the curve on a lot of these things. And

1779
01:37:51,184 --> 01:37:58,584
if you become friends with soupy sales sons, diverting your successful career to make two albums

1780
01:37:58,584 --> 01:38:05,424
with them might not be a good idea. Stay away from the sales boys. If there's later 90 stuff,

1781
01:38:05,424 --> 01:38:10,044
I would be interested if there's a song. I don't think there is, but I would love to find.

1782
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:15,344
I am a little, so it's probably a little too early for this, even on the Burger King one,

1783
01:38:15,484 --> 01:38:22,044
there's not a, um, I feel like there was a lot of like, I knew about the AIDS crisis,

1784
01:38:22,044 --> 01:38:27,184
but I only knew the red ribbon. I feel like we would do a lot of charity fundraisers

1785
01:38:27,184 --> 01:38:32,664
for this sort of thing, but net they wouldn't explain to kids what it was. It was just a problem.

1786
01:38:32,964 --> 01:38:38,464
Just go sell those pizza kits. So you want a McGruff song explaining AIDS? No, not explaining

1787
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:44,084
the full, the full overview of it, but I feel like I saw a lot of like the AIDS quilt, the AIDS quilt

1788
01:38:45,404 --> 01:38:54,844
don't get AIDS. It's really not good for you. Your body, your body is your vessel. So keep AIDS out

1789
01:38:54,844 --> 01:38:59,624
of it. But in turn, I just mean in terms of messaging towards children from the early to

1790
01:38:59,624 --> 01:39:06,284
mid nineties of like drugs, AIDS, violence, we grew up with a lot of AIDS by 1891. Yeah. Yeah.

1791
01:39:06,284 --> 01:39:12,044
Yeah. Post-mess Johnson. I don't know if there's any McGruff sex stuff though. I don't think there's

1792
01:39:12,284 --> 01:39:17,884
any. Oh yeah. I mean like first graders understanding of AIDS is a little like it's,

1793
01:39:18,164 --> 01:39:22,524
I get it. Like if you're talking to seventh and eighth graders. Yeah. I was the whole thing with

1794
01:39:22,524 --> 01:39:27,024
me when I was watching AIDS specials and like a condom demonstration as a kid, I'm like, I don't

1795
01:39:27,024 --> 01:39:30,504
know what I'm supposed to do with this. Right. I don't even know what they're talking about.

1796
01:39:30,604 --> 01:39:34,644
I was the kid watching it. I mean, six or seven, I guess that's for Google, but they're watching,

1797
01:39:34,704 --> 01:39:39,544
they're putting a condom on a banana. I'm like, so what's this all about then? I don't. And I think

1798
01:39:39,544 --> 01:39:45,284
I asked my parents and they're like, um, do you want to watch Looney Tunes instead? Yeah.

1799
01:39:45,284 --> 01:39:48,984
Let's change the channel. I learned about the human body from Rob Liefeld comics. So it took

1800
01:39:48,984 --> 01:39:54,544
me a while to deprogram myself from horrifying nineties, uh, hyper stylized comic book art.

1801
01:39:54,644 --> 01:39:59,244
I think we all, as comic fans, we learned a lot about anatomy from the X-Men. Anatomy. Well,

1802
01:39:59,424 --> 01:40:06,704
your feet are constantly pointed and you have a lot of belts and pouches. Sure. Well, I think of

1803
01:40:06,704 --> 01:40:12,584
a gruff, if there's a, was a further album, he would have tried to get into grunge. Um, I, I,

1804
01:40:12,584 --> 01:40:15,964
I found something on the way out the door and I'm just going to have to have you look this up. Do

1805
01:40:15,964 --> 01:40:20,284
you know, uh, you'll, you would know what I was talking about already. If there's a gruff grunge

1806
01:40:20,284 --> 01:40:27,244
song, maybe continue though. Okay. I'm going to need you to Google sound cloud or is it sound

1807
01:40:27,244 --> 01:40:33,064
cloud or is it one of the other? I don't know. Just Google X crime dog X. Oh, I think as one big,

1808
01:40:33,064 --> 01:40:39,284
I know what this is. Yeah. Um, the, this is, uh, and the, uh, that's the artist and there is an album

1809
01:40:39,284 --> 01:40:47,504
called 1984 through 86. And here's what this is. There is a, like, there is a hardcore band

1810
01:40:47,504 --> 01:40:56,164
from the 2000s that made, uh, a couple of EPs and the, and the EPs were called take a bite,

1811
01:40:56,744 --> 01:41:01,904
drunk kids can bite it and bark today. What is the song you want? And you know, when those EPs were,

1812
01:41:01,904 --> 01:41:09,124
they were all covers of McGruff's smart kids album. Wow. I didn't realize that. Have you found it?

1813
01:41:09,184 --> 01:41:15,424
I can help look if you don't. It's either a sound cloud or a, uh, um, what's one of those other X

1814
01:41:15,424 --> 01:41:22,884
crime dog X. As soon as you said the phrase hardcore band, I was like, oh, they cover them.

1815
01:41:23,044 --> 01:41:29,724
Of course they would have covered it. It's all anti-reagant. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, wow.

1816
01:41:31,124 --> 01:41:36,444
I sampled alcohol. If I have make your body left right here, play whatever you're into. Um, let's

1817
01:41:36,444 --> 01:41:40,484
just get it. Oh wow.

1818
01:41:59,724 --> 01:42:00,884
Yeah.

1819
01:42:32,568 --> 01:42:35,008
I guess I didn't realize that there was actually covers of the songs.

1820
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,588
Wow.

1821
01:42:35,788 --> 01:42:37,168
That fucking whips.

1822
01:42:37,168 --> 01:42:37,948
I like it.

1823
01:42:38,068 --> 01:42:39,108
Fucking slaps.

1824
01:42:39,868 --> 01:42:40,488
I love it.

1825
01:42:40,888 --> 01:42:42,508
They were a hardcore straight edge band.

1826
01:42:43,008 --> 01:42:45,008
Okay, I wasn't sure about that element of it.

1827
01:42:45,008 --> 01:42:45,848
Also straight edge.

1828
01:42:46,268 --> 01:42:48,768
Okay, because that's the thing with like,

1829
01:42:48,768 --> 01:42:51,268
I was reading an article that referred to like minor threat

1830
01:42:51,268 --> 01:42:54,208
and that was also, I guess a lot of hardcore bands are that.

1831
01:42:54,508 --> 01:42:57,328
So it actually weirdly, the messages are,

1832
01:42:57,568 --> 01:43:00,548
they are conveying the McGruff messages.

1833
01:43:00,588 --> 01:43:02,268
Right, so they like the message.

1834
01:43:02,268 --> 01:43:05,948
Yeah, in some way, but there's also, it's, they're not the only,

1835
01:43:05,948 --> 01:43:09,428
this is not the only time that McGruff and punk have collided

1836
01:43:09,428 --> 01:43:14,728
because there is a McGruff song by Jello, by Afra and the Melvins,

1837
01:43:14,728 --> 01:43:22,948
which I don't know offhand, but so McGruff has inspired musicians of all genres.

1838
01:43:23,088 --> 01:43:23,948
Well, maybe one genre.

1839
01:43:23,968 --> 01:43:25,448
This is the Melvins song.

1840
01:43:25,748 --> 01:43:27,168
Let's hear it.

1841
01:43:32,268 --> 01:43:32,488
So

1842
01:44:12,312 --> 01:44:14,172
I'm a savior of heart.

1843
01:44:45,464 --> 01:44:46,504
I mean, you get the idea.

1844
01:44:46,744 --> 01:44:46,884
Yeah.

1845
01:44:47,044 --> 01:44:47,764
I don't know if I do.

1846
01:44:47,904 --> 01:44:50,084
I don't know where you got it in.

1847
01:44:50,084 --> 01:44:52,064
Inspires everyone, I think.

1848
01:44:52,244 --> 01:44:55,344
I just yeah, I just love that that that

1849
01:44:55,344 --> 01:44:58,044
McGruff's musical reach has been pretty far.

1850
01:44:58,064 --> 01:44:58,524
Yeah.

1851
01:44:58,584 --> 01:45:00,004
But let's keep it up.

1852
01:45:00,324 --> 01:45:04,204
The more more more more covers, I think, with I really do,

1853
01:45:04,444 --> 01:45:10,064
especially with that, that that's we're asking for that to be

1854
01:45:10,064 --> 01:45:13,704
brought into current that like churches should be playing that

1855
01:45:13,884 --> 01:45:16,684
we should close a lot our live shows with that.

1856
01:45:17,104 --> 01:45:18,664
Maybe I would like more noise.

1857
01:45:18,664 --> 01:45:22,224
Yeah, I would love like fucked up or Titus Andronicus or Monster

1858
01:45:22,224 --> 01:45:24,524
Magnet or something to do some McGruff covers.

1859
01:45:25,584 --> 01:45:30,424
Yeah, I challenge any artist worth their.

1860
01:45:30,604 --> 01:45:34,524
We have a couple of musician listeners, I feel like that are in

1861
01:45:34,524 --> 01:45:35,064
bands.

1862
01:45:35,904 --> 01:45:38,884
I don't know if they're on Patreon yet, but they should challenge

1863
01:45:38,884 --> 01:45:41,944
whoever if you're in a band, we challenge you.

1864
01:45:41,964 --> 01:45:42,524
Take your pick.

1865
01:45:42,624 --> 01:45:43,104
Yeah.

1866
01:45:43,104 --> 01:45:46,124
I mean, though, obviously, I would love to hear some real I want

1867
01:45:46,124 --> 01:45:48,204
to hear that extended alcohol jam.

1868
01:45:48,444 --> 01:45:52,124
Yeah, but but we may have to do it also.

1869
01:45:52,144 --> 01:45:52,964
So sure.

1870
01:45:53,124 --> 01:45:53,484
Great.

1871
01:45:53,644 --> 01:45:55,184
We may have to do the full tribute.

1872
01:45:55,264 --> 01:45:59,104
We're also going to have to like, you know, study jazz fusion for

1873
01:45:59,104 --> 01:46:02,024
a while to like get up to get the musicality up.

1874
01:46:02,024 --> 01:46:02,524
That's fair.

1875
01:46:02,744 --> 01:46:03,344
That's some tough.

1876
01:46:03,504 --> 01:46:06,044
That's some tough noodling he's doing there.

1877
01:46:06,084 --> 01:46:06,664
Yeah, that's true.

1878
01:46:06,744 --> 01:46:08,424
McGruff himself, who I assume.

1879
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,264
Right.

1880
01:46:09,544 --> 01:46:12,324
I'm going to have to practice standing on the other side of a

1881
01:46:12,444 --> 01:46:16,444
recording booth, smoking and nodding my head a couple of years ago.

1882
01:46:16,444 --> 01:46:20,064
A couple of years ago for my birthday, I just got it.

1883
01:46:20,284 --> 01:46:23,824
I rented a rehearsal room and we just like played songs and everyone

1884
01:46:23,824 --> 01:46:25,344
would switch off playing instruments or whatever.

1885
01:46:25,724 --> 01:46:29,564
Maybe this birthday we do a similar thing, but it's all McGruff songs.

1886
01:46:29,924 --> 01:46:32,324
We're going to have to figure out the Lord and all the McGruff songs

1887
01:46:32,324 --> 01:46:33,064
and play them.

1888
01:46:33,084 --> 01:46:36,384
We have to learn how it we have to learn the charts on this thing.

1889
01:46:36,384 --> 01:46:37,104
Well, we'll see.

1890
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,444
Well, you know, it's a lot to think about.

1891
01:46:38,444 --> 01:46:38,924
We've gone.

1892
01:46:38,964 --> 01:46:42,044
This is now we're almost to our in 50 minutes.

1893
01:46:42,044 --> 01:46:42,464
Wow.

1894
01:46:42,584 --> 01:46:42,904
All right.

1895
01:46:42,964 --> 01:46:44,304
Well, let's get let's get out of here.

1896
01:46:44,304 --> 01:46:45,104
Get out of here now.

1897
01:46:45,144 --> 01:46:49,444
But that was, you know, with it with two entire albums to review.

1898
01:46:49,524 --> 01:46:51,384
Yeah, it was bound to happen.

1899
01:46:52,004 --> 01:46:54,664
Hey, everybody involved in this, these albums.

1900
01:46:54,924 --> 01:46:55,604
Great job.

1901
01:46:56,044 --> 01:46:57,864
Musicians out of the world.

1902
01:46:57,964 --> 01:46:59,124
Step it up.

1903
01:46:59,264 --> 01:47:05,344
Let McGruff's confusing messages rain and new songs inspired by his met, you

1904
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:09,524
know, songs about like making sure you're thrown or disposing of old light bulbs

1905
01:47:10,644 --> 01:47:14,504
properly or, you know, finding proper recycle centers.

1906
01:47:14,624 --> 01:47:16,264
Vaping is addictive.

1907
01:47:17,104 --> 01:47:22,644
Just because it is candy or tastes like candy.

1908
01:47:23,384 --> 01:47:24,724
Don't do chew.

1909
01:47:25,404 --> 01:47:31,044
It's not it's not as relevant as it was, was, but still don't chew.

1910
01:47:31,444 --> 01:47:32,164
Don't do Jason.

1911
01:47:32,264 --> 01:47:34,664
Those Disney pins on Amazon are counterfeit.

1912
01:47:34,864 --> 01:47:38,564
Don't you dare think about ordering them and trying to trade them.

1913
01:47:38,564 --> 01:47:39,424
Scrapper pins.

1914
01:47:39,424 --> 01:47:43,084
The German people are really upset with you online when you said that you could

1915
01:47:43,084 --> 01:47:44,764
buy Disney on Amazon.

1916
01:47:45,284 --> 01:47:46,784
Oh, really?

1917
01:47:46,964 --> 01:47:47,604
Yeah, that's real.

1918
01:47:47,624 --> 01:47:48,444
Well, I guess.

1919
01:47:48,624 --> 01:47:51,504
And you know, I got this from other Disney blogs like that.

1920
01:47:51,564 --> 01:47:54,584
You can buy bulk pins online and then use them to trade.

1921
01:47:55,064 --> 01:47:58,844
But that's how then these scrapper pins get into circulation.

1922
01:47:58,964 --> 01:48:02,804
I've been working with the Chicago Police Department to bring in.

1923
01:48:02,864 --> 01:48:03,744
Yeah, it's counterfeit.

1924
01:48:05,724 --> 01:48:06,324
Fakes.

1925
01:48:06,464 --> 01:48:09,884
Fake pins will soon have harsher punishments than child

1926
01:48:09,884 --> 01:48:12,064
trafficking, as it should be.

1927
01:48:12,244 --> 01:48:14,124
McGruff doing a sting with fake pins.

1928
01:48:14,164 --> 01:48:16,684
He's got like one of those pin badges on for the Disney.

1929
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:19,024
Yeah, I mean, I don't rest, pal.

1930
01:48:19,524 --> 01:48:23,624
I don't I don't want collectors to take a wash on that.

1931
01:48:24,004 --> 01:48:28,464
The I don't particularly care about the line item on Disney's budget sheet about

1932
01:48:28,464 --> 01:48:31,784
like, oh, we lost thousands of dollars to fake pins.

1933
01:48:31,784 --> 01:48:34,124
Like, oh, I'm not exactly sympathetic.

1934
01:48:34,124 --> 01:48:36,024
I'll try to spin your way out of this one, pal.

1935
01:48:36,164 --> 01:48:37,144
You were wrong.

1936
01:48:37,424 --> 01:48:41,604
All right, let's get out of here.

1937
01:48:41,624 --> 01:48:42,344
Yeah, yeah.

1938
01:48:42,344 --> 01:48:43,264
This needs to be done.

1939
01:48:43,444 --> 01:48:43,704
All right.

1940
01:48:43,764 --> 01:48:44,704
You survive.

1941
01:48:44,704 --> 01:48:45,444
You'll survive.

1942
01:48:45,824 --> 01:48:46,124
You'll survive.

1943
01:48:46,404 --> 01:48:46,744
You'll survive.

1944
01:48:47,124 --> 01:48:47,184
You'll survive.

1945
01:48:48,524 --> 01:48:52,184
If there's a podcast you love, make sure you're supporting it.

1946
01:48:52,344 --> 01:48:53,304
It helps them.

1947
01:48:53,644 --> 01:48:56,624
It helps them with the infrastructure they need.

1948
01:48:56,624 --> 01:48:58,904
Yeah, like a wire splitter they had to start using.

1949
01:48:59,324 --> 01:49:01,764
So because they have headphones, they needed black.

1950
01:49:01,764 --> 01:49:02,884
Listen to my songs.

1951
01:49:03,004 --> 01:49:04,504
There's chords everywhere.

1952
01:49:04,504 --> 01:49:05,484
I like what you hear.

1953
01:49:05,564 --> 01:49:07,144
Tell your friend about it.

1954
01:49:07,204 --> 01:49:11,424
They'd want to hear a two hour long podcast about a 35 year old album

1955
01:49:11,424 --> 01:49:13,764
that almost no one has ever heard.

1956
01:49:13,764 --> 01:49:17,264
Five dollars a month for this content.

1957
01:49:17,764 --> 01:49:20,524
A hell of a deal and much cheaper than drugs.

1958
01:49:21,624 --> 01:49:24,164
My voice is starting to go with it.

1959
01:49:24,164 --> 01:49:24,804
Yeah, yeah, I heard.

1960
01:49:25,144 --> 01:49:25,844
Let's bail.

1961
01:49:25,944 --> 01:49:27,664
Let's get the hell out of here.

1962
01:49:27,784 --> 01:49:29,324
Treat your vocal cords right.

1963
01:49:29,564 --> 01:49:30,664
Thanks for listening.

1964
01:49:31,984 --> 01:49:37,524
Using crack and cocaine to get high.

1965
01:49:38,084 --> 01:49:40,144
That's what you say.

1966
01:49:41,264 --> 01:49:41,484
No.

1967
01:49:42,824 --> 01:49:44,984
But it's really insane.

1968
01:49:46,244 --> 01:49:47,684
You could die.

1969
01:49:48,244 --> 01:49:52,104
What are you thinking of?

1970
01:49:54,604 --> 01:49:59,244
Because nobody's needing that crack and cocaine.

1971
01:49:59,244 --> 01:50:04,844
There's terrible trouble behind it.

1972
01:50:05,104 --> 01:50:09,804
And sooner or later you burn in your brain,

1973
01:50:10,644 --> 01:50:14,484
making a mess of your mind.
