1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Warning, the following podcast contains rhinestone studded clothing, strip mall wax figures, an

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,200
extremely safe Santa photo op, and a rock and roll city?

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,200
Jesse Farrar joins us to talk Opryland, so get ready to hoot and holler.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,840
It's podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,960
Welcome to Podcast, The Ride, the podcast about theme parks that's more fun than playing

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,560
a game of Family Feud against the Statler Brothers.

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,600
I'm Scott Gardner and Jason Sheridan, come on down.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,680
I'm here, yes, it's a historic Family Feud game.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,920
I figure we get it out of the way right at the top because everybody's going to be demanding.

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,400
You can't talk Opryland without the famous Statler Mandrell Family Feud.

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,440
Mike, I'm sure you got a myriad of thoughts about that.

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
Mike Carlson.

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
I certainly do.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,880
Everyone I ran into while I was walking the dog today have been saying, you got to talk

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,960
about this, okay?

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,720
You got to do the Family Feud story.

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,560
And I said, I'll get it, I'll get there, but I don't want to reveal all yet, I think.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,840
And what a story it is.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,200
It's definitely not just that it happened.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,000
It's way beyond that.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,960
I'm really excited for today's episode and I think I texted you guys some version of

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,040
this thought, which is that I think that we've done it very seldom, but I think that when

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,120
I think the good things happen when Podcast, The Ride goes south, not when we go, not when

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,320
we fail, but when we go to the south of the country, I think about Hard Rock Park in South

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,360
Carolina, I think about Dogpatch USA in Arkansas.

29
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,900
And I'm so excited to head south now to Nashville, Tennessee to talk about Opryland USA and joining

30
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,160
us from Tennessee, from the Go Off Kings, from your Kickstarter sucks, and from the

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,760
new podcast on Stitcher Premium.

32
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,040
Good morning, good morning, Jesse Farrar.

33
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,920
Hey guys, thanks for having me on.

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Absolutely.

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,280
Thank you for joining us.

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,400
So excited to talk about a thing native to your neck of the woods.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,680
You had mentioned Dollywood as well, but we have a thing I said about Dollywood.

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm like, I think we have to go.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,480
I think we like we do.

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
We deserve that.

41
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,320
Dollywood deserves our physical presence for us to do an episode.

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,160
We need to do a live show at Dollywood before.

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,480
We need to like in one of the theaters that houses like Civil War shows or something,

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,000
to do a show there.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,880
Yeah, I had actually when we were talking about what to do.

46
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,640
Yeah, I said, well, I don't you know, I'm not I'm not a theme parks guy.

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,520
So get the get the knives out now and slash my belly open.

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,960
And actually listening to your show has helped me work out some of my feelings on theme parks

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,920
and this kind of thing, because you guys I think you have a really good attitude about

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
it.

51
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,560
Smoke up your asses.

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,720
OK, please, please.

53
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,920
But I think it's true that theme parks, like everywhere else, are nightmares for a lot

54
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
of reasons, especially right now, obviously.

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,680
But there's there's a lot of shit to hate about it.

56
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,320
There's so much shit to hate about going to one of these places.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,360
And I have to enumerate all of it.

58
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,320
But I mean, it's it's it's just unbridled capitalism.

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,880
It's not fun to see that it's become an experience for if not purely

60
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,720
the rich, then the people with enough disposable income to say, you know, like a few hundred

61
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,800
dollars a pop just to get in the door is no big deal for me.

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,560
And it's also just I mean, so much of the stuff is junk.

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,680
I mean, so much of it's the IP that you have to wander through in all these places is garbage.

64
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,200
I don't care about any of this shit.

65
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,920
However, what do you mean minions and

66
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,160
getting to watch Vin Diesel fly a helicopter?

67
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,480
I mean, how many things are there?

68
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,480
How many parks or rides are there dedicated to properties with one movie?

69
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,800
That's not you have to have more than one movie to get a ride, don't you?

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,400
Am I am I out of my mind?

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,280
This is an interesting point.

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, I mean, it's you know, sometimes people sometimes a movie gets lucky.

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,520
There's an amount of money a company, a corporation has to put into a ride.

74
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,800
And this movie just happened to have just come out and they go,

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,920
oh, that thing just came out, maybe.

76
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,400
Right. We'll use that. Right.

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,040
If it gets lucky. Yes, it can be.

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,000
That's the water world situation.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,680
And like it was ready at the time.

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,760
I don't know that years down the line, you'd sink a lot of money into water world.

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,160
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

82
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,240
But that being said, there is something that when I've been,

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,360
I find to appreciate there.

84
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,360
You know, I've taken my kids to to Disney World

85
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,120
out here on my side of the country.

86
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,080
And we went, my wife and I went to the what?

87
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,720
What's the avatars in the animal kingdom?

88
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,200
Right. That's where in the animal kingdom. Yeah.

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,840
Right. So we went there and I got sick

90
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,840
and had some big nasty drinks and made a fool of myself

91
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,240
by taking a picture that now all my friends mock me with.

92
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,680
And I guess probably will for the rest of my life.

93
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
And that's fine. Yeah.

94
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,400
Oh, yeah. I also have it ready to go.

95
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,440
Yeah. Jason pulled it up.

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,720
Jesse, Jesse, two drinks.

97
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,400
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

98
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,360
Yeah. And in that, you know, and I and that's not that's nothing I enjoyed.

99
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,680
But I appreciate that somebody took this much time.

100
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,800
Look, hey, somebody put some effort into this shit.

101
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,320
You know, you guys really you've made an attempt at doing something here.

102
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,160
And it's pretty cool. And my kids like it.

103
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
So there's stuff that I like about parks without.

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
I can't roll with the punches. You know what I mean?

105
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,720
I can't get on the coaster and whip my neck around and all that other kind of stuff.

106
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,720
But I can kind of bask in it and go, OK, somebody did a really good job

107
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
on this rock texture for this ride.

108
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,880
And also they there's like a good hot dog or something.

109
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,400
That's it's where I'm at with with this kind of stuff.

110
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,120
You know what I'm saying? Not too far from where we're at.

111
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,880
Yeah. Speaking our language here, we did a whole episode about fake rocks.

112
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,520
Right. We love fake rocks.

113
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,880
Fans of it's amazing fake tree that you were in front of in this photograph.

114
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,800
The tree of life.

115
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,760
It's no mere tree.

116
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,280
There's many animals carved into the bark of the fake tree,

117
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,600
the fake bark of the fake tree. Right.

118
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,600
Yeah. There are a lot of very talented artists and creative people

119
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,720
that have given their lives to these corporations in the as a tribute.

120
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,240
Their whole creativity is now given to a corporation.

121
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,440
And it's nice to see some of their work. Yeah. Yes.

122
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,960
Yeah, that's exactly right.

123
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,520
And yeah. And with with Dolly.

124
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,480
So my point was, is when when you asked me what, you know,

125
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,280
what what kind of what do you have feelings on for for in this world?

126
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,640
And I threw out Dollywood because I have been there one time.

127
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,080
And to me, that is the equivalent of caring about something enough to talk about it.

128
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,040
What I didn't realize is it's still open and you guys like it.

129
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,280
So you can just go and have a real experience there and have stuff to talk about.

130
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,360
That didn't occur to me that that would be a possibility.

131
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,640
But of course, and you should go, you know, when this is all over.

132
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,120
Oh, yeah. Believe, believe me.

133
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,320
Jesse, can I ask how do we how do you get to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee?

134
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,840
Can you tell me?

135
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,480
Because I have always wondered hard.

136
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,080
Is it fly into Nashville and then drive?

137
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,960
Is that the right course? Well, so the the Knoxville Airport,

138
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,480
which would be fairly close, is a regional airport.

139
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,200
OK, so if you are going, you're not going to be flying from L.A.

140
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,600
to Knoxville unless something drastic has changed.

141
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,280
Or if you're going to be on a plane that will provide such a horrible experience,

142
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,000
you'd never want to do it again.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,840
So, yeah, you would probably fly into Nashville

144
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,280
and then drive the three and a half or four hours up there.

145
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,480
Or honestly, North Carolina would probably be the way to go and then drive

146
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,240
backwards. So you go over it and then come back the other direction.

147
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,160
So it's not it's not super easy, I don't think. OK.

148
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,640
Yeah, that's what's been stopping me and other people

149
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,440
I know is like seemingly the difficulty of going.

150
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,520
And then also the rumor that it is a at least past a certain hour,

151
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,120
that it is a dry town.

152
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,640
I don't know if you can confirm or deny that.

153
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
Oh, you know, I don't know.

154
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,520
Pigeon Forge itself being dry, I'm not sure.

155
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,480
There are some quixotic laws in this area about that type of stuff.

156
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,320
I mean, I think most people probably know that

157
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,040
the home of the Jack Daniels distillery is it's a dry county,

158
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,400
which is a little bit strange.

159
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,000
I didn't know that, actually. Yeah, that's very bizarre.

160
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,960
Yeah, it's very strange.

161
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,240
I think you can get.

162
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,840
I'm not sure. Can you get samples there of the whiskey?

163
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,080
You may be able to get a sample there, but not you're not like not able

164
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,240
to buy like a big commemorative bottle or something, or they may have carved out

165
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,800
an exception in those in those laws for that area.

166
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,200
Yeah, but but that still does happen out here.

167
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,440
Blue laws are a real thing out here for sure.

168
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,040
And East Tennessee is a very old and very religious part of the country.

169
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,040
So that wouldn't surprise me at all. Yeah. Yeah.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,680
And yet we want to go after all this, we still are wanting to go.

171
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,160
You kind of get thrills.

172
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,520
Yeah, I want to hit Branson, too.

173
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,960
If I'm I know it's not super close, but just like do a whole.

174
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,800
Yeah, a whole dry loop.

175
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,840
Dry, a whole dry trip.

176
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,840
You might adopt that method.

177
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,880
You might stay dry after you go.

178
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,160
You'll realize there's something to it.

179
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,680
Yeah. So, yeah, we'll we'll do that.

180
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,240
I mean, Branson, I feel like is a whole saga.

181
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,560
Was that a daily?

182
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,720
That's a 19 part, at least.

183
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,280
We got to live there, though, for maybe a month.

184
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,840
Opry land and Branson feel similar in that when I've read about them,

185
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,560
it feels like I am I am consumed.

186
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm learning about like not alien culture,

187
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,560
but aliens trying to impersonate human culture.

188
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,520
Like Opry, Opry, the Grand Ole Opry is just a corner of country music

189
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,720
that I am like, I just don't understand Mini Pearl and he haul.

190
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,640
Like I just I it's it's just a little alien to me.

191
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,160
You know, I just didn't grow up with it in the northeast.

192
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,600
That's I think that is like a really good way of putting how I feel about opry land

193
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,480
specifically theme parks as a whole, but opry land even more specifically

194
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,920
because like I was alluding to earlier, this is clearly something that

195
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,440
and you can see this in all the videos.

196
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,840
I'm sure you guys looked at the the rides and stuff that they had there

197
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,640
and all of the kitsch and everything that was so crucial to what opry land was all about.

198
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,680
And the takeaway for me, even as someone who has lived here my whole life, is,

199
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,480
well, you guys really put a lot of effort into this, but it was stupid.

200
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,400
And I don't it's not I don't I didn't like it.

201
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,720
So that's not for me.

202
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,040
You did a good job, but I don't care.

203
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,880
And that's that's what opry land is.

204
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,400
That's what like Branson is.

205
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,520
It's like a lot of people caring a lot about something

206
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,200
that I might as well not even have encountered ever.

207
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,880
And that's why I feel so alien.

208
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,320
Like the the corny level is just cranked up all the way,

209
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,560
like big white leather boots and like, I just I don't want any part of this shit.

210
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,600
You know, all these places make me think of like lots of people

211
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,800
kicking up their heels and skirts, which are red, white and blue

212
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:02,080
and tassels many times over, like all these like between Branson and Opryland.

213
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,800
There's like like five thousand shows all told happening at any time.

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,960
And the shows are like essentially public domain songs for the most part.

215
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,680
Yeah. And also that's supposed to be funny, too.

216
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,320
That's the other thing that's so alien about it is it's not just

217
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,720
that's not just like an entertainment, like like you would go to the ballet

218
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,840
and watch someone like with technical proficiency perform something

219
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,720
you can't possibly imagine doing.

220
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,520
It's also like I mean, that's what a hootenanny is, is someone like

221
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,200
dancing a jig and you clap, but you're also laughing at the same time.

222
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,080
So I don't really know.

223
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,160
That isn't that's like a weird emotion I don't have.

224
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,640
You know, it's like hooting and hollering.

225
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,240
I don't know how to do that one.

226
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,400
Why are you laughing?

227
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,960
Because people are like looking like fools.

228
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,440
Yeah, because they're just kind of like, you know, they're getting they're really.

229
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,880
I don't know. I don't do it.

230
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,280
I don't know. I'm just trying to.

231
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,640
I'm not sure. I'm trying to put myself in their shoes.

232
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,520
But clearly, when you see the pans to the audience of one of these shows

233
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,400
and like you said, the skirt goes up way high.

234
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,360
It's like like what a relief to see the skirt go up so high.

235
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,280
That's so much fun.

236
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,400
I just have to like exhort, you know, it's like church.

237
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,320
Well, where if like like a Will Rogers type came out in a starched white cowboy outfit

238
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,280
and he he's like, I saw a senator standing next to a donkey.

239
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,400
Which was the politician and which was the ass?

240
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,320
And then just everyone laughs at that single joke for one hour straight.

241
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
I think I think growing up,

242
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,280
that was not a part of any entertainment, really.

243
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,160
But I will say the older I get, the more I like maybe my kitch,

244
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,480
my tolerance for love and love of kitch has just gone skyrocket.

245
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,200
I've been excuse me, I can't speak skyrocketed.

246
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,960
But I get more and more interested in like old he haw clips.

247
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
Let me ask you this, Jesse.

248
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,280
Do you know, have you seen the country bear jamboree?

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm familiar with the country bear jamboree.

250
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,600
Yes, I do. I know about that.

251
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,120
It is. I mean, that's what a hoot is right there, isn't it?

252
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,720
I think so. Like that's the and this is, of course, probably sacrilegious

253
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,840
to anyone who knows a lot about all these shows that, oh,

254
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,120
your favorite one is the one where there's robot bears.

255
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,200
But it's a very good version of it.

256
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,720
I find there's jokes in it that I think are funny.

257
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,880
I like the songs.

258
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,320
So like, I get how like this kind of a format could be fun.

259
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,840
So I and then look, we've built in, I think we've built in a failsafe

260
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,440
on this podcast where we like stuff, if it's really good or if it's really bad.

261
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,520
Right. Like there's almost the same enjoyment we can take from a show like that.

262
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,280
So that's why I feel like going to Branson, like maybe we'll see a show

263
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,640
that like, wow, that those songs are really good.

264
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,000
Those were great performers.

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
And then the other 90 percent of the shows were dog shit.

266
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,120
And we love them just as much.

267
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,760
I'll say I learned about I do remember in college

268
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,040
learning about like the grand olopry in the context of like an introduction

269
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,640
to mass media and popular culture in America of like

270
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,240
I had a very old, very white professor

271
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,600
who really wanted to tell us about jazz.

272
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,400
Like he had a lot to tell us about jazz and very, very lala land.

273
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,000
But he would also like enlightened us

274
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,480
into like, you know, Muddy Waters or Robert Johnson

275
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,080
or like the grand olopry in terms of like they were pretty small.

276
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,560
And then they just got insanely popular and they had this massive radio wattage

277
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,280
where like there was a certain point where you could hear it

278
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,680
anywhere in America with a radio.

279
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,000
So like I remember learning about it, like on an intellectual level

280
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,720
and like how it how it was important to the history of American media.

281
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,240
Some of the first like mass entertainment.

282
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,120
Yes, essentially. Yeah.

283
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,120
And like with a way wider reach than anything now, whatever.

284
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,120
Yeah. For some context, the grand olopry, and I didn't realize this

285
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,680
grand, it's kind of like the ground links where they're like

286
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,280
you had to be a member of it.

287
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,000
You would have to kind of get like audition to get in.

288
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,040
And then you would you could sort of be a member for as long as they would

289
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,960
either keep you or if you left.

290
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,320
And it's still like fairly exclusive.

291
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
But yeah, then it was like a radio show and.

292
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,920
Yes. Yeah. Other media.

293
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,800
Yeah, it's a it's a it's a phrase that means lots of different things.

294
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,160
Right. It's a place.

295
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,160
It's a it's yeah, it's like this echelon of country music society.

296
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,400
It's like I mean, it's like a proto hall of fame, I think, in a certain way,

297
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,400
because like the Hall of Fame is like downtown and Taylor Swift

298
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,600
owns it or whatever the hell.

299
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,760
But so this so in a way, the grand olopry is a little bit different.

300
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,400
It also does now sit in the parking lot of a mall, which, you know,

301
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,760
if we have time to talk about that, that would be it might be mostly that

302
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,720
I was going to say a parking lot in a mall.

303
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,040
This is podcast the ride. Yes.

304
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,520
Well, that's well here.

305
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,800
Let me let me jump in with with some dry expositional stuff,

306
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,240
because I think what we haven't said maybe is Opryland USA

307
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,960
was outside of Nashville from 1972 to 1997.

308
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,120
And it was a theme park that was supposed to flesh out

309
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,080
the surrounding area of the Grand Ole Opry Theatre.

310
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,200
Jason was talking a little bit about, you know, the operating, Jesse saying

311
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,440
it's it's many things.

312
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,560
I think I always thought until right now that it was a venue only.

313
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,160
And what I didn't realize it was is that it was a radio show and a review

314
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,520
that moved from place to place, eventually landed at the Ryman

315
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,800
Auditorium, historic venue.

316
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,840
But that started falling into disrepair.

317
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,120
And it would during the summer, it get to be 120 degrees sitting in that thing.

318
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,560
So they needed something more updated.

319
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,000
And they were talking about how to do this and where to do it.

320
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,160
And whoever was putting all this together

321
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,880
when visited Astro World, which we discussed several years ago.

322
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,480
And Astro World is a theme park that is sort of like fleshing out

323
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,800
the adjoining area of the the Astro Dome, the Astro Dome's at the center.

324
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,920
How do we make this more of an experience as a bunch of shops and hotels

325
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,160
and a theme park?

326
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,560
So what if we could do something like that?

327
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,760
And for more information about Astro World, check out our episode about that.

328
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
But obviously, but where Batman Nick Mundy

329
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,480
Batman, the Batman waits around every corner.

330
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,480
But besides all that, yes, it was like,

331
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,520
yeah, how do we like make this more than just a theater?

332
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,560
This this this would be a bigger experience than like creating

333
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,640
a whole little community and city around it.

334
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,960
Yeah, when I was looking back into some of this stuff, because I was

335
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,760
so I was I guess I was 10 when Opryland closed.

336
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,280
So it wasn't like this was a huge part of my childhood, really.

337
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,560
I wasn't going there when I was like a preteen.

338
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,800
I didn't work there as a teenager or any of that kind of stuff.

339
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,080
It was already gone by that point for me.

340
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,000
But when I was looking back into this, I thought it was funny to hear

341
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,840
that same pitch of once we build this, then we'll build all this stuff around it.

342
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,000
And and and then it will be this hub of

343
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,720
economy for the city and for these jobs and all this stuff,

344
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,000
which now I would only associate basically only, I think,

345
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,680
associated with sports arenas and stadiums and stuff like that.

346
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,320
This is the same pitch that they make now, chiefly as a way to get money

347
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,760
from the city or county or state or whatever, to help them build

348
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,880
these massive places and defer their tax payments way into the future

349
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,840
when they've already blown the place up and left town.

350
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,120
But I thought it was really funny to hear that pitched around

351
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,040
what is essentially like like a roller coaster in the middle of the city.

352
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,480
I just that was so weird.

353
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,240
It's such a weird throwback to hear that this was this is what

354
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,160
risk guys, I guess, have always done this. Right.

355
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,680
This is like, yeah, this is like L.A.

356
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,360
Live by the Staples Center. Right.

357
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,320
And what's that other what's that nightmare one by the the Banneheim?

358
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
The do you remember the name anymore?

359
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,200
Well, the worst name.

360
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,640
It's really good, but I can't think of it.

361
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,600
Yeah. Yeah.

362
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,760
With so many like ones instead of eyes and exclamation points

363
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
instead of everything.

364
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,720
Awful name.

365
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,000
These places are, yeah, always in.

366
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
I guess what you're describing, Jesse, is sort of like, all right,

367
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,400
one super rich guy leads the army.

368
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,000
Like we're going to build a big arena or something.

369
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,240
And oh, wait, while I got the opportunity, they might 20 other rich friends

370
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,200
want to come in the door real fast and get in on this scam with me.

371
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,840
Yeah, they these guys want to run the parking for the six blocks around this whole area.

372
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,600
You know, this guy owns the construction company that's digging the footers

373
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,280
for the arena and all this stuff. And it's just a massive.

374
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,920
I mean, it's it's grift.

375
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,480
What else could it possibly be just on this massive scale?

376
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,000
But instead of covered in the cloak of this is this will be a fun thing to have on Sundays.

377
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,280
And then the aforementioned Taylor Swift can come by twice a year

378
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,360
and justify the box seats here.

379
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,520
It's like, oh, this will be cute because it's like country music or whatever.

380
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,480
And apparently the guys, apparently the guy really cared about it.

381
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,720
That was that's at least what's been written in the history books

382
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,560
that he really cared about country music or whatever.

383
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,280
And maybe he did.

384
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,560
But it's hard to see the the complex itself as anything other than what it was,

385
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,600
which was a moneymaker, even until it closed.

386
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,400
Yeah. The CEO of Gaylord.

387
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,960
Is that the that what we're describing?

388
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Yeah, they took it over at a certain point,

389
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,760
just like it's now been taken over by Marriott.

390
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,480
So it's changed hands, I think, a number of times over the over the years.

391
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,280
The property up there. Yeah.

392
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,320
Yeah, there was a couple of times where it's like I had to keep reading,

393
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:02,120
like histories of this because, you know, I feel like I was skeptical or I was suspicious.

394
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,880
And it's like, oh, like you're saying, I think he did care about this place.

395
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,960
But there there was a moment when I found the old logos

396
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,840
where the tagline was the home of American music.

397
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,640
And to their credit, they did try to have like

398
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,280
country and jazz and rock and roll.

399
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,520
And they even seem to admit that, like rock and roll was change.

400
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,760
Like they areas would try to change with the times a little bit.

401
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,880
But now I feel like if something has a tagline home of American music,

402
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,080
I'm just like, oh, geez, what's this? Oh, no.

403
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,240
Like, I'm just immediately terrified of what about what is about to happen.

404
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,560
Yeah. And I think that that's that's something I think about when I when I hear people

405
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,920
complain about what it has become now, which, you know, in one sense,

406
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,360
is it true now that it has become essentially, you know, a a generic,

407
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,880
you know, monstrosity, a pay into capitalism,

408
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,080
just a big nasty mall that you go and fart around in and eat the bacon wrapped, whatever.

409
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,280
I mean, yeah, it has. And that sucks.

410
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,680
And then it flooded and then they built it back up again,

411
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,560
which is even grosser for some reason, not that it was their fault.

412
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,320
They flooded. But the that's true.

413
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,400
But when people say they took this away from us, this was real Nashville.

414
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
This is what Nashville was all about.

415
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,320
This is before Nashville sold out.

416
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,040
I fucking start getting really like grossed out by that, because to me,

417
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,920
it's a very clear implication of what people really think about a city

418
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,760
getting bigger and more diverse and more inclusive

419
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,200
and wanting this this history to be constrained to one very particular thing,

420
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,360
which is like, I mean, it's like white people shit.

421
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,080
I mean, that's what it is.

422
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,800
It's just and and country music is great and it has a place and all this other stuff.

423
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,360
But when people are like, they took this away from us and they get like

424
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,600
really upset about it now, now I'm out, you know, I'm out on the whole.

425
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,880
You can be upset a little bit, but don't be.

426
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,320
This can't be your whole life.

427
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,120
Crusading for opera land. What the fuck?

428
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,880
No, hang on. Hey, they did have a now they had a rollercoaster

429
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,120
that looked like a big dragon's face and they carved all the teeth.

430
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,680
Isn't that something worth fighting for?

431
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,240
Going to the mat for?

432
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,440
Yeah, you're right.

433
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,480
Do you want Diddy City?

434
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,920
Oh, yeah. Oh, come on. Yeah.

435
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,240
That's a that's a paradise from the sound of it.

436
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,720
My America is Dewa Diddy City.

437
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Nessy Plunge, Nessy Plunge.

438
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,600
That real well.

439
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,920
OK, so the dulcimer splash,

440
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,400
formerly the flume zoom and for a brief period of time, the Nessy Splunge.

441
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,960
That was the log ride in the park.

442
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,000
I have to give this park credit because the ride names are all fun.

443
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,320
That said, I was a little shocked to discover that the rollercoaster

444
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,480
called the Hangman was rolled out in 1995.

445
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,840
That seems far too late.

446
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,160
Yeah, that is kind of I guess that's kind of gruesome.

447
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,200
But you look at it and it kind of is like it is they named it right.

448
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,160
You know, it is your hang.

449
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,880
You're hanging there.

450
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,320
So I don't didn't see a picture of the hangman.

451
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,440
I don't know what the hangman's about.

452
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,800
Why did they build a ride so close to being closed?

453
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,880
Like it was closed two years later.

454
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,280
Well, that's the other thing that is, I think, very interesting about this park

455
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,960
is like all of the like look backs and after actions.

456
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,560
No one is taking credit.

457
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,600
No one has an answer for why it closed.

458
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,480
It's like besides, you know, like Jesse's talking about, like corporates,

459
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,800
corporations consolidating and stuff, there's no like,

460
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,480
oh, we wanted to do this instead or like, oh, there was safety incident or like it.

461
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,520
Everyone honestly seems a little confused about why it closed.

462
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,200
Yeah. Do we know, just to go back to Jesse's point, do we know like,

463
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,480
was there a big uproar when this closed?

464
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,680
Was this like a Confederate monument being taken down when upland closed

465
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,880
and people were very upset about it?

466
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,040
Or was it just like, oh, that's a shame.

467
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,840
Like, what do we know?

468
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,440
I don't remember contemporaneously with it happening that it was a big thing.

469
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,320
Is it? Yeah.

470
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,920
Because of course, you look at all the videos or you do any kind of reading

471
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,640
and there is that sort of I don't know if you'd call it rose colored glasses,

472
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,920
but definitely the prioritization, the the wistfulness about the past

473
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,760
that is like really common.

474
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,840
I mean, with essentially everything, we love fandoms and we love

475
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,760
we love our innocent childhoods and we love all the other shit

476
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,320
that makes us go out of our fucking minds.

477
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,240
But with theme parks in particular, right, that are aimed at pushing

478
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,280
that button in your brain, that that's the stuff that you like.

479
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
I think there is a lot more of that with old rides

480
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,880
or or old movies or whatever that go by the wayside.

481
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,000
I think people feel that way more more often about this than other stuff.

482
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,840
But I don't remember at the time.

483
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
I mean, it wasn't like a protest.

484
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,640
You know, I think it just I think it just quietly went away,

485
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,040
but it seemed very popular.

486
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,320
I think if they brought it back, in fact, they there was talk of it

487
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,160
being brought back in some capacity with Dolly Parton.

488
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,000
And that was like a huge deal around here.

489
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,600
That was just a few years ago that people were really excited about that.

490
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,600
Do we so we don't know if maybe an early version of Antifa was behind

491
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,760
taking up land down.

492
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,600
We don't know that for sure.

493
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,640
We don't know for sure.

494
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,520
But I mean, I'm reporting it, obviously.

495
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,400
I just I just don't know it.

496
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,960
Yeah, people are saying more and more. Yeah.

497
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,200
Those floods, there were several floods in this area and we don't, you know,

498
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,840
I don't know if this Antifa put some holes in some dams

499
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,040
or like put the extra water in a river or something.

500
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,720
Well, I mean, we know how much they love soup.

501
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,160
Is it possible that the soup was being opened up and poured into the soup?

502
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,400
Very chunky displaces more water than just water alone.

503
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,040
So something to think about.

504
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,440
A thickening agent.

505
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah. If you're looking to create a flood, add a lot of soup to a river.

506
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,560
Right. Yeah.

507
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,720
I guess, Jesse, you were the like on the ground source of this.

508
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,080
And you and it's foggy memories.

509
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,760
It's before you were 10. But

510
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,720
what do you remember about it?

511
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,560
Were there were there things worth saving?

512
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,080
Do you have positive memories here?

513
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,160
Yeah, I I think I do.

514
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,880
You know, the I also know that I've always been lame my whole life.

515
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,160
So I never would have gone on the hangman ride.

516
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,880
I might have seen it and been terrified and that would that would have been the end of it.

517
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:52,480
I would not surprise me at all if the extent of my being in Opryland was

518
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:59,680
my mom taking me there and us getting on the they're called the 10 Lizzy's,

519
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,840
I think the extremely loud go kart motored.

520
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,760
I mean, those are the worst things in any park to me.

521
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,880
I don't know if you guys agree with that.

522
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,520
Have you ever sat on one of these things?

523
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,480
I don't know in this in this like, yeah, what?

524
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,720
I don't think so. I have. Yeah.

525
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,240
It's pretty much like an Autopia engine, but like on a Model T

526
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,360
like frame, like a Model T style frame and a lot of older parks

527
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,440
keep these going.

528
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,320
Like sometimes it's their vintage like this has been here since the 20s

529
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,920
and we've just kind of like kept it up where we've swapped out some parts.

530
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,640
They're the type of thing you would see at a zoo,

531
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,680
not necessarily like a like an actual proper park.

532
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,880
This is like the thing that you pay 50 cents and get on at the zoo

533
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,040
and you feel like shit when you get your asses.

534
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,000
What's that thing where your ass gets like really vibrated and it like itches?

535
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,560
You know what I'm talking about?

536
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,040
Oh, yeah, I know that.

537
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,840
I know that. OK, you know that one.

538
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,960
OK, yeah. Clever relating.

539
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,720
And I don't know if there's a name for it. It hurts.

540
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,080
Yeah, it's a it's got to be maybe a spine.

541
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,160
It's maybe it's partly a spine, like a lower part of your spine gets

542
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,840
like jacked up a little bit.

543
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,560
I don't know. I need it. I need it.

544
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,600
I need a better ass.

545
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,760
But it wouldn't surprise me if I went and got on the tin Lizzy's

546
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,080
and got on some kind of like tram

547
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,800
and then maybe got on the log ride, which that's to me is what

548
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,000
was emblematic of the park is the the flume,

549
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,640
which Jason, you said it was called the Nestea plunge.

550
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,200
Is that real? That was real.

551
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,600
That was real for like, I think, one summer.

552
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,840
OK, it was, I think, originally called the flume zoom.

553
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,720
And then at some point, the dulcimer splash log ride.

554
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,840
That is not the last utterance of dulcimer coming to this.

555
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Oh, that's right.

556
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
That

557
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,880
on this key plunge was a that that was like a slogan.

558
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,480
That was that was a campaign for that was a campaign.

559
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,360
OK, nasty.

560
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,520
So to turn that into a famous phrase we all love.

561
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,080
That's crazy.

562
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,320
It was also look, I hate I have to say it.

563
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,120
It was also a bump that Mick Foley would regularly regularly take.

564
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,840
He would fall onto the concrete, like on his back from the ring apron in wrestling.

565
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,640
So I just had to say that because it's a thing.

566
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,320
I know it was called the Nestea plunge.

567
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,400
And Nestea plunge is a really ugly looking bump he would take in wrestling.

568
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,360
And that was an endorsement.

569
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,720
Uh, I know that was not an official Nestea endorsed.

570
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,280
He wouldn't get like 50 bucks every time he landed on his back on the concrete.

571
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,920
Please, he deserves it.

572
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,840
The McMahon family are dignified people.

573
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,240
They wouldn't do something like that.

574
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,360
He was doing it before he was doing it in WCW.

575
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,600
Oh, OK. So Ted Turner, Ted Turner owed him the money there.

576
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,600
Who shockingly does not come up in the history of this.

577
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,120
Very good. Yeah.

578
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,880
So we need to there's not been a lot of Ted Turner on this podcast,

579
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,120
but we should correct that.

580
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,760
He you know where he came up?

581
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,480
The the Sid and Marty Croft Park,

582
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,520
the short lived indoors.

583
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,960
Yeah. Sid and Marty Croft Park in Atlanta is now the CNN building.

584
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,080
Yeah, I'm also a fan of Ted's Montana Grill,

585
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,360
his like mediocre burger restaurant.

586
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,240
But that's oddly satisfying to me.

587
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,760
People will be so mad that several times when I've been to New York City

588
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
for only a few days, I'm like, you know, I really want to go.

589
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Ted's Montana Grill.

590
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,440
No, you've been there multiple times.

591
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,560
Yes, I was like I was in New York.

592
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,960
I was only there for like three days and like with that short amount of time,

593
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,480
you know what I need to do?

594
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,920
Ted's Montana Grill. Really?

595
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,880
This is new information to us.

596
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,520
It's a tourist. Yeah.

597
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,320
This is a Patreon episode, I think. Wow. Sure. Sure.

598
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,480
Gladly. It's one of my favorite restaurants.

599
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,760
When you're in New York, you got to go.

600
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,280
Well, hey, folks, an exciting thing I learned about the the now

601
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,440
Opry Mills, Grand Ole Opry, the existing complex as of 2020,

602
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,280
one of the old Opry land buildings that had flooded during the 2010 floods

603
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,920
has been repaired.

604
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,760
And again, this is as of 2020 is now a Paula Deen's family kitchen.

605
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,120
So, Jesse, do people get canceled in Nashville?

606
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,200
Has that do they know about that concept yet?

607
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,960
Wait, is that true?

608
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,320
It's it's on the Opry land.

609
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,200
This is news to me. It's it's on the Opry land.

610
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,640
I mean, is that is what I was reading about?

611
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,440
Yeah, supposedly.

612
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,160
I want to pull it up. Yeah.

613
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,360
That's cool. There's one at Pigeon Forge and and maybe a few more.

614
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,720
And yeah, one at Opry Mills.

615
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,760
You're right. I had not I had not seen that.

616
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,880
That's interesting to me.

617
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,960
That's I mean, it's not surprising.

618
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,480
She's I mean, she's going to make money still, obviously.

619
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,160
I actually I have I have like three knives in my drawer

620
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,440
that I laugh at every time I pull out that say Paula Deen on there

621
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,840
in a very racist script.

622
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,240
No, it looks it's normal.

623
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,000
It's a normal font. It's a normal font.

624
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,360
It's a normal. But yeah, you get that.

625
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,680
Yeah, I think I gave my mom like the guy Fieri pan.

626
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,560
What year for Christmas?

627
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,400
They like to sell these pants at the stores now like any celebrity chef. Yeah.

628
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,840
How are the knives?

629
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,800
I do use that.

630
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,720
I'll tell you what I use the knives for most most often is they are sort of

631
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,280
my designated styrofoam pack opening knife where it's like it's it's the

632
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,520
it's the big it's the chicken breasts that are to they're too big.

633
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,440
They're too big.

634
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,600
And there's three of them in the package.

635
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,040
And this is the knife I take out and I slice that open

636
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,920
and then immediately throw it in the dishwasher because I don't care.

637
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,160
I don't need to do anything else with it.

638
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,280
I'm not taking any risk.

639
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,080
It's just it has one job and it goes right in the dishwasher.

640
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,200
And I kind of like it for that.

641
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,800
So I give it an A plus.

642
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,200
And I think she should have more restaurants, actually.

643
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,760
I think she's a great.

644
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,360
Does he think for being here? OK, new topic.

645
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,800
But let's

646
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,960
let's talk about some other stuff in the in the park

647
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,440
before the last hour and a half of Mills conversation.

648
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,720
I I'll just throw a name.

649
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,080
See if you remember any of these.

650
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,240
I mean, I think we brought it up before that.

651
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,560
You know, there's all these country areas, but of course, we're rock and roll guys.

652
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,160
We go our eyes look at that map and go straight to the rock place,

653
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,040
which for a while was called music of today.

654
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,360
And in music of today,

655
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,920
that's where you could go on the ride Little Deuce Coupe.

656
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,240
Circa 1984.

657
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,320
Yeah, that's very cool.

658
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

659
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,120
Also, also a ride there, apparently called Rock and Roller Coaster

660
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,760
before Disney did it. Yes.

661
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,520
And they had a little Rock and Roller Coaster. Oh, wow.

662
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
There was a smaller version.

663
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,960
Yeah. So they I guess they didn't copyright that name.

664
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,200
I could have saved the entire thing.

665
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,680
Yeah, I think it's generic enough.

666
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,080
I think that what could you what's copyrightable?

667
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,440
Yeah, it rocks.

668
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,120
Well, I mean, it'd be more than that, I think, to get in front of a judge or whatever.

669
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,080
That's like Paris Sultan trying to copyright.

670
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,200
It's hot. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

671
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Or thing.

672
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,800
Yeah, I guess that's a good point.

673
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,840
I guess I guess maybe Disney probably, though, has copywritten

674
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,160
the words Rock and Roller Coaster.

675
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,080
Yes. Oh, yeah. Certainly they've done it.

676
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,560
Yeah. Yeah, they're they're smarter.

677
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,880
And they're and unlike Operaland, they're still around.

678
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Yeah.

679
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,520
I there's a question.

680
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,680
I think you're you were correct in what you said before.

681
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,680
I don't think that this is their fault.

682
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,080
But the the the site has flooded twice.

683
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,440
It flooded when it was a theme park and it flooded when it was a mall.

684
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,240
Are we sure this is not their fault?

685
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,200
Was this a poorly picked location?

686
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,560
If if it is going to flood many, many years apart and completely unrelated events?

687
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,560
I yeah, I I'm not a geologist.

688
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,800
And I also don't know what the right word is to say about someone who does know

689
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,000
any of that stuff.

690
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,080
But I know I think it's probably geologists.

691
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,200
There's rocks underground.

692
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,920
So that kind of makes a lot of sense.

693
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,080
What I said, a quologist like a study water.

694
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Yeah. Yeah.

695
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,960
My understanding is that those were what's called 100 year floods.

696
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,840
So analyzing the science, it's supposed to happen once every 100 years or so.

697
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,960
So the fact that it happened twice in that whatever 25 year period

698
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,960
is several times more frequent than you would expect.

699
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,720
Now, why is that happening?

700
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,360
Maybe you don't lift up that rock and start thinking about why we're having a lot

701
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,000
more floods and other natural disasters.

702
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,200
But I don't I don't I don't know that the people behind Opryland are necessarily

703
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,760
completely responsible for for that.

704
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,960
But honestly, around here, it's surprising to me it hasn't been demolished by a

705
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,800
tornado. I mean, that's honestly the thing that happens here more than anything else.

706
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,240
And Nashville has had several big ones in that time period.

707
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,480
So, I mean, stuff's going to get fucked up for sure.

708
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,480
It's not it's not L.A.

709
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,320
We will get fucked up pretty much all the time living out here.

710
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,880
And Florida, on the other hand, is just going to take about 100 years and then

711
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,360
we'll be completely fucked. But in the meantime, I guess, is OK.

712
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,240
But yeah, this this type of shit does happen.

713
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,640
So I don't know where they would put it that would keep it from from getting

714
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,480
fucked up. I think that's just the way of life out here.

715
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
You know? Yeah.

716
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,200
So it's well, they don't have like a Disney weather machine or anything.

717
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,320
They don't have the money. No, no, they don't.

718
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,320
I think so. That like we wait.

719
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,080
Do you think Disney will ever get up to that?

720
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,880
Will they will they be the ones to spearhead like a carbon conversion

721
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,600
machine that's specifically over Orlando?

722
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,320
That's a good question. So, yeah, Disney, just purely out of a profit motive

723
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,320
will solve some aspect of global warming.

724
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,160
Mm hmm. A big blimp that looks like Mickey and it looks like it's like ingesting

725
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,080
some substance, like he's getting out another.

726
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,920
He's like he's like hot boxing or something like carbon.

727
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,560
And then like a vaporizer.

728
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,920
And then it tilts backwards and spits it up out of the

729
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,280
our atmosphere into space for us.

730
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,600
Give me a hint of that carbon.

731
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,960
Well, oh, yeah.

732
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,560
But I mean, they could certainly afford to fund at least the research.

733
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,080
They have all those crazy research relationships with like Carnegie Mellon or so.

734
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,120
But like what peaks we've had behind the scenes.

735
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,840
I have we have learned that it's like, yeah, this one the company pays for.

736
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,000
It's a little expensive.

737
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,880
This you can get on the app store.

738
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,280
And it's like, oh, that's how you plan stuff.

739
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,760
It's available on iOS just on the app store. I see.

740
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,120
I will say, though, I think if you look at most of the corporations during covid,

741
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,600
we're going to have to have a much worse crisis before any of them step up and do a lot.

742
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,480
So like they'll have to we'll have to be like melting from the sun.

743
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,520
Like humans will be like half melted before like a corporation goes, huh?

744
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,880
Maybe we could use our money to do something.

745
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,400
I can see them starting the Mickey atmospheric balloon program

746
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,160
and then laying everybody off right in the middle of it.

747
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,680
I think that would maybe be the compromise they aimed for.

748
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,720
Yeah, I think that's very possible.

749
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,280
They just have one person who operates it like a drone.

750
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,560
And that is otherwise they can fire 20,000 people.

751
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,440
Yes. Or it's just Bob J.

752
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Pack operating it.

753
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,040
It's just the guy. Yeah.

754
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,200
Yeah, just one guy.

755
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,680
Fly, Mickey.

756
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,920
Um, I OK, what else is what else is in this place?

757
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,600
The we didn't say what Grizzly River's coupe.

758
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,280
Oh, I was going to say Little Deuce Coupe is a teacup style ride

759
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
housed in a geodesic dome.

760
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,640
That's pretty good.

761
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,560
I'm not sure why that's a named after a car song, but why not?

762
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,160
A hip modern car song.

763
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,360
Really? Yeah, no, no, Hipper song.

764
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:24,080
A song that I once performed in a lip sync fashion with a Boy Scout troop.

765
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,920
Really? Yeah, yeah.

766
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,360
And there was a part that I, if you can imagine, spearheaded.

767
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,960
You know what we should do?

768
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,480
You know what would be fun, fellow kids of 1995?

769
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,920
Do you have video of that?

770
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,720
I, you know, I should look into it because I can't deprive the audience of that.

771
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,120
I do remember that there's a part about the pink slip daddy,

772
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,080
and then we all pulled out a little pink piece of paper.

773
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,520
And I'm going to be red as I decide.

774
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,880
Describe this.

775
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,280
Well, my dad helps choreograph it.

776
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,680
Oh, man.

777
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,160
There's some great revelations on this episode.

778
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,880
Yeah, great is one word.

779
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,280
Mortifying is another.

780
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,040
I can't not say it, though.

781
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,280
Did we, did we, can I just confirm that the music of today area,

782
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,680
they eventually threw in the towel and renamed it Dewa Diddy City?

783
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,560
That's correct.

784
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,060
Okay.

785
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,680
That's right, yes.

786
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,840
They just like Diddy Diddy Dum Diddy Do a very much more modern name.

787
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:29,980
Yeah.

788
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,800
Named after a more modern song.

789
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,280
I was just looking the year end songs 1984.

790
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,120
Number one, when doves cry Prince.

791
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,240
What's love got to do with it?

792
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,600
Number two, say, say, say number three, footloose number four.

793
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,720
Those were the songs of the day, just for context.

794
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:53,240
So that's that's actually like that makes me feel better about the theming of this place,

795
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,160
because that's I guess with the exception of the print song,

796
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,720
those are extremely corny tunes.

797
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,960
I think because I thought I thought like, I don't know,

798
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,560
when you think of songs of 1984, is that is that what you go to?

799
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,040
Do you immediately think does that make sense to you when you read that?

800
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,400
Or were you thinking of something else?

801
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,640
Well, I was thinking of like New Wave stuff,

802
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,960
but if I think about 1984, I'm probably thinking of stuff that wasn't as big of a,

803
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,960
I'm thinking of like what Elvis Costello was doing,

804
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,440
but he never really had a like he was never like number one on the charts or anything.

805
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,640
Yeah, and I was thinking of like metal, you know?

806
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,440
Yeah, right.

807
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,400
Jump was on the charts by Van Halen.

808
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:35,720
Cool.

809
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,320
You forget that pop music.

810
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,120
I'm gonna sound like a real piece of shit.

811
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,600
You forget that pop music has always sucked.

812
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,040
And when you think back of stuff that was like,

813
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,200
like, oh, that's what this era was.

814
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,160
It wasn't that.

815
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,960
That's what either the cool shit was or the or maybe like the really uncool shit

816
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,480
that has since become cool.

817
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,760
But the very tip toppy of the crop there was always kind of bad.

818
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,000
So it makes sense that this was also bad and like poorly themed to me.

819
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,840
Anyway, it was just a little older.

820
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Yeah, I mean, I think a little bit behind.

821
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,760
I think the Grammys, if you watch a Grammys broadcast until about 1989,

822
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,160
it was still extremely like, you know, up with people.

823
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,280
Is that the name of the great?

824
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,880
Is it like very like corny Starland vocal band?

825
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,960
Like shows at Opryland, honestly.

826
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,960
It took a long time before things weren't lame as hell.

827
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,880
It's almost like logic defying now that the Grammys would start

828
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,240
with a big Kendrick Lamar performance or something because like,

829
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,000
everything was 40 white people harmonizing.

830
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,120
Like I think almost into the 90s, perhaps through still a lot of it.

831
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,360
But even though like the way we look at it, I mean, I remember in high school,

832
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,040
like freshman or sophomore year in high school, this just sticks out in my mind so clearly.

833
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:03,880
Comedy Central would show this commercial for like hits of the 80s,

834
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,040
like new wave hits of the 80s with clips from the music videos.

835
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,440
And me and my dork friends just thought it was like the funniest thing we had ever seen.

836
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Like, can you believe this shit?

837
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,120
Like, you know, and then a few years later, Grand Theft Auto Vice City comes out

838
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,760
and then everyone's like, man, these songs are awesome.

839
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,120
What happened to these?

840
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:30,520
Like we like framing device, the branding like totally worked on us

841
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,400
where it's like, man, the radio stations in this game rock.

842
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,880
Yeah, I mean, cooler.

843
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,320
I mean, if you look, I would say you would say a lot of that.

844
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,520
I'm looking at the whole chart now.

845
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,000
I think you would think a lot of the songs are cheesy.

846
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,120
There's nothing like Break My Stride by Matthew Wilder, 27.

847
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,360
That's the coolest song.

848
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,600
Yeah, it's a corny, corny song.

849
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,720
Also, what I keep thinking in my head is the solo on What's Love Got To Do With It, which is so...

850
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,080
Like, what is that plate?

851
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,520
Is that a child's keyboard?

852
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,840
Is that played on a baby's toy?

853
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,040
I don't know what any of this shit, I don't know what any of the sounds were.

854
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,680
My wife loves movies of this...

855
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,760
I guess it's probably this era.

856
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,280
Now, if I mention a movie that's not in this era, I'm gonna get my ass torn to shreds.

857
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:26,680
But she loves the stuff from when we grew up that to me is very, very corny and unwatchable.

858
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,160
I'll stream at night here on the computer.

859
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,880
I'll go upstairs and she'll have, for instance, a Polly Shore movie on.

860
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,400
I have no interest in watching that.

861
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,720
Not even for ironic sensibility.

862
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,760
Like, I just want to be out of the room when that stuff is on.

863
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,880
And last night I walked up and she was watching Sister Act with the kids.

864
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,200
And the kids couldn't follow it at all.

865
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,840
But she was really enjoying herself.

866
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,720
And I was like, God damn, this movie is so corny.

867
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,360
At the end of the movie, I don't know if you guys have ever seen this,

868
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:07,640
At the end of the movie, Whoopi Goldberg is leading her choir of nuns in...

869
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,360
Oh my God, I'm not gonna be able to remember the song.

870
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,160
But it's a song...

871
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,480
I will follow him or is that used earlier?

872
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,400
Maybe that is it.

873
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,960
Yeah, I think that's it.

874
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,440
Because the joke of the movie was often taking songs about men and making them about God.

875
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,800
That was one of the running gags of the movie.

876
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,000
So they were doing that.

877
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,400
And then at the end, the Pope stands up and gives them a standing ovation.

878
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,120
And Whoopi's like, hey, check this guy out.

879
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,080
What the fuck?

880
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,440
This wasn't a movie theater?

881
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,640
I can't believe this shit.

882
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,240
That's crazy to me.

883
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,280
And that's what all this is.

884
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,760
It's just, I can't believe people were doing it.

885
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,680
Like kids, there were eight-year-old kids going, little deuce coop.

886
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,160
And then like, Scott.

887
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:49,960
It's me, yes.

888
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,520
I'm the one.

889
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,600
Proudly.

890
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,600
Something truly for all ages.

891
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,920
The term all ages meant something in this time period.

892
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,840
Little kids and old people and everyone in between had the fucking exact same interests.

893
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,560
What a nightmare.

894
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:12,600
This, I think, is a good point to transition into a video that I have,

895
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:17,160
which might move us into a next general area to discuss.

896
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,200
I have here, I will screen share.

897
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:29,400
This is a clip from a special, from 1988 called Opryland 200 years of American music.

898
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,160
Right now you're looking at Frankie Avalon.

899
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,920
I was going to jump.

900
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,840
I was going to show a really specific thing here,

901
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,960
but since with what we've been talking about, I feel like I should jump around.

902
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:46,680
You'll just see random frames here, like a lot of people all doing the same dance on a big staircase,

903
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,680
which I think is in the Opryland Hotel.

904
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,680
I mean, this is all ages entertainment big time.

905
00:48:53,400 --> 00:49:02,600
Just giant hair and giant earrings on Barbara Mandrell in a giant, giant shoulder gold drape.

906
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:10,600
I mean, it's just hours and hours of the corniest, you know, he harsh stuff ever kind of hopping all

907
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,320
around the campus because I feel like there were like 20 different places to do shows at Opryland,

908
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,000
as well as the boat.

909
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,760
We haven't talked about the boat yet.

910
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,240
Oh, wow.

911
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,360
It's still around.

912
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,000
The boat's called the General Jackson and it's parked in the Opry Mills parking lot.

913
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,360
You ever done it?

914
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,240
You ever been on the boat?

915
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,000
I've never been on the boat, never been tempted to go on the boat.

916
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,160
It is, I think one time I accidentally got stuck in the little rounded driveway that the boat

917
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,640
like maintains that I was, I was like trying to get away.

918
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,840
I was trying to go in the right lane.

919
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,840
I accidentally got in there and I was like, oh, it looks like I'm going to get on the

920
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,200
fucking boat.

921
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:46,840
I don't want to do this.

922
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,640
And you know, kind of like peel out of there.

923
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,120
But I've never been tempted by the General Jackson.

924
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,640
Car got trapped on the boat.

925
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,960
So it's a three hour loop filled with ragtime.

926
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,800
Oh, no, I have to have all ages fun.

927
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,800
Not if you blast metal from the car and just like keep laying on the horn until they stop.

928
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,160
Has there been any talk of renaming this boat?

929
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,640
I'm going to guess no.

930
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,080
I'm going to guess no.

931
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,920
And in here, let me see if I get lucky.

932
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,760
I'm going to play a second of the song and if it's part of the song that I'm thinking

933
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,440
of, then it'll make its point for me.

934
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,040
If not, I will stop it.

935
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,920
Here's a little sample from this Opryland musical special.

936
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,160
Nope, it did it.

937
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:35,800
It said it.

938
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,680
This is a lot of people in shiny.

939
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,800
There's those huge skirts like I was talking about.

940
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,640
Big circle skirts flying up and they are waiting on the Robert E. Lee.

941
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,040
Guys actually did see there.

942
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,400
There was talk last year of renaming it to the HMS Paula Dean.

943
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,760
So that's cool.

944
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,960
Can I confirm it's Stonewall Jackson, not Andrew Jackson?

945
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,640
I would have to.

946
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,680
I would guess, right?

947
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,240
I mean, six of one and the other.

948
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,880
It's not much better, but if we could get Trump to tweet about this before he's

949
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,400
not president anymore, that would be.

950
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,560
We'll make that a priority.

951
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,720
Yeah, it'll be his main thing, I think.

952
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,360
So that's a little taste of the special.

953
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,400
Boy, this goes on.

954
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,480
You get off the boat and marching bands are lit and then we go into the Opry.

955
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,960
I think that was a little Lyle Lovett.

956
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,760
No, not Lyle Lovett.

957
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,880
That's a Chris Isma.

958
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,000
Yeah, that's cool.

959
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,640
Anyways, but what I was going to show was, of course, the rock and roll section.

960
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,160
They jump all around the park.

961
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,040
There's a Beach Boys performance.

962
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,320
Most of these performances are by a very old man.

963
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,840
Let me just get a taste of this.

964
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,200
Is he singing like this to mock the Beach Boys?

965
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,880
He's also engaging in like Tim Conway-esque antics.

966
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,400
He's on a rapid ride.

967
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,880
The guy singing in this bad falsetto and it's sped up and he's with some, you know,

968
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:13,400
some gorgeous scrunchie wearing babes and they're getting splashed on the rapid ride.

969
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,080
Your seersucker suit is going to get soaked, my man.

970
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,120
You're crazy.

971
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,040
Also, are you OK?

972
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,480
Like your voice?

973
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,480
I'm concerned.

974
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,560
I'm concerned.

975
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,600
What is that voice?

976
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,880
Every time that I am listening to some Beach Boys adjacent thing,

977
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,400
Aaron, my wife, who does not like the Beach Boys, always makes a point of saying,

978
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,840
this is what I hear when you play the Beach Boys.

979
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,280
There's no difference to me.

980
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,280
And I say, hey, let me play.

981
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,600
You haven't really listened to little Deuce Coop.

982
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,880
Here, put on some headphones.

983
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,280
Anyways, then we get you mentioned Sister.

984
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,360
This is a performance of the Supremes on the big log ride.

985
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:14,600
But the main thing that I wanted to show, and I'll try to not spoil it here,

986
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:20,760
this despite it not being American music, of course, the Beatles are part of the fabric

987
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,200
of American music now.

988
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,440
And this is how they pay tribute to it.

989
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:31,240
And I'm going to have to jump in and narrate real fast because the characters who show up

990
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,120
are so delightful.

991
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,880
I'll let you guys be surprised.

992
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,760
But here we go.

993
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,880
In 1964, England made a huge contribution to America's music.

994
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,480
They sent us the Beatles.

995
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,800
We're Sgt.

996
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,080
Pepper's lovely hot blooded man.

997
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,320
We hope you will enjoy the show.

998
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,800
So let me stop real fast.

999
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,840
This is the same.

1000
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,680
This is the old man in the seersucker suit who badly sang the Beach Boys.

1001
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,640
But now he's in a bad mop top wig and he's performing Sgt.

1002
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,760
Pepper with a cadre of characters.

1003
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,240
And the characters are all your favorite serial characters.

1004
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:19,800
The Lucky Charms leprechaun buzz the Honey Nut Cheerios bee and the Trix rabbit.

1005
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:27,800
Not present for whatever reason is Boo Berry or whatever the character's name is from that

1006
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,280
serial.

1007
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1008
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,720
Count Chocula.

1009
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,160
Count Chocula is up on the side.

1010
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,280
Didn't mean to leave him out.

1011
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,400
This is the strangest little piece of tape I could imagine.

1012
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,160
He slides into a ball pit.

1013
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,680
He is muggy.

1014
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,240
He's so hard throughout this whole thing.

1015
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:45,960
Yeah, we did it.

1016
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,000
You're in a ball pit.

1017
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,200
Oh my God.

1018
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,560
Who is this guy?

1019
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,360
I don't know.

1020
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,200
I didn't watch his introduction carefully enough to know.

1021
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,400
Is he the mayor?

1022
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,600
It's a little treat for his 20th year in office.

1023
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,120
Anyway, this takes us into that.

1024
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,280
I got another way into this because there's several generations of great characters at

1025
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,360
Opryland, but this is the strangest thing to me that you'd think.

1026
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,840
So Opryland, the home of country music, huh?

1027
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,680
Yeah, that's right.

1028
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,080
And it's where you can take a picture with the Trix rabbit and Count Chocula.

1029
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,040
This is interesting because these characters, this is IP that has not been exploited thoroughly

1030
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,760
at a theme park.

1031
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,480
At least with what we've come across thus far.

1032
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,640
This is the first time I'm seeing a theme park exploit them.

1033
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,720
Yeah, and they're great characters.

1034
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,400
I'm so excited they were at a theme park.

1035
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,800
Well-rounded characters that we all love.

1036
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,280
Some of our favorite characters in fiction, I would say.

1037
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,440
Jesse agrees.

1038
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,400
What's your fondness for them?

1039
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,440
I'm just thinking of their backstories.

1040
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,680
Is there a canonical reason they're all there together?

1041
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,720
I meant to understand this is a larger universe.

1042
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,240
What's happening with these guys?

1043
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,560
There's a lot of questions I have because I'm just seeing this footage for the first time.

1044
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,080
I think they all are big music lovers for sure.

1045
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,580
Sure.

1046
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,160
They all love music.

1047
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,440
They love the sounds of today.

1048
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:24,040
I'm sure there'll be some movie that connects all of them together into a larger

1049
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,760
universe just as Scoob recently tied in.

1050
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,960
Who else is in Scoob?

1051
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,160
Now I can't remember.

1052
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,720
Scoob is a universe builder of a movie.

1053
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,560
The Birdman character?

1054
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,280
I forget.

1055
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,560
The Birdman?

1056
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,280
I haven't seen that.

1057
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,000
The Alcatraz?

1058
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,800
Scoob introduces the Birdman of Alcatraz.

1059
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,800
I don't know why they're together.

1060
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:56,040
Is this like in Toontown that the Disney and the Warner Brothers characters all hang out?

1061
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,560
Is there a mascot town where mascots all come from and only mascots are allowed?

1062
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,720
Regardless of what brand you work for, you all hang out at a cafe or something?

1063
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:09,960
Yeah, like a bar.

1064
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:11,800
Say for the whole...

1065
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,240
I'm there just dancing around.

1066
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,240
Obviously they work hard.

1067
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,440
They play hard too.

1068
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,120
That's what I love about Count Chocula.

1069
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,200
Count Chocula is always grinding is what I like.

1070
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,280
He wakes up in the morning.

1071
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,200
He's grinding and that's what he loves.

1072
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:26,920
On that grind.

1073
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:28,520
Here's a...

1074
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,160
At least share the screen again to show you how they were introduced to the general

1075
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,280
public as being there.

1076
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,080
This is from the Tennessean newspaper.

1077
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,000
Opryland introduces Big G Breakfast Buddies.

1078
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,960
Big G and it's the General Mills G.

1079
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,640
For some reason on this show we like to say the phrase King Features Syndicates,

1080
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,120
which is this boring corporate name that a lot of the comic strips are owned under.

1081
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,240
This is similar to me.

1082
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:02,040
Wow, mommy, it's the General Mills Big G Breakfast Buddies.

1083
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,560
Like nobody...

1084
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,200
It's a really mealy-mouthed corporate phrase.

1085
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,720
The Big G Breakfast Buddies.

1086
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,760
I've never heard of that phrase.

1087
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,960
I wonder if that's still something they refer to them as internally.

1088
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:13,880
I don't know.

1089
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,520
That's a good question.

1090
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,320
I mean it does...

1091
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,800
Now that we're seeing this, it does feel like...

1092
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:23,160
Why hasn't there been 10 movies about the Big G Breakfast Buddies?

1093
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,320
Just looking at this picture, Count Chocula is straight up wearing high heels.

1094
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,840
He is in some Louboutins.

1095
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,480
Oh yeah.

1096
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,480
He is flexing right now on our asses and he looks great.

1097
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,800
Sorry, Boo Berry as well is wearing I feel like a flat.

1098
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,600
A woman's flat.

1099
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,720
He's got some high heels but women's shoes.

1100
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,960
A more conservative flat.

1101
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,560
Knows he's going to be on his feet all day.

1102
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,200
Possibly Buzz the Bee as well, maybe.

1103
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,280
I mean those are more like slippers or something.

1104
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,120
He's comfortable.

1105
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,440
That's a Trix rabbit, right?

1106
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,000
Yeah.

1107
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,760
He's au naturel.

1108
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,400
Yeah, I think Boo Berry is in the Marge Simpson ones.

1109
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,840
They look pretty good.

1110
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,080
So you don't like Big G Breakfast Buddies.

1111
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,920
You feel like that's too stiff, too corporate.

1112
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,280
Okay, that's fine.

1113
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,320
What's your pitch on what to call all of the serial mascots when they get together?

1114
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,680
Do you have a better idea of what to call them when they team up?

1115
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,800
God, I don't.

1116
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,320
I just want that corporate...

1117
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,040
I just want that brand out of there, General Mills.

1118
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,200
But I guess I don't mind Breakfast Buddies.

1119
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,880
I guess Breakfast Buddies is okay.

1120
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,380
Yeah.

1121
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,720
Do we have a better one though?

1122
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,720
I don't know if I do off the top of my head.

1123
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,160
I honestly, I think it's too...

1124
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,640
I want more of a King Features syndicate.

1125
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,680
I want it a little less specific.

1126
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:52,520
So I want it to be like Triangle Entertainment Presents.

1127
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,280
The characters.

1128
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:00,760
Like the General Mills Breakfast Consumption Ambassadors.

1129
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:02,520
That's still...

1130
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,760
That suggests something to me.

1131
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,080
That almost is...

1132
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,000
I want it to be so neutral.

1133
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,920
You can almost understand what you mean by that.

1134
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,760
Yeah, maybe try to obfuscate it even more.

1135
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,880
GM Consumption Concern.

1136
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,440
That's better.

1137
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,480
That's closer.

1138
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:17,980
Okay.

1139
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,320
That's good.

1140
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,480
I was thinking Sugar Mills Gang.

1141
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,480
Is that too clever by half?

1142
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,040
Too cute.

1143
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:24,840
I think too cute.

1144
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,720
That suggests to me they're having fun and I can see how that might be interesting.

1145
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,960
I think it's General...

1146
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,560
Maybe General Concerns Properties.

1147
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,280
The General Mills...

1148
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,240
Yeah, Concerns.

1149
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,680
Maybe it's General Mills Concern.

1150
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,320
LLC.

1151
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:45,560
Yeah.

1152
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,440
That's good.

1153
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,400
And they each...

1154
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,840
One is a concern.

1155
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,240
They're not...

1156
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,600
We don't consider them a mascot.

1157
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,400
They're a concern.

1158
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:51,880
Yeah.

1159
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,000
They're concerns, yeah.

1160
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,240
Maybe a consortium.

1161
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,240
Oh yeah.

1162
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,040
That's good, but concerns is a little more vague.

1163
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:00,760
You don't know what that is.

1164
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,560
Extremely corporate.

1165
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,440
That's fair.

1166
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:08,120
Well, there's some adorable concerns and yeah, they are rocking some wonderful footwear.

1167
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,800
Our favorite concern in fiction is what we'll say from now on.

1168
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,080
Scott, did you come across the original characters?

1169
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,040
Oh, you know it.

1170
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,560
I'm sad they had to go.

1171
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:26,440
You need characters as high and mighty as Count Chagula to top these,

1172
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,040
because these are no slouches themselves.

1173
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,000
Sure.

1174
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,280
If everyone can see right here, all your favorite cartoon pals.

1175
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,880
We've got Delilah Dulsamer, Frankie Fiddle.

1176
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,080
We should say these are anthropomorphic musical instruments.

1177
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:50,920
Yes.

1178
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:55,160
Faces jammed in often between the strings.

1179
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,480
It's eyeballs and mouths poking out from behind strings

1180
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,600
and with frets on their sides where ears would be.

1181
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:09,000
Kind of like nightmarish characters that would come to life in a horror movie,

1182
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,680
if there was a horror movie about instruments that were murderers.

1183
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,840
It's some yellow submarine shit for sure.

1184
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,600
Yes.

1185
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:21,480
Barney Baggs, Yancey Banjo, and then they wanted to go home early,

1186
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,400
so then they just went with Johnny Guitar.

1187
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,960
Did you call him Barney Baggs?

1188
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,560
Huh?

1189
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,000
Did you call him Barney Baggs?

1190
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,000
Isn't it Barney Baggs?

1191
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,960
Or Barney Bass?

1192
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,360
Barney Bass.

1193
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,240
I was wondering.

1194
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,040
That's tough to read.

1195
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,600
It's pretty, yeah, it's pretty blurry, all the pictures.

1196
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:40,840
Yeah, I was wondering.

1197
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,480
That's true.

1198
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,480
I agree that the text could be clearer,

1199
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,360
although the name is right next to an upright bass.

1200
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,880
Not a garbage bag full of musical instruments.

1201
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,840
Discarded broken instruments.

1202
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,480
Spirit of broken instruments.

1203
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,440
Barney Baggs.

1204
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,760
I don't think Barney Baggs is that bad.

1205
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:09,240
I don't know what nicknames they give their instruments,

1206
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,840
their tools down at the Opry.

1207
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,200
Yeah, I play a bass guitar, also known as a bag.

1208
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,320
Yeah, what's your bag, man?

1209
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,200
Maybe they were talking about a bass guitar that whole time, okay?

1210
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,280
Austin Powers was talking about a bass guitar.

1211
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,680
His bag, baby.

1212
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,680
I want to say there's one who's not represented in your picture.

1213
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,640
If I could consult my list.

1214
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,200
Yeah, please.

1215
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,640
I just want to make sure they all get their due.

1216
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,200
Jose Mandolin.

1217
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,960
I don't know why he's not in the picture.

1218
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,240
I don't know why they cut out diversity.

1219
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,040
He's not allowed to be photographed,

1220
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,000
but if you hear a mandolin, it's Jose.

1221
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,720
Got it, yeah.

1222
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,760
Do we like these characters?

1223
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,360
Yeah, I like them.

1224
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:58,920
That's good to you.

1225
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:01,480
Okay.

1226
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,400
I like Johnny Guitar a lot.

1227
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,080
I will say that.

1228
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,280
Yeah, Johnny Guitar has a certain charm.

1229
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,200
Yeah, he's sort of...

1230
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,880
Jason, do we know, were these walk around?

1231
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,600
They weren't, right?

1232
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,240
There's no...

1233
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,280
They were just pictures.

1234
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:23,000
Yeah, I think they would be kind of horrific in 3D.

1235
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,240
Yeah.

1236
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:23,720
No, no, no.

1237
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,920
There were walk arounds.

1238
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,240
Oh, they were.

1239
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,840
I don't have a picture, but I...

1240
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,200
Yeah, well, I'll see if I can find it.

1241
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,840
But yeah, no, you could get your picture with Johnny Guitar.

1242
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:36,360
Well, that's going to really determine my feelings on them,

1243
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,440
is how they held up in 3D.

1244
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:38,940
Okay.

1245
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,620
Wait here, I got it.

1246
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,660
Sharing the screen.

1247
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,540
Let's see.

1248
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:45,900
What do we think of the gang?

1249
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,140
Opryland's musical characters.

1250
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,260
I'm a thumbs up now.

1251
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,780
They look better than I thought.

1252
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:53,740
They just look...

1253
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,180
They just exceed your expectations?

1254
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,140
Yeah, I think they look much better in this picture

1255
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,340
than they do in the cartoons.

1256
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,140
Yeah, they look a little more...

1257
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,940
I'm not going to say realistic, right?

1258
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,900
Because that's not the right way of putting this.

1259
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:13,020
But they're not quite as fantastical.

1260
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,900
The drawing of them does make it seem like

1261
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,380
there's no way they could possibly make this real.

1262
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,060
And by God, they did it.

1263
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,180
Yeah, and this is early mascot tech,

1264
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,260
the earlier mascot technology as well.

1265
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:28,940
We should say for the listener,

1266
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,860
it's extremely Sid and Marty Croft.

1267
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,620
It's very Lidsville, I would say.

1268
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,780
But I'm usually horrified by those things.

1269
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,420
And I really don't mind the gang here.

1270
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,980
It's pretty cool when you have these things

1271
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,260
and you don't immediately go,

1272
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:45,020
oh, their face is in the mouth.

1273
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,940
That's a pretty good bar to clear

1274
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:52,140
is knowing that I'm not sure where these people's heads are, right?

1275
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:52,620
I don't know.

1276
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,460
Yeah, not at all.

1277
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,700
Not obvious to me where these people exist

1278
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,540
inside the body of the instruments.

1279
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,580
There could be like three people in each suit for all I know.

1280
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:02,060
Yep.

1281
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:05,100
Or no, or they're autonomously operated.

1282
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,220
They were, yeah, robots.

1283
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:09,420
They were alien technology robots that Operator Man had access to.

1284
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,580
Jesse, can I ask in general, do you have any,

1285
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,660
is there like a, do you have a guilty pleasure

1286
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:19,660
IP mascot that you like even where you go like,

1287
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:23,980
well, I do have affection for this character from childhood?

1288
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,580
That's interesting.

1289
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:27,660
An IP mascot.

1290
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,260
Okay, so we're thinking specifically one

1291
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,820
that has been brought into the real world here.

1292
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,380
Yeah, probably.

1293
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:33,900
I mean, it could be, it's pretty open-ended.

1294
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,540
I mean, it could be like from a, yeah, food,

1295
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:40,380
like a spokes character from a food or from a commercial

1296
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:42,940
or even a walk around character, something like that.

1297
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,100
I don't think many of the product related ones speak to me.

1298
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,260
Although of course, I mean, like anyone else,

1299
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,300
if I saw Count Chocula in person, I'd shit a brick.

1300
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,380
I mean, I'm only human,

1301
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:59,260
but I can distinctly remember something from my childhood,

1302
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:02,700
which I think is like maybe in my box of things

1303
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,220
I go to immediately when I,

1304
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:07,340
I start to get a big head sometimes about myself

1305
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:10,140
and I got to remember, no, actually you're really stupid.

1306
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,660
And one of the things I go to to remind myself how stupid I am

1307
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,700
is that I remember one Christmas, I feel like this was,

1308
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,300
and I don't know if this is right or not,

1309
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,940
but I remember thinking one Christmas I woke up

1310
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:24,540
and there was a framed photo of me meeting Donatello,

1311
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,380
the smart turtle from the Ninja Turtles.

1312
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:32,060
And at that time, for some reason,

1313
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,940
I did not remember going to Disney,

1314
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:37,580
it would have been Disney or I guess Universal, right?

1315
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:40,140
No, Disney, they were in the parks for a little while.

1316
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,340
And then they were, okay.

1317
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:47,180
I didn't remember meeting him and having my photo taken.

1318
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:50,300
So I thought because I was so dumb

1319
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:54,460
that Santa had somehow whisked me away

1320
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:57,980
to have my photo taken while awake with the turtle.

1321
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:01,660
Then framed it and gave it to me as a Christmas gift.

1322
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,060
So I would say to answer your question,

1323
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,460
I really liked the turtles so much so

1324
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,220
that it almost drove me insane.

1325
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:09,900
Wow, really?

1326
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:14,700
I had like a break in reality trying to figure out

1327
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,340
how the picture of myself showed up for Christmas.

1328
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:19,580
So I really liked the turtles.

1329
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,500
That's interesting, you talk about the turtles

1330
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,540
breaking someone's brain.

1331
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:26,300
As you look behind me, there are just all Ninja Turtle toys

1332
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,900
pointing guns at my back.

1333
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:34,060
So yeah, they've broken a lot of brains.

1334
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,740
Yeah, well one of them seems to be

1335
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,340
sort of a sexual predator as well,

1336
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:40,140
but the rest of them seem just like straight up violent

1337
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:40,780
threads.

1338
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:42,380
Oh, Trenchco Raphael.

1339
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,820
Trenchco Raphael, yeah.

1340
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,740
Yeah, yeah, they're all, by the way, they're all violent.

1341
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,420
They all have the power to kill.

1342
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,460
They do, they do.

1343
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,220
They've established that in the films, yeah.

1344
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:54,940
Could I pick apart that notion more,

1345
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:56,380
and I know you don't defend it,

1346
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:59,740
but just to get into it even more thoroughly,

1347
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:04,140
that it was the night, I guess, Christmas Eve

1348
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,020
that Santa absconded with you and then took a daytime photo

1349
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,580
that you weren't cognizant of?

1350
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,580
Yeah, in retrospect, there's a lot of pieces of it

1351
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,340
that don't really fit together.

1352
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:19,020
To me, it was Occam's Razor, right?

1353
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,020
I don't remember having this photo taken.

1354
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,220
It's Christmas.

1355
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,460
How else could this possibly have occurred?

1356
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:27,180
And I think to that extent, you say, well, Santa did it,

1357
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,660
and you just put it in the Santa box and go on about your life

1358
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,540
and not examine maybe what's wrong with your brain

1359
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,580
at such an early age.

1360
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,020
And also, if you are not necessarily a magic believer,

1361
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,300
365 days of the year, maybe you're like,

1362
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:42,540
as you get to be an older kid, you're like,

1363
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,380
I know there's no magic except for the one day

1364
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,420
where there is magic.

1365
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,100
Right, right.

1366
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,860
Although, Santa has to do stuff during the other days too.

1367
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:53,100
It's not inconceivable that he stopped by

1368
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,380
one August afternoon and said,

1369
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,580
you know, sprinkled some elf dust over my face and said,

1370
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,380
you know, and I guess you'd also have to imagine

1371
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:05,500
that to Santa Claus, it seemed like it would be a better gift

1372
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,940
not to meet Donatello, but to simply have a photo

1373
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:09,820
of meeting him.

1374
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,940
So I'm not sure that that really tracks

1375
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,100
as far as what a child would like to have.

1376
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,020
So I don't know, not a lot of it works.

1377
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,780
There wasn't like a big conversation.

1378
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:21,980
You didn't kind of get into it.

1379
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,100
He didn't teach you anything.

1380
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,540
Or if he did, you know, it's yet to be uncovered.

1381
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,660
Maybe one of those things he sort of planted

1382
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:33,500
and I'll rediscover in my 50s, just maybe right when I need it.

1383
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,100
I mean, knowing Donatello, I mean,

1384
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,940
he's the smartest one after all.

1385
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:39,260
Of course, I gotta assume he's got my best interest in mind.

1386
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,380
You'd have to hope at least.

1387
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:43,500
Yeah, absolutely.

1388
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,180
Of course, he wasn't wearing a trench coat.

1389
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,780
So I assume everything was on the up and up.

1390
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:47,980
It's trustworthy.

1391
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,100
I'm like some turtles.

1392
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:54,780
Here's another piece of IP using a different coat.

1393
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,980
Just a really quick flash here of a character

1394
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:01,660
they had in the early 90s called Professor UBSmart.

1395
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:06,220
I'm not really sure what his deal was in general,

1396
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,980
but he's got, you know, like thick round glasses.

1397
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:12,380
He's driving some kind of car around.

1398
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,780
And to me, he looks exactly like David Cross.

1399
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,620
He is so David Cross-esque.

1400
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,740
I was gonna say he's got a very McFeely,

1401
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:23,420
Mr. McFeely vibe as well.

1402
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:23,920
Sure.

1403
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:25,580
Mr. Rogers.

1404
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:26,080
Certainly.

1405
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:27,500
I don't know.

1406
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,460
We'll post this photo.

1407
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:29,740
If you're the kid in the photo

1408
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:32,860
or if you know what Professor UBSmart did,

1409
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:34,860
let us know.

1410
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:37,360
Let's see.

1411
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,180
I mean, that's the IP.

1412
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,220
Look, the IP, that's really where I fell in love with this place.

1413
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,740
You can, I think, judge a park,

1414
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:46,220
especially based on their IP.

1415
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,940
I mean, two fantastic generations.

1416
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:50,460
I just have to applaud them for it.

1417
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:51,680
Yeah.

1418
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,980
I really like that all the rides

1419
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:56,940
seem like something Cotton Hill would yell in anger.

1420
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,860
The Wabash Cannonball.

1421
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,860
Grizzly River Rampage, Bobby.

1422
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,380
Close to Grizzly River Run.

1423
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,940
Yes, a different rapids ride.

1424
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:12,140
Another Disney ride.

1425
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:12,800
Oh.

1426
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,740
But the Grizzly River Rampage

1427
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:21,020
has the unique fact that it was, for one year,

1428
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:25,660
used as a course in the Nation's Bank Whitewater Championships,

1429
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:31,180
which in 1995 alone served as a qualifier for the 96th Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

1430
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,020
What?

1431
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:33,420
Wow.

1432
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,580
Wait, so they ran?

1433
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:39,420
They whitewater rafted down this rapids course,

1434
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,340
this rapids layout.

1435
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,380
And you could qualify for the Olympics, potentially.

1436
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,980
And they relocated that thing to Kentucky Kingdom.

1437
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,300
I believe so, yeah.

1438
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,620
Yeah, a lot of these rides, we relocated to other parks, eventually.

1439
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:56,220
We sold to Six Flags.

1440
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,580
So wait, that doesn't count, though.

1441
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,940
A rapids ride?

1442
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:02,700
That's like, doesn't have to be regulation somehow.

1443
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:06,940
Well, you just fill, you turn on the rapids and you put in your own raft and you do it.

1444
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:08,940
I guess so.

1445
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:12,140
In the Olympics, you're not going to face a big fake bear.

1446
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,860
Scott is in his whitewater rafting bag once again.

1447
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:17,820
Here we go.

1448
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,180
It's time for the big rant.

1449
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,300
Let's hear it, Scott.

1450
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:24,380
We need standards in our whitewater rafting Olympics events.

1451
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:28,060
You can't just pick these courses willy-nilly.

1452
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:30,380
They're at a thousand times.

1453
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:36,300
Look, there should be a bear involved in every different trial at the Olympics.

1454
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,180
And just at the Olympics, I'd say too.

1455
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:40,220
Yeah.

1456
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,180
Yeah, there's a threat of bear in every event.

1457
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,780
Jason, do you have more rides you were going to list?

1458
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,780
No, I think we talked about most of the other ones.

1459
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:56,940
I mean, these were all made by Arrow or Intamin.

1460
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,700
These were made by big ride manufacturers.

1461
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:04,300
It's not like they just homemade these out of nothing.

1462
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:08,620
Some of them look good, but do you think that they weren't good?

1463
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:13,100
I think in when we were DMing, I think you referred to some of the rides as,

1464
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,140
quote, hick shit.

1465
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:15,500
Yeah.

1466
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:21,740
For me, the entertainment is pure hick because it's fiddles and all those other.

1467
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:26,700
I mean, walking by and seeing someone playing a fiddle and then sitting down and then continuing

1468
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,420
to watch them play the fiddle is unimaginable to me.

1469
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,980
I don't know what state of mind you could possibly be in

1470
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:35,580
that you would want to do that, although I know many people do.

1471
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:41,100
I think the rides were perfectly adequate for that era.

1472
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:46,860
Again, the appeal to me is essentially nil of getting in a big log and going down a thing

1473
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,140
and then my feet get all wet.

1474
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:51,420
That's not, I don't want that to happen because I'm not at a water park.

1475
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,620
I don't want to be wet.

1476
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,700
So I don't really understand water parks over here.

1477
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,340
You stay wet.

1478
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:56,780
Normal park over here.

1479
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:57,500
You stay dry.

1480
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,380
That makes sense to me.

1481
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:03,580
But there was a lot of getting wet at this at Opry land for sure.

1482
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:05,980
Roller coasters.

1483
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:08,380
I mean, the rock and roller coaster, I think was like,

1484
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:11,180
I think that was like a legit roller coaster for a while.

1485
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:14,380
And maybe now it's been employed as sort of a throwback.

1486
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:17,180
Like wasn't this cute what we used to think was fun or whatever.

1487
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,420
But I think at the time, I think it probably held its own.

1488
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,580
It's still around.

1489
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:22,460
It's let me look.

1490
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,020
I have it here.

1491
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:23,660
It's operate.

1492
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,780
It's the cannon blaster at Great Escape in Queensbury, New York.

1493
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:28,220
Yes.

1494
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:31,900
So people get on that now and it's like they're not dead and they're not,

1495
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,140
you know, like, bored, I guess, you know?

1496
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,580
So that's that's legitimate.

1497
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:40,700
You don't granted you don't go up and like you don't like what's the one?

1498
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:45,260
I remember the ride I went on as an adult was the one where you go extremely fast

1499
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:48,220
and then you sit here for a minute and then some people like hold a penny

1500
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,700
and they're like, wow, look at the penny floating and then they go back down.

1501
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,260
Is that the Hulk or Superman or something like that?

1502
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:57,020
There's the Superman in Magic Mountain is like that.

1503
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:00,060
OK, because you're saying it's just sort of a ramp up and then you go back.

1504
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:00,860
Right. Yeah.

1505
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:04,300
Yeah. It's not that that that to me is the modern ride,

1506
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,780
although now I guess the modern ride is like there's a screen.

1507
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:09,500
I really don't I don't know what the tech of modern rides is.

1508
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,620
I guess I'm showing my ass.

1509
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,060
I don't know what's supposed to be good now.

1510
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:16,140
Well, I think I look the classics are still good, but, you know, there's different like

1511
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:22,140
there's a there's a roller coaster themed around the Ninja Turtles in a mall in New Jersey.

1512
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:22,620
Wow.

1513
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,860
That like tips you up and then like like makes you go.

1514
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:28,140
How do you describe it?

1515
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,380
It goes like 270 degrees.

1516
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,460
It's 200. It's not a straight down drop.

1517
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:35,420
It drops you like less curves a little.

1518
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:35,660
Yeah.

1519
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:39,020
Curves inside to make you feel like you're really going to die.

1520
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:39,820
Oh, my God.

1521
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,340
And that's like more modern.

1522
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,820
That big mall built in a county with blue laws.

1523
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:48,300
So they build a massive, largely empty mall that cannot open on Sundays.

1524
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:53,980
Ah, the more the mall can't be open on Sundays.

1525
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:59,100
I think shops in East Rutherford, New Jersey is where it is.

1526
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,180
This is the American Dream Mall.

1527
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:01,980
And it opened.

1528
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,900
This took decades to build.

1529
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:04,940
We did a whole episode about it.

1530
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:09,420
It took decades to build, then opened like two weeks before COVID hit.

1531
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:14,780
And now is like pseudo open sometimes maybe.

1532
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:17,660
But yeah, they can't be open one of the days.

1533
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:18,620
Week.

1534
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:20,620
That ain't good.

1535
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:24,700
And also, I was just going to say Disney's innovation for Rock and Roller Coaster was

1536
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,500
adding the greatest American rock and roll band Aerosmith.

1537
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,940
Oh, it's the Aerosmith ride now?

1538
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:31,980
That's what it is.

1539
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:32,380
It is.

1540
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,180
Just the same name.

1541
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:36,060
Rock and Roller Coaster is Aerosmith.

1542
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,180
It has Aerosmith music.

1543
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,100
It's been that way since it opened.

1544
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:39,340
Yeah.

1545
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:41,180
Yeah.

1546
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,660
Agreement, disagreement on that phrase.

1547
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:47,740
Greatest American rock and roll band.

1548
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,660
Well, it's the music of today.

1549
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:50,540
That can't be denied.

1550
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,540
Absolutely.

1551
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,260
Yes, that's true.

1552
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:59,900
Should we talk, since you bring up a mall, it's hard to go backwards when you bring up a mall.

1553
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,220
Can we talk about what is there today?

1554
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:05,740
Which is Opry Mills.

1555
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:12,540
I guess the solution to it seems like just a purely cold calculated business decision

1556
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:15,740
that maybe the park is limited at a certain point.

1557
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,300
We do have to employ all of these people.

1558
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:22,460
This may be due to tons of ride operators and tons of performers and stuff.

1559
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,980
What if we cut all that out and we just open up a big mall?

1560
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:28,300
They did, and it is a Mills Mall.

1561
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:33,100
I have complained about Mills Malls before because they have no aesthetic.

1562
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,380
I was trying to think how to describe the Mills Malls.

1563
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:41,420
I think it's like the tunnels underneath Disney World that connect everything that

1564
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:42,620
the public never sees.

1565
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,220
It's like, what if that was the mall?

1566
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:49,020
What if a bunker was a place where people go?

1567
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:57,660
Yeah, to me, Opry Mills, the original aesthetic was I think significantly worse pre-flood

1568
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,700
because it leaned.

1569
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,180
It was also just older and that's just the way things go.

1570
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:05,900
It's updated, it looks a little bit better for my modern eyes, I guess.

1571
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:13,020
But it did seem at the time to be a little more emphatic on the idea, not just being

1572
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:19,020
an outlet mall but having these weird, kitschy places inside of it.

1573
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:24,860
In fact, I was looking at some of the early ads for Opry Mills and they emphasized things

1574
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,100
that of course haven't been in there in forever.

1575
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:30,460
But we're like one-offs and I'm struggling to think of one now.

1576
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:33,660
But if you've been to any of these big outlet malls, you know it's not just like,

1577
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:36,940
here's the Old Navy that we have at the outlet mall.

1578
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:41,340
Here's the, I mean, not even Gucci, but what's two tiers below Gucci?

1579
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:46,460
Here's the Swarovski we have here at the mall and it's a little bit different or whatever.

1580
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:51,660
But they were also trying to be like, here's 3,000 square feet of fucking, I don't know,

1581
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:55,500
pretzels or whatever the fuck, whatever weird shit you would put in a mall like that,

1582
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,620
that seemed to be the focus.

1583
01:19:56,620 --> 01:20:00,700
And whereas now it's more like a legit, it's more like a normal mall,

1584
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,740
just eight times as big as it ever should be.

1585
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:05,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1586
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,420
They're so mammoth, every Mills.

1587
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,700
It is such a workout to do the entire loop.

1588
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:11,980
It is, yeah.

1589
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:15,980
It's legitimately very difficult to see everything in there, not that you would want to,

1590
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:18,860
because it's like some of it literally repeats from side to side.

1591
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:27,420
And the aesthetic, I think the aesthetic of it now is like hotel room or hotel lobby or whatever,

1592
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:31,180
where a lot of times you go into a hotel and you go, I can tell this was expensive.

1593
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:34,700
It just doesn't, it's not cohesive in any way.

1594
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,500
It's just like, that's an expensive light fixture.

1595
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,300
That carpet was more expensive than it should have been.

1596
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:43,500
Maybe that's like a piece of marble that looks really shiny.

1597
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,380
But then you put it all in the same room and you just go, I don't know.

1598
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,900
It's just like, I don't know what this is.

1599
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,540
Who's this for?

1600
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:55,740
And that mall is now built next to a massive hotel with a giant atrium covering much of it.

1601
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,220
That's right.

1602
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:58,720
Yeah.

1603
01:20:59,180 --> 01:20:59,420
Yeah.

1604
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:01,420
Opryland is the land of contrast.

1605
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:07,100
Yeah, I've stayed in Opryland hotel a couple of times.

1606
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:09,500
That looks good to me.

1607
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:14,540
Like I watched a long boring video about all the amenities of the hotel and it looks great.

1608
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:19,900
I think it has my, my official review is that it has seen better days.

1609
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:25,900
I don't know if it is coincidental that it, that it happens to seem that way.

1610
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:32,220
Once it's been taken over by Marriott and has had this massive corporate overhaul,

1611
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,940
or maybe I just got a old room when I stayed.

1612
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:37,100
I don't know, but also got flooded.

1613
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,140
Don't forget that.

1614
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:39,420
Hard to bounce back from that.

1615
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:39,920
Sure.

1616
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,900
The atrium is legitimately very, very cool.

1617
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:49,820
If you've never seen it before, this is a, it's, I guess it's probably fair to say it is a

1618
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:55,180
convention center first and foremost, which explains the huge footprint of the place.

1619
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:59,740
And then it is a hotel that is attached to this convention center as well.

1620
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:07,660
And the hotel does have in the middle where you, and you can access this from the slightly more

1621
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:11,580
expensive rooms, the balcony rooms overlook this atrium.

1622
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,980
And it's just like, I mean, it's like an indoor rainforest.

1623
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:17,260
Basically there's like a manmade little stream through there.

1624
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:22,860
There's waterfalls in there and just a massive number of plants that have no business really

1625
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,700
being in Nashville, it seems like.

1626
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:29,260
And so along with that, you get, I mean, you get the humidity of obviously what that's like

1627
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:31,820
having all those plants in there, but honestly it's pretty cool.

1628
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:36,940
It's pretty novel and it's kind of interesting, but it is, it's also like,

1629
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:43,740
it's a microcosm of what I, what I find like, what I think about theme parks or Disney world

1630
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:49,340
in particular, which is, wow, look at this like beautifully curated flora that we're enjoying

1631
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:49,820
right now.

1632
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:57,100
What better to compliment this than a $21 slice of the worst pizza I've ever had in my life

1633
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,900
brought to my room, you know, by somebody who looks like they hate my guts.

1634
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:06,460
So that is, that to me is like the experience of Opryland, which is, I think, I mean, that's a

1635
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:07,420
huge fucking bummer.

1636
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:14,540
Well, don't count out all the cool things that could potentially, that at least at one point

1637
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:20,540
were available in that atrium, which is that there was a like night show, like a world of color,

1638
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:26,860
like a Disney fountain show where they lit fountains up and they danced to music, which looked

1639
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:27,820
really cool.

1640
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:33,820
And then also in that hotel atrium, you could see a performance by Lloyd Lindroth,

1641
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:40,380
who seems to be my favorite Mr. Show character, Lloyd Lindroth.

1642
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,140
The king of the harp.

1643
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:47,820
I think this guy, he's like, he's harp Liberace is what he is.

1644
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:48,620
Wow.

1645
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:49,740
Look at Lloyd Lindroth.

1646
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:56,140
He's like a pink, like sparkly cut, like a nudie suit, would you say, would that be an accurate

1647
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,300
nudie suit adjacent?

1648
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,900
I think a little bit nudie suit.

1649
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:04,140
People are thrilled right now to be meeting the Lloyd Lindroth.

1650
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,740
This woman's losing her mind.

1651
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:09,420
He's dressed like flabber from Big Bad Beetleborgs.

1652
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:15,340
This is exciting is meeting flabber.

1653
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:19,260
So, you know, that's cool.

1654
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:20,540
Don't don't.

1655
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:22,060
You're right.

1656
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,660
And now Lloyd Lindroth.

1657
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:25,500
It brings a lot to the table.

1658
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,100
Opryland Hotel does, man.

1659
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,260
And that's I mean, that is huge as well.

1660
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:31,900
Like that's I mean, the mall is very, very big.

1661
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:36,940
But walking around the hotel itself is also like a real chore walking around that fucking place.

1662
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,620
It's not I mean, it's not interesting at all.

1663
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,180
Long walk with nothing interesting to do.

1664
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:47,020
It was at one point one of the 30 largest hotels in the world.

1665
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:49,740
So yeah, pretty, pretty massive.

1666
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:53,660
Well, and I think also if you compare it to other hotels of its size,

1667
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:56,540
it's really big for not having a casino attached to it,

1668
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,740
which is those are the places that I'm used to getting into those hallways.

1669
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:04,220
It's like, oh, this wasn't meant to be anything.

1670
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:06,940
If you ever if you ever walk around

1671
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:14,620
like Caesars or the Bellagio, like some of the really massive hotels in Vegas,

1672
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:17,180
I want to go somewhere.

1673
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,260
It's three miles from where I am right now.

1674
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,140
So I'll get to walking.

1675
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:25,100
And in the meantime, you'll see like these these entire corners of the building that are very

1676
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:30,060
minimally themed or just like it's just carpet and just lights.

1677
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:30,620
And that's it.

1678
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:33,020
It's like this is for the roof line or something.

1679
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:36,860
It just exists here and there's nothing to do except for like sit down and plug your phone in.

1680
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:39,900
It seems to exist purely to be vacuumed.

1681
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:40,620
Do you know what I mean?

1682
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:44,540
And that's that's what a lot of corners of the Opera Land hotel are like.

1683
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:45,420
There's no one in here.

1684
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:46,540
There's no one eating here.

1685
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:47,740
There's nothing going on.

1686
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:48,780
You're just walking through.

1687
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:51,900
And I hope I hope there's a camera here in case I get attacked.

1688
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,820
Like there's no other reason for this to exist.

1689
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:59,980
Does it still connect to like the downtown like the entertainment district by water taxi?

1690
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,620
Because that was something that like they did at some point, right?

1691
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,940
Like they were trying to redo the entertainment district

1692
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:09,420
simultaneously as they're redoing like the Opera Land property.

1693
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:14,140
Those words don't make any sense to me the way that you put them together.

1694
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:15,100
I don't know.

1695
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:16,940
No, I believe you.

1696
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:20,380
I believe that at one time that something someone said, I just don't even know.

1697
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:22,540
I wouldn't know, first of all, because I don't go downtown.

1698
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:24,060
So it would never exist to me.

1699
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:27,900
It's like, but you love Kid Rock's big ass honky tonk at steakhouse.

1700
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,100
I mean, you're wearing.

1701
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:29,340
Yeah.

1702
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:30,140
Well, this is what I'm saying.

1703
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,340
Why would I ever want to take a taxi?

1704
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:33,020
I'm never leaving the fucking joint.

1705
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:33,340
Okay.

1706
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:39,980
You also love getting covid over and over again.

1707
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,260
Yeah.

1708
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:41,580
Yeah.

1709
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,180
It's kind of good to do.

1710
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:43,740
Yeah.

1711
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,180
It's like it's a daredevil.

1712
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,380
Let me see how many times I can get it and survive.

1713
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:53,420
That is actually a huge deal with the guy specifically who owns that place.

1714
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,980
He's like a big asshole.

1715
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,420
I mean, obviously he's a big guy.

1716
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:58,700
That's obvious, right?

1717
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:02,540
But Kid Rock or like his like regional brand manager.

1718
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,820
His business partner.

1719
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:03,980
Yeah.

1720
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:09,260
Kid Rock and his business partner have made a lot of people mad or happy, I guess,

1721
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,260
depending on which type of guy you are.

1722
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,140
But that's yeah.

1723
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:18,300
The whole downtown shutdowns, which of course never really happened in earnest here at all,

1724
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,700
which I know is very different from out there at least.

1725
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:26,060
Yeah, that guy is a big piece of shit and really wants people to come down there and get sick.

1726
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:29,340
And I think one of the cool things is a lot of people are obliging and are doing it.

1727
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,300
So that's interesting.

1728
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:33,740
Anything you say, Kid Rock's business partner.

1729
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:36,460
This guy sounds like a guy up our alley.

1730
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:41,180
We love our nefarious corporate greed mongers.

1731
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,540
I want to know more about this guy.

1732
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:44,940
Yeah, he owns a lot of that shit.

1733
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:48,540
Can I seg into like, you know, there's talk about real quick COVID and like, you know,

1734
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:49,820
Santa photo ops.

1735
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:54,060
How, you know, how is that going to work in this time or whatever?

1736
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:57,980
And I think they've actually cracked it at one of the restaurants.

1737
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,260
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1738
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:00,620
No, no.

1739
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:00,940
Okay.

1740
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:06,220
So there's a restaurant at the mall at the Opry Mills called the, let me look.

1741
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:08,860
It's called Aquarium Restaurant.

1742
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:09,360
Yes.

1743
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,360
Okay.

1744
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,160
Loved the name.

1745
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,120
I looked this up too.

1746
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,360
And I was like, there's got to be more, right?

1747
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,600
No, it's Aquarium Restaurant.

1748
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,640
Aquarium Restaurant.

1749
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:19,920
It's owned by Landry's.

1750
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,200
Yeah.

1751
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:27,120
And our buddy Tilman Fertitta, one of our favorite nefarious corporate weirdos.

1752
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,800
And it's, it kind of looks like cool here.

1753
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,040
Let me see if I can, I'll bring this up.

1754
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,680
You know, it kind of looks rainforest cafe ish.

1755
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:36,740
Yep.

1756
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,120
Let me, I'll share the screen here.

1757
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,360
Um, just so you can get a vibe.

1758
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:45,280
Definitely like a cousin, you know, there's a lot of rainforest cafes or sort of a couple

1759
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:45,760
dozen.

1760
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:49,040
There's like four aquarium restaurants.

1761
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:50,080
Yeah.

1762
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,680
So like you go, oh, this is kind of cool.

1763
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,720
The ceiling looks cool.

1764
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,160
There's big tanks with fish.

1765
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,200
Coral reef world.

1766
01:28:56,320 --> 01:29:00,800
So let me show you a picture of how they figured out how to crack the issue with, uh,

1767
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,800
having kids meet Santa.

1768
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,560
And here's what they landed on.

1769
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:06,180
Yes.

1770
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:08,720
Oh boy.

1771
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:14,960
Santa is in the tank with the fish in a full Santa suit.

1772
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,960
And the kids just go up to the tank and wave at him.

1773
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,800
He does have oxygen.

1774
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,800
He does have oxygen.

1775
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,600
He's not, yeah, he's not holding his breath.

1776
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,560
And gloves and Santa's white gloves and suit.

1777
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,000
He's just in the regular suit.

1778
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,400
It's not a, a Santa fide scuba suit.

1779
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,720
It's just the cloth and the wool.

1780
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:34,960
Yeah.

1781
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,000
It looks like an accident.

1782
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,220
Yeah.

1783
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:38,740
Tell him.

1784
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:40,800
It looks like he's saying help.

1785
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,160
Kids, please.

1786
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,840
If you want another Christmas, if you ever want to meet Donatello.

1787
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,480
So on the official, on the website, it says mail your letter to Santa and keep a close

1788
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,000
eye on the aquarium tank.

1789
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,840
You may see him swimming with our fish.

1790
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,480
Ruining your letter.

1791
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:01,760
Whoops.

1792
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,160
I guess this is what I didn't, didn't read it.

1793
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,440
Just get you some socks.

1794
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,000
How about that?

1795
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,520
Now I will say they have figured out Santa to keep Santa safe.

1796
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:15,200
But the restaurant is just open and it's also a buffet.

1797
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,720
So Santa will be safe.

1798
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,500
Wow.

1799
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:24,720
So I've eaten at that aquarium restaurant a couple of times.

1800
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,220
Oh boy.

1801
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:26,340
And.

1802
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:27,780
It ain't too too good.

1803
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,060
No, never.

1804
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:29,560
No.

1805
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,700
But the rainforest, it's, it's as good as rainforest cafe, right?

1806
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,860
Which many more people have had.

1807
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:38,500
It's, it's, it's quite bad food.

1808
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:39,700
It's on the level of.

1809
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:43,060
I regret bringing up zoos twice because it sounds like that's the only place I've ever

1810
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:43,540
been.

1811
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:44,500
This guy fucking loves the zoo.

1812
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:51,780
It's like zoo food, which is it's, it's like 40 to 50, 50 to 60 percent of the food.

1813
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:59,140
Which is it's, it's like 40 to 50 percent more expensive than it should be and like 40

1814
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:01,220
to 50 percent less good than it should be.

1815
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:04,180
So like even french fries kind of suck and they cost $9.

1816
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:10,100
That's basically the, the realm of aquarium, except with it, with a bonus, which is that

1817
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:14,340
it's mostly seafood, which is already way more expensive than it should be at most chain

1818
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,300
restaurants.

1819
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:22,180
So, I mean, you, you can really legitimately sit down at the aquarium and with four people,

1820
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:25,620
which is what I would have been doing with myself, my wife, my two children.

1821
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:28,740
You legitimately could sit down at that restaurant and eat.

1822
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:34,740
I mean, uh, like $40 worth of food for $130.

1823
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:39,780
I mean, it's, it's not at all difficult to do that type of shit there and it fucking

1824
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:41,700
stinks, but the fish are very cool.

1825
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:43,220
Yeah.

1826
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:43,700
And.

1827
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:44,100
Okay.

1828
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,420
And that's the Tillman for Tito promise.

1829
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:52,580
The, the, the aquarium is like really well done as far as I know.

1830
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:53,540
I'm not an aquarium guy.

1831
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:58,660
I'm a geologist as we established earlier, but it's, um, the, one of the things there

1832
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:04,900
is we went somewhat recently, like after the big flood that caused them to refurbish the

1833
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:13,940
whole mall and the waiter there told us somewhat credibly, I feel that because the place was

1834
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:17,140
so flooded, they were not able to get in and rescue any of the animals.

1835
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:21,380
So by the time they got back, there was one remaining and it was the one that had eaten

1836
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:24,980
all of the other fish in the aquarium.

1837
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:29,220
I mean, it sounds somewhat apocryphal, but also I know it was flooded for a really long

1838
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:30,020
fucking time.

1839
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:30,980
So that makes sense.

1840
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:32,100
Sure.

1841
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:32,340
Yeah.

1842
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:33,220
That's what happens.

1843
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:34,020
It's that one.

1844
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,460
It's not like he killed himself.

1845
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:39,380
Like he was, you know, he didn't, he didn't let, I mean, he didn't, he was in there for

1846
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:40,260
a long time.

1847
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:40,580
Right.

1848
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:40,820
Yeah.

1849
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:42,900
That one, the 12 foot tall fish.

1850
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:46,660
He ate Santa.

1851
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:52,260
Oh my God.

1852
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:53,140
That's incredible.

1853
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:55,460
Yeah.

1854
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:55,860
The weed.

1855
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,780
Well, there's also, there were mermaids.

1856
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:58,500
I think they do that.

1857
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:58,740
Right.

1858
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:01,140
Did you see mermaids at the aquarium restaurant?

1859
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:04,180
I don't think I've seen the mermaids in there.

1860
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:06,100
I've seen the people who clean.

1861
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,300
So they go in to clean.

1862
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,380
It's big enough that you do go in to clean it.

1863
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:09,620
Right.

1864
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:11,780
So that is kind of fun.

1865
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:16,260
That's to me, the entertainment equivalent of a mermaid because you're sort of like,

1866
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:20,420
there's not very much you can, I mean, you can kind of like, I mean, we're people, right?

1867
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:21,140
We're not fish.

1868
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:23,700
We can kind of move our arms a little bit, but that's pretty much it.

1869
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:26,660
I mean, otherwise she might as well be cleaning a rock while she's in there.

1870
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:27,060
I don't know.

1871
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:27,940
Two birds with one stone.

1872
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:28,500
Why not?

1873
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:33,940
And they have to hold their breath or there's like hidden oxygen, like tanks where they

1874
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:35,300
can take a quick breathe.

1875
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:38,340
And oh, that, oh, cause I was concerned.

1876
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:41,060
You watch a video and you're like, this is too much.

1877
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:43,060
Are they trained?

1878
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:46,980
Are they trained in like anti-torture methods?

1879
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:48,100
How else are they under here?

1880
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,180
So yeah, I think they have to train a lot.

1881
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:53,620
It says on the website, people are always asking us about our mermaids.

1882
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:55,860
Click here for fun facts about what it takes.

1883
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:59,220
Oh, and then it's, it's like job.

1884
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:01,220
Like they tell you if you want to work this job.

1885
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:07,860
And then, and then not a link, but it says, go to the restaurant, fill out an application.

1886
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:08,500
If you want.

1887
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:09,940
Wow.

1888
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:10,180
Yeah.

1889
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:16,420
You have 50 yard butterfly stroke time swim, 200 yards timed underwater endurance evaluation.

1890
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:18,900
There's also a performance evaluation in the exhibit.

1891
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:20,580
Yeah.

1892
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:21,060
Wow.

1893
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:24,340
Now it says what kind of, oh, sorry, Jason, go ahead.

1894
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:29,140
Oh, I was going to say it does make a point to say the mermaids are not all scuba dive certified.

1895
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:33,700
That's a little alarming.

1896
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:36,100
And then it tells you what you would have to swim with.

1897
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:44,900
And there's a big list of fish, like a butterfly fish, assorted tangs, a look down jacks and

1898
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,260
tessellated eels.

1899
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:47,940
Okay.

1900
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:52,260
Somebody was having a little bit of fun in the website copy room.

1901
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:52,740
Come on.

1902
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,180
Those aren't real.

1903
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:55,300
That's not real.

1904
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:56,420
Such thing as a test.

1905
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:57,940
Eels can't be tessellated.

1906
01:34:57,940 --> 01:34:58,660
Come on.

1907
01:34:58,660 --> 01:34:59,620
That's outrageous.

1908
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:02,900
I, Tilman Fertitta creations.

1909
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:03,400
Yeah.

1910
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:09,480
You know, in the, yeah, Tilman Fertitta came up last year in our downtown Disney ordeal,

1911
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:12,280
the owner of the Rainforest Cafe and many other restaurants.

1912
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,040
So I think Bubba Gump's too.

1913
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:18,040
And I didn't have, I didn't want to go down a big rabbit hole here, but I was just like,

1914
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:22,360
I know it's been kind of a year for Tilman Fertitta and things have been rough for him

1915
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,960
with the Houston Rockets.

1916
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:30,760
I forget what exactly, but I was like, I just have here three random recent headlines about this,

1917
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,680
this man and this great restaurateur.

1918
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:37,720
Tilman Fertitta supporting Trump, leading to revolts among Rockets players.

1919
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,160
Rockets owners is from March, right at the beginning of the pandemic.

1920
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:44,600
Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta is the worst type of boss.

1921
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:50,040
And then over the summer Rockets Tilman Fertitta's family has deep mob ties.

1922
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:53,720
Just get better and better with this dude.

1923
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:54,520
Huh?

1924
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:55,160
Yeah.

1925
01:35:55,160 --> 01:36:00,360
That's, I didn't know that he owned Landry's, although I of course have heard as well.

1926
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:07,720
I mean, the player dissatisfaction with him, I think is, I mean, maybe a little convenient given

1927
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:11,240
what the other 29 billionaire owners must be like.

1928
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,360
I mean, yeah, yeah.

1929
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:16,840
They're just like slightly, they're 1% quieter, but all pieces of shit.

1930
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:17,720
Yeah.

1931
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:22,600
I think maybe you go in there blind a little bit on those guys, but I do know that, I mean,

1932
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:27,480
his fortune has decreased substantially as a result of the pandemic and all that.

1933
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,920
And that's, that's very understandable.

1934
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:35,640
I didn't know that he owned Landry's, which like you said, owns the aquarium and what else?

1935
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,520
There's, there's a bunch of it.

1936
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:40,520
He also owns claim jumper, which is in Opry Mills as well.

1937
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:45,480
Which I actually liked, but now I haven't been in a couple of years, but now I feel like I've

1938
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:51,080
soured on based on his, on his associate, not like there's a good restaurant tour.

1939
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,960
I guess I should support, but I thought the restaurant was pretty good.

1940
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,480
I did one like a year ago.

1941
01:36:55,480 --> 01:37:00,200
I thought it was like the worst restaurant I've been to in the recent past.

1942
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:00,520
Yeah.

1943
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:06,680
Might've just been Mike's might've just been the ah, ah, juice sandwiches, but that's any indication.

1944
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,120
I have affection for it, but I wouldn't recommend it.

1945
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,320
Yeah.

1946
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:11,880
I like it.

1947
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,880
There's one right over here by the Warner Brothers lot in an office building.

1948
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:16,360
That's the one.

1949
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:16,520
Yeah.

1950
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,520
And the TBS headquarters.

1951
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:23,240
We should say also that the TNN headquarters used to be on this campus.

1952
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:24,920
Remember the Nashville network?

1953
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:25,960
Sure.

1954
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:26,760
They used to broadcast.

1955
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:32,920
That's why family feud broadcasted from the, with the special guests, the Stadler brothers

1956
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,360
bringing us back to the beginning.

1957
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:39,320
TNN, the Nashville network became, I remember it mainly for showing Dallas reruns.

1958
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:44,920
Then it became Spike TV where it mainly showed Manser's reruns.

1959
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:50,600
Then it became the Paramount network where it mainly collapsed and died, I think.

1960
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:51,880
It had bar rescue.

1961
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:53,320
It's got bar rescue reruns.

1962
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:53,560
Yeah.

1963
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,160
Cause I keep wanting to watch bar rescue and then I'm like, where is it?

1964
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:58,040
What's it streaming on?

1965
01:37:58,040 --> 01:37:58,440
All right.

1966
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:02,760
The one that you can't get to the one with the content moat.

1967
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,400
Nevermind.

1968
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,400
I will never watch bar rescue.

1969
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:10,600
Well, the great thing about bar rescue here is that if you want to pirate bar rescue,

1970
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,120
which I would never recommend doing.

1971
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:18,920
If you wanted to do that for some reason, bar rescue has completely fucked up on TV database.

1972
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,720
This is one of the things that gets up my ass all the time.

1973
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:27,240
TV database on bar rescue is fucked because they kept doing this shit where they would say,

1974
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:32,280
this is part three of season two when it was actually part one of season four.

1975
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:35,720
And all of the episodes overlap and you can't get the fucking episodes because

1976
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,480
nobody knows what fucking season it is.

1977
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,680
It's a nightmare.

1978
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:42,440
Some seasons were 10 episodes long and other seasons were like 80.

1979
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:43,400
It makes no sense.

1980
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,040
Yeah, that's annoying.

1981
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,040
That's my bar rescue rant of the day.

1982
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:52,920
I appreciate hearing such a niche that would absolutely bother me.

1983
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,200
And you're not alone.

1984
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:58,200
And I guess there's multiple ways that trying to watch bar rescue is trouble.

1985
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:58,680
Yes.

1986
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,880
I think he wouldn't.

1987
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:02,520
John would be furious about all of this.

1988
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,600
This season is only 80 minutes long.

1989
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,520
One's 10 episodes, one is 80.

1990
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,040
Confusing people.

1991
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,120
You can't stream it anywhere.

1992
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:18,360
He'll talk with Trump about it, of course, because he's another Trump guy.

1993
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,880
He loves Trump.

1994
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:23,000
He interviewed him on his podcast.

1995
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:23,320
What?

1996
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,040
Oh my God.

1997
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:24,600
Like recently?

1998
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:25,160
I didn't know that.

1999
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,040
Three weeks ago.

2000
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,680
Three weeks ago he sat down with him.

2001
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,880
Does he literally post, does anyone have any questions for the president?

2002
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,520
No, I can't think of any.

2003
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:35,160
Thank you though.

2004
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:37,960
Thanks John.

2005
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,640
Excited for Taffer's Tavern.

2006
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,880
What cocktails will you have on tap?

2007
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:47,880
Okay.

2008
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:52,600
That was going to say the Santa thing in the aquarium was interesting.

2009
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:58,440
When you were talking about how they had figured out how to meet Santa,

2010
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,760
I was like, oh, he's about to talk about Bass Pro.

2011
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:06,840
Because that's where I had seen the Santa innovation with the big plexiglass shield,

2012
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:11,640
was at Bass Pro, which around here is a massively big deal.

2013
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:15,880
It is now an anchor store in Opry Mills.

2014
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,360
It wasn't always, but now it is.

2015
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,440
I think it's the only store.

2016
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:26,120
No, it's one of two, if I remember correctly, that you can't get to from inside the mall.

2017
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:28,920
Or it did have a separate entrance.

2018
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,440
Maybe now you can get in through the mall.

2019
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,040
If you look at the satellite of Opry Mills,

2020
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:38,600
you can see there are millions of boats out front.

2021
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,920
Someone's going to the mall to buy a boat, which is very strange.

2022
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,760
But I guess probably happens.

2023
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:47,720
I think that's where I saw the thing about the plexiglass.

2024
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:52,520
There's also the big Bass Pro shops, which we actually would be going to,

2025
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:58,600
I think, this holiday season in Memphis, which is in the site of the old pyramid

2026
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,160
where the Grizzlies played for a time.

2027
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:05,960
But it also has this weird kitschy appeal where people thought it was haunted

2028
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,440
or run by the mob and all this stuff.

2029
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:14,040
But it's a very cool, I mean, literally just a big great glass pyramid on the Mississippi River

2030
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:19,960
and is now a Bass Pro shops with, I think, the largest freestanding elevator in North America.

2031
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:21,800
We would go down there.

2032
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:25,960
We've been there for the holidays once before and they always have a big Santa thing.

2033
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,840
Of course, now we're not going to do it.

2034
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:32,200
But that's our idea of a good time is going to a big Bass Pro.

2035
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,280
Not that we don't do anything outdoors, but it's a cool place.

2036
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:37,160
It's another thing that's like this, which is like a cool place to look at

2037
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:40,520
because somebody tried really hard to make it look like something and it mostly worked.

2038
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,480
You know, yes.

2039
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,160
I have stayed at the hotel.

2040
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:44,440
Yes.

2041
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:45,000
In the pyramid.

2042
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,440
Yeah, we have stayed at the hotel a couple of times and it's like,

2043
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:49,960
I mean, you talk about theming.

2044
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:55,800
It is impeccably themed as a wilderness lodge, like really, really nicely done on the inside.

2045
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,960
And it's only the hotel itself is only three levels.

2046
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:04,280
And I mean, because obviously it's a pyramid, so you can only go up so high in the fucking thing.

2047
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,680
The wilderness lodge in a pyramid.

2048
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:07,400
This is great.

2049
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,000
It's incredible.

2050
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,280
It's absolutely incredible.

2051
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,400
They have they have like little crocodiles in there.

2052
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:17,160
And of course, I mean, all of the camo shit you could ever want to barf on.

2053
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,240
But, you know, Memphis itself is a really great place to visit.

2054
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:22,440
And so we would go down there.

2055
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:33,000
And actually, my wife did get roped into buying a room that came with a

2056
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:39,880
I'm trying to think of a way to phrase it where we got a discount on a room for this year last year.

2057
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:43,400
If we sat through a timeshare presentation.

2058
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:46,840
And this is something that I would never have done.

2059
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:50,040
And she did because she was like, we're going to come here anyways.

2060
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:50,600
It's so much fun.

2061
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:52,360
The girls love coming here for the holidays.

2062
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,800
They do Christmas so big here.

2063
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,960
We'll see Santa will do all this fun stuff.

2064
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,120
We get these gift cards and we get a discount on the room.

2065
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:58,680
It's perfect.

2066
01:42:58,680 --> 01:42:59,880
Of course, we're not going to buy anything.

2067
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:00,920
It doesn't matter.

2068
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:03,640
And I'm like, okay, that's not what I wanted to do.

2069
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:05,480
But okay, we've got a year to do it.

2070
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:10,200
And then this year happened and I guess it's just like money down the toilet now.

2071
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:14,360
Because they're not going to let me cancel, you know?

2072
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,440
Oh, yeah, never if they have some of your money.

2073
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:17,560
Yeah.

2074
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:18,280
Yeah.

2075
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:18,920
Oh, geez.

2076
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:23,000
Yeah, we've this came up recently.

2077
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,880
I've been curious about this pyramid, but never done the deep dive.

2078
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:31,800
We were asking for examples of like crazy, epicottish architecture recently.

2079
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:34,680
Somebody brought this up and I was like, oh, this is an episode for sure.

2080
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,280
And you're confirming this more.

2081
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:37,480
Oh, yeah.

2082
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,600
Got to check out this pyramid.

2083
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,120
Do that on your Branson loop.

2084
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:40,680
Go there.

2085
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:46,280
Get some ribs and hang out at the big pyramid.

2086
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,400
It's a fucking hoot, man.

2087
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:48,360
That's really cool.

2088
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:56,040
Well, either do we wait until COVID is over to do the loop or do we just go do it right now?

2089
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:57,720
Because everything's right.

2090
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,880
You could probably do a lot of this, couldn't we?

2091
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:00,520
Be cheap.

2092
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:01,240
Everything would be cheap.

2093
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:01,640
Mm hmm.

2094
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,400
Yeah, it would essentially be no different.

2095
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:07,960
Everyone else is doing it out here, so there would be no disruption in service.

2096
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:15,720
I think my game plan is to low bar the Farrar family and I will use their credits.

2097
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:20,360
So they're like, well, we don't lose all the he's it's a bad offer,

2098
01:44:20,360 --> 01:44:22,120
but at least we don't lose everything.

2099
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,520
Yes, that would be great.

2100
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:27,000
And then maybe you actually do want to buy the timeshare.

2101
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:27,720
I mean, we don't know.

2102
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:28,920
I mean, it could be a great deal.

2103
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:29,800
It could be anything.

2104
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:30,520
The timeshare.

2105
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,160
We know for a fact it's an investment.

2106
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:36,520
Pass that down to your kids.

2107
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:36,760
Yeah.

2108
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,000
We've been going a while.

2109
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:43,800
We'll wrap it up.

2110
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:49,560
But I have one more thing that like a truly unique experience that can only be found

2111
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:51,720
in the Opry Mills Mall.

2112
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,800
And I'm excited to share with you guys.

2113
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:58,920
So that many as we've established, many of the great restaurants,

2114
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:01,080
slash entertainment brands are in Opry Mills.

2115
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:04,600
You get your Dave and Buster's there too, a Chili's and a Chewie's,

2116
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:07,000
everything you could want.

2117
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:11,080
But there's also a Madame Tussauds.

2118
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,240
These are fairly common.

2119
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:14,760
They're around here.

2120
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:19,000
You have the added specificity of country music.

2121
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,880
You've got your Kid Rock wax figure, not his crooked business partner yet,

2122
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:25,080
but hopefully someday.

2123
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:31,320
But you know, so it's more a country influenced group of wax figures you can go see.

2124
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:39,640
And that includes a recent rising country star, Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish,

2125
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:42,200
and now recently a big country star.

2126
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,680
So there is a Darius Rucker wax figure.

2127
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,160
What's the big deal, you ask?

2128
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:50,440
You just take a picture with him.

2129
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:52,440
There's a myriad of those who cares.

2130
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:55,480
Not so fast.

2131
01:45:55,480 --> 01:46:04,280
This is the first ever wax figure that includes screen mapping technology.

2132
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:08,280
This is a thing that's in theme park world a lot.

2133
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,680
You put a projection show on the castle.

2134
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:14,840
Or I guess there's Disney characters where you project onto their face,

2135
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:19,240
but not deployed by Madame Tussauds until Darius Rucker.

2136
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:23,720
And so Darius Rucker comes to life, talks to you,

2137
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:28,520
and tells you about the process that goes into making a wax figure.

2138
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:31,720
And we'll put these on Twitter.

2139
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:34,680
This will have more impacts, I think, to look at than to hear about,

2140
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:36,920
but you guys just need to see the progression here.

2141
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:41,640
So, you know, here's regular stuff.

2142
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:44,200
That's just that's Darius and wax Darius.

2143
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,520
Yeah, that'll make sense to my brain.

2144
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:47,560
Yes, so far.

2145
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:49,000
Yes, very accurate.

2146
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:53,640
Here he is being sculpted, and it's a little, you know, creepy, of course,

2147
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:55,720
but nothing out of the ordinary.

2148
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:57,400
Crazy talent by the sculptor.

2149
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:58,360
I mean, that's incredible.

2150
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:00,680
Yeah, I mean, this is a very good looking.

2151
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:03,880
I feel like Madame Tussauds recently are pretty impeccable.

2152
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:07,080
I don't knock their work, but then we start getting into the screen.

2153
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:16,040
Here is Darius watching with some skepticism.

2154
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:20,840
A oddly brightly lit version of himself.

2155
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:24,120
He seems like scared of his own visit.

2156
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:27,560
He looks like he looks like when Jimmy Kimmel did Karl Malone.

2157
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,360
That's not good.

2158
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,040
It's like blackface Jimmy Kimmel.

2159
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:32,440
Yes.

2160
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:33,000
Oh, no.

2161
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,680
That is very unnerving.

2162
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:40,040
It's yes, or the crank yankers puppet version.

2163
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,680
Yes, he looks like he looks like a crank yanker puppet.

2164
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:44,520
So what does this look like without the screen?

2165
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:45,800
Hold on.

2166
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,120
Do it.

2167
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:46,920
You're heading to it.

2168
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:48,280
Okay.

2169
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,880
Oh, no, it's like cats.

2170
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:54,920
Wow.

2171
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:55,400
Yes.

2172
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:56,600
Very good description.

2173
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,840
Here he is being made.

2174
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:02,200
Here's like all of this, like a bunch of storyboards,

2175
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:05,240
like different expressions that Darius Rooker can make.

2176
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,160
And they all look so alarmed.

2177
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:11,720
It looks like these are all like figures that have come to life inside the computer

2178
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:12,920
and they want out.

2179
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,280
They're begging to be killed.

2180
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:19,000
And all of this made, by the way, not for nothing,

2181
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:25,720
on a Mac with a full size toolbar that does a dock that does not disappear

2182
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:26,920
when you mouse away from it.

2183
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:29,960
That's a huge oversight to your productivity.

2184
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:32,680
I mean, you're taking up a full 10% of the screen.

2185
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:33,240
Yeah, you're right.

2186
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:34,200
That's massive.

2187
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,880
No one's adjusted that size.

2188
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,560
It's only basic apps on there.

2189
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:38,920
That's crazy.

2190
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:39,240
Yeah.

2191
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:41,480
And you got updates to do in the app store.

2192
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:44,520
And they're only using like PDFs and QuickTime player.

2193
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:47,560
This is being achieved with the most basic Mac technology.

2194
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,840
Yeah, it makes sense actually now that you point that out.

2195
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:53,640
Yeah, no, it makes you have all it all adds up.

2196
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:56,280
Look at his crooked mouth on this one picture.

2197
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:59,000
It's like his mouth is trying to escape his face.

2198
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:00,440
Oh, man.

2199
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:01,640
Then we keep going.

2200
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:03,640
This one's very disturbing.

2201
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:09,160
I think this is part of a progression where like his skin tone is being painted on.

2202
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:15,720
So like he's blank and then like his texture's being filled in like an hourglass and it's very

2203
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:17,560
upsetting.

2204
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:20,760
And then now we get into some very creepy.

2205
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,920
This is just the most ghastly thing.

2206
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:29,080
Here he's poking behind some from somebody's back and now the full thing.

2207
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:29,580
No.

2208
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:35,480
Anyone feel free to describe it in your eyes.

2209
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:42,360
This to me, it just looks like Darius Rucker got crushed by a cartoon steamroller.

2210
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:46,760
So his head is just perfectly pancaked, like splayed all the way out.

2211
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:48,280
His head is three feet wide.

2212
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:54,680
It looks a lot like recently second gate addressed big Dick Tracy character little face.

2213
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:59,720
Yeah, it's like a Cronenberg body horror to me.

2214
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:01,000
Yeah, it's like thing.

2215
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:01,560
Yeah.

2216
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:02,040
Yeah.

2217
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:02,680
Yes, exactly.

2218
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:03,640
Like the thing.

2219
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:09,640
It kind of looks like that CGI image of like, well, here's how the human body could be sculpted.

2220
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:16,440
If the human body evolved to survive car crashes and it's just the most hideous looking thing

2221
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:17,720
you've ever seen.

2222
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:19,160
Oh, those monster creatures.

2223
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,600
Yeah, the monster creatures.

2224
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:20,840
Yeah.

2225
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:26,040
I mean, it gives us a preview, I guess, of if you took our head skin and unraveled it

2226
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:29,160
completely, but left the face attached.

2227
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:32,200
I guess there would be some disturbing results.

2228
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:37,160
And then just one more where he looks like a ghoul.

2229
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:37,960
What?

2230
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:40,040
Like from the Haunted Mansion.

2231
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:41,720
He looks like a singing bust.

2232
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:42,760
Whoa.

2233
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:43,720
Now hold on.

2234
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,280
That's the magic mirror from Shrek.

2235
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:49,800
That's the magic mirror that talks to Lord Farquaad.

2236
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:57,640
We'll get these all up on the Twitter so you know what we're screaming about.

2237
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:58,040
But I-

2238
01:50:58,040 --> 01:50:58,680
Wait a minute.

2239
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:00,920
I think what happened on there, they're on Windows now.

2240
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:03,480
I think this person maybe opened a link that said,

2241
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:06,840
can you tell the difference between this picture and this other picture?

2242
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,080
You have to wait 50 seconds or else you can't.

2243
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,120
And then they got scared.

2244
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,960
I think this is the scary face.

2245
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:14,200
They opened a link in their email they shouldn't have opened up.

2246
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:14,920
That's what this is.

2247
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:17,320
This is not real.

2248
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:19,400
This is a virus being distributed.

2249
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:20,520
Yep.

2250
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:21,240
A virus email.

2251
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:25,400
I will tell you what is real.

2252
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:28,760
Millions of people across the world dream this face every night.

2253
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:36,120
This is what you see when you die of COVID.

2254
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:39,080
You get a quick flash of this and then that's all she wrote.

2255
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:42,200
Yeah, yikes.

2256
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,840
Truly disturbing stuff there.

2257
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:46,840
Only at Opry Mills.

2258
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:52,120
They also, they did this gag, they did this technique,

2259
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:59,080
the first wax figure that talks to you and the excitement of this has resulted in some total of

2260
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:01,560
147 views on YouTube.

2261
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,760
The making of, no one's looking into this.

2262
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:08,200
This is not a story I had to go digging to find.

2263
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:13,960
They don't want people to know about a CGI little face Darius Rucker.

2264
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,240
Well, it also costs an exorbitant amount of money to go into that place.

2265
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:21,000
Am I wrong for thinking that?

2266
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:21,560
I think so.

2267
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:23,960
It's really a lot of money.

2268
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:27,080
I'm not sure.

2269
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:32,600
It used to be a bookstore in that slot there, which I mean, at a tourist mall,

2270
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:35,480
I guess it makes sense that that wouldn't be the most highly trafficked place.

2271
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:39,800
But the truth is, it's also a mall mall for the Nashville area.

2272
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:46,840
I mean, the other malls that we have around here, there's Cool Springs and Green Hills,

2273
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:51,640
which are really, really like the high end malls.

2274
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,840
And they're also pretty far out of the way for most Nashvilleans.

2275
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,480
And then there are some older malls as well that are borderline dilapidated.

2276
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:02,200
And so Opry Mills is like the default mall.

2277
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:06,120
In addition to being this tourist trap, it is also sort of the default mall for a lot

2278
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:07,240
of people here as well.

2279
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:13,480
So having a massive Madame Tussauds operation in there that costs, I'm going to say a hundred

2280
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:13,960
dollars.

2281
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:14,360
I don't know.

2282
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:15,800
It's something crazy to go in.

2283
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:16,440
Maybe.

2284
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,480
It's weird.

2285
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:21,400
It's very strange to look at.

2286
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:22,920
Yeah.

2287
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:23,480
Yeah.

2288
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:23,960
Yeah.

2289
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:25,800
Pretty big use of space.

2290
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,280
I also just something just occurred to me while as I continue to stare at this little

2291
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:36,840
face, Darius Rucker, it's a little face with a perfectly puffed out round, you know, like

2292
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:37,800
rest of it around.

2293
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:43,160
Is this showing us what Hootie would look like as an actual blowfish?

2294
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:43,640
Oh, wow.

2295
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:47,560
I mean, I think you hit the nail on the head there.

2296
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,400
I don't think there's any better description than that.

2297
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:51,720
It's the only explanation.

2298
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,320
I've looked up the price.

2299
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:54,360
I'm sorry.

2300
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:59,240
It's twenty five dollars if you walk up, which quite frankly might as well be one hundred

2301
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:04,360
dollars for how quickly I would not buy the ticket to go in and look at weird Hootie.

2302
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:07,000
But Hootie, the actual blowfish.

2303
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:11,080
Do you I guess as a closing that like, do you miss this place?

2304
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:15,400
I don't know if you've been or if any aspect of it is available to go see or if you've

2305
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:20,040
done the did you say you did the best pro distance Santa or are considering it?

2306
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:21,320
Oh, I will not.

2307
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:23,720
And I will not be going to a mall anytime soon.

2308
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:25,800
I can't imagine going there.

2309
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:29,240
I mean, you know, the mall, you know, I mentioned this earlier.

2310
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:35,480
People are nostalgic for Opryland and that's fine.

2311
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:41,560
I I kind of believe that nostalgia is poison, but I also know that we are all sort of

2312
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:45,560
poisoned by it to one extent or another.

2313
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:47,560
And you just kind of have to deal with it.

2314
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:49,880
I and I didn't have any memories with it.

2315
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:57,240
So the fact that it's a mall now as a man in my 30s with children who gets motion sick,

2316
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:01,320
the mall honestly serves me better than the theme park would.

2317
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:03,080
Now, it doesn't have to be not everything's for me.

2318
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:03,640
That's fine.

2319
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:07,160
But as far as I'm concerned, I would go to the mall more.

2320
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:10,200
And my wife and I did, you know, we would go see movies there.

2321
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,040
It had a huge it still does.

2322
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:16,520
And I'm sure people are in there watching fucking Transformers four being brought out

2323
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,520
to theaters again or Tenet or whatever.

2324
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:19,960
I don't know what's going on in theaters right now.

2325
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:24,600
Whatever the hell it is, you know, people are still going in there right now, I'm sure.

2326
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:30,840
But we would love to go in there and see a movie and go to Dave and Buster's and blow

2327
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:37,080
twenty dollars on a phone game that's on a 50 inch LCD screen now for some reason.

2328
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:42,040
We would love to go down and look at the build a bear thing and say,

2329
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,200
well, we're not getting our kids that, but it's cute.

2330
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:50,360
Or all of the little the little kiosks in the mall with the last time I was there,

2331
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,200
the kiosks were the following.

2332
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,440
You had the thing you throw at the wall and splats.

2333
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:56,920
They have this new thing.

2334
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:00,360
It's called like Dragon's Breath, which is it's like these little

2335
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:04,840
snacks that you put in your mouth and then it looks like you're vaping and they sell them to kids.

2336
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:06,200
That's a great.

2337
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:11,480
They're like these little puff balls that I think it's obviously not dry ice.

2338
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:13,080
It wouldn't be that it's like

2339
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:17,160
whatever the safe version is of something you can eat that gives that it's like cold,

2340
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:20,200
but you it like exhales water vapor or whatever.

2341
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,680
So you walk around, you see high schoolers or I guess middle schoolers would be the one

2342
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:29,160
surprise. Obviously high schoolers vape all the time, but like middle schoolers or children

2343
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:30,760
going like, isn't this cool?

2344
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,760
And they're like eating a snow cone or something.

2345
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:36,600
So, you know, I miss seeing that stupid shit.

2346
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:41,560
I missed the food court, which I want to talk about the food court before we go.

2347
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:42,200
Oh, yeah.

2348
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:42,440
Please.

2349
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:43,000
By all means.

2350
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:47,560
What is I mean, this is what I remember from being in the food court and I think it actually

2351
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:51,480
has changed since I went last, but I'll tell you guys what it is and you and you tell me if you

2352
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:53,560
have any favorites or things that you hate.

2353
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:02,040
There's the the Sarku or Sakeo Japan, which is like the flat top teriyaki style place.

2354
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:03,960
You pay a dollar for double meat.

2355
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:04,360
Okay.

2356
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:04,920
Okay.

2357
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,120
That's one that's pretty good.

2358
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:09,960
There's like a smoothie place and a salad place, but come on.

2359
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:12,040
There's a Burger King.

2360
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:14,440
There is a Sabaro.

2361
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:20,120
There is a I think it's a TGI Fridays and a Chili's too.

2362
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:25,160
If I'm not mistaken there, like across from each other competing for the exact same demographic

2363
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:25,640
of guy.

2364
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:29,160
It just depends on which of them is a 15 minute wait and which is a 45 minute wait.

2365
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:37,320
There was the the always mysterious Chinese typical Chinese place, but then the one that

2366
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:42,920
they inexplicably say is a Louisiana style like the Cajun place that serves the same food as the

2367
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:43,720
Chinese place.

2368
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:45,080
It just has a different name on it.

2369
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:49,720
I don't know if that's something that's common out West fond memories of those in malls.

2370
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:53,400
I grew up going to yes very I don't understand the bourbon chicken.

2371
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,200
Bourbon chicken.

2372
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:58,360
Yeah, which which one is good the bourbon chicken, you know, I just saw that as one of the only

2373
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,360
things left in a dead mall video.

2374
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:06,440
I was watching it's like the only slot out of 12 in a food court and some decaying like Ohio mall.

2375
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:07,720
Wow.

2376
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:11,480
Yeah, that's that's all I can remember being there in the food court.

2377
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:13,000
There was then claim jumper.

2378
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,560
There was a Mo's burritos place in there.

2379
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:21,320
The very airport right like does anyone does anyone done Mo Mo's isn't good.

2380
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:25,640
Is it I think I've done it once and I don't have any memory of what it was.

2381
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,080
Yeah, good or bad.

2382
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:31,720
Their main thing is a is a it's a big burrito called the home wrecker, which I think is just too cute.

2383
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:35,560
We're not you know, I'm not that interested in that.

2384
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:37,640
There's a Mexican place.

2385
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:40,920
There's a fascist barbecue joint called Mission Barbecue.

2386
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:44,280
Oh, there isn't there's a macaroni grill.

2387
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:44,920
That's pretty good.

2388
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:48,280
Yeah, it's a the barbecue place is one of the places that you will go and it's like

2389
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:54,120
it's got the American flag that's been palette swapped to look like Terminator future or whatever

2390
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:54,760
that shit is.

2391
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:59,720
But the the best place there is the Bavarian beer house.

2392
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,120
Oh, which is like a huge mass.

2393
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:03,160
It's massive.

2394
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:04,760
Yeah, it's it's totally huge.

2395
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:06,600
They have the live German music in there.

2396
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:09,240
It's like a beer hall with these long communal tables.

2397
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:12,120
Now that's now that's good eats there.

2398
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:12,920
I like that a lot.

2399
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:15,080
There's a place.

2400
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:19,320
Yeah, there's a place like that in Vegas where Jason got way too high and ran out of there.

2401
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:28,680
I was afraid either the waitress with the test tube shots or the band with the hat that moved

2402
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:29,960
was coming for me.

2403
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:33,240
There was a woman there was a woman who would paddle you for a dollar.

2404
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:39,480
Whoa, he was really Jason was really worried she was coming for him that she had a there was a

2405
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:40,840
paddle coming for his ass.

2406
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:41,560
Oh, my god.

2407
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:43,480
Tillman for Tita quote Tillman for Tita.

2408
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,080
Yeah, that was a Tillman for Tita quote.

2409
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:47,160
I did honestly all comes together.

2410
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:50,360
Yeah, that all sounds I mean, that sounds good.

2411
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:53,000
I'm a big Chili's fan of all the garbage.

2412
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:53,960
Oh, really?

2413
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:54,520
Yeah.

2414
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:57,640
So that would probably be my choice of those.

2415
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:00,040
I would like the beer hall sounds like the most fun, though.

2416
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:00,680
Sure.

2417
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:02,840
So you're thinking chicken crispers, I guess.

2418
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:05,480
Yeah, chicken crispers for sure.

2419
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:10,520
I like the big platter with the ribs and you can get like a big you can get like

2420
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:13,480
six different horrible things.

2421
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:13,800
Yeah.

2422
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,240
Like from around the menu.

2423
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:16,520
Yep.

2424
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:17,320
Yep.

2425
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:18,360
That would be good.

2426
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:26,520
I it'd be it's it I'm imagining now like what if I did go do a like a curbside pickup.

2427
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:28,200
Awesome blossom.

2428
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:35,560
But I'm confident that my wife would not join me in that and my baby is a baby, so he would not.

2429
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:43,160
So me just sadly peeling off bit after bit of a would that be it depends on my attitude.

2430
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:45,160
If I make it sad, it's sad.

2431
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:50,120
But if I make it the coolest thing I've done for the entire quarantine, maybe it is.

2432
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:52,920
Yeah, that doesn't sound that sad to me.

2433
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:54,600
That doesn't sound sad.

2434
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:55,080
I don't know.

2435
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:56,520
No, I mean, it's.

2436
02:00:56,520 --> 02:01:01,960
Chili's is inherently sad, so once you're there, it doesn't matter.

2437
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:02,920
It's all good.

2438
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:06,120
I mean, it's going to be ice cold by the time you get at home.

2439
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:08,200
Yeah, because unless you're eating in your car.

2440
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:10,760
Scott, the closest one is in the Sino, I believe.

2441
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:13,720
Yes, I know, but I can get back and forth pretty fast.

2442
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:15,800
I mean, it's pretty deep in Sino.

2443
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:18,680
It's pretty West and Sino, but there's no traffic anywhere.

2444
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:23,720
So now that is not that far from where my baby goes to the doctor.

2445
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:26,840
So I could the next time he's going to go to the doctor, drop them off,

2446
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:30,840
sit in the car and eat an awesome blossom by myself and then go pick them up.

2447
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:33,240
That's how far I get.

2448
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:36,680
Well, could you bring the awesome blossom in the waiting room?

2449
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:41,960
I'm sure they'd appreciate that and then take off my mask in this pediatric care lobby.

2450
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:42,840
I'm eating here.

2451
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:45,400
A lot of pediatricians have different sections.

2452
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:49,000
They have the well section and the sick section and the awesome blossom to go

2453
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,760
section that you have to kind of sit in there.

2454
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:51,880
It's next to the aquarium.

2455
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:56,680
But I still got a view if I can watch the fish.

2456
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:02,600
This is the Opry Mills experience condensed, I feel.

2457
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:03,960
You're absolutely right, man.

2458
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:04,760
Oh, beautiful.

2459
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:05,400
This is great.

2460
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:11,400
Any closing thoughts or words of wisdom about this area, this theme park, but also,

2461
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:14,200
I mean, it became the mall as we knew it would.

2462
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:18,520
Well, we neglected to mention when they opened the Grand Ole Opry house,

2463
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:22,120
the big venue they built for the Grand Ole Opry,

2464
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:26,840
who was in attendance and sat down and played a couple's ditties on the piano,

2465
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:29,000
President Richard Nixon himself.

2466
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:29,720
That's right.

2467
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:37,080
Of course, on the Disney dish on Jim and Len's show, they had a historian from the

2468
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:42,920
Smithsonian on recently who talked about Nixon's love of these theme parks.

2469
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:50,520
And he did want to go to the opening of Disney World, but could not because of the optics,

2470
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:54,040
because he was about to withdraw a ton of troops from Vietnam,

2471
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:55,880
and they thought it would just look too bad.

2472
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:00,520
While he was on the ride.

2473
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:06,520
But in his place, he sent H.R. Haldeman with a flag that flew over the White House,

2474
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:08,520
the first one Nixon ever gave out.

2475
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:10,520
Wow.

2476
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,280
To present to Roy O. Disney.

2477
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:15,800
Haldeman, of course, ended up doing time for the water gate break.

2478
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,320
I've never heard that one.

2479
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:20,200
That's bonkers.

2480
02:03:20,680 --> 02:03:23,720
Ladies and gentlemen, H.R. Haldeman.

2481
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:28,040
He was not on that opening day special.

2482
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:28,540
No.

2483
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:34,680
I was aware that we missed that fact, and I will continue to do.

2484
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:39,880
I think maybe Mr. Nixon will play us out of this episode.

2485
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:41,340
Oh, goodie.

2486
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:43,720
That became my plan as I started thinking here.

2487
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:49,960
Um, but, uh, uh, Nixon, notwithstanding any, anything we want to any more,

2488
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:54,920
last things we want to say to, to this wonderful campus, uh, the many things to do over the years.

2489
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:56,620
Hmm.

2490
02:03:57,160 --> 02:04:01,880
Uh, I just, I am, I would have liked to have visited Dua Diti City.

2491
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:02,920
That's all I'd like to say.

2492
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:09,000
Yeah, I, I guess, you know what?

2493
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,080
Nothing lasts forever is the way I feel about Opryland.

2494
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:16,520
You know, um, it had its moment in the sun.

2495
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:22,360
Would it still be there today if a couple of incompetent CEOs hadn't decided that there was

2496
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:26,520
more money in this weird land grab or whatever they were doing at the time?

2497
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:27,320
I don't know.

2498
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:31,080
I mean, if it were around now, it would be hitting pretty hard times, right?

2499
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:32,440
I mean, like everything else is.

2500
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:34,040
So I don't know.

2501
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:37,160
I guess that's in the interim, another 25 years or whatever.

2502
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:40,680
It could have had some, some good times, but so be it.

2503
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:42,520
We got a Dave and Buster's now.

2504
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:43,320
Move on.

2505
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:46,360
You know, you can go in there and do the fruit ninja on a big iPad.

2506
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:47,320
What the hell else do you want?

2507
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:52,120
You think the fucking rock and roller coaster is better than fruit ninja on a big iPad?

2508
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:52,520
You know what?

2509
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:53,720
I don't know what to tell you.

2510
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:58,200
Get with the times, get down to Opry Mills, turn in your tickets for a stuffed bear,

2511
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:01,880
get some COVID, uh, jump on the trampoline for $20.

2512
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:04,360
Go to Madame Tussauds for a hundred.

2513
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:07,240
I, you know, have a good time.

2514
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:09,240
See a jolly old elephant, a fish tank.

2515
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:12,760
Drowning Santa.

2516
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:16,760
Um, they've got it all at the Opry Mills.

2517
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:19,480
Uh, beautiful closing words with that.

2518
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:22,200
Jesse Ferrari survived, but gets the ride.

2519
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:23,480
Uh, what a blast.

2520
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:25,160
Thanks so much for joining us here.

2521
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:28,440
Uh, and hey, let's exit through the gift shop or is there anything you would like to plug?

2522
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:29,880
Yeah.

2523
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:34,200
Um, you mentioned at the top, um, I do a show with my friend, Mike Hale called your Kickstarter sucks.

2524
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:38,840
Um, we talk about all the shitty stuff on Kickstarter, actually pretty similar to stuff

2525
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:40,200
that would be in any gift shop.

2526
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:43,960
Um, except for most of the time it never makes it out of the idea phase.

2527
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:47,720
So if you like goofing on, uh, silly products, that's a good place to go.

2528
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:53,160
Um, we've also, uh, teamed up with my friend, Chris James, a great comedian, uh, to do the

2529
02:05:53,160 --> 02:05:54,440
new show on Stitcher premium.

2530
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:55,160
It's called good morning.

2531
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:56,120
Good morning.

2532
02:05:56,120 --> 02:05:58,360
Um, it's a little bit different, uh, than YKS.

2533
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:02,600
It's the sort we're playing radio hosts and we've got some, uh, very funny, uh, comedian

2534
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:05,000
friends on to do some great bits.

2535
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,920
Uh, we're really excited about doing that.

2536
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:10,760
It comes out, um, pretty much as soon as this episode comes out.

2537
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:14,040
Um, yeah, so that's a good timing on that.

2538
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:15,080
We're really excited.

2539
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:18,680
And then, uh, I do a stream, uh, pretty much every night of the week, uh, with my friends,

2540
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:22,840
Stefan heck and Rob Wiseman, um, it's called the go off Kings and we go on there and we

2541
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:25,400
play games, uh, pretty badly most of the time.

2542
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:29,560
Uh, but we have a good time and goof off, you know, kind of like this, if you like goofs

2543
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:32,920
and good boys, I think that's a good place to find yourself over there on Twitch at the

2544
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:33,880
go off King stream.

2545
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:35,960
So, uh, thanks for having me guys a lot.

2546
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:37,720
I really appreciate it and I love the show.

2547
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:38,600
So it's nice to be on.

2548
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:39,160
Oh, geez.

2549
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:39,880
Thank you so much.

2550
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:40,840
So much fun.

2551
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:41,080
Yeah.

2552
02:06:41,080 --> 02:06:41,400
Yeah.

2553
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:41,640
Great.

2554
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:42,360
Great area.

2555
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,280
Go off Kings hitting a fruit Ninja at, um, uh, David Buster's anytime soon.

2556
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:52,200
We're we're actually, we have to do a lot of practice before we're able to get up to

2557
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:53,080
the fruit Ninja level.

2558
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:56,760
We're sort of like, we're on the, like, uh, starting the stream on time, making sure the

2559
02:06:56,760 --> 02:07:00,520
system turns on, everything's plugged in, the controller is charged.

2560
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:04,040
And then, and then we'll get to the big boy stuff like fruit Ninja on the iPad, you know?

2561
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:05,000
Mm hmm.

2562
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:06,760
Uh, uh, awesome.

2563
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:08,440

2568
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:37,240
months away from resigning the presidency.

2569
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:45,640
Um, uh, but in happier times, uh, opening the new grand old Opry at the, at the future

2570

02:07:58,120 --> 02:07:58,920
to this episode.

2573
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:00,840
Thanks everybody so much for listening.

2574
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:02,220
Dick.

2575
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:10,360
How weird is it to look at, by the way, like I knew he played.

2576
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:20,600
He's mainly blocked by a head in the audience.

2577
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:23,800
Video says low resolution preview.

2578
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:28,760
He had the angriest face I've ever seen.

2579
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:31,000
He was like, you will God bless America.

2580
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:36,920
So should we all.

2581
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:48,440
A bunch of glaring people in thick glasses.

2582
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:56,440
Tucker Carlson's dad.

2583
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:07,800
Great job, Dick.

2584
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:20,120
