00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello there subscribers, hello there patrons. This is Scott Gardner joined by Michael Carlson,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,920
Jason Charrod. Oh boy, it's hush tones, it's hush tones here because anticipation is building

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:19,120
because we are so excited to unleash the next big announcement in podcast The Ride History and

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,200
genuinely I'm thrilled about all this stuff. This is a multi-tiered announcement. One leads to

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,200
another, one builds to another and it's all one big beautiful ecosystem. So let's get to it.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,800
The first thing to announce is the next big podcast The Ride theme month, theme celebration,

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,080
whatever you want to call it and it is this. Podcast The Ride Sin City Nights, a celebration

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:53,760
of the themed entertainment of Las Vegas, Nevada. We've been talking about this for a while. You may

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,840
have even caught that we have not done a ton of Vegas. I think we did the Star Trek experience,

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,160
but we've been pretty sparing and a lot of the things when we say on Twitter, hey,

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,600
topics for second gay topics for main feed, so much of the biggest stuff that's left, so much of

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,040
the meatiest stuff that's left from current to 90s to probably insane 60, 70. There's so much,

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,240
I don't even, we don't know what it's going to be yet, but boy are we excited to cut loose on that

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,840
Vegas shit. Yeah. I mean, there's just, I, this could be a yearly tradition. I'm not saying it is,

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,160
but it could be with the amount of stuff there is to cover. Oh yeah. I'm saying it's the only one.

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Yeah. Unless it is very poorly received, but I can't imagine knowing what we have to talk about,

17
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,800
knowing what's in the arsenal. Either it's poorly received or every episode is 20 hours long.

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,000
So either way, it's possibly possible. Yeah. We don't know. Very, very possible. I know. Yeah.

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,160
The endless running times might come back this month because we are salivating.

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,080
Cannot wait for podcast the ride sin city nights, but there's more. And the more is this,

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:07,840
the centerpiece of podcast the ride sin city nights will take place on Saturday, July 22nd

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:16,480
in Las Vegas, Nevada. As we put on our first ever live show in Las Vegas, or as we prefer to call it

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,040
podcast the rides, big Vegas groove blender. We guys also, you guys say groove. Let me do

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:31,680
one more time to say the rides. Big Vegas groove blender. Yeah. I sure bought a harmonica. Oh yeah.

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,720

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,840

28
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,720
word. It's not a nation, but it's the, you know, they love it there. Let me tell you as a Vegas
