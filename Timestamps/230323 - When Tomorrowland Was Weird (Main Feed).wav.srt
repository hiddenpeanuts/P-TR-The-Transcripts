1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,800
Warning, the following podcast features versatile metals, a Dutch boy, decorative test tubes,

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,400
and plenty of toilet talk.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:40,920
Plus a look back when Tomorrowland was weird on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,720
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, presented by Raytheon, quality guided missiles and Kent

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,560
cigarettes, the cigarettes of the atomic age.

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,480
We're the hosts of tomorrow, Scott Gardner, as well as Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Yes.

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
Hello, I'm Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,640
I just want to say that some of the missiles that Raytheon make are friendly missiles.

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,280
So I just want to make sure everyone knows that before we begin.

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
They protect the skies.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
That's right.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
They're good.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
They prevent less trustworthy missiles.

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Good, nice missiles.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Jason Sheridan.

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,520
National lead paint, national lead paint.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,760
All our friends are here today.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,980
It's a great lineup of shady companies, like really one of the best that we have assembled

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,600
because it's what Walt Disney assembled when Tomorrowland was weird.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,280
The perfectly tied into the title.

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Yeah.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,960
So we're talking about the early days of Tomorrowland, from 55 to 60 roughly, although it doesn't

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,440
all line up like that, but early Tomorrowland bullshit.

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,320
Are you guys excited about it?

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,560
I am very excited.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,360
This seems like a tailor made for us kind of topic.

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,880
I mean, I knew bits and pieces, but looking at it all together and thinking about the

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,920
narrative, I guess I never really knew the narrative of like Tomorrowland almost didn't

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,120
happen at all for opening.

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Yeah.

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
Yeah.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,560
And that's kind of the, I found this all interesting from the perspective of, we said in the people

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,240
mover episode that we'd talk about Tomorrowland a bunch this year, and this is maybe the first

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,200
we've returned to it.

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,760
And I think it's interesting because Tomorrowland at Disneyland especially is in a rough place.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,560
We've complained about it many a time and we're going to kind of tackle this problem

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,560
this year as much as we can.

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,920
But I was like, I wonder if like to, could we diagnose the problem a little easier if

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,800
we started at the beginning, if we go back to the roots and see are the roots rotting,

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,360
what's going on under the surface?

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,520
And I think it's not, it doesn't start good with Tomorrowland.

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
No, it doesn't.

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
You're treating the underlying.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,840
You don't want to just treat one of the symptoms.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,340
You want to treat the patient.

49
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,160
You want to treat the underlying condition that's there.

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,960
So that's what we're talking about here when we just start this massive Tomorrowland redo

51
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,160
that we're going to fix.

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,560
We're going to make happen somehow.

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Yeah.

54
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Over the course of the year.

55
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Yes.

56
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
We will slowly solve the problem.

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,280
When you look at it through the lens of like going all the way back to the beginning, it

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,800
really does seem like the land is like a prize fighter in a big bout with a one arm tied

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
behind its back.

60
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,480
It's just like everywhere else, you know, everywhere was struggling.

61
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,800
Opening day was a disaster.

62
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
You always hear that.

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:48,820
But I guess I, it never really dawned on me of just how not just weird, but like messed

64
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,200
up Tomorrowland was.

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,400
It was an afterthought in a lot of ways.

66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Seemingly.

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Yes.

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Yeah.

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,160
So it's a scramble building Disneyland, as we know.

70
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,200
The whole thing was done within a year.

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Correct?

72
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
We've sort of because it was various ways.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,560
It was not a long time building.

74
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Right.

75
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,760
Because it was going to be delayed and then all of a sudden it wasn't.

76
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Sure.

77
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
Yeah.

78
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Well, I mean, I'm at Disneyland in general.

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
Like the whole.

80
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Oh, yes.

81
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
The whole thing takes a year.

82
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,480
And it seems like the initial energy really goes into like the huge carving of the earth.

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,840
You know, we got to make these rivers and then the rivers I think drained and was not

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,960
a river and they had to figure out how to make the river actually a river.

85
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,880
And then there, you know, the big stuff they're thinking about the Mark Twain, we're going

86
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,160
to build, we're going to take a lot of care to make a perfect old river boat and the jungle

87
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,420
cruise that, you know, that the foliage has to be perfect.

88
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,800
And then it seems like Tomorrowland just got kicked down the curb over and over again and

89
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,120
not dealt with.

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
Where it was.

91
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,440
It wasn't going to make opening day.

92
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,800
And then Walt hit a point where he couldn't stop thinking about it.

93
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
He's like, I've talked about it on the TV show too much.

94
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Yes.

95
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,680
He's been on television standing next to upstanding Nazi scientists.

96
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Yeah.

97
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:13,000
So this was another refresher of how many damn Nazis were hanging around the Disneyland.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,040
And if he doesn't get this place open, then it's it's not fair to the audience and it's

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,480
not fair to the Nazis.

100
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
It's not.

101
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,320
You can't make promises right in front of the Nazis that you don't keep.

102
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
No.

103
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,600
It's a weird thing.

104
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,360
Like everybody like it's because if you don't know this, that the Disneyland TV show thematically

105
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,040
represented the big lands.

106
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,240
Here's the Adventureland Weeks and specials.

107
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
There's Frontierland.

108
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
Here's Fantasyland.

109
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,080
And Tomorrowland was all these like man in space.

110
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,760
These forward thinking specials that were legitimately educational and like helped the

111
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,040
drive to, you know, to the space race and educated the public about that.

112
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,120
But for some reason, it's Nazi scientists.

113
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
Some reason it's not.

114
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Yeah.

115
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,520
The source.

116
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,980
It was almost I guess the public was just like it was almost like a game of like risk

117
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
or some.

118
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,040
Well, we captured this and now they work for us.

119
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
And you're like, wait a minute.

120
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
Hold on a minute.

121
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Operation Paperclip.

122
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Get them.

123
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Get them out of Europe.

124
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Yeah.

125
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,060
It was almost just like not even thinking of the implications of what had happened versus

126
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:19,040
just like, well, now now we've captured a playing piece in a way like they flipped good

127
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,840
as soon as we met them.

128
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,680
As soon as we shook their hands, it transformed them into good.

129
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Exactly.

130
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
So everything's fine now.

131
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
Don't worry.

132
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Put them right on television.

133
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Yeah.

134
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,320
They're TV ready.

135
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,980
So that's well, look at boy.

136
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,280
It's even before the park is that is the Tomorrowland rot.

137
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
That's what we're finding.

138
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,240
Tomorrowland has these specials with bad people in them.

139
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
That's true.

140
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,480
And then things get cooking.

141
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,520
And as you said, Jason, I didn't realize this, that it's September 54.

142
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,600
Tomorrowland is essentially killed entirely.

143
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,720
Not that we'll never build it.

144
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,280
But this guy, C.V. Wood, this early developer says to Walt, we can't do it.

145
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,480
It's just we don't have the money and we don't have the time.

146
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,260
We're just going to have to call this future expansion.

147
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,280
So this was going to be it's Galaxy's Edge and Rise of the Resistance opening later.

148
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,040
Or Avengers campus with maybe never a ride over there.

149
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Right.

150
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Like it is.

151
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
It's funny.

152
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,280
These things that remind you like, oh, it's kind of all the same like the same syndromes

153
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,280
have happened ever since 55 or 54.

154
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Yeah.

155
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,040
Everything everything repeats in different ways and different.

156
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,280
The Haunted Mansion took 10 years or whatever.

157
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Right.

158
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Right.

159
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
Oh, yeah.

160
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,100
But so yeah, it then months pass.

161
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,360
It drives him crazy.

162
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,040
He's like, we got to do something.

163
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,320
We're going to do something.

164
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
And they scramble.

165
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,880
By the way, a lot of this I'm pulling from something called Disney History Institute

166
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,000
dot com, which is a cool website.

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Great website.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,360
Read the the actual stuff.

170
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,800
But so they start getting into it.

171
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,880
They start they start dreaming.

172
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,760
But they only got six months or so to go.

173
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:05,600
And it's tougher to do Tomorrowland in general than it is to everything we always come back

174
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,080
to of like, how do we represent tomorrow?

175
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,800
And is it a future that never was?

176
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,240
Or is it a retro future?

177
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,960
Like they were again, they were having this problem back then because we know how to make

178
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
the old west.

179
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
We know what that looks like.

180
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,640
And we know who in California can build old west stuff.

181
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Yeah.

182
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
But tomorrow and what is it?

183
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
What is it going to be?

184
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,120
They have this problem from the very beginning.

185
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Yeah, they're going to build a UFO.

186
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,680
Like what are they going to build?

187
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Like they have to.

188
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
It's an imagination.

189
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,680
They have to they have to come up with a concept and build original things that don't exist

190
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
in the world.

191
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,080
Was there even that much like sci fi fascination at this point?

192
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,800
Like was UFO big?

193
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,640
I don't know when like I don't know the timeline of like War of the Worlds and such.

194
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,000
But well, there were B movies before this.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,640
So I don't know that it was such a mainstream thing.

196
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,760
I think like your dweebs and geeks of the time certainly liked this type of entertainment.

197
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,680
I don't know that perverts like you had that year like a science fiction comic book is

198
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,800
like you go read that in the darkest room you can find.

199
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Yeah.

200
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Not in public.

201
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Right.

202
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Yeah.

203
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I mean, Walt would rather have Nazis on TV than a dweeb that likes.

204
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,000
We need all those Operation Paperclip guys.

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,600
That is the thing that I keep coming across recently where it's like, oh, yeah, the rise

206
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:30,560
in like canned food really picked up after World War II because there was so much surplus

207
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,160
and there were so many companies who learned how to make preserved goods for the war effort.

208
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,840
And then after World War II, the space race, so many innovations came from, I was trying

209
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,480
not to say in a venture, so many innovations came from like stuff developed for the space

210
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
race.

211
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Oh, that's interesting.

212
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,320
The war stuff fed right into the space race.

213
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,160
Plan nine is 1959 plan nine from outer space, which is not, of course, the I don't know

214
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
that it like popularized.

215
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
No, it didn't.

216
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
Yeah, yeah.

217
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,000
But there's like, yeah, there's plenty of like weird serial stuff from the 40s.

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sure, sure.

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, yeah.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Forties and Buck Rogers and stuff.

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,920
But yeah, it doesn't seem like that was ever in the cards.

222
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,360
That kind of future was not because I think he was I think what was always interested

223
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,000
in the science fact of it all and everything that fed into Epcot eventually like what really

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,640
will be the future soon.

225
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
So they start digging.

226
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,480
Well, what can we do with the little time we have?

227
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,000
And Walt started dreaming up a big fountain that's made up of molecules.

228
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,520
I sort of in the realm of what that DNA in front of wonders of life.

229
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Right.

230
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,360
And this looked the designs of this look cool and poppy.

231
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,360
And then they're like, no, not going to happen.

232
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Not enough time.

233
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,920
There were even I mean, the grand plans of it were like that there's like, I think maybe

234
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,800
a stationary but still like a representation of a monorail essentially in the hub that

235
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,880
there's like a track and like a mock up of a monorail just to give the idea of like futuristic

236
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,680
vehicles that's out.

237
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,520
There was talk of a restaurant kind of at the at the front of it where you pick your

238
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,460
food on a conveyor belt.

239
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,080
But then the conveyor belt also cooks the food.

240
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Yeah.

241
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,840
And you watch all of that happen until they realized, well, that is literally a future

242
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,960
idea and I don't know if we can do that.

243
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,480
They couldn't even picture the Burger King flame broiled whopper phenomenon yet.

244
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Yeah.

245
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Or the Quiznos.

246
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Oh, yeah.

247
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
The little Quiznos belt.

248
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
What was that called?

249
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Oh, yeah.

250
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Did they patent that?

251
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
That Quiznos little belt?

252
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Is Quiznos still around?

253
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,120
I think there is a lot less, but I think there's still some.

254
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
OK.

255
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,400
It does feel like they were on every street corner.

256
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,720
There were Quiznos across the street from each other at one time.

257
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,520
They were on Subway's ass for a while.

258
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,040
And now Subway won, I feel like.

259
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Yeah.

260
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
Yeah, they really won.

261
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Yeah.

262
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,960
2008, 2009 doing PA jobs definitely would stop at a Quiznos every now and then.

263
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,440
Is Togo's still around?

264
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
There is still Togo's.

265
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
A little bit.

266
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
OK.

267
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,280
But they never had the market share.

268
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,560
And how did Subway manage to do it despite having the worst possible spokesperson?

269
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,360
Well, Walt did Nazi's on and Subway had Jared and they both did fine.

270
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
The brand was...

271
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,920
It really tells you the staying power of Subway, that they were not hurt, I don't think, in

272
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
any way.

273
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
Not for a second.

274
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,220
The worst spokesperson.

275
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,800
People were probably finding out in line.

276
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,840
They're like, oh, yeah, the spokesman was a pedophile.

277
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Huh?

278
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
All right.

279
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Well.

280
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,040
Well, I'm not going to go touch anybody when I leave this with my sandwich.

281
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
I'm going to get...

282
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Tuna.

283
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Footlong tuna.

284
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
I'm eating it and then I'm going back to work.

285
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Tuna's not really tuna.

286
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Footlong tuna and what?

287
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,080
I don't care about the fact that the tuna's not tuna.

288
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
It's delicious.

289
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
That's part of the...

290
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
I love the tuna.

291
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:50,360
I'm not going to let one bad apple spoil the bunch of fake tuna that is spoiled and will

292
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
make me sick.

293
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Right.

294
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
It is.

295
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,280
I mean, looking at long past Disneyland history is really fascinating because I think I've

296
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,560
talked before about excavating recent history.

297
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,760
Finding the tie in DC comics where Superman's shaking Jared Fogel's hand and going, like,

298
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,400
thank you for your help today.

299
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Or just the eBay...

300
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
That one happened?

301
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Oh, yeah.

302
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
That's real.

303
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Yeah.

304
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Oh, no.

305
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,680
Or just the stuff on eBay where you can find the Lehman Brothers company swag.

306
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,320
Just stuff that has gone under and it's like, oh, they made so much garbage.

307
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,720
The garbage is still out there.

308
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,640
It's still very expensive.

309
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
Wow.

310
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,260
I'm glad DC then wasn't like, we need to commemorate...

311
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,420
We got our Six Flags deal.

312
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,360
We should commemorate the Jared moment in the parks in every Six Flags.

313
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Oh, yeah.

314
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Subway, in every Star Wars statue.

315
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
The highest quality.

316
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Yeah.

317
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,400
Well, with Six Flags, though, there may still be time.

318
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
All right.

319
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
We just finished.

320
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,440
It may be in process for the last 15 years and they're just like, you know what?

321
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,000
We made it.

322
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,080
Maybe we just put the statue out.

323
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,640
Can we put a wig on?

324
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,480
He could probably look, you know, Jared looked like anybody.

325
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,720
Yeah, we spent money.

326
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,040
Why would we waste it?

327
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,560
So it's possible.

328
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,720
So plans are out.

329
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
What do we do?

330
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,100
Eventually it lands at just build two big buildings.

331
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,800
Just make two big buildings.

332
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Get going on those because we need the time to get those installed.

333
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,160
What will be in the buildings?

334
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
I don't know.

335
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,040
Just make the buildings and we will figure it out.

336
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
So they call it a mansion.

337
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
Oh, yeah, true.

338
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Build the front of it or whatever.

339
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,040
I don't know what it's going to be, but build it.

340
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Yeah.

341
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Yeah.

342
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,960
Exterior is up for a long time before they even know predates what even goes in there.

343
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,440
And the layout of Tomorrowland remains the same, essentially, that you walk into this

344
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,120
thoroughfare and here's the what now on your left is Buzz Lightyear and what now on your

345
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,080
right is Star Tours.

346
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,880
That basic layout is the same.

347
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,480
But then what are we do?

348
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,080
And I don't know who exactly is tasked with this, but here's where we get into.

349
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:19,320
Let's assemble the squadron of the shadiest companies in America to toss together some

350
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,600
barely entertaining commercials.

351
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Ads for themselves.

352
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Yeah.

353
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Yeah.

354
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Yeah.

355
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,700
That aren't even as like because now we're a little more accustomed to there's fun little

356
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,440
package delivery scenes at the end of Space Mountain sponsored by FedEx.

357
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,640
These are truly just, hey, it's us.

358
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,680
And awkwardly, because none of them really want to say, here's the this of tomorrow.

359
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,800
It's them saying it's this, which will be really good tomorrow, but it's also very good

360
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
right now.

361
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,320
Would you like to buy some right now?

362
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,480
Unlike most companies, we did tomorrow today.

363
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,600
That's just that's just our quality standard.

364
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,440
Yeah, head down the street, head down the street to your local establishment.

365
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,040
Get out of this, go to the crane bathroom showroom.

366
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,800
Actually, it's more fun than here.

367
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,080
Disneyland.

368
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,800
It's so funny because Walt, you know, when you read about him, he was such a control

369
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,200
freak and a guy wanted this quality to be so high.

370
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,400
I like the idea that all this stuff existed here, but it sucks.

371
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
It's like bad.

372
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
It's all bad.

373
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
It does.

374
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,520
It's surprising that he allowed this to open all of this stuff, which we'll talk about

375
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
today.

376
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
It's funny.

377
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
It's desperation.

378
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
I know you're right.

379
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,960
And like for the level of the quality control he's able to have over the films is then this

380
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,760
new medium just become an entire land is just it's all together.

381
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,280
World's fair, but worse.

382
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
It's awful.

383
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
Yeah.

384
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Yeah.

385
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
It's so funny.

386
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
I love it.

387
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,360
But and the rest of the park is, you know, it's not like the one the park today, the

388
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,520
gray, you can see the grass and see deep into the hills or Vanaheim, people get away or

389
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
climb a fence.

390
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
That's fine.

391
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,000
I understand that that was just sort of like that's a work in progress.

392
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,320
But tomorrow it was awful.

393
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
It was bad.

394
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,080
It definitely mirrors Main Street in terms of lots of sponsors and vendors.

395
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,820
But like for them, for the most part, Main Street had like things people could use like

396
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:26,200
coffee or liverwurst or like whatever nasty undergarments Jason needs.

397
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,000
I was trying to remember the nasty menu.

398
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,480
Yes.

399
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,760
What is now the plaza?

400
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,800
Could you get a tube of liverwurst on Main Street?

401
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,560
You could get a display tube from the pharmacy.

402
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
OK.

403
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,720
And then you put it in there.

404
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,440
Capsules before churros.

405
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,480
You just like took a you walked around with a hot tube, one hot tube, please.

406
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,080
This is too futuristic, actually.

407
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Yeah.

408
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
You know.

409
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Yeah, you're right.

410
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,960
This is all it's hard to imagine what function this here now.

411
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,960
I don't know if I know the source of this quote, but I liked it.

412
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,960
This might be from a book by Randy Bright, the Disneyland Store.

413
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,040
I'm not sure what it is.

414
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,680
But all right, with time and money running short before the opening of Tomorrowland,

415
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,960
Walt had been forced to accept several corporate county fair type exhibit.

416
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
That's even below.

417
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Yeah.

418
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
We're calling it World's Fair.

419
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
That is more accurate.

420
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Right.

421
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,360
No insult to county fairs, which can be excellent, but are often intended to run for a couple

422
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
months.

423
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,480
And these some of these ran for years and years.

424
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,000
Some of these attractions did little more than promote the companies themselves and

425
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,800
even less to promote the future.

426
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,720
That is very true.

427
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Yeah.

428
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,560
Mostly seemingly unentertaining things.

429
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,680
And now the onus is on us to make the discussion of the non entertaining things entertaining.

430
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, I think we can do our challenge on the mics.

431
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
All right.

432
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I dare you take the challenge.

433
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,360
Take the podcast, the ride challenge.

434
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,000
It's not like the subway challenge.

435
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's a better.

436
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
No, no, no, no.

437
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,160
No blood on the hands of this challenge.

438
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,280
Can I want to talk first before we dive into the companies, let's talk about one of the

439
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,120
biggest things you would see, which is really nothing.

440
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,280
The Court of Honor, the Court of Honor, the listeners know offhand what the Court of Honor

441
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,800
is and do you does that phrase conjure anything to you?

442
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,680
Imagine what that might possibly be.

443
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,720
And now, Jason, what is it?

444
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,760
OK, I saw this somewhere.

445
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,640
I just saw the phrase and I thought I'd have to look this up.

446
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,000
And then I there was a defunct land that that tied a lot of this together for me because

447
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,760
I saw a lot of individual blogs and it it helped fill in a lot of blanks.

448
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,440
The Court of Honor was forty eight state flags on tall poles and then a taller pole with

449
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,200
the American flag.

450
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
That's the best.

451
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
That's the best.

452
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,680
And that is a super state.

453
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,880
That is that is seemingly the most attempt to like tie this all together.

454
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Bunch of flags.

455
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
It was a bunch of flags.

456
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Yeah, flags.

457
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Uh huh.

458
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
So they did that.

459
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,160
Walton get his molecules, but he got his bunch of flags and which I think for a while, I

460
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,120
think it moved a couple of times.

461
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,000
But what now is that if you're depressed when you see what used to be the people mover loading

462
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,600
station and and the rocket jets and is now that sculpture that doesn't move right, at

463
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,840
least that all is better than a bunch of flags.

464
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
A bunch of.

465
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Yeah.

466
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
Is it?

467
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Did anybody check each flag?

468
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,360
Were there any fake flags that he felt would be there tomorrow or like he?

469
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,640
Waltz thought certain countries would invade each other and he invented new flags.

470
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,360
Like did he do any of that or was it just flags from countries in the moment?

471
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,000
So like you're thinking like Pole, Nebraska, when Poland invades Nebraska.

472
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,720
Yes, new pole, Nebraska, when Poland invaded Nebraska, because Walt had like some idea

473
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,400
of like different countries and what would happen.

474
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,400
China, when China takes over Florida.

475
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,800
Yeah, he had all the states.

476
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,400
He also had the Russian flag and the Soviet Union flag because it's like, well, we could

477
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,680
lose this Cold War.

478
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
So just be safe.

479
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,720
We want those on hand to roll up really quick.

480
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,000
Walt loves America, but he will easily love Russia if it comes to that.

481
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,720
It was a color change flag.

482
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,960
It was an innovative flag.

483
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,520
It could change color on it with just like, I don't know, a little button or something.

484
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,000
Just push it gently.

485
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,480
Now we're new allegiance.

486
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,040
I was just looking for some future way this ties into progress or the future by having

487
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,240
all the all the flags.

488
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,920
No, and it wasn't like new New York, the floating New York in the full shape of New York.

489
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Right.

490
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
But it's up in the clouds.

491
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,320
I know just regular ground New York.

492
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Right.

493
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,080
Boring is what I say to that.

494
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Yeah.

495
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,240
Similarly boring.

496
00:21:52,240 --> 00:22:01,000
What became the big entrance item, which was the clock of the world, big ish clock that

497
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,600
shows you what time it is across the world.

498
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,160
Now, this, I think, is at least novel.

499
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,680
Like this, I kind of get it kind of looks cool.

500
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,400
Like seems interesting.

501
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,840
You know, the clock of the world to me reminds me of a large version of the mind control

502
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,880
device that Edward Nigma does and uses in Batman forever.

503
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
It's got a similar.

504
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
It's got like a blender.

505
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
It looks like a blender.

506
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,480
It's got a thing on it and he puts it on.

507
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:36,600
It's disguised as like a virtual reality kind of like Elon Musk's implant that just gets

508
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,280
in your brain and delivers content.

509
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,600
But yeah, it looks like this Edward Nigma Elon Musk connection.

510
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,040
People think it's cool, but isn't he just the new Edward Nigma?

511
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,000
Either undertones of that in my Batman forever two script.

512
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,560
You're holding in the.

513
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,640
But here's the twist.

514
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,880
Unlike Edward Nigma, Elon Musk is not funny.

515
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,040
You couldn't tell a riddle to save his life.

516
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
That's true.

517
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,840
His riddles are all stolen from people online and he doesn't cite sources.

518
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,240
So consider riddling me this if you want.

519
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,960
Yeah, yeah, no.

520
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,000
In Batman forever two, Edward Nigma will still be able to riddle well.

521
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,200
Great, great.

522
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,560
He will not be riddling like Elon Musk.

523
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Yeah, that would be tortured.

524
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,360
Yeah, Edward Nigma hosts Gotham Night Live.

525
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,120
Now, look, I don't want to take it by take ideas from people, but maybe I have to steal

526
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,760
that particular idea.

527
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,920
This is a creative space.

528
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,280
You know, just give me a special thanks.

529
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,320
OK, I will.

530
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:52,600
Did would Bruce Wayne have hosted or did he not want the attention?

531
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,640
Does that like if you stare at Bruce Wayne on television, do you start to figure out

532
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,840
maybe he's Batman?

533
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,600
I think there would be like Bruce would not want to do it, but there would be some he

534
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,360
would be dating someone or there would be some sort of Gotham charity thing.

535
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,000
And Alfred and whoever like Vicky Vail, they're encouraging him to do it for a specific reason.

536
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,720
OK, I don't think he would want to do it, but he would reluctantly do it.

537
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,920
And obviously, you know, the Mad Hatter would attack during the live show.

538
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,480
Yeah, he cuts out so good.

539
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,600
Yeah.

540
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,840
So he's coming on stage, putting a suit back on at the very end.

541
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,920
He's kind of the oddball one of the C's like when Steve Forbes.

542
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,720
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

543
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,520
Is that the richest or no, Elon's the richest host or Bloomberg?

544
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,960
Maybe he hosted, but he was on it.

545
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,480
The coolest host. Yeah.

546
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,680
Oh, yeah.

547
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:50,840
And then like maybe one week instead of a musical guest, they just ladies and gentlemen,

548
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,480
the flying Grayson's.

549
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,040
Well, sure.

550
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,320
They're like circus guests.

551
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,520
That's flying great.

552
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,640
They do a lot of artsy stuff on Saturday Night Live now with the musical guests.

553
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,240
So, oh, that's true.

554
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,080
They are always these little arranged tableaus.

555
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah. Jason, is any of Batman's villains good singers?

556
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,560
Mike, I'm drawing a blank here.

557
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,320
Good singers.

558
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,040
I'm sure there's some like Sonic based DC villains.

559
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,800
Someone's yelling at the podcast right now that I'm missing somebody.

560
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,440
Screaming. Oh, screaming.

561
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,240
Mimi's in Marvel. Yeah.

562
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,200
Catwoman would be Eartha Kitt Catwoman.

563
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,760
Sure. If she had the same singing ability.

564
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah. So maybe Catwoman, maybe Catwoman, Selena Kyle musical guest.

565
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,160
Here's here's one thing to bring up.

566
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,400
And when I think about that clock of the world,

567
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,480
I think about the opening day telecast where Walt delivers

568
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,960
a Tomorrowland specific opening in front of it,

569
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,120
where he misses his cue and it's awkward for a good long time.

570
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,720
And then he does the speech and then a bunch of doves all fly out or pigeons.

571
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,680
I don't know. Who knows?

572
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,440
I'm sorry. He didn't know.

573
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
We don't know. Yeah.

574
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,640
Yeah. Just a bunch of flapping happens.

575
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,640
But then there's there's this fact about Tomorrowland that is also,

576
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,520
I think, key to the rot in a way, the maybe somewhat

577
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,760
famous fact that it is meant to be to portray the far off future of 1986,

578
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,480
which whoever's narrating says, 1986.

579
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,280
So that's way ahead, he says. Yeah. Sort of.

580
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,880
Well, but there's one year in the same special.

581
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,920
There's narration that says, yes, this is Tomorrowland.

582
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,720
And it's not a stylized dream of the future, but a scientifically planned

583
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,840
projection of future techniques by leading space experts in science.

584
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,840
Techniques.

585
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,600
OK, I guess.

586
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,480
So it feels like a lot of people's loose definitions made it in

587
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,920
early on of what this thing is supposed to be.

588
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,800
I don't think. Yeah.

589
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,920
I don't think everybody maybe got the memo about 1986,

590
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,920
because a lot of it sure looks like a 1950s industrial college.

591
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,440
It looks like it looks like a mid sized like part of a college campus.

592
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,440
Yeah. Where you go to like, you know, where you bring your slide rule.

593
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,200
Right. Protractors.

594
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,840
It's weird. It's weird, too.

595
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,960
And I guess it's not weird because because every other land is meant,

596
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,560
I think, to be a very stylized version of adventure, adventure land.

597
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,720
And it's like you're on some wild expedition and frontier land,

598
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,240
the old west cowboys.

599
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,120
And everything is very much like centered around an exciting narrative

600
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,960
that would have been on a TV show, the version of it that would have been

601
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,520
in a movie or a TV show, Fantasyland Princess, all that stuff.

602
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,280
And for some reason, why Walt wanted this thing to be dry

603
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,320
is confusing to me.

604
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,480
Does that mean he wanted he wanted it to feel like the people who are

605
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,720
working on the early forms of space travel, which we are not that interested

606
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,480
in yet as a country, right?

607
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,560
Neil Armstrong, we don't know about him yet.

608
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,720
There's no space rock stars.

609
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
It's just clinical scientists.

610
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,640
Yeah. And the most famous ones right now are Nazis.

611
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
Right. Yeah.

612
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,080
What is it? Almost like dealing with this as a land is a is a flawed concept.

613
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,120
Because you would think that if it was future, it would be a stylized future.

614
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,320
It would be like Star Trek or something where there's technology.

615
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,040
You're seeing technology that doesn't exist.

616
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,480
It's just fun imagining what would be in the future, which stuff comes true,

617
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,200
like Star Trek, people, people using iPads on Star Trek, people like

618
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,760
all different things, kind of like, oh, that's kind of somebody

619
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,000
imagined what that would be like in 30 years.

620
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,160
But he's like not interested in that in a weird way.

621
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,320
He loves American commerce.

622
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,280
He loves American companies, likely sees himself as like, well, I'm a head

623
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:50,240
of industry, I'm on par with the heads of Boeing and Trans Pan Am and

624
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,520
and likely probably felt because science fiction was the era, you know,

625
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,040
that was the realm of pulp, like shitty little pulps.

626
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,720
And that's why radio, yeah, it's frivolous.

627
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,200
So and even though that's eventually what the Imagineers, you know, as

628
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,720
like, because it makes sense.

629
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,600
It makes sense for that to be because everything else is that way.

630
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,400
It's the pulp version of everything else.

631
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,760
Yeah. I mean, it eventually became the

632
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,720
it eventually they would do the future that never was in the same way

633
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,440
they would do the Hollywood that never was and will always be at MGM Studios.

634
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,080
Is it not the case that if you think about it is not like the

635
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,720
the most successful iterations of Tomorrowland and best Tomorrowland

636
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:43,920
attractions are always, for the most part, sci fi and alien oriented.

637
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,080
When you think about the highlights that, you know, like the alien

638
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,560
encounter was great.

639
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,600
Captain EO is great because it's this like adventure

640
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,400
and there's weird creatures, star tours, obviously. Yeah.

641
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,280
It's almost like that becomes like it that has to be

642
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,400
a important facet of tomorrow.

643
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,120
It's not a science museum.

644
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,000
It's not that's not the vibe. Yeah.

645
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,520
If everything else was the vibe and you were really learning

646
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,760
about American history or learning about animals, that's fine.

647
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,200
But you're on a boat where you see like cartoonish hippos

648
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,320
shooting water and the guy fires a gun like it's not.

649
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,000
That's the vibe of Disneyland.

650
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,280
It's not that like you're going to go and see something.

651
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,000
And it's very, very educational.

652
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,160
But but this is like the Wild West of what a third early version is.

653
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,600
And he does like World's Fairs.

654
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,480
So there's probably a part of him thinking maybe it could be like,

655
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,560
because we're all everybody's finding this together.

656
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,800
Yes. So maybe there could be an educational aspect.

657
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,880
Yeah. And all this stuff is why there stops being that.

658
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,640
World's Fairs had plenty of industry sponsors or new inventions

659
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,280
and new things from other countries and that kind of thing.

660
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,800
And so he thought highly of that clearly as opposed to like traveling carnivals,

661
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,000
which he if it was on fire, he wouldn't piss on it to put it out.

662
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,520
He probably lived a lot on fire on the way to Disneyland.

663
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,800
I guess Kent cigarette.

664
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,560
I'm just I guess maybe when I was looking at all this stuff,

665
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,560
I was just upset that like he didn't have like he didn't invent

666
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,240
like three different alien races that were like floating around

667
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,320
and people in bad costumes and there were like dumb looking spaceships

668
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,320
that the current the imagineers of that time made up.

669
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,960
Like that would have been so cool and dumb.

670
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,880
If there was that, yeah, if there was really silly Walt Future.

671
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,280
But no, it's all it is dry.

672
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,080
It is definitely dry.

673
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,960
But now let's try to get into the dry and have some fun with the.

674
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,320
Yeah, I think we can.

675
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,280
And here's I'm going to go in order of when things opened.

676
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,920
Yeah, because this seems sort of tidy.

677
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,680
And the one I want to dive into is if you have this one isn't even the most dry,

678
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,720
which probably makes it a good place to start.

679
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,680
And that is I'm so excited to say the phrase again,

680
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,840
the Kaiser Hall of Aluminum Fame.

681
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,920
Yeah, this was an opening day attraction.

682
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,160
This was on July 17th, 55.

683
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,840
And I didn't misspeak.

684
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,960
It is the Kaiser Hall of Aluminum Fame.

685
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,560
Yeah, it is not the Aluminum Hall of Fame.

686
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,600
This came up before on a second gate, one of the ones Jason missed due to Covid

687
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,160
where we talked about it because there was a Kaiser spaceman

688
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,360
whose suit was made of aluminum.

689
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,600
And he he walked around to let people know that there was a hall of aluminum fame.

690
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,800
And that episode then becomes about jetpack related kidnapping.

691
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,760
Check it out on the second gate if you haven't heard it.

692
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,160
But so that's why this came up before.

693
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,440
And this odd phrase, why does it bother me so much?

694
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,840
It's just it's just the wrong.

695
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,640
Yeah. And like aluminum Hall of Fame.

696
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,880
Yeah. But what is aluminum fame as a concept in and of itself?

697
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,160
What's aluminum fame?

698
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,760
No, I don't know. I don't.

699
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,360
Yeah, no, it's bad.

700
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,680
And it's I guess I see why maybe it wasn't just a phrase

701
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,400
that was so thrown around like Hall of Fame.

702
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,080
Maybe not. I don't know.

703
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,880
But if you do the same thing with like it's the basketball Hall of Fame,

704
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,080
it's the Hall of Basketball Fame.

705
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,800
It just doesn't it's it's not where an adjective wrong, but it's not it's not.

706
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,880
It's not as upsetting because basketball is more exciting than aluminum.

707
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,040
Well, that's true. Yeah.

708
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,760
So there's no no one is famous because of aluminum.

709
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,720
Well, prove me wrong. Is anyone famous from like

710
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,600
did anybody like cover themselves in aluminum and run out in the street

711
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,000
or something was? Yeah.

712
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,280
Who's the most famous person because of aluminum?

713
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,840
Like aluminum was there as aluminum fame guy Woodstock, like aluminum man

714
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,560
was at Woodstock and we all loved him and he was like kind of a symbol of peace.

715
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,240
Like, I don't know.

716
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,320
There was a weird little pig guy in this, right?

717
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,280
There was a little pig man.

718
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,720
Well, he might have the most aluminum fame, I guess, is that now here

719
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,520
to that point of that, it's this this this is not the driest

720
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,440
that early tomorrow and gets there is a character is new IP.

721
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,000
His name is Cap.

722
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,800
He's capped the Kaiser aluminum pig, the aluminum pig.

723
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,720
This, of course, refers to the fact that aluminum has a pig state

724
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,680
and that refers to I stopped paying attention.

725
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,040
I don't know why it's a pig state, but there is a there is a pig.

726
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,480
You have a photo of the pig is there.

727
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,280
Are you you got something on your phone? I have no I have the hard to find.

728
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,040
Yeah. A lot of this stuff is hard to find.

729
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,360
A lot of it is even not definitely not like fetishized

730
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,800
in the way that a lot of old Disney stuff is.

731
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,040
No, not like like, for example, something we will not be talking about

732
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,440
in this episode is the Monsanto House of the Future, right?

733
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,880
Which people do like because of that kooky design.

734
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,200
Yeah, there is fondness for that.

735
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,520
But that'll be interesting.

736
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,480
Too interesting.

737
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,080
This is the realm of dry today.

738
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,800
Yeah, too wet. Yeah.

739
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
This is a little pamphlet I was looking at.

740
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,520
Oh, I saw some of that. Yeah. Yes.

741
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,720
Here. Wait. All right.

742
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,360
Let me if you if you there's anything interesting on there.

743
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,880
There's not, but I will read it says

744
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,720
Kaiser aluminum pig is your host as you visit the panorama of properties

745
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,240
of aluminum, put him through his paces for aluminum fun.

746
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,440
They're doing it again.

747
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,760
Aluminum fame, aluminum fun. Yeah.

748
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,640
There's no such thing as this aluminum fun.

749
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,160
You know, like I know that what's out there.

750
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,000
I found a lot, I think, because they released

751
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,800
audio files in some compilation at some point.

752
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,320
The wish the other character, the wishful knight, the wishful knight.

753
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,880
Is he wishing that his

754
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,200
his armor was made out of aluminum?

755
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,240
Scott, you hit the nail on the head. Yeah.

756
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,960
All right.

757
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,840
It's a night going like, oh, I wish I had aluminum in King Arthur's time. You don't.

758
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,280
Yeah, no. Aluminum sort is going to go right. Yeah.

759
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,560
Well, I guess it depends on thick.

760
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,440
The aluminum aluminum siding now.

761
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,720
I think aluminum a little more flexible, but as as I think in the defunct land,

762
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,480
Kevin talks about like, oh, yeah, they also put aluminum.

763
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,720
They use it in the building, some of the stuff in the park.

764
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,640
And they discovered that it expands and contracts,

765
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,680
depending on whether it's hot or cold.

766
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,360
So that rocket ship deep in tomorrowland would make horrible noises.

767
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,960
This ghoulish groaning would happen.

768
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,680
And like the aluminum is alive.

769
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
Neat.

770
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,600
Which means it could also kill you.

771
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,200
And it can kill you and it can feel it certainly feels pain a lot during the day.

772
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:47,520
They also used aluminum in the bumpers for the original Autopia cars,

773
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,080
because this change was made so late in the game.

774
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,960
They did not have time to test the aluminum bumpers.

775
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,280
So when they get them out on the Autopia track, which already is chaos

776
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,240
because there's no track and kids are ramming into each other.

777
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,960
When they ram into each other, the bumpers are crushed because they are aluminum bumpers.

778
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,360
So mere feet away from this glory of aluminum exhibit is a practical application

779
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,240
of why aluminum sucks.

780
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:24,200
Ironically, through progress, we would get to a point where modern cars now,

781
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,200
the front of them, if you hit something or something crashes, it is it crumble.

782
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,960
It like crunches up really easily as opposed to back then.

783
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,520
The cars were like very solid.

784
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,480
You know? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

785
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,160
So that's I don't know what are what are what are cars made of now?

786
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,040
There's a lot of plastic.

787
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,240
Plastic, it's plastic. It's not aluminum.

788
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,480
I'm not I'm not going to say one word.

789
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,880
I will seem like such a well, I'm going to edit this out so I don't look like a fool.

790
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,800
So yeah, this is this pamphlet has got like it's basically was a walkthrough

791
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,600
attraction and it says your trip through the Kaiser Aluminum show

792
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,680
and then all these different I have to go that way.

793
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,080
Well, that's like the Simpsons box factory where you follow a little line

794
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,000
through a bunch of boring stuff.

795
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,600
Yeah, like I'm just there's 14 different stations that it mentions here.

796
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,800
That's well, that's a lot.

797
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,920
There's not 14 scenes and a lot of rides that we like.

798
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,120
Yeah, so maybe the all of aluminum fame is good.

799
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,240
Four was you would run into the huge aluminum time sphere

800
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,720
with ancient night, which is who Jason was just talking about today's firefighter

801
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,680
and spaceman of the future telling of advantages of aluminum.

802
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,360
So there you go.

803
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:41,280
I hate so it's better to be a hypothetical spaceman than an old knight.

804
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,520
That's what they're saying.

805
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,880
Now, is it possible that a kid in this day and age went through this?

806
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,640
Because there were things aluminum fairly new at the time.

807
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,200
Were there kids who were kind of interested in this?

808
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,920
Or is it as boring to them as it is to us now?

809
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,080
Well, the night segment, the narration at least has the timber,

810
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,720
like the audio, it sounds like a theme park voice, you know?

811
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,920
But would kids go to school the next day?

812
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,400
They're like, oh, my, oh, my goodness, I went to Disneyland.

813
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,240
I got to tell you about the top five things I did.

814
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,520
Did any kids say the Hall of Aluminum fame or whatever?

815
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,160
Like, you know, they talked about seeing a

816
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,480
like eerie cloth dumbo with big holes carved out his face.

817
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,560
I saw I saw a horrific Pinocchio.

818
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,600
And then I got on the little cars and I ran right into an employee

819
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,760
and broke his leg.

820
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,760
I saw Bob Cummings high on monkey balls.

821
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,920
Yeah. Yeah.

822
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,280
Like I just it's so interesting because I yeah, I don't you don't hear about this

823
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,080
ever. And at this point with Disneyland, people have

824
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,320
poured over everything.

825
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,440
Everything is a piece of history.

826
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,880
That's the whole thing with all of these.

827
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,520
I vaguely seen these.

828
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,240
This is us. We know this stuff.

829
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,960
You have to Google search specifically for some of these.

830
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,640
Yeah, it's like you can't even just vaguely search for them.

831
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,200
Yes. Yeah, they've been lost.

832
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,360
And some of them, there's like one photo per right item.

833
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,080
Or if that some things I think are not documented there anyway,

834
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,720
14 different stations in this, they're not all well documented.

835
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,760
Yeah. Which is pretty wild.

836
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,080
There is a I don't know if this counts as one of the stations,

837
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,040
but there was a guest book made of aluminum.

838
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,840
Well, most guests, but not this, not the old

839
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,960
book binders that you're used to tear through every page

840
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,920
with the slightest pressure of a pen.

841
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,000
And then you the pig, by the way,

842
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,160
you could you like put pushed and pulled

843
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,360
buttons that turn cap the Kaiser aluminum pig

844
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,640
flat as a pancake, light as a feather, round as a post, strong as an ox.

845
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,960
What does that mean that you couldn't push a button and make him strong?

846
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,960
That's that there's no way whatever this exhibit was.

847
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,440
This could not have that.

848
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,440
That's like this is like eight things that this aluminum pig can do.

849
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,960
No way. No, there's no way that like he became like thick

850
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,520
and he could withstand like some sort like he couldn't

851
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,840
like take a sword stab all of a sudden when you made him strong.

852
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,760
And then when you made him weaker, yeah, you would puncture the aluminum.

853
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
There's just no like a jowse aluminum blood.

854
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,400
You could you could joust with the pig when he was strong

855
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,800
and he would like the joust stick would break.

856
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,320
Yeah. How would they have illustrated that by having like a big brawny

857
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,400
fifties boxer ram him with his head?

858
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,160
Yeah. Right. Johnson guy.

859
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,120
Right. Right. I don't.

860
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,240
Yeah, it seems it seems hard to believe.

861
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,800
And there are there's no video documentation of this.

862
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,640
No, no, we don't know what it was.

863
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,880
Now, some of that is because it was tougher to preserve these things.

864
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,520
But you can still you know, because we don't know what a lot of these rides.

865
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,400
I I couldn't really tell you what those early fantasy land rides looked like.

866
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,680
Oh, that's generally sure. Sure.

867
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,440
But at least as soon as cameras like home movie cameras

868
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,520
into the picture, things are starting to get. Yeah.

869
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,680
I don't think anyone bothered.

870
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,200
Nobody used any rolls of film when film was precious.

871
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,200
True. They're not using it on the aluminum fame. Right.

872
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,120
You know, 35 millimeter people taking still photos.

873
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,200
So we end up with some of these exhibits and buildings.

874
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,240
You end up with very evocative like black and white photos.

875
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,600
You know, oh, they really look like old films. Yes.

876
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,440
Yeah, because it looked like Touch of Evil or something.

877
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,160
Yeah. Yeah. Because old film preserves pretty well.

878
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

879
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,680
So if a picture was taken, it's a good picture.

880
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,920
But I think I think every one of these attractions has any two photos.

881
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,160
Any picture you took is one perfect shot.

882
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,480
That's right. One of these old walkthroughs.

883
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,800
I mean, that's the that's the gist of it.

884
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,400
I would say that at the end, you could get a card

885
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,400
and you fill in your name, let's say Jason Sheridan has been illuminated,

886
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,960
spelled with aluminum and yeah,

887
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,240
the illuminated by the brightest star in the world of metals.

888
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,240
There was a bright star. Did we say that? There's a big star.

889
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,120
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

890
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,600
So you've been illuminated by the brightest star at the Kaiser aluminum

891
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,200
exhibit, not what it's called at Disneyland and and is aware

892
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,080
of all the benefits pertaining thereto.

893
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,640
So this is like you can.

894
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,720
This is you signing a legal document.

895
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,440
This is you signing a contract, but a fun one.

896
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,320
But but still legalese.

897
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,520
I mean, it's we got to be formal about this.

898
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,520
Please sign this document indicating that you had fun.

899
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,080
You were a booster of aluminum from now on.

900
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,000
Yeah, this is was there any other land that just had a walkthrough for them?

901
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,160
An ad is an ad.

902
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,280
It's just a walkthrough.

903
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
It's an ad. And that's it.

904
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,080
I don't think they at least they kind of dress up.

905
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,960
Right. Club Cool has the soda stations.

906
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,240
Is it a big? Yeah, that's true.

907
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,600
You're right. But they do something that could be perceived as an attraction.

908
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,440
Yeah, there is.

909
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,760
I guess there are original characters here.

910
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,880
Cap. Well, that's why this is this is one of the best, I will say.

911
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,840
Oh, that's fair.

912
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,400
You're right. I'm sorry to say.

913
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,920
Maybe if there were more photos, we wouldn't be so down on it.

914
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,080
Maybe if there were some photos of the night and the pig,

915
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:38,480
if it could convince us that Cap was cool or but I don't.

916
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,880
But that doesn't that that's an editorial voice right there

917
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,920
that nobody bothered to film cap.

918
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,360
Right, because Cap could be like, again, there could have been a park

919
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,680
star of cap, no mention of cap.

920
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,520
It could be, oh, we need cap figurines.

921
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,040
We need cap on the merchandise.

922
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,160
So we're we're bringing cap back.

923
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,920
Cap meet and greet. Right.

924
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,320
And I know what you guys are thinking.

925
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,880
Josh tomorrow on stage.

926
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,880
And there's been a lot of rumors floating around and I'm here to illuminate them.

927
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,720
The character you've all been asking for.

928
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,480
For someone who you have a lot of affection for.

929
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,800
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

930
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,760
You're in a fun bra.

931
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,480
He's back.

932
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,160
I have repented and I regret my beliefs at the time.

933
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,840
Let's take a selfie.

934
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,560
He's repenting.

935
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,360
Yeah. Well, that's that's that.

936
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,040
From there, I wanted to start with that one because there's a little bit more

937
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,240
energy than the other opening day one, which is the Monsanto Hall of Chemistry.

938
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,800
Yeah. Oh, by the way.

939
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,000
Wait, one thing I missed just to go backwards slightly.

940
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,360
The Hall of Aluminum fame.

941
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,800
Kaiser themselves were so unhappy.

942
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,600
Oh, yeah. With this, they wanted to break the contract three years early.

943
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,480
And Walt still there still was not anything really figured out for this space.

944
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,880
He's like, no, we can't.

945
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,720
One of these things disappears down the road and it's replaced

946
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,560
with just photo standees and the attraction is called Fun Photos with an F.

947
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,960
That is as good as that.

948
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,440
So Walt needed these things or else he's going to have to resort to fun photos.

949
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,280
Right. So he pleaded with Kaiser to stay.

950
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,840
They they did their full term of five years.

951
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,200
This has gone in 1960.

952
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,760
The Hall of Chemistry made it a while along.

953
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,680
This is an 11 year attraction.

954
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,120
There's a way which gets you into if you're at 66 now, the Matterhorn is risen.

955
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,520
Like there's a small world is there like, oh, my God.

956
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,080
Like, like what we know is Disneyland is there.

957
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,840
And then the Hall of Chemistry is still there. Still there.

958
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,600
And that's why when I was there, good.

959
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,240
That's why there's I think a few more photos because it lasted longer.

960
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,200
Yeah, yeah, true. Made it into the color days a little more.

961
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,160
Did anyone find anything that they liked or thought was interesting

962
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,920
about the Hall of Chemistry?

963
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,200
I like the chemitron.

964
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,680
Sure. That seems like something.

965
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:10,520
But past that, the chemitron was the chemitron was this big like

966
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,960
it was like eight test to eight giant test tubes

967
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,760
on kind of a statue type thing that represented like the eight.

968
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,760
What is it? The eight most often found like chemical properties

969
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,040
in nature or something.

970
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,120
What was the wording of it?

971
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,600
You know, it's like I have a common substances, substances

972
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,960
which can be made and combined into almost 500 different Monsanto

973
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,520
chemicals and plastics.

974
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,640
Here's the things that will kill your world tomorrow.

975
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,560
Yeah. So it looks I don't I guess it looks OK.

976
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,920
I mean, it's a kind of a cool thing. I might have been as a kid.

977
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,480
As a kid, I'll say this. I liked test tubes.

978
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,000
Yeah. You have test tubes because you'd see like Ludwig von Drake

979
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,720
with a test tube or you'd see some cartoon making a potion.

980
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,280
Sure. I did think test tubes were cool.

981
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,600
So as a kid, I could see going in there and big test to take one.

982
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,640
It's like three feet. Let's be clear about that.

983
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,480
This is there. They aren't like 20 feet. Well, sure.

984
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,800
That's a lot of liquid to fill.

985
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,200
That's yeah. You're going to use up a lot of coal, precious coal.

986
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,320
Right. You can't put that much coal in there.

987
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,880
There's a lot of coal talk here.

988
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,000
That's I this I'm stealing this copy from whatever website.

989
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So this might have been yesterland, but I like this dry.

990
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,120
You'll never again think of coal as just a boring sedimentary rock

991
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,840
that's combustible after you see this display.

992
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,760
This will change your view on coal forever.

993
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:48,120
It was yes. Salt, sulfur, oil, coal, air, phosphate, rock, limestone and water.

994
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,680
OK, water. So rock rock.

995
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,400
Mom, I saw rock in a slightly bigger than usual test tube.

996
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,280
You know, a representation of rock.

997
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,920
Yeah, that's true. I actually know it was.

998
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,840
I think it was actually I saw some like drawings of it.

999
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,400
And it looks like it was just like, oh, this one's like blue.

1000
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,640
Like it's water. And it's just like some like abstract kind of idea.

1001
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:17,440
Like what water is like not not aluminum foil, but like plastic wrap.

1002
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,640
Yeah, this is all like I've talked about in the show before about

1003
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,200
going to the JFK Health World as a kid,

1004
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,000
which is a little like science kind of museum near where I grew up.

1005
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,760
And that this stuff compared to what that was is like

1006
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,880
that was JFK Health World, like Disneyland compared to this.

1007
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,960
Sure. In the sense that they really had not figured out

1008
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,800
an effective, fun way to try to teach kids something.

1009
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,440
I feel like. Yeah.

1010
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,320
I wonder when museums started getting more and more

1011
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,760
started getting kidified.

1012
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,520
It has to have been post the rise of the Disney.

1013
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,720
Probably, I would think.

1014
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,760
I would think so. Yeah.

1015
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,760
I think we went into like we went into there was a play area

1016
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,640
at this JFK Health World, and I believe you went into like a giant man's ear,

1017
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,360
which I thought was weird, but cool.

1018
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,920
That's cool. Well, that's like double.

1019
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,080
Yeah. We had the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, which is still a big

1020
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,000
museum, you know, named after Benjamin Franklin.

1021
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,120
We also had the Please Touch Museum.

1022
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,960
What? It's called the Please Touch Museum.

1023
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,080
And it was a kids museum.

1024
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,120
You could pretend to drive like half a city bus.

1025
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,960
They had like a set the bus, the city.

1026
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,920
And kids could pretend you could drive and drive the bus.

1027
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,640
And there was a grocery store section.

1028
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,640
You pretend to shop at the grocery store.

1029
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,680
Oh, so it's like a Sesame Streetified Museum.

1030
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,200
It opened in the late 70s. The museum.

1031
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,280
So so what was the learning aspect of it?

1032
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,440
Was it to pretend you were an adult or?

1033
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,040
Yeah, kind of. Did you ever do it?

1034
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,920
I remember going to the Please Touch Museum, which as a kid,

1035
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,880
I thought was called the Police Touch Museum.

1036
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,040
And I was like, I guess police made a museum.

1037
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,520
And that was not the case.

1038
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,600
But like the Franklin Institute, a little more for little older

1039
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,320
kids and families and stuff.

1040
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,200
And you walk through a room size version of the heart.

1041
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,520
You'd walk through different ventricles and such.

1042
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,720
Yeah, there you go.

1043
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,520
Famously, a lot of kids left with souvenir T-shirts and said,

1044
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:23,720
please touch really big, which created a lot of disasters out in the world.

1045
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,720
Bad. Bad.

1046
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:31,560
So if you wanted to go learn about sulfur,

1047
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,400
you could kind of go here and do that. Kind of.

1048
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,200
You could sort of get a vague suggestion of what it might be.

1049
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,600
This like this one's so boring to me.

1050
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,440
It's like I believe something was here for and yet such a hit

1051
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,600
that Monsanto ended up with four attractions all told through that.

1052
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,000
Not concurrently, because this closes to make room for adventure

1053
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,320
through inner space. Right.

1054
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,880
Like this is on the Star Tours, the half of it.

1055
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,640
But then they got House of the Future and they also got

1056
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,680
Monsanto's fashions and fabrics through the ages,

1057
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,680
which showed you how chemicals will help us make the clothes of tomorrow.

1058
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,280
Even the very historical Disney parks blogs are like,

1059
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,280
we're not touching the fashion fabric for the ages.

1060
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,040
Yeah, I found a nice website I liked that had some posts about some of this

1061
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,920
called Inventing Disneyland, and they point out that, by the way, this was

1062
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,120
Monsanto had a better reputation.

1063
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,400
This is before Agent Orange, before the genetically modified food,

1064
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,840
before incidents that led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.

1065
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,840
They caused it, really.

1066
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,840
I think they may have caused it.

1067
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,840
What was the DDT, though?

1068
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,840
This was around the same time.

1069
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,240
Well, they must have been developing some of these things, at least.

1070
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,240
But maybe we didn't know.

1071
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,240
Is that Silent Spring? Is that the book about?

1072
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,240
Hold on. There's this. Hold on.

1073
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,240
Just because you brought it up, I want to bring up some stuff

1074
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,240
that they were working on that never made it to market.

1075
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,240
OK. I don't know. Oh, God.

1076
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
I don't know if you saw this. Hold on. No.

1077
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,240
Well, give me one second here.

1078
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,240
So, yeah, so there's some there's some really just awful things

1079
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,240
that this company ended up doing.

1080
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,240
They were absorbed by Bayer a couple of years ago.

1081
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,240
Sure. Wait, while you pull that up, here's just here's

1082
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,240
I'll juxtapose it with their copy that like, you know,

1083
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,240
your food, clothing, health and transportation all depend on chemistry

1084
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,240
and the future holds some exciting, wonderful things in store for you,

1085
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,240
such as?

1086
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,240
Uh, they're there.

1087
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,240
Hold on. Here it is.

1088
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:41,240
Uh, the phrase is Terminator seeds.

1089
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,240
Hmm.

1090
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,240
The seeds of tomorrow.

1091
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:50,240
Genetic use restriction technology, colloquial known as Terminator

1092
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,240
technology, produces plants with sterile seeds.

1093
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,240
This trait would prevent the spread of those seeds into the wild.

1094
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,240
It would also prevent farmers from planting seeds they harvest,

1095
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,240
requiring them to purchase seed for every planting,

1096
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,240
allowing the company to enforce its licensing terms via technology.

1097
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,240
I have heard about that.

1098
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,240
Yeah, licensing crops. Did this not happen?

1099
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,240
I think it did happen.

1100
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,240
Well, this version of their technology did not go to commercial use,

1101
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,240
but maybe another company has done this.

1102
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,240
There was a thing where, like, they like farmers had to fight back

1103
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,240
against having to buy seeds.

1104
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:29,240
Oh, there's a lot of seed stuff lately, and maybe it is similar to this.

1105
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,240
You're right.

1106
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,240
But this, they said this specific Terminator seeds was never commercialized.

1107
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,240
Okay.

1108
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,240
But maybe there is a different, somebody else made Terminator seeds,

1109
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,240
which could not reproduce.

1110
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,240
Isn't that what Jurassic World Dominion is about?

1111
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,240
Yeah, but Terminator seeds, killer seeds.

1112
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,240
Uh, yeah.

1113
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,240
There's a funny article, I found an article in Real Clear Science

1114
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,240
that's really snide about Monsanto.

1115
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,240
Oh, Monsanto is the devil incarnate, a ruthless corporation

1116
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:05,240
hell-bent upon forcing their unnatural food down our open gullets.

1117
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,240
The soy and corn they sow are more likely to transmogrify us

1118
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,240
and to imps and sustain us.

1119
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,240
And then they were like, oh, yeah, they may have caused 400,000 deaths

1120
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,240
in Vietnam from its use of chemical warfare agent,

1121
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:26,240
but they're basically saying like, they're just like the company de jour to say,

1122
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,240
like, is bad, like Walmart or McDonald's,

1123
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,240
because they've done some good stuff too.

1124
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,240
Oh.

1125
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
I'm like, this is, what is this article I'm reading?

1126
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,240
They're all over the map.

1127
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,240
Really all over the map.

1128
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,240
So they want to be up front with Monsanto,

1129
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,240
but they still want to sell some Monsanto ads, you know?

1130
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,240
In case they sponsor it.

1131
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:47,240
They are, they are aspirin, you know, they buy, they buy some banner ads, you know?

1132
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,240
So yes, this is before some of their awful human rights violations.

1133
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,240
This is the stuff we're talking about.

1134
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,240
And they didn't finish the Terminator seeds.

1135
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:59,240
And if any other company took that plan and ran with it and that company,

1136
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,240
you know, like the Yen Sid Seed Corporation,

1137
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,240
some secret firm of Disney that we don't know about.

1138
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,240
Yeah.

1139
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,240
But before, yes, they were slightly less evil at this time.

1140
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:19,240
So Walt gave them four attractions and they are the most boring things I found out about.

1141
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,240
So around this time, I'm getting like, OK, we sit around and do this episode,

1142
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,240
but Hall of Chemistry is boring and like I'm feeling boxed in.

1143
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:32,240
And then like I almost missed this one and I'm so glad that I found it.

1144
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,240
Did you guys come across the attraction, the Dairy Bar?

1145
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,240
Oh, yeah.

1146
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,240
Now let's be clear.

1147
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,240
The Dairy Bar is not the milk stand.

1148
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,240
The milk stand is current Disneyland.

1149
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,240
OK.

1150
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,240
That's where you buy the Star Wars milk.

1151
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,240
The Dairy Bar was different.

1152
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,240
OK.

1153
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,240
That's not a Dairy Bar.

1154
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,240
That's because that milk probably is not dairy.

1155
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,240
No, it's all non-dairy, I believe.

1156
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,240
OK. Yeah.

1157
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,240
Yeah.

1158
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:02,240
So but this, of course, was dairy because it was the American Dairy Association Dairy Bar.

1159
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,240
And we think that today's attraction titles are convoluted.

1160
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,240
That one does not exactly roll off the tongue.

1161
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,240
Yeah.

1162
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,240
So this was a late edition.

1163
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,240
Now we're into 56.

1164
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,240
This is January 56.

1165
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,240
It only made it to September 58.

1166
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,240
This was one part of it was a big barn.

1167
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:26,240
And it said, today's food builds tomorrow's man.

1168
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,240
Hey, that's not incorrect.

1169
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,240
That is true.

1170
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:35,240
It's a strange phrase, but it was technically something you could say to your kid you brought with you.

1171
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,240
You're tomorrow's man, so eat today's food.

1172
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:45,240
That's what like when, you know, Lindsay was having some morning sickness and when she was pregnant and she had to eat a lot of McDonald's fries, because that's what it would agree with her.

1173
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,240
And now I say the baby was built by McDonald's.

1174
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,240
Wow.

1175
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,240
Well, that website would have some mixed words to say about that.

1176
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,240
Right.

1177
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:01,240
But then where I get excited about this milk attraction is that they there's a whole other.

1178
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,240
The barn is just, you know, kind of rustic.

1179
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:11,240
And that's where you, you know, it's an opportunity to try tomorrow or today's today's food.

1180
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:19,240
I can try today's food today, milk here and also at probably every other location at early Disneyland.

1181
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,240
Thick whole milk.

1182
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,240
Me drinking whole milk.

1183
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,240
Walt Disney, you've made my dreams come true.

1184
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,240
Have both of you had full glasses of milk at Disney ever?

1185
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,240
Probably, right?

1186
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,240
Maybe as a child.

1187
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,240
Because you were milk up until like 20s, right?

1188
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,240
Until my now wife, yes.

1189
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,240
Right.

1190
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,240
Jason, you too, right?

1191
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,240
I'm sure. Yeah, when I was younger, I probably opted for chocolate milk.

1192
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,240
Did you have a big glass of like two percent?

1193
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:50,240
I bet I did when I was in my like, it feels so like it feels I know that it hasn't happened,

1194
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,240
but doesn't it feel like something that would have happened?

1195
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,240
And we forgot the story that four and a half years ago, we were there to do something.

1196
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,240
We were there to do the canoes or something.

1197
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,240
And then we watched Jason have a full glass of whole milk.

1198
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,240
And then four hours later, he's saying, oh, my stomach.

1199
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,240
And we're like, probably the milk, right?

1200
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,240
And he's like, no, no, wasn't the milk.

1201
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,240
Does that feel very familiar to you?

1202
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,240
I don't know.

1203
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,240
I was trying to do oat milk for a while and that was giving me.

1204
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,240
I think that's still bad for your stomach.

1205
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,240
Yeah, that's still not great.

1206
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,240
Yeah.

1207
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,240
But I. Any of them.

1208
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,240
Soy.

1209
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,240
I used to go to the old country buffet and I think I would have a glass of milk with the meal.

1210
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,240
My grandparents would take me out.

1211
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,240
Just from the name, I don't know what else is going on at the old country.

1212
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,240
The old country buffet was like a hometown buffet, but better.

1213
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,240
We were not hometown buffet people.

1214
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,240
We were old country buffet people.

1215
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,240
And we would go every Wednesday because my grandmother got a discount.

1216
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,240
Nice for being five to 10 for being old.

1217
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,240
Yes.

1218
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,240
We go to venture on Wednesdays because she got a discount for being old.

1219
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,240
Then she wasn't an employee of no country.

1220
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,240
Did not work. No, no.

1221
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,240
But I would get I would load up, get a big salad.

1222
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,240
Then I would load up my plate with macaroni and whatever the carving station had.

1223
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,240
And I think often I would get a big glass of milk.

1224
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:08,240
There would be a milk machine basically, just like there was a soft drink machine.

1225
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:13,240
Oh, so you could kind of you could customize and if I well, I wouldn't.

1226
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,240
I would send with whole.

1227
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,240
Yeah, I think it was just two percent, but I could be wrong.

1228
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,240
Well, like it's like the bib juice, the beverage in a bag.

1229
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,240
Yeah, like you know, it's milk in a bag.

1230
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:29,240
Because we would have to like they have them in the dining halls of college.

1231
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,240
Milk in a bag.

1232
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,240
They had the machines that you would like pull on milk, you know,

1233
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,240
fountain milk or whatever you drinking, found milk in college.

1234
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,240
Well, for cereal, I'd have to take the cereal bowl over to the milk machine.

1235
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,240
OK, but we're having half they had half and half in those machines, too.

1236
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,240
If you want to put in your coffee, did you ever drink a big glass of milk in college?

1237
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:54,240
Maybe if I was eating a big plate of cookies, chug, chug, chug, because you're still doing Jason's

1238
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,240
Jason's treat based fraternity.

1239
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,240
He's got a keg of milk.

1240
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,240
All right. You need to chug that old glass and then he'd a hundred chocolate chips.

1241
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,240
Doing a keg stand of milk.

1242
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:12,240
Jason upside down with the tube in his mouth or whatever.

1243
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,240
However you do that, whatever you people that had fun in college, however that works.

1244
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,240
Milk stands.

1245
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,240
You're still doing milk and cookies, though.

1246
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,240
Usually just the cookies.

1247
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,240
Oh, so you've stopped doing the milk and cookies?

1248
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:30,240
Yeah, not so much because usually just I like just half and half in my coffee.

1249
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,240
OK, so you're doing coffee cup of cream.

1250
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,240
You're not buying enough milk every week to justify getting a jug.

1251
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,240
Not a whole glass.

1252
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,240
When was the last time you had a big glass of milk with your cookies?

1253
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,240
That's a good question.

1254
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,240
Less than a year.

1255
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,240
Oh, I think less than a year.

1256
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,240
Probably when I was home for Christmas.

1257
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,240
Probably a glass of eggnog at one point, a glass of milk at another.

1258
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,240
OK, Scott, let's have a big glass of milk.

1259
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,240
Years.

1260
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,240
I'd say probably 15 years.

1261
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,240
I bet it's 15 years or more with me.

1262
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,240
Unless I did cookies at some point, but I don't think I did.

1263
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,240
Interesting.

1264
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,240
Listener?

1265
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,240
Chug milk at the next live show?

1266
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,240
When was the last time you had a big glass of milk?

1267
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,240
Are you happier for it?

1268
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,240
Are you happier than us?

1269
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:16,240
Sure, Mike and I have our children, but you maybe you've had a big glass of milk.

1270
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,240
Yeah, you're really living it up.

1271
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,240
That's what makes you warm and say.

1272
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,240
We should play milk pong.

1273
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,240
Milk pong?

1274
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
Milk pong.

1275
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Milk in little red solo cups set up on the table.

1276
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,240
And that way we don't have to get drunk.

1277
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,240
We just get to have fun.

1278
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,240
That irritating part of beer pong.

1279
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,240
You just get potassium.

1280
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,240
Yeah, it's fun to lose.

1281
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,240
Then you get strong.

1282
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,240
You become tomorrow's man faster.

1283
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,240
I'd be good.

1284
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,240
A flippy cup with milk?

1285
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,240
Yes.

1286
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,240
I start.

1287
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,240
You made it flippy cup.

1288
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,240
You additionally made it two different games.

1289
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,240
Oh, there's flip cup.

1290
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,240
Wait, flippy cup.

1291
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,240
What do you call it?

1292
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,240
Flippy cup?

1293
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,240
Yeah, I've never heard of it.

1294
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,240
Is it just flip cup?

1295
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,240
I don't believe so.

1296
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,240
Are you thinking flappy bird?

1297
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,240
I'm always thinking of flappy bird.

1298
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,240
I don't know.

1299
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,240
Maybe I'm misremembering the name of it, but I played both of those games in college once

1300
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,240
in a while.

1301
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,240
Hey, dudes, we got to play some flippy cup.

1302
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,240
Who's down for some flippy cup?

1303
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,240
Flippy cup and flip cup is not so drastically different.

1304
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,240
It's not so far.

1305
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,240
No, but it's cuter.

1306
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:20,240
It's cuter, so I added an extra fun Y on it, but perhaps I'm remembering it wrong.

1307
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,240
You're right, because it's cuter.

1308
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,240
Well, I'm not saying I'm right, but I'm better.

1309
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,240
I'm not necessarily right, but I am better.

1310
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,240
Let's think of it that way.

1311
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,240
All right, OK.

1312
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,240
We're moving to the milk port.

1313
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,240
We're going to the milk port.

1314
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,240
And then under that, it says loading dock for tomorrow's milkman.

1315
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:46,240
And this is where we're finally having some fun in kooky old Tomorrowland, because there's

1316
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,240
some kids gathering around.

1317
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,240
And then I'm looking at it like, what's in there?

1318
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,240
Is that little figures?

1319
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,240
Is this little maybe animatronics?

1320
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:58,240
I don't know if they were animatronics, but they were at least diorama figures.

1321
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:06,240
And in one case, in one picture, there is a milkman of the future, and he is piloting

1322
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:13,240
a little, presumably milk covered helicopter, a futuristic helicopter, to deliver.

1323
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:17,240
Oh, wait, and I forgot the sign says different LA subsidies.

1324
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:24,240
So like Pasadena, Westminster, Laguna, Compton, he's going everywhere in Los Angeles.

1325
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:31,240
Today's milkman is stuck with wheels and stuck on the road and burning gasoline, but tomorrow's

1326
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,240
milkman takes to the skies.

1327
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,240
This is the closest thing to what I wanted, what I said at the top.

1328
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:41,240
This is the closest thing that is like, OK, some nonsense future thing that you could

1329
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,240
see happening.

1330
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,240
Obviously, we wouldn't.

1331
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,240
The traditional milkman, much to Jason's chagrin, has gone away.

1332
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:56,240
But through this 50 centric future, we imagine we're like, assuredly, the future still has

1333
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,240
milkmen.

1334
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,240
We still have milk delivered to our door.

1335
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:06,240
We have sleek, futuristic, sexy milkmen using what we've learned in the war.

1336
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,240
Right.

1337
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:11,240
A lot of the Nazis are working on new milk delivery technology.

1338
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,240
They're nice now.

1339
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,240
Now they're milk deliverers.

1340
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,240
Who could have a problem with that?

1341
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:22,240
So we drop, yes, we still look, they're bombs and they're bomb shaped, but we drop them

1342
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,240
softer and they just land on your soft grass.

1343
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:29,240
And then a little hatch opens up and that's where your milk is.

1344
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,240
Who could hate that?

1345
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:35,240
We have thousands of decommissioned missiles that we need to use for something.

1346
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,240
We built them.

1347
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,240
They don't cost us anything.

1348
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,240
Why not fill them up with milk?

1349
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,240
Milk bombs.

1350
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,240
Well, this is the American Dairy Association.

1351
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,240
I mean, the dairy industry gets insane subsidies still in America.

1352
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,240
Well, then it would all make sense.

1353
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,240
Tie together.

1354
01:05:50,240 --> 01:06:00,240
Can I ask for fan art of Jason in the famous Slim Pickens riding on the bomb picture?

1355
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,240
Riding on a milk bottle?

1356
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,240
From Dr. Strangelove.

1357
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,240
But it's a milk bomb.

1358
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:12,240
And it's spraying milk out all over and people are waiting and catching it with their glasses.

1359
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,240
Now let's be specific about the type of milk because this gets a little weird because if

1360
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,240
it's soy milk, does that make it a soy bomb?

1361
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:24,240
Does this now tie to Bob Dylan's famous crusher of Bob Dylan's Grammy's performance?

1362
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,240
Oh, yeah.

1363
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,240
If they want to draw two photos, that's fine.

1364
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,240
Two pictures.

1365
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,240
Jason as soy bomb.

1366
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,240
But that would have to be a separate photo.

1367
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:36,240
Jason interrupting a Bob Dylan performance 25 years ago.

1368
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,240
Two equally good concepts, but different concepts.

1369
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,240
Jason as soy bomb.

1370
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,240
A lot of soy subsidies, I think, in this kind of lot of soy exports.

1371
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,240
I think there was something like every now and then they catch a Republican congressperson

1372
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:56,240
who's like, oh, your family, quote unquote, family farm gets like insane subsidies while

1373
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,240
you rail against government assistance.

1374
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,240
Oh, gotcha.

1375
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,240
That's probably what soy bomb was so mad about.

1376
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,240
And Bob Dylan stands up here and doesn't even sing about it.

1377
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,240
Yeah.

1378
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:11,240
I got to ride around with my shirt off or else no one will know.

1379
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,240
Yeah.

1380
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,240
He barely reacted to that.

1381
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:18,240
And he's always in his later years always reacting so so wildly.

1382
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,240
And yeah, that seems alive.

1383
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,240
The gym halberts of time.

1384
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,240
The other thing.

1385
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:30,240
And if you think the helicopter, the milk helicopter is fun, then we go to truly the

1386
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:38,240
milkman of the future who is flying around on a jet pack and he is hovering over three

1387
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:43,240
plastic, clear cubicles, each containing a cow.

1388
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:50,240
So he in through some sort of these are not the filthy farm stalls of today.

1389
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:56,240
This is the sleek, clean farm of the future where the milkman has gone like he's got

1390
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:01,240
probably I imagine two sets of like packs on his back, one tube.

1391
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:05,240
He hooks up to the udders, gets milk straight out of them, loads up.

1392
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,240
Then he lights the other ones.

1393
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,240
You have to make sure to write light the right ones.

1394
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,240
Those are rockets.

1395
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:12,240
He flies straight to Compton and gives them their milk.

1396
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,240
Wow.

1397
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:17,240
This is such funny nonsense.

1398
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,240
I love it.

1399
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,240
This is probably the stupidest thing at early Disneyland.

1400
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,240
Yeah.

1401
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,240
What was stupider than this?

1402
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,240
Yeah.

1403
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:29,240
And again, if you put it in the context of Walt May of thought this was actually coming,

1404
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:33,240
it's so much funnier too because he's like looking at this and he goes, yes, this is

1405
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,240
how milk will be delivered in the future.

1406
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:40,240
Walt is imagining a future where like what's coming down that he's probably working on

1407
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,240
101 Dalmatians and he's like walk with me and he's walking from the animation building

1408
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:48,240
to his office and talking to the director and like, well, I don't know, it's a lot of

1409
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,240
spots to draw.

1410
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,240
Well, you could use Xerox machines maybe.

1411
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:56,240
Well, Mike, we have to make sure we hit our and then he just puts a cup out where a milkman

1412
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:01,240
of the future flies by on a jet pack, deposits milk straight into his cup.

1413
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:06,240
Walt, like Bob Dylan, doesn't react whatsoever and he just keeps and that's it.

1414
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,240
So make sure it's got to be ready for Christmas.

1415
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,240
Takes a sip.

1416
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,240
Ah, delicious.

1417
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,240
Doesn't get in the way of his.

1418
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,240
He doesn't have to go to the milk machine like Jason at college.

1419
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,240
That's right.

1420
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,240
He doesn't have to go to the bag.

1421
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,240
Yeah.

1422
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,240
So it's a yeah, he thought this was the future.

1423
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,240
I do wonder if it comes from like it was a practical concern.

1424
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,240
He's like, you know, that milkman's never around when you need him.

1425
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,240
We need to figure that out.

1426
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:34,240
We need to figure out what we're going to do to like I'm going to make a futuristic

1427
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,240
utopian city that I'll be the king of.

1428
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,240
And also we will have flying movement.

1429
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,240
We need to, you know, and the like the people mover will go in between the buildings,

1430
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,240
but the monorail just goes into the hub.

1431
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:51,240
But the milkman flies through the sky and deposits milk from his jet pack wherever he wants.

1432
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:55,240
I guess he thought this was there's a chance he thought this was like a bit of whimsy here,

1433
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:59,240
but nothing else suggests whimsy other than maybe I hated it.

1434
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,240
That's not what tomorrow lands for possibly hated.

1435
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,240
Tomorrowland's not for fun.

1436
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:09,240
Well, you could try milk like that's whimsy, right?

1437
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,240
You could go to the milk at the exit of the cafe.

1438
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,240
I don't know what to call it.

1439
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,240
It's dairy.

1440
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,240
We still had some dairy bars where I grew up like ice cream place that had been there

1441
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,240
forever and called themselves creamery or dairy bar.

1442
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:25,240
You know, I don't think I've ever been to a dairy bar like a branded that.

1443
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,240
Oh, OK.

1444
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,240
So like we had Oberweiss dairy in the Midwest.

1445
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:34,240
And if you wanted, you could pay money and you would get like a milkman essentially that would come out

1446
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,240
and give you like a bottle.

1447
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:41,240
They'd also sell like a fancy glass bottle of milk in the grocery stores around us.

1448
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,240
I don't know if it's probably still there.

1449
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,240
Yeah, they're still fancy glass milk.

1450
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,240
That's like three times as much as the Kroger milk.

1451
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,240
Right. Right.

1452
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:53,240
But you're not drinking the plastic, the microplastics that we all grew up drinking.

1453
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,240
This isn't you reminded me of something.

1454
01:10:54,240 --> 01:11:02,240
This isn't quite about milk, but it's a little related because it's about ice cream and like a local ice cream factory in Houston, Texas.

1455
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:07,240
And I'm going to ask the listeners because I've had a lot of success with throwing out some vague mystery to listeners.

1456
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,240
Oh, yeah.

1457
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:16,240
Somebody knows. So if you are from Houston or spent any time in Houston, I want to say that the word blue is in the name of the company.

1458
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:22,240
And it was there was like a tour that you could take, which is always my dream of any of these.

1459
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:29,240
Like, like to have some factory tour and then with some like specific content that's only available to watch here.

1460
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,240
And I swear I was in Houston in probably 2000.

1461
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:46,240
And I went on the tour where there was a video where the founder of the Blue Ice Cream Company came back to life or like his ghost appeared so that he could see what his plant has turned into today.

1462
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,240
Does does this make any sense to anyone?

1463
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:56,240
I've thought about it the word forever because like who like we know who Walt Disney is or we know who Henry Ford is.

1464
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:04,240
But like the swing to have an actor come play the founder of this Houston ice cream factory, I love.

1465
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:09,240
Oh, God, if anybody knows somehow Houstonites, I give you an assignment.

1466
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:15,240
I might be able to help you out. OK, does the is a bluebell ice cream. Yeah, it's got to be.

1467
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:19,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Does that logo look familiar? I've heard of it. Yeah.

1468
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:25,240
News a few years ago for like, oh, was it a Listeria outbreak or like something like that?

1469
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:30,240
Well, the founder would not like that. Yeah, no. Yeah. Did he come back to life and was he horrified?

1470
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:40,240
What have you done? It happened right around you. What does this ice cream had like a big they had to scrap a ton of yes, because production, they had to close all the ice cream stores.

1471
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:45,240
I remember. And yeah, I feel like Bluebell had a similar incident. Yeah. Oh, God.

1472
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:52,240
But that has nothing to do with the founder coming back. No, I'm saying I think Bluebell might be known for being based.

1473
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,240
So Bluebell is almost like a Houston and Listeria.

1474
01:12:55,240 --> 01:13:02,240
So it's like the Chipotle of ice cream at this point where it's known more for stomach problems than it is for the taste of their food.

1475
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:05,240
That's enough time has passed. I forgot about the Listeria.

1476
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:10,240
Well, Brenham, Texas, is that ring a bell? That's one of their factories.

1477
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:20,240
You can tour. It's got to be the right pronunciation.

1478
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:23,240
Well, please let me know if you ever took this tour.

1479
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:27,240
Somehow I've access to this video. That's just a little personal wish there.

1480
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:31,240
I'll try to look myself to. So I haven't looked in YouTube era.

1481
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:35,240
But anyway, delightful. Great. Love this.

1482
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:41,240
And I'm going to move to something that it does not seem like this exhibit was very fun.

1483
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,240
But I think there's fun things to talk about with it.

1484
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:50,240
And that is March 1956 opens the Dutch Boy Color Gallery.

1485
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:59,240
So what this seems to be is like lights that have colors and you can like make color matches.

1486
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,240
I don't know. It sounds so bad.

1487
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:05,240
But what is notable about this is that this is sponsored by Dutch Boy.

1488
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,240
This is a brand that is still around today.

1489
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:16,240
But they have shifted their brand for today's purposes because at the time they were primarily known for producing lead paint.

1490
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:21,240
Yeah. Yes. Yes. We now know causes all kinds of environmental damage.

1491
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:31,240
I'm not sure Santa issues ask. So yeah, from 56 to 63 Disneyland had a big ad for lead paint.

1492
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:37,240
Yeah, of course. Of course they did. And all the paint was lead they were using.

1493
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,240
Oh, that's probably true. Well, I imagine they used it everywhere in the park.

1494
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,240
That was part of that. You got to lose use our aluminum. Yeah.

1495
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:48,240
We use our lead paint. We might still we might all be getting sick from Disneyland lead paint.

1496
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:52,240
Oh, it's got to be baked in there somewhere in this somewhere in Disneyland.

1497
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,240
They're still lead paint 100 percent. There is.

1498
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,240
I mean, we hear about like little things all the time where it's like, oh, they didn't clean this thing for 40 years.

1499
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:03,240
And now now there's an issue. Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah.

1500
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:06,240
They don't let these stories leak. Some stories. Yeah.

1501
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,240
There's stories we hear. But yeah, no.

1502
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,240
So there's got to be like one whole building that's full of lead paint.

1503
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:18,240
They forgot to get rid of it. And we've just been going in there and like eating for decades.

1504
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:23,240
Look, hey, mommy, look, I'm going to lick the wall. Yeah, that's well, that's right.

1505
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,240
Disneyland's like Willy Wonka's Factory. You can lick every wall.

1506
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,240
We've licked all the walls at Disneyland. And that's what the final four is going to be about.

1507
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:36,240
Right. Best tasting wall is it. Look, is there a higher percentage chance you're going to get Legionnaires disease?

1508
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:41,240
Yes. But still, there's got to be lead paint somewhere.

1509
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:47,240
Another fine Philadelphia invention. Legionnaires. Oh, no, that is discovery.

1510
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:51,240
Jason takes pride in Legionnaires disease.

1511
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:56,240
At this point, let me talk for a second about Dutch boy.

1512
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:02,240
I can't tell if I've found my new favorite character or least favorite character.

1513
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:10,240
Dutch boy is still around. But if you haven't seen Dutch boy, Dutch boy is he's got like a big he's got overalls.

1514
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:17,240
He's got a big floppy Fievel kind of hat and he has very severe blonde bangs.

1515
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,240
He has his hair. Basically, he's got a Z.

1516
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:27,240
Oh, yeah, he does. Uh huh. And it's so it's very like euro like well, Dutch, I get that's what it is.

1517
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:33,240
And it's like cut right at the cheeks, just the sharpest you would slice your fingers on his hair.

1518
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:38,240
His hair reminds me of and it's not the same color and he's not bald.

1519
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:44,240
But it reminds me of a guy I was recently talking about. Cookie from the Bozo show.

1520
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:50,240
And this is Cookie. Oh, yeah. He has very like straight hair.

1521
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:54,240
He's bald on the top. So he looks kind of like Hulk Hogan. But ends.

1522
01:16:54,240 --> 01:17:00,240
The hair does not fade. Yeah. Over. It looks. Yeah, it looks like almost fake.

1523
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,240
And yeah, so Dutch boy looks like that.

1524
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:12,240
And he is I know what you're saying. It's like, do I love Dutch boy or am I a little afraid?

1525
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:22,240
Dutch boy often is rendered in this in that kind of like fifties eerie style of painting that's like old Santa Claus ads.

1526
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:27,240
But I'm not scared by those. But yeah, Norman Rockwell is a good one.

1527
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:37,240
Yeah. But I guess I mean, Dutch boy might kind of feed into my discomfort with like Mary Martin and Sandy Duncan.

1528
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:43,240
There's kind of like a frozen chipper smile. Yeah. Yeah.

1529
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:50,240
I'm happy. And it's like, I'm happy. Like, I'm just insisting that I'm happy. Look at the smile I'm making.

1530
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:56,240
Yeah. Yeah. How could this be insincere? Jason, what do you think about Dutch boy?

1531
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:08,240
I mean, yeah, he's he's kind of cute. When when you were growing up and around this time in the 1950s, were you even friends with Dutch boy?

1532
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:19,240
Yeah, I don't. You know, there's a lot of Pennsylvania Dutch, you know, drawings of people or drawings of the Amish, you know.

1533
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:27,240
And I feel like they look like the little Dutch boy. Yeah. I mean, that probably was friends with a Dutch boy.

1534
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:33,240
Yeah. The Dutch boy definitely looks like he's adjacent to Little Rascals or our gang. Yeah. Yeah.

1535
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:41,240
If they had a European friend, right, moved in, joined the RIP Robert Blake, by the way.

1536
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:54,240
All said, the Oscars didn't say it, but they didn't say it. Yeah. But where I'm looking at Dutch boy currently is from, you know, in addition to sponsoring this lead paint exhibit,

1537
01:18:54,240 --> 01:19:02,240
they also had a coloring book, the Dutch Boy Disneyland coloring book. So here is Dutch boy painting the castle. Oh, yeah, that's great.

1538
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:12,240
Bright pink. And then there's moments in this. Look, I don't usually enjoy that. OK. The meaning of this word has changed.

1539
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:23,240
And there is a different meaning in the in the past. But when you don't expect to see this page where it says ice cream from a gay pushcart, it's just it jumps out at you.

1540
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:33,240
Sure. It's very strange. And and then you got hold on a second, even if we're using gay as happy. Why is it being a pushcart being described as happy?

1541
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:42,240
Yeah, the cart, maybe the man is. And then also, why is the man covered up by this umbrella in this weird it's like covering half of his head?

1542
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:46,240
It's very poor composition. Well, certainly is a poor composition. Yeah.

1543
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:54,240
They didn't take a lot of care in this coloring book. Yeah. Yeah. It's a strange adjective for a push, much like aluminum fame.

1544
01:19:54,240 --> 01:20:02,240
And then you go. So he like kind of looks at a couple of things at Disneyland, but then keeps moving to the real the real Disneyland.

1545
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:06,240
Here is Dutch Boy's special show. And he's at his own color gallery.

1546
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:21,240
And then it illustrates what the kind of thing you can do in the color gallery. Dutch Boy dials his color charts and then he's got like wheel. He's so happy to be turning wheels that say sandalwood and bottle green.

1547
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,240
I hate your I hate your color chart, Dutch Boy.

1548
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:41,240
And then I can answer the why the car was a gay ice cream cart. The gay 90s is an American nostalgic term and a periodization of the history of the United States referring to the decade of the 1890s.

1549
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:45,240
And that's Main Street. And that's kind of what they're. So it's an era specific era.

1550
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:55,240
There used to be there's an old there's a bunch of old black and white photos of Burbank and there's a photo and you can see the blue room like a longtime bar in Burbank.

1551
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:03,240
The blue room neon sign is exactly the same. But the bar two doors or three doors down was called the gay 90s.

1552
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:08,240
OK. But that's gone. That bar is long gone. Yeah. The bar's changed names a lot of times.

1553
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:16,240
Well, the adults Dutch Boy would have been drinking there. Yeah. Yeah.

1554
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:22,240
Still today. Grown grizzled Dutch Dutch man Dutch man.

1555
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:28,240
Things were so much happier when I was Dutch grandpa. Things seemed so simple then.

1556
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:38,240
Anyway, this just got me down this rabbit hole. Then I'm doing Google Images Google Images searching of other Dutch boy media.

1557
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:45,240
And that is where I start finding Dutch boy books from the 1920s. Yeah, there's so much Dutch boy content.

1558
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:49,240
If you look, you find some. Yeah, you go for go ahead.

1559
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:58,240
Well, here's the one one that I found is called the Dutch Boys lead party. Yeah.

1560
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:01,240
It is he hears Dutch boy and he's got his open.

1561
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:10,240
Dutch boys like kind of a Johnny Appleseed, you know, but instead of spreading apple seeds, he spreads lead paint everywhere with a huge smile,

1562
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:25,240
severe hair, giant smile and a bucket full of lead paint. And he is facing a battalion of products with with lead in them like a big light bulb and a plate and a shoe.

1563
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:32,240
They're massive. And they're done. This is again. We're now we're in the 20s. So this is that eerie kind of Efteling. Yeah.

1564
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:41,240
Lewis Carroll kind of like it's these are very unsettling creatures in general. And then here's all right.

1565
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:46,240
OK, so he's talking to this light bulb.

1566
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:54,240
And again, this work they use. This is like a motif of of Dutch boy. The first one at the party was gay electric light.

1567
01:22:54,240 --> 01:23:02,240
He said, I'm very brilliant. I always shine at night, no little which gives a light much brighter because it's made with lead.

1568
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:08,240
And then so he's meeting all these things, telling him the benefits of lead forming this lead party.

1569
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:19,240
And then, oh, God, a pair of rubbers, it says, which are shoes, a pair of rubber gloves and took the Dutch boys arm.

1570
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:26,240
We're tough and strong and lively because in us there's lead. This sounds this sounds like somebody made a fake one.

1571
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:31,240
Yeah, maybe. Like some. That's what I was going through some of these and I go, are these fake?

1572
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:35,240
Because they mentioned lead so much, it feels like some sort of perverse parody.

1573
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:40,240
Like you could own this could only come from an era where we know that lead paint is bad.

1574
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:45,240
But I guess why else would they say leads like it's not just that we've changed what we make pain out of.

1575
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:49,240
I'm so proud of the lead. Yeah, that's why only wants friends with lead in them.

1576
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:54,240
And if you don't if you don't have lead in you, he's going to put some lead in you. Right.

1577
01:23:54,240 --> 01:24:03,240
I was in something different back then. Totally fine at the time and happiness for a young boy to say he wants to put lead in you.

1578
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:07,240
Yeah, that made them making you smile, making smiles come into your body.

1579
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:14,240
That's why I was terrified in elementary school because I knew they taught us that the pencils have graphite in them nowadays.

1580
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:18,240
But like the clicky pick pencils, everyone always called lead pencil.

1581
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:23,240
Yes. And I'm like, oh, I'm going to touch that lead and I'm going to die.

1582
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:30,240
Like I'm sure it wasn't actual like, you know, full strength, full power lead or whatever.

1583
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:34,240
Yeah, I don't know the you were talking to the mechanical pencils. Yeah, mechanical.

1584
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,240
That was work. I think it ended up being like graphite or yeah, probably.

1585
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:41,240
Yeah, I don't think it was led. But the short hand, everyone just said, oh, yeah, we said it too.

1586
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,240
Yeah. But yeah, once we learned that was bad.

1587
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:51,240
He also he calls this specifically Dutch Boy Pure White Lead. Yeah.

1588
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:55,240
Unsettling phrasology throughout all of this stuff is like on eBay.

1589
01:24:55,240 --> 01:25:00,240
You can get these ads and it's yeah, they look fake.

1590
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:05,240
A product like this one is just as at the end is as a product of national lead, national lead.

1591
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:10,240
That was a parent Dutch Boy does it best and the best is less expensive in the long run.

1592
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,240
And he's got this like crazy smile on his face.

1593
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:16,240
Oh, I don't like that Dutch Boy. Yeah.

1594
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:20,240
That Dutch Boy slowly getting lead poisoning through the.

1595
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:25,240
Yeah, here are the facts. This is how I looked two years ago.

1596
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:29,240
What do you mean? It's good for my skin.

1597
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:32,240
I get only more pure white by the year.

1598
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,240
I drink a big glass of lead each morning.

1599
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:43,240
Stir the lead into my milk. I can paint my house with it and then I can clean up my intestines with it too.

1600
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,240
I wait for the lead man to fly by.

1601
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:50,240
Pour some lead on me. Pure white, of course, my favorite kind.

1602
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:54,240
The lead man is having an affair with my mother.

1603
01:25:54,240 --> 01:26:00,240
And I welcome it. And I like it. I hate my dad. My dad don't believe in the lead.

1604
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:04,240
My dad doesn't care for lead at all. What a fool.

1605
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,240
My dad uses oil paints. He's a coward.

1606
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:12,240
The lead man brings my mother some lead every day.

1607
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:17,240
I wish my dad would drink some of the oil paints and end it all.

1608
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:21,240
He doesn't deserve to live because he don't know about lead.

1609
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:28,240
I'm the Dutch Boy. This is, Mike, because you mentioned microplastics, this is reminding me of a meme I saw recently.

1610
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,240
That's the Spider-Men pointing at each other.

1611
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:37,240
And it's three of them and it says, My grandfather, lead. My father, asbestos. Me, microplastics.

1612
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:40,240
And it's just like, oh, every generation has been poisoned with.

1613
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,240
That's right. Different things.

1614
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,240
All things found in Disneyland.

1615
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:48,240
Oh, yeah.

1616
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:53,240
The other one that I found, I'm sorry, I'm not going to go into all of them, but there's a lot of Dutch Boy books.

1617
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:57,240
Another one is called The Land of Sad Houses.

1618
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:05,240
And it's a bunch of there are a bunch of houses that all have human legs that are clad in slacks, slack legs.

1619
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:13,240
And then, like, you know, loafers and Dutch boys going through the land of sad houses and fixing them by caking them in lead.

1620
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,240
And again, every page. Hurrah!

1621
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:22,240
The old house cried, tis new. Dutch Boy White Lead has made me new.

1622
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:27,240
Here he has here there's a set of stairs and the stairs are all set.

1623
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:35,240
These are ghosts. These are ghosts trapped in stairs and the like whatever the staircase knob, whatever you call that.

1624
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,240
The banister?

1625
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,240
Oh, banister. Thank you.

1626
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,240
The whole thing is banister.

1627
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,240
Yeah. All like moaning like hellions.

1628
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:46,240
Like they're trapped. Spirits are trapped in these stairs.

1629
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,240
Save me in lead, please.

1630
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:54,240
It's the only way to cleanse my spirit. Only lead can get me out of hell.

1631
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,240
Hell would be more prep.

1632
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:03,240
Hell would be better than this stair limbo.

1633
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:10,240
Dutch Boy, go find a gun and fire it into each of our stair faces.

1634
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,240
Put us out of our misery.

1635
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:16,240
Oh, they say we look so old, we're nearly dead.

1636
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,240
I'll make you new, the Dutch Boy said.

1637
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:24,240
And then he paints them and Dutch Boy Lead, they look just right.

1638
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:29,240
And then there's so much scarier when they're smiling. It's worse. He makes everything worse.

1639
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,240
Yeah, he's bad.

1640
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,240
In the land of sad houses.

1641
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:37,240
I hear you met a bungalow who's crying big thick tears.

1642
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:46,240
I'll make you new with my white lead.

1643
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:53,240
You just need my white lead.

1644
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:59,240
Put me full of your white lead, Dutch Boy.

1645
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,240
Oh, man, I guess I don't.

1646
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:06,240
I do like the Dutch Boy, but I don't like him too.

1647
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,240
I have one more.

1648
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:14,240
The most maybe the most sadistic thing that I found is that there's one where he goes through like Mother Goose and famous stories.

1649
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,240
Oh, yeah, I think I saw that one.

1650
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:17,240
Yeah, yeah.

1651
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,240
In this one.

1652
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:23,240
So he like he sees Little Red Riding Hood and she's running.

1653
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:26,240
And what are you running from? Oh, there's a wolf after me.

1654
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:29,240
Oh, I'll spoil his game, says Dutch Boy.

1655
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:37,240
And then he gets his his bucket that is clearly labeled Dutch Boy white lead and he traps the wolf's head in it.

1656
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:41,240
The old wolf growled and growled and pawed and pawed, but couldn't get it off.

1657
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:46,240
So he suffocates a wolf joke on my leg.

1658
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,240
Choke on my lead and die.

1659
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,240
You want to eat Little Red Riding Hood?

1660
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:59,240
Eat this. The wolf stopped moving his body so there, but he was gone.

1661
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,240
Hey, Little Red Riding Hood, want to go kick his corpse?

1662
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:06,240
Let's dump. Let's dump lead on the part that didn't have lead.

1663
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:11,240
We're eating wolf for dinner with my favorite sauce.

1664
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:14,240
Lead. White lead.

1665
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:17,240
A white lead sauce on the side.

1666
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:20,240
There's no better glaze than white lead.

1667
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:25,240
We sauteed a wolf in white lead for eight hours.

1668
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:29,240
It brings out the flavor.

1669
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:32,240
This what now? There's a couple types of food that I would like in the cafeteria.

1670
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:37,240
I like, of course, my favorite chili and I would like wolf sauteed in white lead paint.

1671
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:40,240
Talk to the Dutch Boy people. Get them moving on that.

1672
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:45,240
OK, Denison's Chili Dutch Boy Wolf Lead Paint. Got it.

1673
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,240
I'd like to call a second gate shot for Dutch Boy at this point.

1674
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:53,240
I think there's enough momentum to find more Dutch Boy content.

1675
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:57,240
And if you want to hear more Dutch Boy, you're going to have to pay us.

1676
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:00,240
That's what I feel. Seems like he earned it.

1677
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:04,240
I was boy, love Dutch Boy.

1678
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:07,240
Do you do we want to?

1679
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:10,240
Do we do Bathroom of Tomorrow? Yeah.

1680
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:14,240
You mean as opposed to not as opposed to peeling it off for later?

1681
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,240
I don't I don't have a ton about it.

1682
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,240
Do we think it fits in here?

1683
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,240
Bathroom of Tomorrow joins in April 1956.

1684
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:24,240
I throw that, by the way, what a way to introduce it so casually.

1685
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:26,240
What do we think about Bathroom of Tomorrow?

1686
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:31,240
They had something called the Bathroom of Tomorrow, which has been suggested on on Club 3.

1687
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,240
So let's let's talk about it here a little bit.

1688
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:37,240
I have never sent an email or a text faster of like that one.

1689
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,240
Bathroom, Bathroom of Tomorrow.

1690
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,240
We're going to the bathroom. I want it.

1691
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:44,240
Well, not when did not win, but that's OK.

1692
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:51,240
It didn't win. But with that said, what's what are some of your favorite facts about the bathroom?

1693
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:53,240
Well, the opening ceremony. Well, yeah.

1694
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:57,240
Please, let's talk about that. Yeah, I got it right here.

1695
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:04,240
Walt was involved in this opening ceremony himself, along with Crane Company.

1696
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:07,240
Crane Crane and Frank F.

1697
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:12,240
And then the designer, I think, of the exhibit last is last name is Dreyfus,

1698
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:18,240
who was a major designer of the of the 40s and 50s on like revolutionized design

1699
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:21,240
in a lot of ways that weren't ultimately that funny or interesting to talk about.

1700
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:28,240
But a major 20th century design and Walt Disney and Walt Disney did not open every ride.

1701
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,240
No, not by a long shot.

1702
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:36,240
But he's there for the Crane Bathroom of Tomorrow for the ceremonial valve turning ceremony.

1703
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:42,240
They didn't cut a ribbon. They turned on a toilet valve, essentially.

1704
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:47,240
They got turned on the water for the toilet and the shower.

1705
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:50,240
Mr. Elliott, Mr. Elliott, turn that valve.

1706
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:55,240
So there's three men all turning not real valves. I don't think.

1707
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,240
I believe they're ceremonial valves. They're ceremonial.

1708
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,240
They weren't actually like valves that would turn on and off water.

1709
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:08,240
I don't know, because they're in the spot where ultimately there were five valves outside the exhibit,

1710
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:12,240
which I think these did work. I think the children could turn.

1711
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:16,240
This is this is like a water feature. Children turn the valves.

1712
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,240
Oh, so that is those are the valves they were turning.

1713
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:23,240
I mean, I'm not sure, but they're in the spot where OK, it could have been ceremony of valves.

1714
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:26,240
But they but ultimately real valves were installed.

1715
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:34,240
This is where we need Jim Hill and Lantesta to step in and figure out did Walt and company turn the real water valves.

1716
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,240
Were they actually affecting water pressure?

1717
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,240
And that's what you just said is the title of the episode.

1718
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,240
Yes, that is right. Yeah. Come on, family.

1719
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:47,240
Toilet. Jim and Lenny talk about we talk about toilets a lot on this show.

1720
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:50,240
And Jim and Lenny talk more about toilets.

1721
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:53,240
That's what we can bring to the table when the collaboration happens.

1722
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:56,240
Or if the collaboration has happened, I don't know.

1723
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,240
We'll see. We'll see.

1724
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:04,240
The funny fun post about this on the Walt Disney Family Museum Web site.

1725
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:07,240
A place I've been to, I think, was really neat.

1726
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:15,240
And I think it's surprisingly more frank about Walt and his company and his contributions and stuff.

1727
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:18,240
More more than the Walt Disney Company is.

1728
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:30,240
But they they mentioned that guests could enjoy, quote, a dramatic story of valves.

1729
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:41,240
And a lot of it was like these are actually, you know, we're talking about this guy, big designer, kind of thoughtfully designed like museum placards and panels, a lot of water drops.

1730
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:48,240
Well, when they say dramatic story of valves, what they mean is it's a story that's laid out into big teardrops.

1731
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:51,240
And what's more dramatic than a big teardrop?

1732
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:55,240
No. So this timeline that is labeled the story of flow control.

1733
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,240
Yes, that's a great graphic or whatever you call it.

1734
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:01,240
To be clear, the water that is flowing is blue, not yellow.

1735
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:10,240
This is not about a human being's flow control, something that, you know, we'll all have our struggles with as the years go by.

1736
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:14,240
Well, you see hints of it already. You're a man. You're 30. Yeah.

1737
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,240
Amen, brother. Not perfect down there anymore. Yeah, we're not. Yeah, I'm doing all right.

1738
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:21,240
I got to say, I'm going to take this opportunity to brag. I'm my flow control.

1739
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:25,240
I think that's great. I think that I'm not having a big problem, but, you know, there's a little thing you go.

1740
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:33,240
It's not airtight anymore. You start reading about cranberry extract capsules.

1741
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:41,240
That is when you guys are because you guys are drinking ice and even pop rocks every day. They're all calcifying at the end.

1742
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:46,240
But the beginning of your flow, you think my flow is being affected by the amount of ice I'm drinking.

1743
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:53,240
Yeah. Hardened ice is all preventing that. It's all flow blockage. My flow is fine.

1744
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:59,240
I'm just saying you go to the doctor and you go as a little, you know, sometimes it's not airtight.

1745
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:03,240
Now, sometimes a little comes out afterward and they go, yeah, that's fine. That's what happens.

1746
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:08,240
You know, my flow is fine and it's not because of the sugar intake.

1747
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:13,240
That's what I'm saying. And I'm mad about it. I'm mad about the inference. If any backseat doctors are listening.

1748
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:17,240
Yeah. No, I don't claim to be a doctor. That was just one guess. All right. Fine. Maybe you're right.

1749
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:22,240
Maybe it'll come out. We didn't know about lead paint. Maybe we don't know about ice and what they're doing to a man's flow.

1750
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:28,240
When you drink ice for decades and your cocktails are essentially ice as well.

1751
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:34,240
I don't drink. I don't drink milk for dinner anymore, but I do drink an icy for each dinner. I have an ice per meal.

1752
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:40,240
Oh, you got one of those machines that I have a machine suggested on the Instagram ads of like, oh, check out that.

1753
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:49,240
You can get a little icy machine. That's right. I bring that Snoopy Snow Cone maker with me everywhere I go in case I need to do something like I don't have access to an icy.

1754
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:52,240
I can bring the whole doghouse. You know, I'm talking about.

1755
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:58,240
You mean you could like if you're going camping or something. Yes. So if you need ice, ice stat on the road.

1756
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:04,240
Yeah, I bring the Snoopy Snow Cone maker, which doesn't work very well, but you know, it works.

1757
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:08,240
Shit. A bear got into the icy machine.

1758
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:14,240
I never should have gone camping with the icy machine. We had that Snoopy Snow Cone maker and I was so excited when we got it.

1759
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:19,240
And then I we made the snow cones and I was like, this does not taste as good as an icy.

1760
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:26,240
You said that Snoopy Snow Cone. You guys don't know what I'm talking about. No, I kind of feel like maybe this is.

1761
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:31,240
Did you get this when you were 10 or when you were like 28 when I was 10? OK, here.

1762
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:37,240
This is it's a pretty look. I thought it was a fairly iconic item, but it's it's it's like Snoopy's.

1763
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:43,240
It's like a doghouse and you would put the ice in it and then it would like you would crush it up.

1764
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:50,240
There's like a little like a thing on Snoopy's head or this is the new. There's actually a newer version of it, too.

1765
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:53,240
And I think it's basically the same as it was when I was little.

1766
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:59,240
So, yeah, you would grind it up manually, essentially, and make like shaved ice and then add coloring to it.

1767
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:06,240
But it sucked, probably. Well, versus an icy, which was much more integrated as far as the flavor and the ice.

1768
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:10,240
Sure. Because the snow cone was fun. It was fun to get it and see it.

1769
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:16,240
It looked cool. But a lot of the flavor that would run down to the bottom of that little like paper sleeve

1770
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:21,240
or whatever you would call it and you wouldn't get you'd almost just be getting mouths full of ice with no flavor.

1771
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:26,240
Not even distribution. Not exactly. I see. So any dream that I see have made possible.

1772
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:32,240
Yes, the technology finally caught up with snow cones and icy people figured it out.

1773
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:38,240
This is the futurism that Walt well. Yeah. Even distribution. We can all dream of a better world.

1774
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:44,240
That's right. And God bless the scientists at Monsanto. God bless the Nazi scientists who created ice.

1775
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:49,240
That's what I have to say. The Snoopy Snow Cone Machine from Nazi scientists.

1776
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:54,240
Yeah, the icy polar bear actually evacuated in Operation Paper.

1777
01:38:54,240 --> 01:39:02,240
We captured him. He's on our side note. What else in this thing?

1778
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:12,240
Oh, well, everything was a certain color, which was like a yellow like a beautiful gold, beautiful urine gold.

1779
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:17,240
Gold like it looks in some photos. It does look like Trump's apartment in New York.

1780
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:24,240
Yeah. And some in some ways I are some places I felt like it was described less as gold and more like just like a weird yellow.

1781
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:30,240
Right. Yellow. Right. Yellow. Which a lot not most bathroom. It has not become the standard bathroom.

1782
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:34,240
No, it looks it looks awful. Yeah. And the photos that exist.

1783
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:45,240
But I think the I think Crane's deal was getting a little experimental because I found the end of one of these articles, the discussion of or this.

1784
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:49,240
This is an ad from this era from 1957, I think.

1785
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:55,240
And here's a Crane bathroom ad and the the toilet is bright turquoise.

1786
01:39:55,240 --> 01:40:02,240
It is the it's exactly the color of cherry from Playhouse and the same.

1787
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:07,240
It's like cherry, but without cherries, top half cherry got sliced.

1788
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:14,240
Yeah. The bottom of cherry and then but then also next to it, the toilet paper is the same color.

1789
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:17,240
Oh, yeah. Bright turquoise toilet paper.

1790
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:26,240
And then under that very red shag carpeting, the color of turning red. Yeah.

1791
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,240
It's an insane bathroom.

1792
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:31,240
Colored toilets go in and out of fashion.

1793
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:41,240
And I think Kohler, I had I had gotten some ads for like the limited run like Hunter Green toilets like it recently.

1794
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:47,240
Oh, so they like throwback designs. All of this comes back around and throwback designs.

1795
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:52,240
Color toilet paper. I do remember like blue or pink toilet paper occasionally growing up.

1796
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,240
Really? Just just what was it? I don't know.

1797
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:58,240
I don't know. Just buying not like a grandma's house thing.

1798
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,240
Grandma's house sort of thing.

1799
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:03,240
But did you have carpet? Did anybody have carpeting in their bathroom? Yes.

1800
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:06,240
You did all of them. Wow. Oh, really? Yeah. That's interesting.

1801
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:12,240
And then kind of quickly removed when like something would flood or overflow.

1802
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:17,240
And it's like, well, let's get this out of here because this is a pain in the ass.

1803
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:20,240
And it's catching anything that falls. That's yes.

1804
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:26,240
And if you're a man, you're 30s and sometimes stuff flies. You know, it's getting some flow in that shag.

1805
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:30,240
Right. And the full of maybe not a perfect flow and the aim isn't as precise.

1806
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,240
Yeah, you're going to get some some pee in that carpeting.

1807
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:40,240
That's it is a crazy thing to do. So glad you don't have you aren't soaking red shag in your your late droplets.

1808
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:43,240
It's not it's not a big problem.

1809
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:47,240
But look, a lot of other men in their 30s don't want to talk about Jason.

1810
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:50,240
I mean, could this be from like food?

1811
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:53,240
Could this be from that bottle of Captain Crunch Blue Mabel's?

1812
01:41:53,240 --> 01:42:00,240
Sorry, Jason's thinking now from the Pandora flakes that after finishing polishing off two boxes,

1813
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:03,240
I realized, you know, I think I got a headache every time.

1814
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:06,240
That's what I'm saying.

1815
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:09,240
I don't. It's always right in front of you.

1816
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,240
What's causing the extreme health?

1817
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:16,240
Is there a blue dye just destroying Mike and Mike's urethra?

1818
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:22,240
I don't. Scott's perfect urethra is just because he didn't have as much blue dye.

1819
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:24,240
You said it. Not me.

1820
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:29,240
You know, you can't make up your own poll quote for the movie poster, but perfect.

1821
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:33,240
Perfect. A perfect urethra, says Mike Carlson of Podcast The Right.

1822
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:38,240
I'm going to look into your urethral rejuvenation and I'm going to figure out a way to reverse

1823
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:45,240
our urethra aging that has been caused by the different dyes in the foods we normally regularly eat.

1824
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:53,240
After after careful research, you discovered that the most common cause is the sands of time.

1825
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:56,240
No way to remove that. I don't want to hear that.

1826
01:42:56,240 --> 01:43:01,240
I'm seeing the phrase reconstruction, but not re not rejuvenation.

1827
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:04,240
That seems to be mainly vaginal vaginal thing.

1828
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:09,240
I was curious if your urethral rejuvenation is a thing.

1829
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:12,240
No one can tighten up my urethra is what you're saying.

1830
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:16,240
So that was not covered in the bathroom of tomorrow.

1831
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:21,240
There was not. No, the dramatic display did not discuss your urethral rejuvenation.

1832
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:27,240
It's a lot about quote, tomorrow's bathroom incorporates the type of heating and cooling,

1833
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:31,240
which will make you forget the weather.

1834
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,240
Uh huh.

1835
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:38,240
So I just I just spend the entire summer in my cold bathroom.

1836
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,240
Yeah, I don't even know what's going on outside.

1837
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:44,240
That's like, yeah, like a heated bathroom.

1838
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:46,240
They have heated toilet seats at this point.

1839
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:51,240
Like that's something that people still have. Heater in the fan.

1840
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,240
You can make the fan blow hot air.

1841
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:56,240
I feel like most bathrooms have some sort of a heater thing still.

1842
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:58,240
Yeah. If you want to turn that on, it's usually like dusty.

1843
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:02,240
If you're in an old house or apartment, you go in there and clean that thing.

1844
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,240
But yeah, uh, I've a heated toilet seat.

1845
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:08,240
I don't I don't think that's I don't need that.

1846
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:10,240
What did you not do that in Japan?

1847
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:13,240
Well, I don't know that I realized it was heated.

1848
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:17,240
I know the day situation, of course. Oh, you were into the heated thing.

1849
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:19,240
Yeah. Oh, really? Oh, it feels great.

1850
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:22,240
Yeah, I guess it was a little chilly. I was in I was in Tokyo.

1851
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:26,240
I remember a really solid you sat on a heated toilet seat in Tokyo,

1852
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:27,240
didn't Tokyo, didn't I?

1853
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:30,240
I guess I managed to not talk about that in my trip report.

1854
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:35,240
My God, I feel like a really good one that might have been built into the big volcano.

1855
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:39,240
Really? Mount Prometheus, I believe, has heated toilets.

1856
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:46,240
You attribute because it's about like the ingenuity of H.G. Wells and Jules Verne.

1857
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:50,240
And even they couldn't dream of the comforts of a heated toilet.

1858
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:53,240
I took a shit in Mount Prometheus.

1859
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:57,240
Wow, how did we not talk about this on the episode?

1860
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:59,240
How did we not? Was that not something I wanted to?

1861
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:04,240
Well, I didn't want to, you know, how just in case anyone wasn't comfortable with their urethral.

1862
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:06,240
I'm so tired and punchy right now.

1863
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:09,240
I'm trying to think of where did I shit in Tokyo?

1864
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:14,240
I had to have done it somewhere because we were in the park for we were there for again, three and a half days.

1865
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:20,240
But this I liked this episode until the last until until the last 45 minutes.

1866
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:27,240
I was the first hour I was like, oh, this is one of more like scholarly episodes.

1867
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:32,240
Bathroom of the Future and Dutch Boy really derailed that here.

1868
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:36,240
This is cleaner because it's about laundry.

1869
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,240
The exhibit is from the Disney Family Museum site again.

1870
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:45,240
The exhibit was also home to a laundry of the future, which according to Crane,

1871
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:52,240
quote, only hints at possible attractive settings for the home laundry with Crane material.

1872
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:58,240
So your laundry will be much more attractive in the future.

1873
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:07,240
OK, dryers will tear up your clothes, exposing nipples and butts the next time you wear the clothes that scintillating.

1874
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:10,240
There are like Wi-Fi washer and dryer.

1875
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:14,240
Now we're like, you can start the cycle on your phone and it's completely superfluous.

1876
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,240
Don't need to do it. Oh, yeah.

1877
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:19,240
Like what would you can't load it with? It's really weird.

1878
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:21,240
Buttons are fine. Yeah.

1879
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:26,240
So there are like weird like future washer and dryers that exist now, but it doesn't make any sense.

1880
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:31,240
It's also where all the Quibi shows ended up. You watch them on certain. Right.

1881
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:34,240
I forget that. I forget the brand. Producers are dryers. Yeah.

1882
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:39,240
So they got a second life. That's what Katzenberg said. You can use them after you can repurpose them.

1883
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:41,240
That's true. Yeah. Just head to your dryer.

1884
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:46,240
Roku, one of the companies affected a lot of Quibi stuff landed on Roku.

1885
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:50,240
That's right. Their payroll affected by the Silicon Valley Bank.

1886
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:53,240
They seem to have lost a lot of money. Yeah.

1887
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:57,240
I know. I think what does this mean for future recovered Quibis?

1888
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:00,240
I think it's been resolved. I think the government has stepped in.

1889
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:05,240
One collapsing company has heard another really collapsed company.

1890
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:09,240
The government should have bailed out Quibi. That's what I think.

1891
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:13,240
Who isn't sure? Wait, that all happened within Trump, right?

1892
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:18,240
Yeah. That's a quibi. Yeah. That's well Katzenberg such a lib, you know, like he was never going to buy.

1893
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:23,240
Biden would have come on. We need our we need our horizontal work.

1894
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:26,240
We got to be able to. It's turnstile. Come on.

1895
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:31,240
But both way. Come on. Judge Judge Teigen. Come on.

1896
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:36,240
She's got a golden arm.

1897
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:39,240
She's got that golden arm. Hard to live.

1898
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:44,240
She's upset about the golden arm. We can't have her losing her job to create jobs.

1899
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:48,240
It's whether you have a golden arm or regular arm. She can't do her stand up gigs.

1900
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:52,240
She can't do her stand up. The clubs are closed.

1901
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:56,240
This is all during the State of the Union.

1902
01:47:56,240 --> 01:48:01,240
I'm going to give a golden arm. Everybody in this country.

1903
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:05,240
Boo. Boo.

1904
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:08,240
Marjorie Taylor Green shouted in protest.

1905
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:14,240
I quibi protest of Biden's golden arm program initiative.

1906
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:19,240
Remember, the Supreme Court strikes down golden arm initiative as unconstitutional.

1907
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:24,240
Remember when that was a news story for like weeks that some guy yelled, you lie at Obama.

1908
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:30,240
I just said a scream fest at the state of the union.

1909
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:34,240
Now everyone's screaming the whole time. British Parliament now.

1910
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:39,240
Yeah, it's just my chaos. They get stuff. That's true. They get that was fun to watch in high school.

1911
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:44,240
And they were like, oh, you they would show us, you know, recording like you had to watch a British parliament on C-SPAN.

1912
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:46,240
That's fun. That's real. Yeah, that's good.

1913
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:50,240
So their costumes too much better. Yeah, they should.

1914
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:57,240
But I want I want I would shut up about Marjorie Taylor Green if she would wear like a Dutch boy wig.

1915
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:00,240
Oh, my gosh. Everybody probably will be your hair at some point.

1916
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:06,240
Sure. She has the cap deal with it. I asked for the Dutch boy deal.

1917
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:13,240
So what you could also you could look at a bidet in this exhibit, by the way, a gold bladed bidet.

1918
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:19,240
Yeah. Yeah. So that was go to Disneyland. Look behind a pane of glass there because you couldn't use the bathroom of tomorrow.

1919
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:21,240
Right. Which is a big, big mistake.

1920
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:25,240
Only in Mount Prometheus years later, you use an innovative bathroom.

1921
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:31,240
Well, they say they always nothing gets lost in imagineering. They always go back and use everything eventually.

1922
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:38,240
I think Crane fixture is eventually used in the Disneyland Hotel right across the parking lot.

1923
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:44,240
But is there a bidet on property in American soil at Disney Park?

1924
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:47,240
I don't know. Let's again. Jim and Len.

1925
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:55,240
Can you get a spray of water after you go to the bathroom anywhere in any hotel? Maybe a suite?

1926
01:49:55,240 --> 01:50:03,240
Maybe like one of the high end suites or those like the on the water Polynesian rooms or something.

1927
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:07,240
That's your thing. The more. Yeah. Yeah. DVC. DVC gets the days.

1928
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:10,240
Grand Floridian suites. Can you get a little spray?

1929
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:14,240
And you go maybe they that's my question. What's by Golden Oaks?

1930
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:17,240
Is that a Four Seasons? Oh, but that doesn't count.

1931
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:20,240
I feel like I'm looking for Disney Imagineer. OK.

1932
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:23,240
But days or approved at least approved.

1933
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:28,240
Not they created it. Tony, you want to know that Disney's touch was put into this bidet.

1934
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:34,240
Now, if Joe Rody could write 10 paragraphs on the majesty of a bidet, I would like to see that.

1935
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,240
But I don't believe there was one in Animal Kingdom.

1936
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:39,240
And I don't think there's maybe there is an animal kingdom lodge.

1937
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:48,240
I'm not sure of the animals all get that was part of the deal with like we're not going to the conditions are going to be great for these animals.

1938
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:53,240
They're going to have plenty of room to roam and they will each have a personalized bidet with their name on it.

1939
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:56,240
And it's not every elephant, every monkey.

1940
01:50:56,240 --> 01:51:00,240
It's not just a human spraying a hose at their asshole.

1941
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:05,240
Not that it's actually a sophisticated thing.

1942
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:13,240
The you know, it's funny to imagine coming out of these exhibits and like, OK, kids, we can do a ride.

1943
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:20,240
OK, we do want we can go on one of the boats in the brownest water you've ever seen.

1944
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:22,240
Yeah, I didn't see that one. Yeah, yeah.

1945
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:26,240
Terrible. And then it's surrounded by just brown dirt, too.

1946
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:30,240
Yeah. This is where the lagoon, this where the submarine voyage would go.

1947
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:33,240
And that's Autopia in the background. Yeah.

1948
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:35,240
This is the tomorrow.

1949
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:38,240
There's not a time history about this. That's the Tomorrowland boats.

1950
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:41,240
They were called. Then they malfunctioned.

1951
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:49,240
They were not very workable. And then they took them back, gave them fins, called them the Phantom boats, brought them back out.

1952
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:55,240
They exploded all the time. And then so they it started requiring like a chauffeur.

1953
01:51:55,240 --> 01:52:07,240
You had to have a guy, an employee on the boat with you, which did not prevent explosions. It just made it so you could get back easy, not be stranded on the little pile of dirt within the dirty water.

1954
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:11,240
Yeah, I think there might have been some crashing stories as well.

1955
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:16,240
It's like the boathouse where you got to get that guy in the captain's outfit to drive you in Orlando.

1956
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:19,240
Yeah. Well, that's a fancy vehicle, just like that.

1957
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:25,240
And this has the distinction of being the first to Disneyland ride ever closed.

1958
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:28,240
This didn't make it past 56. I don't believe.

1959
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:32,240
So one more blight on Tomorrowland. Yeah.

1960
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:37,240
All of this stuff gone. You know, some some stragglers, some made it to sixty three, sixty six.

1961
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:41,240
The main thing that starts wiping this stuff out and gets us to the Tomorrowland that we know.

1962
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:44,240
Fifty nine is finally the first of the many big.

1963
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:56,240
All right. Here's a bunch of new stuff for Tomorrowland, which was pretty significant because it's monorail, it's submarines and it's Matterhorn, which is sort of sort of shares a border with frontier for a fantasy land.

1964
01:52:56,240 --> 01:53:02,240
So 59 kind of wipes out this Tomorrowland. Anything that we miss about it? Is there anything we'd like to come back?

1965
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:10,240
You know, you went to your 80s night and you're totally mini. If they did totally 56.

1966
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:15,240
Well, superbly 56. Would you be happy to see anything from this era?

1967
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:20,240
All the characters, the future dairyman, the aluminum pig, the aluminum night.

1968
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:24,240
Yeah. All that stuff. They could just throw it all in a room for a photo op.

1969
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:28,240
I would be thrilled to see that the big old bidet.

1970
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:34,240
Yeah. After they de-gal this, after they de-gal it of the lead pain and asbestos.

1971
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:42,240
I think statues, I mean, a walk around Dutch boy. Yeah, we could see that. I mean, they didn't have that back in the day, but just as a tribute.

1972
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,240
We take a selfie. Yeah, of course.

1973
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:53,240
And I don't know if this is too much to ask. Could you could you fill me with lead to fill me with your white lead?

1974
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:57,240
I can never say that.

1975
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:59,240
All right. Close your eyes.

1976
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:05,240
Here comes my white lead. Jesus Christ. All right. I'm closing it out.

1977
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:19,240
You survived podcast the ride. I would love. I mean, this is the niche-iest of niche, but I'd love to see all my friends from from Tomorrowland 56 when Tomorrowland was weird.

1978
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:26,240
Yeah. Fun to talk about, but it doesn't tell you it was a land that was always playing catch up. Yeah.

1979
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:32,240
That was still it's it's staggered. The other lands had the magic and the tent pole attractions already here.

1980
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:37,240
We didn't have, you know, it's a big, big dirty lake that still we're not happy with.

1981
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:43,240
And that's still what we're eyeing is the expansion zone that might be the key to fixing Tomorrowland. Yeah.

1982
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:48,240
We're going to keep diving in. I'm not sure where to head after this, but a ton of Tomorrowland stuff to talk about.

1983
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:51,240
But I'm glad we went back to the literally dirty beginnings.

1984
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:56,240
Yeah. I mean, the stuff that makes pack mules seem thrilling. Yeah.

1985
01:54:56,240 --> 01:55:06,240
Pack mules and stagecoach rides like, yeah, that's this is the most popular thing at the at the movie house on the on the black and white TV.

1986
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:14,240
I forgive the mules for stopping and stranding me and getting me muddy because Disney didn't build them.

1987
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:25,240
They should know God did that. They should have covered. They should have bought a bunch of different mules, covered them in aluminum foil and called them like future mules

1988
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:32,240
and have the same exact ride only with just like big flats like aluminum flats that would like look shiny.

1989
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:42,240
That's great. And then like put some, you know, don't restrict their breathing for doors, your breathing, but maybe put some weird tube on their mouth so that they're like,

1990
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:48,240
he is filtered in like a Darth Vader kind of. Yeah, exactly.

1991
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:52,240
Yeah. No, that would have that would have gone a long way to dressing this area up. Yeah.

1992
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:56,240
And in hindsight, if we double the mules would have fixed the whole thing.

1993
01:55:56,240 --> 01:56:02,240
If we had a time machine, go back in time, we would not kill Hitler because we wouldn't have gotten these great scientists.

1994
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:06,240
That's right. We need ultimately you need it for this for Disney's scientists.

1995
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:12,240
And then secondly, we would have given Walter a new future mule idea because that's really where it all went wrong is not doing that.

1996
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:19,240
Just go whisper that in his sleep, sneak into his homey hills mansion like Marty and back to the future.

1997
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:23,240
Future mule. Yeah. Dressed like that. Yeah. It's the same year. Yeah, it's perfect.

1998
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:31,240
I am Darth Vader. I have an idea for you to save your land.

1999
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:41,240
News out of Anaheim today. Walt Disney land continues its growing pains as the future mules have all passed after a mere day and a half of operation.

2000
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:46,240
Some sort of strange breathing tube was strapped to their mouth.

2001
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:50,240
Southern California heat wave continues unabated.

2002
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:58,240
Let me speak for everyone in the state when I say we forgive you, Walt, for this horrible tragedy.

2006
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:20,240
Let us know. They are. They want more. That's the place for episodes of the future.

2007
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:35,240
We we don't want we want to hear about not the house of the future, not the cool looking one. We want to hear about the one that ran on Microsoft XP from the 2000s from the early 2010s.

2008
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:41,240
