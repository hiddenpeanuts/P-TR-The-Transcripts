1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,360
We're too excited to podcast.

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,340
It's Podcasts that Ride the Second Gate.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,740
I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,020
Are you too excited to say more than hi?

6
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,740
Yes, I'm so concise in my words.

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,320
But now you're doing it.

8
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,180
I guess you're gone.

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,780
Jason, hi.

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,360
What do you think podcasting's gonna be like?

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,600
They say every year it's more magical than ever.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,880
The Hollywood Reporter says it's more magical than ever.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,260
Folks, either you know this one or you don't.

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,020
I don't think they're…

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,040
Because if you've seen it, you can never unsee it.

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,740
And it's like, it's simultaneous.

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,420
It's a big part, I feel like, of theme park and Disney World culture.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,300
And we've nodded to it here and there.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,860
But this is the first, I imagine by anyone, anywhere,

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,100
deep dive into a particular commercial that Disney World put out in 2002.

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,860
One that you can only call, I think, it has a real name,

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,680
but I think you can only call it We're Too Excited to Sleep.

23
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,600
Yeah, this feels like when you sent this in our group text,

24
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,920
this felt like a Manchurian candidate activation.

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,100
Like, had not thought about it in a long time,

26
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,340
besides tangentially touching upon it on this show.

27
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,120
And then as soon as you did…

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:53,780
Can I…

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,320
I hate to just go back to saying what we said in text messages,

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,700
but you said something so funny in a text message.

31
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,360
I want to remember.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,660
You said something along the lines, like Scott said, should we do this?

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,380
And you said, excuse me, can you repeat that?

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,060
As if we were in real life or something, instead of just saying,

35
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,320
oh, what are you talking about?

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,980
Or could you clarify that?

37
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,400
You said, could you repeat that?

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,600
You said something along the lines that made me feel…

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,260
Well, we were talking about another topic.

40
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,020
We were talking about another topic and you two had a full conversation

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,620
and I was like running around town.

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,320
But I'm pretty sure…

43
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
No, I did say that.

44
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,420
I did say that.

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,820
It just amused me because you were like, whoa, slow down.

46
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,740
Repeat that.

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,560
It almost felt like, are you serious, man?

48
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,380
That's what it felt like.

49
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,200
No, that was more like, oh, I'm sorry, I'm an idiot.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,980
I'm confused.

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,500
I just want to make sure I understand this correctly.

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,420
I think you are a little incorrect, Mike, because when I do remember,

53
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,000
I said like, should we do an episode about this?

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,320
I sent a GIF of a child who is the star of this and I felt support right away.

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,420
And honestly, I think we were too excited to do this.

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,140
I guess so.

57
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,900
We backed up other topics.

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,320
You're going to have to get in line, buddy,

59
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,360
because we got a 30-second ad to talk about for way more than 30 seconds.

60
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,280
Can I tease?

61
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,280
This is the first second gate of September.

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,200
Oh, yeah, and we're sort of officially back from a little hiatus, at least here.

63
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,640
Yeah, yeah.

64
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,240
Oh, absolutely.

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,480
So at the end of the episode, I'd like to announce my birthday shot.

66
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,260
Your birthday shot because your birthday is in early October,

67
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,760
but we'll do it a little early to clear the haunt cast season.

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,380
Yes.

69
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,780
So you know what you're doing.

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,840
You know what shot you're calling.

71
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,660
Well, it involves a little legwork, so which I will take care of.

72
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,000
OK, but you want to run the legwork by us.

73
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,620
Yes, because I haven't mentioned it so far.

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,460
No, no, no, we have not.

75
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,480
Yeah, we're in the dark on this.

76
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,520
OK, wow, wow.

77
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,900
So a lot of business to handle here.

78
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,700
Future topics jumping out.

79
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,080
But before we could go any further,

80
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,180
you know, you've been waiting for us to come back on the second gate for a while.

81
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,620
What are they going to return with?

82
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,760
What monolith of theme park culture?

83
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,120
And it is this absolutely unforgettable piece of theme park media.

84
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,040
Maybe the best thing to do here for anyone who doesn't know or needs

85
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,500
or needs the Manchurian Candidate activation is to just play the ad.

86
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,960
So, again, this is from this from 2002.

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,680
The actual name of it is Anticipation, which appears on screen.

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,420
And that's why we know it's a very like Folgers coffee ad kind of.

89
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,640
I don't think they do this anymore.

90
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,300
I don't think the little like ad auteurs name their pieces right.

91
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:29,580
Right.

92
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,080
Same way.

93
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,660
Well, maybe they do.

94
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
But behind the scenes and we don't know.

95
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:32,740
Yeah.

96
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,800
And they're and they're always referred like like saying really quickly the, you know, you know,

97
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,060
so like so we're like, all right, so the machine, we're going to sort of machine.

98
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,620
And, you know, I'm thinking back on soda machine.

99
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,700
It's like how do we top the heights of soda machine?

100
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,060
I hate to give a little bit.

101
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,920
I hate to be too inside baseball here, but on the, you know, Jason, I've done some commercials

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,160
and you do see the name of the commercial that they don't say in the actual 30 second or 15 second spot.

103
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,740
So the Allstate commercial I was in forever was called Check, Please.

104
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,180
Wow.

105
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,320
But I never said check, please.

106
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,220
Nobody ever says check, please in it.

107
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,280
Is that line in it?

108
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,480
No, I don't think so.

109
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,100
Unless Dennis Haysburg said it, but I don't think he did.

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,580
Yeah.

111
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,640
I sometimes I wonder, are there new listeners?

112
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,040
This is another, I think ads are all like mentoring candidate activations.

113
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,180
What they're supposed to do is like lodging your brain and then you're buying something or paying for something and you don't know why.

114
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,160
Sometimes I wonder if people remember your ad, like you and this girl at the table.

115
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,720
And then I'm sure we've talked about the show before, but like it was one of those where there was a period where like every time I'd met you.

116
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,540
And then every time I was in a bar, it was always like if you're in a bar for an hour, it shows up.

117
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:36,840
Crazy.

118
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,580
Yeah, it was.

119
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,460
Yeah, it was great.

120
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,040
Occasionally you get that title and like the sentence you're supposed to.

121
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,260
I've been on shoots where they are like, hey, let's go to set.

122
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,100
And I'm like, hey, no one has given me a script.

123
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,960
Oh, well that's a whole.

124
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,260
The only thing you have to say is sentence.

125
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,760
So they just hand you the storyboard.

126
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,280
That's a whole other thing where you're just like, oh, you just kind of get, they just push you and they go, hey, do this.

127
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,100
And you go, what am I doing?

128
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,280
They go, oh, yeah, sorry.

129
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,280
I just push you.

130
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,860
I forgot that part.

131
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,300
Yeah.

132
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,320
A director showed me a really cool diagram.

133
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,380
They had doodled once too of like this sentence needs to be two seconds.

134
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,540
This needs to be three.

135
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,700
This needs to be ten.

136
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,700
Then there's a card for five seconds.

137
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,320
And I was like, that is insanely impressive that you did that.

138
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,440
But it makes sense.

139
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,900
You get a free breakfast quesadilla.

140
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,860
Oh, the best.

141
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,200
The best, yeah.

142
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:33,340
Well, yeah, this is a clearly like down to the minute 30, you know, down to the second 30 second ad where it's like things are overlapping.

143
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,300
You can tell it's like and then they got their messaging to put in.

144
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:36,740
Oh, yeah.

145
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:48,320
But the only thing the listeners need to know is that it is in a child's bedroom and it is the it's a brother entering his sister's bedroom.

146
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,520
And it is the bluest, glowiest suburban room you've ever seen.

147
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,480
It's all in extreme close ups, I would say.

148
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,960
It's like it's all about emotion.

149
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,800
It feels like like E.

150
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:02,900
T.

151
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,900
is about to join or something like the room is very feels amblyne to me.

152
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,960
It feels like they may as well just go to the window and see an alien friend.

153
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,100
Childhood magic.

154
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,240
Something's in the air.

155
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,500
That's completely clear.

156
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,800
Before the famous line even is said.

157
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,820
Also, I thought this ad was a lot older.

158
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,440
And then at some point they show the Disney World logo and a website.

159
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,080
So and I was like, oh, this is much more recent than I anticipated.

160
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,880
Yeah, I didn't know either when it was from.

161
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,560
And now I know some of the forums in which it appeared.

162
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,660
I'm sure it was on television, but also on some tapes.

163
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
And that might be why we know it really well.

164
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,380
But anyway, let's let it speak for itself and let a famous quote be said.

165
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,700
Here's the full ad anticipation.

166
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,680
Are you sleepy?

167
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,580
No.

168
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,920
What do you think it's going to be like?

169
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,900
Mom says there's even more magical stuff now.

170
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,960
OK, guys, back to bed.

171
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,960
We're too excited to sleep.

172
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:11,600
Imagine how excited your kids will be when their favorite Disney stories come to life on a magical Walt Disney World vacation.

173
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,320
You sleep?

174
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,540
No, too excited.

175
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,640
I heard that.

176
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,780
Big boom, big boom.

177
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,100
Very like old McDonald's ad.

178
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,080
The hijinks of McDonald's and Ronald's and fun.

179
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,040
So, you know, there's all right.

180
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,500
It's a it's a nice little scene at the beginning.

181
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,160
Then you get some good Disney World footage and a website and a dad act.

182
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,680
Look, the parents are fine.

183
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,220
But how much does this dad eat shit to the kid in terms of winning the ad?

184
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He's nowhere close.

186
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,960
Not even in the ballpark.

187
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,140
He should have done that.

188
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,760
Somebody should have directed him to do it like the kid, at least.

189
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, like a little more of a maybe they didn't know.

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,020
Maybe they didn't know what take they had, what magic they had.

191
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:54,500
That's a good point.

192
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,460
I just wanted to give the full context.

193
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,240
But obviously all you need to know about is this.

194
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,260
We're too excited to sleep.

195
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,400
It's almost Gilbert Gottfried.

196
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,180
It is.

197
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,720
Wow.

198
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,340
Absolutely.

199
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:09,780
Yeah.

200
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,720
You know, it's interesting.

201
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,460
The kid didn't actually talk like that.

202
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,080
That was an F.

203
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,700
That was a character that he put on.

204
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,880
His regular voice is totally normal.

205
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,780
I don't know.

206
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,140
I feel like that's a kid saying something in a way only a kid can say.

207
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,780
Like, I feel like that's not a delivery you could prompt someone for.

208
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't think so.

209
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,540
And it's like imagine just like reading the script for that and the copy for that.

210
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,300
And maybe it's an OK ad.

211
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,700
And they did a lot of ads around this time in this style with the little name next to the little mouse ears at the top.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,700
And it's you know what?

213
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,940
We're not just going to show shots of the rides.

214
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,320
This is about the emotion and about like how your kids are going to feel and how their relationships are going to grow.

215
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:51,680
Right.

216
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,620
From you going to Disney World.

217
00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:02,280
There were a lot of these, but none of them have the staying power of this moment, which is absolutely just an organic, weird little kid moment.

218
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:02,900
Yeah.

219
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,660
It's pretty remarkable.

220
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,780
Very iconic.

221
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,580
Out of the gate.

222
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,800
First time you ever saw it.

223
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,180
Well, you want to know, like, did the kid audition like this or did they like say to the kid,

224
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,880
You're going to Disney World tomorrow to juice him up.

225
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,320
And then after the take said that was a lie.

226
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
Yeah, you're not going to check.

227
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:21,460
OK.

228
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,920
I mean, you can go if your parents pay up, but we're not going to ban you from going.

229
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,360
We don't have the power to do that.

230
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,660
You're getting your non-union one hundred and fifty dollars for this commercial kid.

231
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,600
See if mommy and daddy pay up, though.

232
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,460
Technically, it's not look, it's actually for VHS pre rolls.

233
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,740
Those ads are different.

234
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,960
So those rules are different.

235
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,680
So you don't get any from that.

236
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,360
I don't know.

237
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,360
I don't know.

238
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,760
I don't know what prompted it, but just imagine if it's the exact same ad.

239
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,540
All right.

240
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,300
Come on, kids.

241
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,020
We're too excited to sleep.

242
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,780
Nothing.

243
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,880
No one remembers it.

244
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,220
Nobody ever talks about it.

245
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,760
That's what how they would do it now.

246
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,680
I think so.

247
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,420
I don't think they would allow for it's like too weird.

248
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,340
We get more normal.

249
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,960
You get kind of like a more there'd be so many.

250
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,780
There'd be immediately a flood of like twelve identical people like, yeah, we're wondering if we.

251
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,680
I mean, he did create.

252
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,880
He's doing really great.

253
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,560
Yes.

254
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,480
Just note the thing to death.

255
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:26,140
They bring in a kid that was like went to like NYU Junior, like a little acting school in NYU and was like, I am too excited to sleep.

256
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,120
And then they'd be like, that's great.

257
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:28,900
We love that.

258
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,580
It's like, you know, it's John Hartnett, Josh Hartnett's son.

259
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,140
Yeah, of course.

260
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,940
He's like, you know, it's got to be somebody or he's like some or he's some billionaire's kid or whatever.

261
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:49,760
A situation where a director will say, throw it away, which usually translates to like just don't just have a lot of content for the like,

262
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,660
And then like a kid actor who will say, I love that.

263
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,580
Uh huh.

264
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:57,880
Uh huh.

265
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,160
And it's like, well, that's a weird thing for an eight year old to say.

266
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:10,460
Do you think just throwing it away is a good thing to say to a kid because then it gets it could shake them out of their like stiff kid actorness?

267
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,600
We've talked about that in various specials.

268
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,040
Yeah, kids have a mode that and understandably, I'm in performance mode.

269
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,440
I have to talk this way.

270
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,760
I have to be a little robot.

271
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,580
I mean, I take that to mean you say it very dry.

272
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,400
Don't have a lot of inflection and don't make it too funny.

273
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
You know, don't deliver it too much.

274
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,660
So it might be good for a kid actor.

275
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,600
Just throw it away.

276
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,480
Related question gets us off the kid a little bit.

277
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,660
But with you both as esteemed commercial actors, has the direction, just have fun with it ever helped?

278
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,620
It's a very good question.

279
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,000
Just have fun with it.

280
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,320
If it's helped in the sense that it's ever been used, no, for sure.

281
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:04,320
No, because I know you're told this in auditions and I'm I think you're and you're probably like, I only just caught up with what this is.

282
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,440
It is not fun.

283
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,640
It's all jargon.

284
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,280
There is no way for a real human being to have fun with it.

285
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,940
That's just something a dumb person says because they like have seen other directors say it.

286
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,340
If just have fun with it means do whatever you want.

287
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,220
I've had fun in the take, but it's never been used.

288
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:23,680
Yeah.

289
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,240
Yes.

290
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,600
Because it doesn't make sense.

291
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,740
Then you're piecing it together and like, well, I'm glad they all had fun.

292
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,000
It is usable.

293
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,860
I mean, I wouldn't I didn't do like something completely like unused.

294
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,100
I would try to get in the zone of usable.

295
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,180
But yeah, just have fun with it or yeah, do do one like a fun one.

296
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,880
Sometimes somebody would say, hey, let's do a fun one or on this take.

297
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,180
Yeah, on this take, do whatever you want or something.

298
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,020
But yeah, no, not usable.

299
00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:02,000
And if you if you having fun with it takes longer than two seconds, then there's no room for and some comedy premises or choices require a little tangent.

300
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,460
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

301
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,140
It's going to be long and it's probably going to be weird and you're not going to use that.

302
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,860
Yeah, doesn't have a it doesn't fit in a title thing like this.

303
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,340
There are there are videos.

304
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,320
I mean, maybe they've been deleted, but there are videos of me in callbacks.

305
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,500
There's like 10 minutes of just having fun with it.

306
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,800
Thirty minutes.

307
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,440
Jibberish.

308
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:22,900
Yeah.

309
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,920
You're just giving it away and not gotten hired.

310
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,980
Well, I just on some of them I have on the commercial.

311
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,140
The first thing I ever booked.

312
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:37,720
There is a video of me, I think, improvising for twenty five minutes in the room at a second callback.

313
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,940
And there's no dialogue in the spot.

314
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,360
None of the characters say anything.

315
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:51,460
You see my face for about two seconds and they worked me so hard in that callback.

316
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,420
I've gotten it.

317
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,300
Someone's given me a so they're like, we're so sorry you're still here.

318
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,220
Here's a soda.

319
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,120
I have only once or twice been there so long.

320
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,980
I've got a check in the mail because sag rules are such that they're supposed to pay for auditions.

321
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,540
Oh, after.

322
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,060
Yeah, auditions.

323
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,200
It's very rare.

324
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,640
Yes.

325
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,360
They have to really.

326
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,000
Two hours technically.

327
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,580
Something like that.

328
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,620
You have to make sure to sign in and out to indicate it.

329
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,300
But it seems to me then you just got to like suddenly become Charlie Chaplin with the sign in.

330
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:31,280
You have to like, yeah, you know, like then you slip and then the papers go everywhere and there's a mess to clean up and no, no, no, I'll get it.

331
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,640
Yeah.

332
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,040
You make the ink go everywhere.

333
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,260
If you can just like through business, make your audition take longer than two hours.

334
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,720
You just wrote yourself a check.

335
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,320
Sure.

336
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:47,000
They have a person though monitoring that list that a callback very, very aggressively often, not all the time.

337
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,300
Yeah.

338
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,020
So you got to deal with the list.

339
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,420
Meister.

340
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:49,820
Yeah.

341
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:49,980
Yeah.

342
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,860
You would really have to.

343
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,360
They're on.

344
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,500
They've experienced this scheme before.

345
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,540
Yes.

346
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,120
Mr.

347
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,760
Magoo.

348
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,400
Yeah.

349
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,660
Yeah.

350
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,320
Hello.

351
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:57,960
Hello.

352
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,840
It's like a stick.

353
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
You're like hitting around.

354
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,000
I can't see anything.

355
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,580
Whoopsies.

356
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,760
And the person, the list Meister just kind of listlessly ducks right when the game comes her way.

357
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,300
I've experienced this before.

358
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,920
The list Meister went to lunch.

359
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,700
So sorry.

360
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,100
Yeah.

361
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,820
No, we'll sign you out.

362
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:27,620
This doesn't matter because usually now it's just like on a MacBook like webcam, just like doing it from your house.

363
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,040
Yeah.

364
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,740
And I think all I think I can't even book.

365
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,140
I can't book a goddamn commercial to save my life anymore.

366
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,000
I had the hottest streak of all time for a few years.

367
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,380
This is going to be like the Bruce Springsteen Glory Day song where I'm just like, you know what?

368
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,180
There was one year.

369
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,300
GE.

370
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,980
Direct TV.

371
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,000
All state.

372
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,240
Taco Bell.

373
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,560
German beer.

374
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,300
A German beer company.

375
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,260
Only aired in Germany.

376
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,460
I don't.

377
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,420
Well, is this, as you've done before, a message to any ad bookers in their audience?

378
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:01,920
On the Patreon?

379
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,620
On the Patreon.

380
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,680
I mean, yeah, I guess it's possible.

381
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,060
Very hyper specific casting directors.

382
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:07,760
Yeah.

383
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,540
I mean, it's possible, I guess, if you're out there.

384
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,160
No, this is not.

385
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,440
This is not the direct pathetic plea I've made on the main feed.

386
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,140
Yeah.

387
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,420
You need to cast a wide net to do that.

388
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,640
That's on purpose.

389
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,100
Look, let's get back to this kid's glory day.

390
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,380
Of course.

391
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,160
His glory take.

392
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,020
I mean, what have many commercial actors scaled this height?

393
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,000
Is there a more memorable kid line?

394
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,300
I mean, there's been, you know, there's like, there's Where's the Bee.

395
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,340
I was going to say, what are the most iconic commercials we remember in general?

396
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,420
It's like, it's not this for most people.

397
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,320
You have to kind of be into Disney World to know this.

398
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,880
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,200
On a wide scale.

400
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,200
But I but it's it does feel up there to me in terms of quotability, relatability.

401
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,480
I are commercials and this quotable anymore.

402
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,440
Well, it's hard because so many people skip commercials and you got different ways to watch TV.

403
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,400
So I feel like we're not we don't collectively all see the same ads.

404
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,100
This is some this is some monoculture right here.

405
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,200
We're all watching the tapes and seeing ABC shows with Disney World ads.

406
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,820
I watch mostly pro professional wrestling on Wednesday nights.

407
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:24,520
And the ad I see the most is Frank Thomas's ad for something called New Genics, right?

408
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,760
Genics, which is I think a low T like a low T pill or a low T powder.

409
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,780
Yeah, I looked at I read about it.

410
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,320
It's it's all like kind of it's not actually testosterone.

411
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,340
It's all like just vitamins and ginseng and all that.

412
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,120
OK, so it's a natural way to boost testosterone.

413
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,200
It's not some sort of aggressive testosterone replacement.

414
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,340
And they didn't call you in for this one, Mike.

415
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,000
Not yet.

416
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,140
Well, they know my testosterone is still actually pretty high.

417
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,040
Oh, you know, they know they wouldn't people wouldn't believe it.

418
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,040
They know I'm, you know, maybe an older man at this point, but they don't believe that I would have low T.

419
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,980
They like the big hurt, big, big 60 years old, even though he looks great.

420
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,500
And maybe maybe we should doubt that he even has low T because he's a celebrated athlete and he looks great.

421
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,700
So I don't know.

422
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,400
They should have though.

423
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,960
I should have at least been on the callback list.

424
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,900
You can you can play low T.

425
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,160
It doesn't mean you have low T.

426
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,900
You're right.

427
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,060
You're right.

428
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,560
You're right.

429
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:16,960
Yeah.

430
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,460
I looked it up after I saw that.

431
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,360
Were you going to get it?

432
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,000
Well, I was interested in it.

433
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,320
I bet your T is pretty high.

434
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,620
I bet my T is pretty high.

435
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,960
I bet it's high.

436
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,780
When Jane comes on the show, that's to be believed.

437
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,560
Well, don't check the T.

438
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,440
That's a very good point.

439
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,000
Go back and check those episodes out.

440
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,860
This motherfucker's got the highest T on the show.

441
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,060
I guess he puts the T in PTR.

442
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,060
Couple of T's, brother.

443
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,780
So on the commercial, they're like you get it for free.

444
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:03,800
But I think the hook is that they automatically sign you up for a monthly plan because otherwise it's like 70 dollars at GNC or CVS or whatever.

445
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,180
So you can just buy a bottle of a big cup.

446
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,080
Why'd you want to buy this?

447
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,580
I don't know.

448
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,620
Just fucking around.

449
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
But that seems like a thing.

450
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:20,880
I feel like you've complained about people running their powder scams, right wing grifter, and suddenly like, oh, a powder thing, a non-scam.

451
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,080
Let me just run the pricing.

452
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,400
What?

453
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,220
It's a scam.

454
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:23,820
I don't know.

455
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,100
I'm a mark sometimes.

456
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,080
I like to be worked.

457
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,880
Well, you're watching Adster.

458
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,140
They show this during wrestling all the time.

459
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,160
They show it during AW.

460
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,880
There's a line and they like it too.

461
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,400
And she likes it too.

462
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,300
And it's like a lady, meaning like, yeah, and then fuck sometimes.

463
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,000
Sheila, I'm an older man.

464
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,300
That's what it is.

465
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,580
Grow up if you're upset with what I just said.

466
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,720
The powder is good for me too.

467
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,460
I don't have to take the powder to get to benefit from it.

468
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,780
That's the most famous commercial I know at this point.

469
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,280
That's a current commercial.

470
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,840
I'm not saying it's like, where's the beef or I don't know.

471
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,280
To you.

472
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,420
Well, this speaks to the fractional nature of ads.

473
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:05,860
Right.

474
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:12,920
After our imaginations the way this, we've sure done a lot of talk of tea for a dad about a little kid.

475
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,320
Well, there's a dad, there's a tired dad.

476
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,980
Very dry delivery from the dad, by the way.

477
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,160
What were you saying?

478
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,220
I don't care for it.

479
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,260
It seems like an ice cake.

480
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,340
You don't like it?

481
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:22,620
No.

482
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,560
I think it's mostly set up for the daughter to go, I heard that.

483
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,200
How can she hear it?

484
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,280
That's what I want to know.

485
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,780
Yeah.

486
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,900
He says it so quietly.

487
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,420
And she's just full volume as if she's, maybe she's just in the room.

488
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,840
So of course she can hear it.

489
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,560
I guess in that, yeah, with that logic, yeah.

490
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But what a gig.

491
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,820
Lying flat on your back with your eyes closed, delivering the one line.

492
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,460
What a gig.

493
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,280
Jason's dreaming.

494
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,340
That's the analyze, that's like Monday Night Football where you get out the board and you circle things on a play.

495
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,840
If Jason could analyze commercials and how comfortable each role was on the actual day, I would really like that.

496
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,320
Not swimming at all.

497
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,580
Not like me and Hulu.

498
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

499
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:09,720
So if you could do a Twitch channel where you get out the board, like the John Madden board where you can circle on live television.

500
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,740
Or Vanity Fair does these breakdown of scene things.

501
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,060
Yes.

502
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,200
Jason breaks down how comfortable the actor's got to be.

503
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,760
No, no, just a ballpark like going rate for commercial actors at this time.

504
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,500
So if you think about what they're making per hour and they're spending most of that hour in a bed, this guy's got it made.

505
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,280
It's got it made.

506
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:35,040
You see this bus by Commercer Hill, Grandpa here never actually has to sit in the chair, meaning he was in the chair from the start of the shoot till the end of the shoot.

507
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,980
This is a good day for Grandpa.

508
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,700
This would be an A plus role.

509
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,840
Like this would be a I would this, by the way, is a great idea for you to do.

510
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:51,480
And then it's like a Wheaties ad where Wheaties gives somebody the energy to go do a track meet and Jason's like, no, no, no, no, X, X, X, X, X, X, X.

511
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,020
Do not answer this call back.

512
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,280
If you get it, don't get tricked into doing a track and field spot.

513
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,920
The whole spot is him sprinting.

514
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,360
You know how many times he probably had to do that?

515
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,940
At least 15 times because look at all the different shots.

516
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,820
Look at all the different setups.

517
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,060
You can tell it's the same man.

518
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,880
They did not use an extra note.

519
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,760
I use it.

520
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,320
No doubles.

521
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,000
So this would not have been a good day.

522
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,300
He's wearing his own t-shirt and slacks.

523
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,680
Maybe he gets an extra forty dollars for using his own t-shirt and slacks.

524
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,440
That is good.

525
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,340
That would be good.

526
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,800
But that doesn't count for shoes or belt.

527
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,120
It's technically a dry cleaning fee.

528
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:26,680
Oh, yeah.

529
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,040
Now, the dad is and he's covered up by a sheet, which means probably they were not even if they weren't considering pajama pants.

530
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,140
And then he probably just brought his own.

531
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:40,740
What I'm saying is I think he avoided maybe an elongated, you know, like try on fitting day.

532
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,820
So, you know, so it's less time for him and that.

533
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,620
If you can never see you have your bottom half shown, now you're saving valuable time.

534
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,520
This could be the newest, hottest Twitch stream.

535
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:58,500
I thought you were going to say Twitch stream of me sleeping because there are people who live stream them sleeping.

536
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,620
Let's do that, too.

537
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,000
Let's put that together as well.

538
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,280
No, no, this actually is going to be more work for you.

539
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,900
But oh, look, this is a four hours.

540
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,140
He slept on the couch and now he's moving to the bed after he brushes his teeth.

541
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,020
Let's just turn a webcam on in your bedroom then.

542
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,780
I guess if there's a slip, there's a now you got a Truman show it.

543
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's true.

544
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,260
If you need a couch cam and a bed.

545
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,580
Yeah.

546
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:21,820
All right.

547
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,460
Well, either either option is fine for what we're going to do.

548
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,760
OK, let me OK, we can talk about OK.

549
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:37,300
Question one, what is it that makes this particular delivery so compelling?

550
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,940
Is it like is it the way he does it?

551
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,060
Is it the emotion?

552
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,700
Is it the relatability of feeling this way about Disney World or about any vacation?

553
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,440
Any like big, exciting day you got coming up?

554
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,540
Well, here what's really the core of why we remember this?

555
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,280
I would say number one, it's cute.

556
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,820
It's very cute the way he says it.

557
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,900
And you understand it immediately.

558
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,580
You've seen it.

559
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,500
You've done it.

560
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,040
You've said you've said it before to your parents.

561
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,700
I think I've come around.

562
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,840
I do think it's cute.

563
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:16,120
And it's easier for me to think it's cute now having a toddler and like knowing what fun it is

564
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,200
to have a little goober run around saying weird stuff.

565
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,580
Yeah.

566
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,560
I think there was a time where I would have might have been more likely to like make fun of it

567
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,920
because it is strange.

568
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,340
He also does like turn into like a weird little troll.

569
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,720
Yeah, yeah, but I think that's yeah.

570
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,980
And the angle, the angle makes it memorable, too, that it's like this.

571
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,320
It's like facing up.

572
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,040
So like chin is down.

573
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,700
So his face is just like all weird and like he is.

574
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,340
He is this odd little monster.

575
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,080
He's like he's like, who's the guy from the guy?

576
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,000
The kid, the Barney's the character only you like, Barney.

577
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

578
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,640
He's got a fry.

579
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,880
He's got a fry.

580
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,660
I'm Gryff and I got a saxophone.

581
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,740
He's so excited to play saxophone.

582
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,840
He can't he has to channel it through the saxophone.

583
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,180
Just like this kid.

584
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,300
The anticipation is so intense.

585
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,120
He's so excited.

586
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,180
He's like crawling out of his skin.

587
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:12,800
Yeah.

588
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:13,980
Yeah.

589
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,080
Which you really I don't know you feel that's not easy to do naturally, I don't think.

590
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:29,340
But then the other half of it, I was saying, is is is it like we we all flash to when we felt this way or seen people in our families feeling this way?

591
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,120
How much do we relate to?

592
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,860
We're too excited to sleep.

593
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,360
I relate to it.

594
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,980
Yes, especially when I was little.

595
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,180
I knew we were going on a trip there.

596
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:48,540
From the commercial, they've excised the portion where like and also we're going on a plane and there's always a chance it could crash.

597
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,100
You know, there's a little.

598
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,120
Well, yeah, that's OK.

599
00:26:53,300 --> 00:27:00,140
We are going in unfamiliar, less familiar environment, but it's God knows what could happen.

600
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,600
I'm too excited to die.

601
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,880
I'm too excited to die.

602
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,640
I haven't experienced anything.

603
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,480
I've only been excited four times in my life.

604
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,960
This is this is the story of my life.

605
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:25,500
This commercial, this is I whenever I was aware of what Christmas was, my mom is just like you woke us up every 45 minutes that Christmas Eve.

606
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
What is he saying here?

607
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,660
Is saying here?

608
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,520
And she's like, it just like at 545, we just I just got up.

609
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,880
Yeah, I have I think that was me a lot.

610
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:40,720
There's one that my mom will not let me forget because she was in a she was in the choir.

611
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:47,580
She would like perform at masses and she did midnight mass on Christmas Eve, which is a long service.

612
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,280
That's maybe you're maybe not, you know, in bed heading to sleep until 2 a.

613
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,420
m.

614
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:58,260
And that was the year that my sister and I were this ad like, is it Christmas yet?

615
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,200
And five there, my Santa was and she's like, no, no, Santa was.

616
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,520
Of course he was here, but I don't.

617
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,780
And then we didn't.

618
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,020
She just had no choice.

619
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,800
She had to get up.

620
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:15,800
And it's one of those that you have like one thousand of those, I think, that your mom won't let you forget.

621
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

622
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,720
So there's a greatest hits for sure.

623
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,060
The listeners are listeners are aware of like the best 12 to 15.

624
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:30,420
My brain is so my brain fucks with me so easily still to this day about, yeah, with their fear, excitement.

625
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,940
I remember it'll do it with random stuff.

626
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:41,900
I remember in 2011, the night this is no boy, the night before Wilco's, the whole love came out.

627
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,500
I was like really excited to hear it because I like whatever song or two that was out there.

628
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,380
And I remember like waking up in the middle of the night being like, is it out yet?

629
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,220
And like I did a drink that was out.

630
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,060
I'm like, I'm an adult here.

631
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,780
And it's like, that's not that crazy.

632
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,500
And it's not even like they were at their full peak or it's not like it was a follow up to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or anything.

633
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,020
Was it out?

634
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,180
What was when you checked?

635
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,540
I don't think it was.

636
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,620
I think like whatever it was, I don't remember what was a download or what.

637
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,980
And are we in like iTunes store at that point?

638
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,500
You could instantly remember 3 a.

639
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:14,660
m.

640
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,600
on the East Coast, Medina, West Coast.

641
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,540
I don't remember what the details of the release was.

642
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:20,860
I don't remember.

643
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,740
But just like I remember being like, why?

644
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,420
I remember being aware of like, why?

645
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,020
Why am I waking up?

646
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,740
I think I get very, I try to get excited about things, which sometimes keeps me up.

647
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,540
What is that?

648
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,240
Like, papa?

649
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:45,020
I'm very into, I got very into it.

650
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,200
And cards, you know, you heard this?

651
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,800
I was about to say, all right, no further explanation needed.

652
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
And I won't let it derail.

653
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,980
Lorcanapax, I got it.

654
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,780
I'll let it derail a different episode.

655
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,020
But Lorcanah is the new Disney collectible card game like Magic the Gathering.

656
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,040
Like Overpower.

657
00:29:59,680 --> 00:29:59,860
Yes.

658
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,460
You're going to do this now.

659
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,740
I don't know what I'm going to do.

660
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,880
Are we going to play it on mic?

661
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,100
In your late 30s with a child, you're going to start doing Lorcanah.

662
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,380
Let's see what happens.

663
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,120
It's collectible.

664
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:10,980
That's what I mean.

665
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,500
I don't have to play it necessarily.

666
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,540
I can just collect them.

667
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,100
You just put them in a binder.

668
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,820
Put them with my other binders.

669
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,040
This makes me so happy that there are not many things I collect.

670
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,800
I guess you look, you get joy from collection.

671
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
So that's good.

672
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,840
So I, but I just, if I, sometimes I run the numbers.

673
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,140
How much I save a year.

674
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,380
I'm moving right now and I hate these comic books.

675
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,580
I hate them so much.

676
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,700
This does, you have alluded to this, that the main thing, the main stress in your moving is the comic.

677
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,600
Comic books and paperbacks.

678
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,660
Uh huh.

679
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,300
I'm a big.

680
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,040
Your crime novels.

681
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,580
My crime novels and literary novels.

682
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,720
All your Elrond Hubbard tales of valor.

683
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,500
Well, look, you know, I just love adventure.

684
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:02,380
I love space and you know, if I pick up some moral guidance along the way.

685
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,940
Yeah, well, you're there for the story.

686
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,680
You're there for the story, not anything else.

687
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,340
No, no, no.

688
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,640
So, so yeah, I was, I was excited about that.

689
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:19,520
I, yeah, I know this does make me want to, you know, what I have, I was thinking like when, when today do I feel too excited to sleep?

690
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,720
And it's kind of more, it's actually more after the fact.

691
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:30,260
If there's something even I'm excited about the next morning, that's a little more anxiety because I want to be rested for it.

692
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
So that can get negative.

693
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,560
That can be bad.

694
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,020
Actually, I'm more like, if I come back from a, you know, like a great bar hang, we're like, wow.

695
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,000
15 people who are so funny and who I really like, we're all around.

696
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,900
My birthday, you guys are both that.

697
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,580
That was a, I'm too excited to sleep.

698
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,180
And when I need to report to Erin, I'm a little out of it.

699
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,760
I got home and I was just buzzing.

700
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,200
She will sometimes say, you're too excited to sleep.

701
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,980
It is a, it's a really good short.

702
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,220
Erin and I both said it for, she said it separately from me with her sister, any vacation.

703
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,360
It's very like, we, it's definitely always been a, and I feel like she probably said it the first time.

704
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,180
Without asking me, do you know what this is?

705
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,480
I think she just went into it and like, oh, I know exactly what you're talking about.

706
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:22,320
Scott, I feel like when you do, sometimes if you do a funny voice, you're channeling the spirit of I'm too excited to sleep.

707
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,740
Just other voices?

708
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,240
Just when you're, yeah.

709
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,020
If you have to do a funny voice or like your voice acting or something.

710
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,760
You're saying that's the core of all of his impressions?

711
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,280
The spirit of, what's that?

712
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,140
You're saying that's the core of his impressions?

713
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,500
Maybe.

714
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,140
I don't know.

715
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,540
We all have different touchstones and stuff.

716
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,500
But you know, when you hear me do that voice, it's, you just see other things.

717
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,200
You nail it so well.

718
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,040
You do such a good job.

719
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,260
I checked before I got out of the car.

720
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
I was like, let me make sure.

721
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,780
Cause it's got the, it's got the step down.

722
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,780
That's really, that's important.

723
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,320
I saw you looking in the rear view mirror.

724
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,220
Like, what is Ron doing?

725
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,240
I go up with it.

726
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,740
No, no, no.

727
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,540
Now go down with it.

728
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,100
And then I started punching the mirror.

729
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,700
Sorry.

730
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,180
Now that I know you were watching me, I'm really embarrassed.

731
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,360
You're a star.

732
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,120
You're a fucking star.

733
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,920
My knuckles were bleeding for another.

734
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,280
It's just something, it's, I miss my skin is getting thin in my age or something.

735
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,700
It's not because I punched my mirror aggressively.

736
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,240
Look, we all have our process.

737
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,040
You know, we all have different process to pay for recording.

738
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,520
Let's take a big scoop of Nugenics before recording.

739
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,340
Oh yeah.

740
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,020
That's the year it's star.

741
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:26,760
Yeah.

742
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,080
Yeah.

743
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,000
I'm ready to go now.

744
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,160
Jack, I'm ready to go now.

745
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,220
I got Nugenics in me.

746
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,140
I'm ready to go now.

747
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,300
Okay, go now.

748
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,180
There's something, another thing about this, I think.

749
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:42,460
I was thinking how this ad, I think clearly comes from a post Lipnicki era.

750
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,380
Oh yeah.

751
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh yeah.

752
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,980
It's way post.

753
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,240
That's six years after Jerry Maguire.

754
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,440
But, you know, Lipnicki captured America's hearts.

755
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:58,400
And that was, it seems like the appeal of him was he's a natural weird little kid saying weird little kid stuff.

756
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,420
And he's not polished.

757
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,400
He's not Dennis the Menace or whatever.

758
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,020
Not to throw, no offense to Jay North.

759
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,720
But you know what I mean.

760
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,440
Like kids can feel very stiff and staged.

761
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:16,260
And it was, you know, Lipnicki cracked it all open by just going, having fun with it as we said.

762
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,320
Yes, I agree.

763
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:22,220
This is also post Haley Joel Osment, like Sixth Sense.

764
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,440
Which I feel like is the other end of the spectrum.

765
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,620
I was going to say kind of underselling it, like much more reserved.

766
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,640
Well, you're so, so we're cracking open what kinds of kid acting there is.

767
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,500
You know, there's not just one mode.

768
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,660
We're in the wake of Jake Lloyd and the Phantom Menace.

769
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,600
Jake Lloyd, Mara Wilson from Matilda.

770
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,820
That's a few years prior.

771
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,000
That's much prior.

772
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,560
Yeah.

773
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,300
I'm just thinking of notable interesting child performances.

774
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,960
Yeah, I'm not saying she's good.

775
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,740
Where a few years before Winner's Bone, I guess Jennifer Lawrence was pretty older.

776
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,320
Yeah, wait a minute.

777
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,440
We're doing big reaches here.

778
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,580
We're looking more Bill Engvall show.

779
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,800
Happy Dermen from the Pilot of the Munsters had just 40 years prior performed.

780
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,840
Frank TV was on and I bet Frank Kelly played a kid at one point.

781
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,760
Okay, Haley Joel Osment has come up.

782
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,360
Haley Joel Osment is relevant to some greater context that I wanted to give.

783
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,820
We probably saw this ad on television.

784
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:28,560
I imagine this was on television, but the most accessible way you can watch it on YouTube.

785
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,800
And by the way, almost a million views on one of the copies of this.

786
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,920
Clearly the reach of it is massive.

787
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,980
And then also when you Google it, as you guys probably found, there's page after page of Reddits and weird Disney message boards.

788
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:49,640
Bumper Car Boys forums where people are saying, like, I quote this all the time.

789
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,560
My family quotes this all the time.

790
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,580
It's just it is a really good shorthand for especially the Disney trip experience.

791
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,420
Very fond remembrances.

792
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,720
Some message boards from like 2004, 2007.

793
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,560
People trying to find it.

794
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,920
Yeah, yeah.

795
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,460
We're like, is there some is there some website where you can watch old ads?

796
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:08,940
Yeah.

797
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,980
My 2005 friend.

798
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,980
You have no idea what's coming.

799
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Yeah.

800
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,100
Everything.

801
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,860
Most thing.

802
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,560
There's only like three things left that aren't posted.

803
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,680
And even there were getting progress on some of these.

804
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,440
King Koopa's cool cartoon.

805
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:22,960
Yeah.

806
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,000
Somebody just found some old clips of it and I think determined that they were not good.

807
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,040
But at least we have them.

808
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,640
There's some comfort in that.

809
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,740
But anyway, I discovered that there were a couple.

810
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,320
There's probably a number of VHS releases from Disney that this ad was on.

811
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,580
But the most prominent ones, possibly a Beauty and the Beast re-release in 2002.

812
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:52,980
And also in 2002 or maybe three, the main VHS release of Lilo and Stitch.

813
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,680
Stitch, I believe, is that big ogre, the comical ogre.

814
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:56,980
You got it, my brother.

815
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,260
Okay.

816
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,700
Just making sure I have it straight.

817
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,080
But so other things on the this this really paints the picture of Disney 2002.

818
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,860
Here's what else was in the pre-roll on Lilo and Stitch.

819
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,700
Spy Kids 2 Island of Lost Dreams.

820
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,720
Inspector Gadget 2.

821
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,860
101 Dalmatians 2 Patch's London Adventure.

822
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Stitch the Movie.

823
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,320
Already there was Stitch the Movie on the video.

824
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,500
What was Stitch the Movie?

825
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,780
I kind of remember Stitch.

826
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,420
I don't remember anything about it.

827
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,860
I remember it was like a direct-to-video spin-off.

828
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,300
What year is Lilo and Stitch?

829
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,680
The year before, 2001 or earlier in 2002.

830
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,320
Eisner had this thing just cranking.

831
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,740
He cranked these things out, I guess.

832
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,540
Yeah, at this point, he narrowed the gap between the 90s ones and their straight-to-video.

833
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,780
Now they're just ready to go as soon as can be.

834
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:55,440
And then the biggest gap, this is in a world of twos here, there is Jungle Book 2.

835
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:02,100
And Jungle Book 2 was on my mind because I was just flipping through Disney+.

836
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,580
What have I never, and I don't think I remember that there was a Jungle Book 2.

837
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,500
I brought it up because Mowgli is Hailey Jelosment in it.

838
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,840
Elsewhere there's an ad for Country Bears, Jason's favorite film, also voiced by Hailey Jelosment.

839
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,940
He's the king of Disney around this time.

840
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,320
It is nothing but Indian characters voiced by white people.

841
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,040
Of course.

842
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,920
Like who voices the character Shanti?

843
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,300
Ah, Mae Whitman.

844
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,660
Oh, yeah, Mae Whitman.

845
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,380
Just weird details about this movie and just watching it.

846
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,380
I'm like Jungle Book 2, what are you talking about?

847
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,120
And every day, like John Goodman is blue.

848
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,240
That's weird.

849
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,860
That's okay in my mind.

850
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,540
It was fine.

851
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,320
Yeah, that's as good a casting.

852
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,660
And for a straight-to-video thing, solid casting, Phil Collins acts.

853
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,640
Only acts.

854
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,040
What?

855
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,140
One of the vultures.

856
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,720
One of the like, whoa.

857
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,520
Uh-huh.

858
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,460
I guess was around the studio doing Brother Bear, Brother Bear 2.

859
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,980
Yeah, sure.

860
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,680
In Miami Vice, sir.

861
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,840
So that's fun to me.

862
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,380
But then a couple of weird details.

863
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,620
Due to a legal dispute, King Louie could not be included in the film,

864
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:23,040
but he is used as a shadow puppet that recounts the events of the first film.

865
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,220
A legal dispute with Louie?

866
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,360
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

867
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,260
And the Wikipedia had no further information.

868
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,300
Kipling estate?

869
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,560
Like, why would it be?

870
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
I'm not sure.

871
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,400
I feel like there were weird lawsuits with the voice actor Louie Prima,

872
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,040
but I can't imagine that the Louie Prima estate was still holding Disney to the fire,

873
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,060
what, 40 years after the fact?

874
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,060
I don't know.

875
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,960
Or the character himself, if there's any footage of King Louie appearing in a courtroom.

876
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,460
Wow.

877
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,340
So, but King Louie was Christopher Walken in the Favreau version, I believe.

878
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,680
What?

879
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,260
Really?

880
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,000
I believe, right?

881
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
He's a monkey, yeah.

882
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,400
Christopher Walken?

883
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,300
I believe, yeah, because Bill Murray is blue and Christopher Walken is King Louie.

884
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,080
Does he sing?

885
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,880
He does sing.

886
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,560
Yeah, he sings this song.

887
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,440
That's strange.

888
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,880
I will admit I liked it when I saw it.

889
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,420
Yeah, you were a big fan of that.

890
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,260
Now, maybe I'll go back and I'll not like it, but I did like it at the time.

891
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,500
I went to pave the way to Lion King.

892
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:22,720
We wouldn't have Lion King and Mufasa prequel without, so we owe it so much.

893
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
That's true, we do, yes.

894
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,380
But here's the main thing I wanted to bring up about Jungle Book 2.

895
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,520
You hear that and you're like, oh wow, that shit, and they were really cranking it out,

896
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,320
and Eisner's really like, boy, this is so cynical.

897
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,880
Here's the thing, Jungle Book 2 did come out in theaters, by the way.

898
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,920
I had no idea.

899
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,260
And the numbers on this.

900
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,140
Budget, $20 million.

901
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,920
Worldwide profits, $186 million.

902
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,820
Oh my God.

903
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,860
You laugh at Jungle Book 2, like crap, they're pumping out.

904
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,720
That's unbelievable numbers.

905
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,660
For today?

906
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,800
Yes, yeah, yeah.

907
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,980
Like, okay, you know, one of Disney's quote unquote hits of the summer,

908
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,040
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

909
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,140
Budget, $291 million.

910
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,220
Made 381 worldwide.

911
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,900
So it made, Indiana Jones made 1.

912
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,280
3 times its budget.

913
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,400
Jungle Book 2 made 9.

914
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,500
2 times its budget.

915
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,640
5 times its budget this year?

916
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,580
Barbie.

917
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:39,320
What we view as like the biggest hit we've seen in the recent past is just currently barely above a Jungle Book 2.

918
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,100
Pure ratio wise.

919
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,700
I would say that the cultural impact is perhaps a little bit more on Barbie.

920
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:54,580
But like Disney would fucking, you know, if they would like, if somehow like sniping customers in the theme park,

921
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,860
like if somehow, right, if we sacrifice 20 people in Disney World today,

922
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,680
that will get us a hit the size of Jungle Book 2.

923
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,220
Get the guy up on top of Cinderella Castle.

924
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,380
What you're telling me is very clear.

925
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,080
What the lesson should be here, bring back Eisner.

926
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,880
Of course, obviously.

927
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,620
Bob is a public enemy number one these days with his shitty comments left and right.

928
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,160
His arrogance, time to bring back a man.

929
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,140
We trusted.

930
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,060
Arrogance free.

931
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,120
Who undoubtedly.

932
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:34,660
Now look, I will say this, there was a big writer's strike during the Eisner era.

933
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,620
I don't know any shitty things he said.

934
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,360
Maybe there were less opportunities to say shitty things.

935
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:46,580
But like as opposed to Eiger, who has famously shitty things, a couple rounds of them.

936
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,760
No, a good trustworthy man who we certainly is not absolutely greedy.

937
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,540
Saying shitty things, but also apparently very touchy and emotional.

938
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,120
That's the rumors that Zaslav and Eiger are like hurt by these labor strikes.

939
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,940
Yeah, that's what came out a couple days ago.

940
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,140
We worked hard on the deal and they said no, they didn't even look.

941
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,860
Yeah, so they were.

942
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,920
Did you see which this one number went up barely?

943
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,800
It's been a tough year for us.

944
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,100
We haven't had any Jungle Book 2s.

945
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,920
We'd give you the money, but we don't have a Jungle Book 2.

946
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:39,240
I think really this spate of labor actions has really shown that these heads of these companies,

947
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,440
you really go like, what do you do?

948
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,920
What do you contribute, you freaks?

949
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,580
Well, I don't know, Zaslav is staring at it.

950
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,100
He's like, here's one of my properties on a screen,

951
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,600
and then there's a paper telling me about another one of my properties.

952
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,460
What if I put that one on that one?

953
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,460
I own CNN.

954
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:06,180
What if CNN Alert was in the middle of you're watching Treasure of Sierra Madre on TCM on Macs,

955
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,380
and then it says, guess what, Giuliani's getting sued.

956
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,920
Giuliani's being weird again.

957
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,900
Look, Bob Iger, California Adventure, people didn't like it, so he said,

958
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,020
oh, let's build some good rides.

959
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:19,960
That's smart.

960
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,240
That's a smart thing for him to do.

961
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,560
No one else could have thought of that.

962
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,400
Build some cool stuff, make it look better.

963
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,460
Are you kidding me?

964
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,300
I couldn't have thought of that.

965
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,260
I was like, this park, just level it to the ground.

966
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,080
I think the wheels started moving on that when Eisner was still in church.

967
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,180
Yes, you're right.

968
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,620
For the Cars Land stuff?

969
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,200
No.

970
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,040
No, that's all Iger.

971
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,520
He was out in 2005, 2006.

972
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,580
I think he was ready to let that thing rust.

973
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,540
But you know what, he was right.

974
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,940
He was probably right, because he's smarter.

975
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,540
He's a good guy.

976
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,280
He was a yo.

977
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,240
In some way, we'll figure out how, but it was correct that Eisner made California Adventure bad.

978
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,500
Yeah, if he was in longer, we would have seen the full plan come to fruition.

979
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:03,900
As with God, it is hard to know all of the divine reasons, but we have to trust.

980
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,460
We have to trust them that we know what they were doing, what was right for us.

981
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,440
He needs to come on this GD show and talk to us.

982
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,220
We don't say that full word.

983
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,360
Not when we're addressing God and we love Eisner.

984
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,120
Right, exactly.

985
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,360
That's why I said it.

986
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,440
Okay, so that's bigger context.

987
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,380
What have I missed about the…

988
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,180
Oh, I got a big one.

989
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,660
Okay.

990
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:33,520
So, we were saying how this maybe is not as magical without the natural…

991
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,880
Whatever happens to make that kid just actually be excited in that moment, really be fit.

992
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,660
You're thinking, well, okay, the same ad without that moment maybe is not as magical.

993
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:55,220
And then I realized there is a practical way to prove that because almost essentially the same ad was made in England,

994
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,080
I guess, trying to get people to…

995
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,480
more aimed at Disneyland Paris.

996
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:05,820
And I discovered this through some confusing Reddit threads and such where people…

997
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:12,820
There's the discussion of, does anyone remember this ad where it's like a blue glowy room and there's a kid who's too excited?

998
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,260
And then they say, here is a link to that ad.

999
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:22,200
And they say, no, no, no, no, it's a different one because it has the word mum in it.

1000
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:22,620
Oh, wow.

1001
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,200
So, there's discussion of, is this a Mandela effect?

1002
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,900
Am I making up that there was this?

1003
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,500
And I had to find a video on Twitter, in fact, to prove that the British one existed.

1004
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,280
So, here, listener, it's almost the same thing.

1005
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,560
It's almost shot for shot.

1006
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,160
It's a blue glowy room and a brother and a sister.

1007
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,920
But does it have the same magic?

1008
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,320
Same ending.

1009
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,020
I guess it was for Disney World in that period.

1010
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,120
Is that as charming?

1011
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,120
It is pretty charming.

1012
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:20,840
It's pretty charming.

1013
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,220
It's very British.

1014
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:22,940
Yeah.

1015
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,480
I mean, these little British kids doing this is really good.

1016
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,060
I really like it, but it doesn't have the moment.

1017
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,380
Look, I don't dislike the children.

1018
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,880
Yeah, you can say you don't like them.

1019
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,420
But Aaron and I, maybe we're too excited to sleep-pilled or something.

1020
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,280
But we were both like, I don't care for this.

1021
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:42,620
Really?

1022
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,400
I don't care for these British imps.

1023
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,200
Oh, I'm too much of a sucker for a little British kids doing like talking and stuff.

1024
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Mem says it's better than era.

1025
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,820
They're doing too many, they're inserting too much, it's too British.

1026
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,620
They cranked the British up.

1027
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,460
You could tell the director was saying, more British though.

1028
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,640
Fit more vows in.

1029
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,820
I wish they were like, it was like a period piece.

1030
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,920
It wouldn't make sense for Disney World, but I wish it was like the Kenzian era.

1031
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,260
And like shaking snow off their pajamas, even though they're inside.

1032
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,460
Kid had a crutch.

1033
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:15,800
Yeah.

1034
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:20,520
Oh, and then in that wind, because he, look, he gives a little more, that's context for the listeners.

1035
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,240
He doesn't fall back into bed like American Kid.

1036
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,720
He gets up and does a little spin.

1037
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:35,440
So if that was him getting to throw his crutches away, Tiny Tim style, the excitement of Disney World has cured him of his rickets.

1038
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,360
I want to go time traveling to Disney World, Mom.

1039
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:48,040
Mom says, Mom says we're going to get in something called the time machine and we're taking it straight to somewhere called Orlando.

1040
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,720
Weeeee, 12.

1041
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,060
Yeah, that would be better.

1042
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:52,580
I agree.

1043
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,840
But yeah, it's not as good.

1044
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,920
But I still, I like, I do like this.

1045
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,040
The dad's kind of made a meal of the line.

1046
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,040
This guy?

1047
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,940
Yeah, the dad did not make a meal of it.

1048
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,880
It was too long.

1049
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,880
I feel like the note would be like, can you say it twice as fast?

1050
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,440
You're like the American dad better.

1051
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:14,580
Because it's short and sweet and then it's mostly set up for the punchline of like, we heard that.

1052
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,600
But here's this, here's this thought.

1053
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:24,580
The British dad is kind of, he seems to be more comfortable in the bed, in my opinion, because he's on his side, which is how I like to sleep.

1054
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,020
And the American dad is more kind of on his back.

1055
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:28,740
Yeah.

1056
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,800
And like this guy looks like he could even be like out.

1057
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,480
He's so like comfortable looking.

1058
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,140
Okay, that makes a little more sense.

1059
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,760
He's almost half asleep.

1060
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:41,220
So that means he's like soaking that cash.

1061
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,900
Much better day.

1062
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:51,160
And for Jason's channel, we got to determine like what is the, I don't know, like dollar to pound in 2002.

1063
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,120
I don't know who's like making better money for their lying down.

1064
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,120
Right.

1065
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:56,880
Yeah.

1066
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,800
Which nation of dad made out more like a bandit here?

1067
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:02,800
Yeah.

1068
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,800
I'm a left side sleeper.

1069
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:12,140
And which I think they say is good for you to sleep on your side, sleep on your side as opposed to right side.

1070
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,720
Really?

1071
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,400
Why is that?

1072
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:13,840
I don't know.

1073
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,420
I think it's where the heart is to sleep.

1074
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,000
You have to sleep on top of your heart.

1075
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,500
Well, no, but it's elevated.

1076
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,100
If you're sleeping on the right side, you don't want it to be elevated.

1077
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,100
It's working less hard.

1078
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,260
You're saying I think so on the left.

1079
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:26,960
I don't know.

1080
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,520
I toss and turn a lot.

1081
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,380
Sometimes back, sometimes left, sometimes right.

1082
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,400
It never gets to rest.

1083
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,500
No.

1084
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,060
Jason's heart is restless.

1085
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,380
I've got new genetics.

1086
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,820
I've got like days worth of new genetics coursing through my veins.

1087
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,440
I'm too excited to sleep.

1088
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,380
I can't sleep.

1089
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,640
I'm drinking too much ginseng.

1090
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:53,680
I watched your new genetics down with Arizona iced tea, green tea.

1091
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,940
Testosterone went straight to my heart.

1092
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,950
Made it heavy.

1093
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,980
Just have so much love to give and testosterone.

1094
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,060
I'm the heart of podcasteride.

1095
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,170
My heart has to be pulsing at all times.

1096
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,780
The pressure of being the heart and putting the T in PTR.

1097
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,940
If we're also picking these ads apart elementally,

1098
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:25,920
something to note that you, Jason, mentioned before we started recording is that it goes straight from iconic shot to excited asleep.

1099
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,480
To what's our hero shot?

1100
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,980
It is the barnstormer.

1101
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:36,940
It is Goofy's plane roller coaster in the Toontown Fair area.

1102
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,100
And Goofy is on it.

1103
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,240
He's on it.

1104
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:40,840
So that's good.

1105
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:49,640
But does it not strike, did it strike you, Jason, that there, then the hero shot is a ride that's like fine.

1106
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,260
Right?

1107
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,060
We've never talked about the barnstormer.

1108
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:56,900
Well, I think that's one that it's like, OK, it could be a kid's first roller coaster.

1109
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,540
I think it's elevated by like, OK, you're riding it with Goofy.

1110
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,180
For sure.

1111
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:07,740
By the way, I think now that coaster is called the barnstormer starring the great Goofy.

1112
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:15,040
Because all of that stuff is circus themed now because of the big Dumbo, which as we all remember Dumbo,

1113
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,140
they make the circus seem awesome to be part of the circus.

1114
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,740
Yeah.

1115
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:20,980
It rules.

1116
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,400
It's very true.

1117
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,180
Terrifying at all.

1118
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:31,780
You also, then the next shot is like a bunch of kids all doing like duck walk, all like wagging their duck tails

1119
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:35,980
as they head into the castle behind Donald and Daisy.

1120
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:36,520
Yeah.

1121
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,480
This is a bigger area I hadn't thought about.

1122
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:48,160
But when I, to this day, see Disneyland, Disney World commercials, I think that there is a real false advertising going on

1123
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:55,460
in that they imply that you will get to like be at a party, like dance and have fun with your favorite characters.

1124
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,300
This does not happen.

1125
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,500
This is not an organic duck walk that you get to do.

1126
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,240
You might get a hug you'll never forget.

1127
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,360
But besides that, there's not organic party fun happening with the characters.

1128
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,160
Not often, but once in a while.

1129
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:26,540
Because like, you know, famously I've talked about going to the Tomorrowland stage and seeing the country bears partying with everybody and just hanging out.

1130
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,320
Slapping asses.

1131
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,700
Slapping asses, yes.

1132
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,860
And you welcomed it.

1133
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,620
They got towels?

1134
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,620
May I have another?

1135
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,160
They're rolling up the towels.

1136
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,860
There were towel slapping incidents with the country bears in Tomorrowland.

1137
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:37,480
That's correct.

1138
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,480
Being in a locker room.

1139
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,060
I want to feel like I'm in the locker room.

1140
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,780
They're dirty frayed country bear towels.

1141
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,100
Yeah, they're regs.

1142
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:44,880
They're nasty.

1143
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:45,840
Oh, so that hurts.

1144
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,540
That leaves a mark.

1145
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,220
They're weapons.

1146
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,400
Like, yeah.

1147
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,380
There's some welts from that.

1148
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:57,340
Yeah, security confiscated their zip guns and their homemade guns from the hauler.

1149
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,260
It'll happen.

1150
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:04,960
I mean, at the ticketed event for the retro 80s night, we certainly were dancing with totally many for like an hour.

1151
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,620
But it's not a common thing.

1152
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,480
That at this point seems like one of the most formative experiences of your life.

1153
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,620
Well, it's right before the pandemic too, so it's the last bit of joy.

1154
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:21,700
So every so at the at the depressing height of it, you're just you fall asleep and go straight to like, Mike, dance with me.

1155
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,860
Holding out her hand.

1156
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,920
I have a video of it.

1157
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,660
Yeah, yeah.

1158
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,560
Lindsay too.

1159
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,320
She's okay with it.

1160
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,400
She knows we have something special.

1161
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:40,500
Mike imagining like walk around Max and Roxanne from Goofy Movie and throwback 80s gear, dancing to Obsession.

1162
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,200
My obsession.

1163
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,920
They're doing the robot.

1164
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,780
They're joining hands and doing break dance moves.

1165
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,580
We're all drinking tab.

1166
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,260
It's a glorious night.

1167
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,060
Yeah.

1168
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,840
Well, what have we missed about this?

1169
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,280
What have we picked apart?

1170
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,040
Every elemental detail of this 30 second ad.

1171
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,400
Did we do the voice enough?

1172
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:10,420
It's only about nine seconds, 10, nine, 10 seconds of the parks.

1173
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,040
It's mostly the scene.

1174
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,480
That's something that's interesting format wise, isn't it?

1175
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:21,100
It seems like about halfway through it switches and then it goes back to the back to the scene.

1176
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:26,200
They felt the narrative was too important versus just showing glamour shots of the park.

1177
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:35,380
Do we think that this is effective and an interesting idea to like not just like maybe you feel like you're being advertised to when you see shots of rocks?

1178
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:42,320
But when you get to see the emotion, when you get to see like this is how it might make your family feel.

1179
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,660
This is your if you have if you have several children, they will bond over this.

1180
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,440
There's something there's something heartstring pulling about it.

1181
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,080
Yeah, it does capture the anticipation element.

1182
00:55:54,180 --> 00:56:03,020
I am surprised over 20 years later, they have not got the kids back as adults to shoot.

1183
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,280
Doesn't that seem like that's a good idea?

1184
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,560
Because the optics are like not great for Disney right now between the writer's strike and then like the parks are so crowded.

1185
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,580
The parks are empty.

1186
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,000
The parks are so expensive.

1187
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,540
Yeah, and all their other movies are fucking suck shit.

1188
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,540
I have no idea.

1189
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:23,600
I have no idea if they've had a run of hit movies or run of box office flops.

1190
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:23,880
It's hard to tell.

1191
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,040
I really can't tell.

1192
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,460
I just know Barbie made a billion dollars and everything really.

1193
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,860
You show a clip of that and then like get them to recreate it.

1194
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:42,920
I mean, that's the you know what one thing if you're looking at this episode title, you're like maybe like, oh, did they learn where the kids are today?

1195
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,800
No, there's no way to find that out.

1196
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:45,620
I tried.

1197
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:46,460
I'd like to know.

1198
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,300
And I hope that the kids are doing well.

1199
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:52,440
And I would like to see this kid milking it.

1200
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:58,000
I want to see him at a convention getting to say we're too excited to sleep and everybody.

1201
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,840
I want twenty thousand people to light up, say it with him.

1202
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:11,460
I mean, I want everything that's this this guy if he's not like maybe I should I like I'm not a publicist, but I feel like I've got a good.

1203
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,620
Oh, I thought you were going to say I'm going to pretend to be him.

1204
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,120
Wait, sure.

1205
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,940
Well, what does he look like?

1206
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,520
Can I fake my way through?

1207
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,140
I don't know.

1208
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,020
It's a dark kid.

1209
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,640
I don't think I resemble this kid at all.

1210
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,740
I don't think it matters though.

1211
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:27,920
Yeah, maybe just by putting it out there, I'll just side by side.

1212
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,720
I think you just feel like you're walking up to my table and like glancing.

1213
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:32,240
All right.

1214
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,580
Him picture him picture.

1215
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,380
Yeah, sure.

1216
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,080
You know what?

1217
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:36,600
Yeah.

1218
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:44,720
They just don't want to believe that it's me so badly side by side you now with that kid, but then put the same blue filter on it.

1219
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,000
And I just fool people into thinking.

1220
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,640
Well, and I just always like myself really blue.

1221
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,660
I get that's my writer for when I can appear at a convention.

1222
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,980
I need the bluest light.

1223
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,000
Right, right.

1224
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,680
And you'll do anything like in the contract.

1225
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,860
This is how many times you'll do the line and how like it.

1226
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,080
Well, like you'll do it only five times for a certain fee.

1227
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,180
Jason will negotiate this with you because.

1228
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:05,740
Oh, yeah.

1229
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,900
So help me penny.

1230
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,580
I'm going to squeeze everything I can.

1231
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,520
John Madden, Katie Porter, White Porch drawing.

1232
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,540
Here's here's here's the plan.

1233
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:16,100
We will.

1234
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:16,380
All right.

1235
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,040
They're going to want to see you in context.

1236
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,520
They're going to want to see you in a bed.

1237
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,820
Right.

1238
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,620
So we wheel in a bed.

1239
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,900
That's also part of your writer blue lighting.

1240
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,540
And you do it all from a bed.

1241
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:29,000
They were like, we'll they put a microphone right above your head.

1242
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,020
Put it on a stand.

1243
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:30,740
Get it above you.

1244
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,580
You don't get out of it.

1245
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,020
You literally don't get out of bed for less than fifty thousand dollars in appearance.

1246
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:43,080
And then as opposed to all these other people at conventions who have to walk around for steps cost money.

1247
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:43,780
Yeah.

1248
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,400
Yes.

1249
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,780
So here's your price for autographed picture video of you saying I'm doing it.

1250
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,200
You know, we we got we got a big menu for that.

1251
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,640
We do want to let the Brits in on this.

1252
00:58:55,700 --> 00:59:03,020
So he will say mum for a price you can't if you grew up with the British one, but he will not get up and spin that car.

1253
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,660
We're talking a two hundred grand appearance fee if he's going to do a spin.

1254
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:12,480
And that price will be tacked to the current exchange rate.

1255
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,180
So the dollar is better.

1256
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,140
It's pounds better.

1257
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,200
That's what they're paying.

1258
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:16,620
Yeah.

1259
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,420
We even if this is happening in nine years, we're locking it in its best rate right now.

1260
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:20,760
Yeah.

1261
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,760
I just want to tell the listeners because this is paywalled.

1262
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,140
So just don't don't tell on us.

1263
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,180
Don't tell on Scott about the grift where we're about to pull.

1264
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:28,920
Yeah.

1265
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:29,640
Yes.

1266
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:39,800
Because you can be you know you can be you can be you're in on the ground floor like I you know I listen to this guy when he was just doing a podcast and I didn't even realize that he was we're too excited to sleep.

1267
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:40,100
Right.

1268
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,460
He's so humble honestly that he didn't bring it up.

1269
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,980
In six years.

1270
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:44,340
Yeah.

1271
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:47,160
Because I if that were me I'd be talking about it all the time.

1272
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,880
And now he's finally getting rich off it.

1273
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,040
And I said good for him.

1274
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,360
Honestly good for him.

1275
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,740
So yeah all all few thousand of you please lie.

1276
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,600
Help us.

1277
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,260
Please help us.

1278
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:56,780
Please.

1279
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:09,900
I like the line so much and I think I appreciate this ad a little bit more having a kid having a little boy myself.

1280
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,440
And I was like I wonder if I can get.

1281
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:12,440
A little bit.

1282
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:24,680
And you know hey I'm not holding him to the impression skills that I might hold an adult to but I was like well this sound like coming out of my son I don't think I don't know if he's ever been heard on the show before.

1283
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:25,200
Yeah.

1284
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,220
But here's here's my little boy.

1285
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,720
To a side this week.

1286
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:32,880
Oh wow.

1287
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,320
That's adorable.

1288
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,580
Naturalism you can't you can't buy that you know you can't coach that.

1289
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:43,380
I think I forgot I only I did it this morning and hadn't really re listened and that.

1290
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,340
Hey that made me feel.

1291
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:45,680
You shit.

1292
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,000
It is really.

1293
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,880
I'll get him to do it in an English accent.

1294
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:50,940
No British.

1295
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,500
That's too cockneyed.

1296
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,200
Do it like a current British kid.

1297
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,220
Get your accents straight.

1298
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:55,820
Wales.

1299
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:01,480
I suppose that is all I think you survived podcast the ride the Sego gate.

Okay so I was trying to think of what I want to do for my birthday shot and I was trying I was like oh I alluded to like oh the islands of adventure lighthouse and then I started.

1304
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:48,700
Come I started thinking of other things and I narrowed it down to five and I was a guy who's of islands of adventure huh.

1305
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,500
Outside of islands of adventure.

1306
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,140
There's more islands of adventure.

1307
01:01:53,040 --> 01:02:06,840
I so I narrowed it down to five as Mike said the phrase Jason month at some point and I was like well if I had a program what would I do and then I was thinking I started thinking of other topics and then I decided like well why don't I do something different.

1308
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,440
Why don't I get the listeners involved why don't I make it a party.

1309
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:14,300
Oh my gosh a party a party a voting party that's right.

1310
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,040
I chosen five topics.

1311
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,500
Oh my god we're doing it.

1312
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:33,620
Shot poll if you're not on club three it's polls every month where the listeners get to pick get to submit and pick topics but this is this will be a rare second gate second and club three poll okay yeah we'll get to get that if you're close to yeah yeah right.

1313
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,620
Okay so here are the five potential birthday shot.

1314
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:42,440
Ferros lighthouse is one of them island skipper towards the short question.

1315
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,060
I have a question.

1316
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:50,660
Okay.

1317
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:55,720
I learned about the original lighthouse is based on one of the wonders of the ancient world.

1318
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,180
We know that.

1319
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:57,500
Yeah.

1320
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,420
Did you know it before this year.

1321
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,420
No the answer is no.

1322
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,820
I knew there was a lighthouse and the wonders of the ancient world they didn't know.

1323
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,480
Okay.

1324
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:12,940
Ferros lighthouse island skipper towards the short lived boat ride that would take you from port of entry to Jurassic Park.

1325
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,980
Holiday Inn's holodome.

1326
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,500
Do you know about the holodome.

1327
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,800
This has been suggested for the second gate before.

1328
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:26,600
This is a good yeah I've never looked into it deeply but what is what's the quick sell on.

1329
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:37,020
So the quick sell on this these were holiday inns with internal courtyards built around like an indoor pool and like shuffleboard or mini golf.

1330
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,860
And I think there's one or two you know they're not how they ends anymore but they're kind of still holding on.

1331
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:43,360
Okay.

1332
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:50,740
I think having room doors that close to an indoor pool I think some of the criticisms where this is disgusting.

1333
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,420
Yeah.

1334
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,600
That's still indoor pools create just the worst stench.

1335
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,080
Yeah.

1336
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,560
But okay great.

1337
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:58,920
Yeah.

1338
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,120
Number four.

1339
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:07,660
This is an episode I'm calling forgotten cartoon theater which are another podcast.

1340
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,600
No no.

1341
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:16,480
So they were going to talk about it shows that I loved as a little kid that I feel like I've seen very little.

1342
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,020
One example.

1343
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,600
We're talking James Bond Jr.

1344
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:26,020
Has come up for BOTS master which notable for Aviarad.

1345
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,160
Is that how you say Aviarad.

1346
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:31,100
Aviarad produced this like kind of.

1347
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,520
And we're going to do all of these cartoons or just one.

1348
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,160
We're just going to touch on them.

1349
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:34,780
Okay.

1350
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:35,500
So.

1351
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:35,980
All right.

1352
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,960
That was also that was bold to say Aviarad.

1353
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,080
No further information.

1354
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:40,740
Aviarad.

1355
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:43,960
He produced a lot of the 90s Marvel stuff.

1356
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,700
He rescued Marvel with like Pearl Mutter because he owned Toy Biz in the 90s.

1357
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,760
So if he's a friend of Ike then he's a guy.

1358
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:50,500
Yes.

1359
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:51,640
They're all buddies.

1360
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,940
I think he permanently has to have a producing credit on all the Spider-Man movies.

1361
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:56,840
Oh wow.

1362
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,920
There's a recent conversation with Bugman.

1363
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:00,340
Yeah.

1364
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,840
Aviarad is good.

1365
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:09,600
And then the final choice of the 1996 made for Fox movie Generation X.

1366
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:10,880
I know what I want to talk about.

1367
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,280
Based on the Marvel comics.

1368
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:18,300
Matt Fruer is in the I don't even remember what character he plays but he's like the star of it.

1369
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:18,860
Yeah.

1370
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:26,380
Fox in the late mid late 90s made a bunch of like event made for TV movies.

1371
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,600
There was a Nick Fury.

1372
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,960
David Hasshoff one.

1373
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,500
They also did a Doctor Who one.

1374
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:32,640
Which I.

1375
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:33,480
American Doctor Who.

1376
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,620
American Doctor Who.

1377
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:34,980
Interesting.

1378
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,220
So yeah.

1379
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,660
So that there we have it.

1380
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,580
So I will put this.

1381
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,660
I would like to add a sixth choice.

1382
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,120
I don't know if you can do that on.

1383
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,660
We made Jason take new genetics for a month and we check in and see how he's doing at the end of the.

1384
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,940
That's the episode for your birthday.

1385
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:52,380
Well thank God only as five.

1386
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,800
I'll pay for the new genetics.

1387
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,640
I think they have more than five.

1388
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,600
I think you can keep going.

1389
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,160
No choice.

1390
01:05:59,340 --> 01:05:59,420
Yeah.

1391
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,100

1392
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,240

That all of those sound like a lot of fun.

So thank you for all those options.

1396
