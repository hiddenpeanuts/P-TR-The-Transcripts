1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,480
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate hosted by three guys who consider themselves

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,880
the Kevin Stewart and Bob of podcasting.

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,560
You can distribute those however you like.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,400
I don't know.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,720
I'm Bob.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,560
Sure.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,400
Bob's the cute one.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,440
Bob is the teddy bear.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,280
Jason's Bob.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,960
Jason jumped at being the cute one.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,800
Yeah, it's a cute one.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,640
It's me.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,480
It would be me.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,320
That would be me.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,160
A cute one, me.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,040
One of them is specifically tall.

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,600
I believe Kevin is tall.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,440
Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,040
And Bob is cute.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,120
And what's the other?

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,440
What's the attribute of the other one?

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,600
The strongest one for Stewart?

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,040
The strongest attribute that is?

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,880
Big cock?

26
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,720
Pigeon.

27
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,560
Pigeon.

28
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,520
Yes, judging by some fan art, some art online.

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,000
A healthy urethra?

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,840
Yeah.

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,160
The healthiest urethra of all the minions?

32
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,000
Mm-hmm.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,840
Yeah.

34
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,520
That's what you can imagine to yourself.

35
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,240
There's kind of like the water zone in this area we're talking about today.

36
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,480
And I think one way to make it fun is to imagine that it's a bunch of minion pee.

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,320
Yeah, it is.

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,640
That you're seeing urethral gush.

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,480
Yeah, urethral gush.

40
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,920
Three things I regret in the first minute.

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,720
Yeah, no, it's really off to the races.

42
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,760
That was, of course, a callback to the main feed episode,

43
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,120
recent urethral discussion on a main feed episode.

44
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,040
Check it out.

45
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,960
Which was different than the one where we talked about what part of Optimus Prime

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,960
is his prostate, right?

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,840
Oh, right, right, right.

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,040
Which a tailpipe versus, yeah, where did the tailpipe go when he transformed?

49
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,240
We are.

50
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,920
Look, this is just like some conversation

51
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,880
some quick stop employees would be having on the day they weren't supposed to be there.

52
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,520
You know, that's just what happens to us sometimes.

53
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,240
No, no, no, hear me out.

54
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,960
Hear me out.

55
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,480
Yeah.

56
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,840
The tailpipe is Optimus Prime's prostate.

57
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,520
Right.

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,880
This is what this is.

59
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,440
Sub in Jason Lee and Stanley and put in the game, me and Peter Cullen,

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,560
voice of Optimus Prime, where I'm asking them about Optimus's tailpipe.

61
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,360
And then and then put in us, but like looking wretched decades later,

62
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,960
looking just like unreal horrible.

63
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,400
And then and then even for more of those for another two decades.

64
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:39,960
Imagine it somehow not not having received any of the benefits of digital face clean up.

65
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,440
Imagine that.

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
Oh, my goodness.

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,880
This is it's strange that we got off to this point,

68
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,320
because what I wanted to do here in talking about super silly fun land,

69
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,440
which is the Minion, the Despicable Me, like kids area at Universal Studios, Hollywood.

70
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,120
I wanted to get into this because of recent really fun experiences with my son,

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,160
because now I am deep into going to theme parks with him.

72
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,520
Yes.

73
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,640
And I especially we're pretty late on this now.

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,560
But, you know, Christmas break, I got to slow down a little bit

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,360
and go back to all the parks that I hadn't been to for a little while

76
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,880
and do it with him in an age where he's really appreciating it, heading towards three.

77
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,560
And that's why I wanted to talk about it.

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,560
But here, you know, how do you mouths and potty minds?

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,120
You were the one who said the lewd thing and got off to the races.

80
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,000
So I'm just saying you wanted it to be wholesome, but you started me off.

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,640
I'm the one who talked about Stewart.

82
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,440
You opened the dirty forbidden door.

83
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,840
Yeah. And I stepped through it willingly.

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
Yes. But I'm just saying I would have been happy to keep this thing wholesome.

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,440
Stewart's attribute.

86
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,800
And I guess this is where I reveal because you you said right before we recorded,

87
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,960
we're not really familiar with this franchise.

88
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,640
I actually really like all of these.

89
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,440
Oh, I made an assumption.

90
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,320
Why did I assume that? I don't know.

91
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,600
The OK, that's good.

92
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,640
Well, I was watching earlier today.

93
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,800
I was watching Minions Rise of Gru.

94
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,960
I have not. I had to come here.

95
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,880
I've got 15 minutes left because I know the time.

96
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,320
And I also see this is the listeners maybe know what happens.

97
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,160
And Jason doesn't.

98
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,080
You're hearing you at a really precarious point of Gru related peril.

99
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,280
There's a big you know, they're all saving.

100
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,400
Kevin and Bob and Stewart.

101
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,920
Otto is showing up. Otto gets a lot of play in this.

102
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,320
I don't think I knew about the Minion Otto.

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Mm hmm. Is he new to that movie?

104
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,520
Sorry. What's that?

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,640
Is Otto?

106
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,280
Was he been in the franchise the whole time?

107
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
He's me.

108
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,560
I it seems like he's got a lead.

109
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,880
Like it seems like he's been bumped up.

110
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,480
Oh, OK. So he was a breakout in one of the earlier ones.

111
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,080
I guess so.

112
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,520
And now he's like shining on his own in a way.

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
Not in his own movie, but I the only the other one.

114
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,560
I haven't seen Despicable Me three.

115
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,600
These are also looking up for this.

116
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,960
I was interested to learn that.

117
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,880
OK, if you want to get caught up,

118
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,400
Despicable Me one and two are on Peacock.

119
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,920
Despicable Me three is streaming nowhere.

120
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,120
Good. It makes sense.

121
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,440
Why would you want that streaming anywhere?

122
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,200
Minions Rise of Gru is streaming on Netflix.

123
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,600
And I believe Minions again, streaming nowhere.

124
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,840
Oh, a wonderful world that we have built.

125
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,320
A wonderful world we live in.

126
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,120
This is really where just either for the kids,

127
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,560
buy the DVDs or go to your local library.

128
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,920
I have what is going on.

129
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,640
Yeah. How do we we have like so, you know, a movie from the 70s,

130
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,120
whatever, the cult following that's what the but we're just we're dropping

131
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,880
despicable, despicable or falling into black holes.

132
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,120
Yeah. What is our where is our culture at?

133
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,320
There's going to be a different despicable on each streaming service.

134
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,600
I think in the future, there'll be a because we're all licensed.

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,240
Everything's being licensed out again.

136
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,080
Everyone's not going to keep their stuff in house on their own streamer.

137
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,400
So I think, yeah, like to be you'll have despicable me to and free V.

138
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Is free V the same as to be no.

139
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,040
No, V is the is the is the former IMDb.

140
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,480
OK, so the despicable me rise of Gru will be on free V.

141
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,120
And then the third one you'll have to I don't know.

142
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,800
It'll be a sort of a treasure hunt to find on something else.

143
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,720
We share custody.

144
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,680
All the streamers share custody.

145
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,240
Yes. Of America's children, the minions, the minions. Yes. Yeah.

146
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,840
Well, this is I'm glad to know this, that you are if I've never watched

147
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,480
one of them all the way through, I have to admit this.

148
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,960
Mike, where were you at with?

149
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,280
I've seen like one and half of the despicable,

150
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,200
which I think are fine.

151
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,320
I wasn't a despicable me one and a half.

152
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,000
This is not like Lion King.

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,040
You're not saying you've seen one and a half.

154
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,640
No, I haven't seen.

155
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,040
No, there's not like a Cinderella twin.

156
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,320
No, that's not a one and a half. Right.

157
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,680
Well, Lion King was the only one that was the one.

158
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,600
I think it's the only half besides naked gun two and a half.

159
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,200
Right. Yes. No, no, I know.

160
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,960
As far as I know. Yeah, I know.

161
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,440
I've seen a full one.

162
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,520
I believe the first one.

163
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,680
And then I've seen some of the second one.

164
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,760
Well, I hate to correct you, but did we see one together?

165
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,880
Yeah, I I know we saw a screen.

166
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,160
I saw many, many years ago.

167
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,920
I got an invite to a screening of minions,

168
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,360
but this took me to the second one, the Arclight.

169
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,600
And I had a guest passes and I took Mike and Nick, our friend Nick Weigert.

170
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,480
Oh, yeah, that's right.

171
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,880
And you thought of Weigert.

172
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,800
I thought of Weigert.

173
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,240
I forget why he has associated himself with the minions.

174
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,720
How that even began.

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,440
But I have that association.

176
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,080
But we saw the directors.

177
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
We saw Pharrell.

178
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,680
Pharrell was wearing his big hat.

179
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Delighted. Yeah.

180
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,880
Pharrell there in the big hat.

181
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,040
Oh, my God, I completely forgot this memory.

182
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,320
Thank you for reminding me.

183
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,840
I thought that was the first one.

184
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,120
This is crazy.

185
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,280
We saw the big hat, which the big hat is the thing, of course,

186
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,960
that sent a stone to Jason in Las Vegas into a giggling fit.

187
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,600
Mentioning Pharrell's big hat when he was like at the height of being stoned

188
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,440
at this bachelor party in the German beer hall is what sent him

189
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,280
spiraling out of control with laughter and then made him have to leave.

190
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,960
I somehow forget that detail, despite this being a five timer.

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,680
I might call it a 15 timer.

192
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,320
Very true. But I think this one is OK because it was a very specific detail.

193
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,720
I wasn't retelling the story.

194
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,680
The big hat made you laugh.

195
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,800
Yes, because there was a guy on stage, a guy on stage who had a big hat on.

196
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,760
And he had a witch like a witch hat or like a big hat sort of thing.

197
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,000
And it was kind of I think was sort of animatronics

198
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,840
was like kind of moving around a little here and there.

199
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,560
And from like a quarter block away,

200
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,320
like it was a big beer hall and a little stoned and a little stone is not

201
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,040
a really like we should probably tell the story.

202
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,320
Troublingly, yeah.

203
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,560
Which later on recently, I kind of did the math and I was like,

204
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,400
oh, that was probably like that was a corner of a cookie,

205
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,680
but it was probably like a hundred milligram cookie.

206
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,880
And I probably had 25 milligrams.

207
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,280
And I don't know what the what that means.

208
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,120
Well, Michael, the average that I would do would be five

209
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,000
and five milligrams on like a square of chocolate, five to ten.

210
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,360
They make a hundred milligram cookies.

211
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,680
That would that's like an elephant tranquilizer.

212
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,440
Yeah, that's right.

213
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,720
OK, some people with very high tolerance.

214
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,520
That's true. Take that much, you know.

215
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,360
OK, well, I find out the next day that only Mike can attest.

216
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,840
I was the next day like Jason, that hat was not moving.

217
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,760
Oh, no, that was clear.

218
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,320
It wasn't big either.

219
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,440
We regular had maybe smaller than regular than regular.

220
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,200
Well, I think the other thing that was unclear

221
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,240
and I don't think I ever got an answer on this.

222
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,600
It they were kind of the way they were moving.

223
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,960
It's like, are they lip syncing?

224
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,040
Is this like cover band playing?

225
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,680
Yes, I think that people were lip syncing.

226
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,280
That's what we were trying to figure out at the time.

227
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,680
Like there was a lot of weird bits going on.

228
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,200
So like it definitely contributed to unreality issues. Right.

229
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,000
And so but Jason was not laughing when we saw that we were very impressed

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
to see the directors of Despicable Me and. Yeah.

231
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,640
For real.

232
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,000
No one was laughing when these

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,040
giants of the industry came into the room.

234
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,560
Yes, exactly. And this was at.

235
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,960
We bowed is what we did.

236
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,400
Of course. And this was at AMC Burbank. Yes.

237
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,640
No, it was at the Arclight.

238
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,360
Just solid. Yeah.

239
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,440
That's how tired I am.

240
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,600
That's how wiger I think you all were still at funnier.

241
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
My memory is wigered and say over there.

242
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,720
My memory is wigered and say a word to us.

243
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,520
Well, put those things together.

244
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,920
If you experienced a full day in front of your day.

245
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,480
That's true. You're right.

246
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,480
I. We're in the crank at the viral crap factory.

247
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,640
Dead inside. Yeah.

248
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,480
As opposed to the joyful wiger, we know.

249
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,120
Of course.

250
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,280
Boisterous.

251
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,000
Um, well, this boy.

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,360
So you got some of that despicable magic.

253
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,560
I you got you got banana dust.

254
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,680
By the way, you really can't pretend I'm like a huge fan and I forgot.

255
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,440
Yeah, I saw the movie and then saw the director and the guy who wrote Happy,

256
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
which is the biggest song.

257
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,160
Wow. That's crazy.

258
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,280
But you remembered his name.

259
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,120
If you were like the guy who wrote Happy, what's that guy's name?

260
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,480
Yeah, no, I know that Neptune's I know what they did.

261
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,600
I love the Neptune. Of course.

262
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,520
You know, that's part of this this area.

263
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,760
I might as well say, well, so we'll hear.

264
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,320
OK, big picture stuff.

265
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,560
This is all this is this kids play area.

266
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,960
That is next to the Despicable Me Minion Mayhem ride.

267
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,640
You better believe that's its own episode.

268
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,520
You know how, yeah, of course.

269
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:56,760
And I part of me is wondering if another separate episode is the big minion.

270
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,880
Of course it is.

271
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,560
Yeah, of course. Of course.

272
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,280
Why would you even why would you use the words?

273
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,440
I think. Yeah.

274
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,320
Yeah. Right. Language in your mouth, Scott. Yeah.

275
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,760
I mean, there's also Minions Cafe.

276
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,880
Uh huh. Which I'm not prepared to talk about.

277
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,640
I'm not prepared to talk about that.

278
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,000
I mean, there. Yeah, I like it.

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,200
But you're not prepared to talk about it.

280
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,560
I've not eaten there in a while.

281
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,000
OK, I like the neon sign a lot.

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,920
But it's very cute.

283
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,600
And worse. And you think there's going to be more to say than all what was just said.

284
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,040
Oh, I didn't. I'm not saying necessarily anything.

285
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,280
I just I just think it's funny Jason's not prepared.

286
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,960
He's feeling but he has eaten there.

287
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,200
It's outside the you.

288
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,960
OK, that's a good point.

289
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,000
That's a good point.

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,600
If we're talking about what's in the gates, because it's it's big medieval type gates,

291
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,480
but all of it striving for a very specific location in Despicable Me one.

292
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,760
Yes. In the first one.

293
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,960
It is like a seaside amusement park.

294
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,200
And they they recreate they they made it look like a pier.

295
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,880
They put they put wood planks down on the ground.

296
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,240
And I hadn't seen again, again, my familiarity.

297
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,840
I don't know why my familiarity with this franchise is so low.

298
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,440
I've just I've never made it a priority.

299
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,760
I'm sure I'm sorry.

300
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,720
And you never is your child tried to watch it or you just haven't shown it.

301
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,920
He really likes a minions trailer on a Thomas the Tankin.

302
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,320
Oh, you mentioned this. Yes.

303
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,240
Yes. And he laughs a lot at them from that likes when he sees one.

304
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,440
Delighted to see them at this place when we go to this little land.

305
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,400
Yet tried full movies and does not care.

306
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,520
It's very strange.

307
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,920
He wants them in trailer form only.

308
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,040
He's kind of like his dad.

309
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,000
You know, I'd rather watch a bunch of trailers than watch him.

310
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,600
Sure. Yeah.

311
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,680
Some collections of the shorts on Netflix.

312
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,040
There's a few.

313
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,920
And those are our fun little show.

314
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,120
I mean, I think the thing that's odd about these

315
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,360
movies like the first one has a lot of heart.

316
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,040
It's about like people building a surrogate family.

317
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,720
But then there's also the minions and they really want bananas

318
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,440
and they slap each other like the three suges a lot.

319
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,800
And they're always getting up to mischief.

320
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,200
So they kind of counterbalance the unit

321
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,800
lest things get too mushy with the heart.

322
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,680
Sure. They they muck things up and keep you on your toes.

323
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,520
Yeah. Right.

324
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
And I guess I understand them.

325
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,720
Jason, you like to speak of a franchise more than the Shrek franchise.

326
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,760
Do you think I was I actually was thinking about that today?

327
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,440
So yeah, and I was I think I have not seen a Shrek in a while.

328
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,920
Yeah, I've seen these more recently.

329
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,800
Yeah, I don't know.

330
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,280
I mean, I think they're both kind of products of their times.

331
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,560
If that makes sense.

332
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
But yeah, maybe.

333
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
OK, I mean, the minions are cute.

334
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,800
What was it? What happened in circa 2010 that led to the rise?

335
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,760
How is it a product of the 2010s?

336
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,440
Oh, well, that song Happy, the other song for the first movie.

337
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,600
It having a song that's in it.

338
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,120
The song that's just called Despicable Me, which last time

339
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,600
a couple of times I was at Universal.

340
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,400
They play a lot. Yeah, that's in this area.

341
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,200
And it's also in the front areas before you're even in the park.

342
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,160
You are pretty inundated by this.

343
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,960
It's it's in there with ET theme and Jurassic Park theme.

344
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,360
It's now this this song, which is is fine.

345
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,560
It's so lodged in my I never pulled it up on Spotify or anything,

346
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,840
but it's so just from being in this park.

347
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,360
I'm having a bad day.

348
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,800
Well, I guess I don't know beyond that.

349
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,560
Despicable Me.

350
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,680
I guess one thing I like about this area is I do consider it to me unofficially.

351
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,240
It is Pharrell land because, oh, there's such a strong presence in the music loop.

352
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,560
Yes. And which I like, I'm a big Pharrell fan, as I would say.

353
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
I love all those Neptune songs.

354
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,760
He's like still like making hits for like 25 years.

355
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,440
This guy and I love I love a ton of them.

356
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,760
And I like some of these minion songs for sure. Yeah.

357
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,200
Happy is so ubiquitous.

358
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,000
It's hard to even like think of it as a song at this point.

359
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,240
It's just such a it's like a billboard.

360
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,320
You what? And by thousands of times, what does the wind sound like?

361
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
That's sort of when happy is playing.

362
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,680
It's like it's an element part of the earth.

363
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,720
It's not a song. It's just yeah.

364
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Fire, wind and happy. That's right.

365
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,040
But I but then there's other what there's a song Fun Fun Fun that is very nice

366
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,520
and that is genuinely a part that it's something that I like about being in this area,

367
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,280
because that's a great song, not just because it has the Beach Boys title.

368
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,520
I like it of its own. Right.

369
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,080
Sure. Sure. Its own volition. Oh, sure.

370
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,080
One, though, that it's a really strange.

371
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:02,120
I think I think it's all music from Despicable Me 2 is what I looked up

372
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,320
because there's this CeeLo song that is Pharrell produced.

373
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,280
That's also very lovely and retro. And oh, yeah, yeah.

374
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,480
But and but then you get a bunch of disco.

375
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,120
You get like boogie fever and then you get YMCA

376
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,200
Twist sung by the minions.

377
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,560
And then one thing that's just very it's just jarring when you figure out what it is.

378
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,880
And this is the only one I feel like I might have to play a hit of.

379
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,440
But just know that there is a place in theme park world

380
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,000
where you can hear a minion cover of I Swear by All for One.

381
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,720
Have you heard this? I haven't heard this.

382
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,880
When this creeps up on you, standing in the line for the little spinner ride

383
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,680
or in the gift shop, you just really like is that.

384
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,640
Am I hearing what I think I'm hearing?

385
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,960
I don't know the context of it in the mood.

386
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
Do you know? Do they sing it in the movie?

387
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,960
I yeah, I think it's like a gag.

388
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,400
I think they're singing it to someone.

389
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,160
I forget who I will say when we saw that Q&A,

390
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,800
I specifically remember them chalking up some of the like big success of these movies.

391
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,720
Is that like, OK, one of these directors is

392
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,760
American one is French.

393
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,760
So they kind of meld both sensibilities.

394
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,000
And then the other thing is like the minions speak in like occasionally

395
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,360
there's a real word or a real phrase and then it's a lot of gibberish.

396
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,040
Honestly, one of my notes so far for Rise of Gru, too much, too much English, too much.

397
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,120
They're cheating a little.

398
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
They're cheating a little.

399
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
I don't like that.

400
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,160
They also have started saying Perfavor, which is a little more interesting.

401
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,080
Like I don't I'm not sure where the minions picked up Spanish.

402
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,520
So sort of the height of that joke of the main the joke of the minions of their

403
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,240
speeches, having them sing like a very sincere ballad.

404
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
Yeah.

405
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,480
Which I have not heard. That is good. That's good.

406
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,000
That's plenty. Do you stand in that that this land for half an hour?

407
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You're going to hear it.

408
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,800
It's not the longest music loop.

409
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,600
Yeah, it's better than like I really I recall because my the the

410
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:38,440
the universal the the tram like break patio is like you could hear the Back to the Future loop.

411
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,840
That's what it was when I worked there.

412
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,640
They all back to the future days, don't I feel?

413
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,000
But I it like I think there was I think it was the score and I think it was the two

414
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,400
Huey Lewis songs and that was it.

415
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,080
Yeah, if you are working in a in a theme park zone where there are only three songs,

416
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,600
they could think which is ridiculous for Back to the Future because you could get

417
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
it.

418
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,400
And now I failed to produce an example.

419
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
What's the song at the dance?

420
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Well, you need to be good or angel.

421
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
There you go.

422
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,080
You need Earth Angel and Johnny B. Good and then double back the ZZ Top

423
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,480
song that Van Halen's is a Van Halen song is he playing in the in the Walkman?

424
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, is it like a rupture or something?

425
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
I think that might be right.

426
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Yeah.

427
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,840
And there is plenty of the instrumental ZZ, the Western ZZ Top.

428
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Oh, yeah.

429
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Do do do do do.

430
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Yeah.

431
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,080
What a failure to not include that in the loop.

432
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,160
Is there a bit of Mr. Sandman in the diner?

433
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
There should be.

434
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
Mr. Sandman is in the movie.

435
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Yeah, in the movie.

436
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Oh, no.

437
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,280
And it's the audio cue that you're back in the 50s.

438
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Yes.

439
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
When you go back in part two.

440
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
You know, it's funny.

441
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
I just had this thought because I was I'm trying to figure out if I'm going to take

442
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,200
my parents to the Disneyland throwback night next month.

443
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,880
Like it goes back like and then I'm like, but then does that mean all the good rides

444
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
are closed?

445
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,600
Does that mean like if it's throwback night, I don't know if Star Wars land is going to

446
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
be open.

447
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Do you know what I mean?

448
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,800
Why would they not open?

449
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,440
That seems crazy to me.

450
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,520
It seems a little crazy, but they do like certain parts of the park will be closed since

451
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,800
it's like mostly just for like the old fireworks and big band stuff.

452
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,400
And I'm like, well, which tell me what rides are going to be open.

453
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,960
Also, there are a list.

454
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Sometimes there's a list.

455
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
There's usually a list.

456
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
I just haven't found it yet.

457
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,520
The one they did a couple of years ago.

458
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,200
And Mr. Sandman was being sung on Main Street by like a barbershop quartet or it wasn't

459
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
dapper dance.

460
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,240
It was some other thing and they had like a little like bell thing they were playing

461
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
as well.

462
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,880
And I was like, this should be in Universal.

463
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
That's true.

464
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,200
This is universal stuff.

465
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,720
They got their diner over there, although even that's not like it's not Mel's diner

466
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
anymore is it?

467
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,120
Yeah, I don't think it's.

468
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,320
Wait, there's no it's a movie theater.

469
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
There was a Mel's diner.

470
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Is the Mel's in Orlando still?

471
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Or did that go away?

472
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
I think so.

473
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,280
I think they're both still.

474
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
I don't.

475
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,720
Is there a Mel's diner anymore?

476
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
I don't think in Hollywood.

477
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
No, I don't think it is.

478
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
Oh, I.

479
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Yeah, I don't know.

480
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Honestly, I don't know.

481
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
I should know.

482
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:10,240
Yeah, it's that is very close to this minion zone where I've been many a morning.

483
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,280
Sincerely, let me say I like this.

484
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,880
This place that I would have glossed over completely in the absence of a child.

485
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Suddenly, I'm like, this is a it's a it's a wonderful play.

486
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,080
I would say to any parents listening and whenever you start going, Mike, it spends some time.

487
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,520
Here the here the I swear.

488
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,120
Do you think and enjoy just like early, early morning Universal, which I will say has no

489
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,220
magic like Disney has.

490
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,640
It's not you know, you get there first thing in the morning and everybody says there's

491
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,120
no magic.

492
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,600
But I have really fond memories now of when my son's main interest was just pushing chairs

493
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,000
around and touching trash cans through ample opportunity to do those things at this place.

494
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,340
One time a great memory was him pushing a chair just through a busy thoroughfare to

495
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,560
try to show a minion like somebody.

496
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,200
Oh, you're going to impress a minion.

497
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

498
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:14,080
I know how to really get my hero's attention to this loud scrape like in front of people

499
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
and in front of busy workers.

500
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

501
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,600
The minimum like job interview.

502
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Yeah, yeah.

503
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,280
That is something that the minions would do.

504
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,440
That is like that's right on on game.

505
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,920
Scott's raising a little minion.

506
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,280
Guys, boy, let me tell you something about a toddler.

507
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,080
It's like having a little minion.

508
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,240
They aren't yellow, but otherwise.

509
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,020
Yeah, same thing tolerates bananas.

510
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,020
Not his favorite.

511
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,080
Oh, we just got we just that was the first thing we gave our daughter.

512
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Are you getting in?

513
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Yeah, getting into solid food.

514
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,720
So not unrelated to the minions, but banana.

515
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,840
Not because you're not fostering a particular minion love.

516
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,000
No, not yet.

517
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,800
If it happens, if it happens, it happens.

518
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:03,320
But you know that I like I'm saying it just there's like a subtle charm to this area.

519
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,260
And I do associate it with emptiness.

520
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,900
There might be times where this land is very crowded.

521
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,080
They're very well could be.

522
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Yes.

523
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,760
My experience has been all right, we're going to go early in the morning.

524
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,160
We've got to beat crowds and we obviously aren't rushing down to Jurassic or Transformers

525
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,040
of those things because he can't go on those things.

526
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,960
So we've we're kind of like, well, I want to be universal, but what do we do?

527
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,440
And then we go over to this area and realize that the ride is not the one ride is not open

528
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,960
till an hour later.

529
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, so it just becomes kind of this just it's really it's just like an empty place for like

530
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,600
we've spent a bunch of time there and we're the only two people walking around.

531
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,160
The land is open, but the ride is not.

532
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,880
And you just get like I guess maybe this is why people love the grass.

533
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,080
It's why they love the although the grass, I think grass is stroller parking.

534
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,800
Is that is that become officially true?

535
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
I think so.

536
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,200
OK, well, we'll adjust this more officially soon, I think.

537
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
OK, OK, sure.

538
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,400
We got to get back down there and check this new grass out.

539
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,540
We got a whole new grass.

540
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:10,800
We may just call the episode Toontown grass and then kids and parents at a move and all

541
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,160
the other stuff is a different episode.

542
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,120
We put our like put magnifying glasses to it, like walk around like Winslow and ski.

543
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,640
I'll pick a little piece of the artificial grass and we'll go and study it in a lab and

544
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,640
see what the chemical makeup of it find out what it's made of.

545
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,640
You got a safe.

547
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Could a child lick this?

548
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
That's right.

549
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,840
The grass to JPL in Pasadena.

550
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,920
We set it in the jet propulsion lab to examine.

551
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,280
Could you grind this up and use it as jet fuel?

552
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,560
If so, it should not be eaten off of.

553
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,040
But anyway, I just like it's it's been very nice memories of walking, having this like

554
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,880
calm space to just listen to Pharrell and let the kid run around.

555
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,320
And it does have a thing that is pretty rare to find in theme park environments, which

556
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
is just a park.

557
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:04,400
There's just a little park there, just a dopey little like set of legally cleared slides.

558
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Nothing that's hurting anybody.

559
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Yeah, there's a playground, right?

560
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,000
There's a little play area.

561
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's nice.

562
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's nice to see it.

563
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

564
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,840
It doesn't always work for my kid because he does require absolute emptiness in any

565
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,600
playground environment.

566
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Working on that.

567
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Don't know if it's cool.

568
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
I hear that.

569
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I hear that.

570
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Yeah, yeah.

571
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
That might never go away.

572
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,880
But I don't know.

573
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:34,120
There's just like I appreciate just having those basics for kids.

574
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,480
And I appreciate that it looks so much like the environment in the movie.

575
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,120
Yes, that entrance sign is really perfect.

576
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,840
But then there's been the question, you could tell that the designers of the place had the

577
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,000
question, but how do we pack this place full of minions?

578
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Because that scene in the movie has no minions in it.

579
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,720
So it becomes, well, it's this environment we know from the first movie, but the minions

580
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,240
are wreaking subtle havoc all over the land.

581
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,260
There's lots of minions to see if you were, if you're doing a spot the minion counting

582
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,960
type game, plenty to see all around this place.

583
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,720
Yeah, this would be very exciting because this would be a place that I, as a kid, I

584
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,800
would have been, the theme park in the movie, I would have been very excited the idea that

585
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,120
there was even any version of it available.

586
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,600
And it does look like the stuff in the movie by and large.

587
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,720
Yeah, it looks really good.

588
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,520
It's a really good translation.

589
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,400
So yeah, when you just add in more minions, you can't go wrong.

590
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,440
It's the only thing it needed.

591
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,500
And it's fun little tableaus, you could tell they're like, they're blowing things up or

592
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,560
they're trying to add splashes of paint, but the paint spilled and good little clear, you

593
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,080
know, in the lineage of Mark Davis, good little area.

594
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
Look at that.

595
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,320
I know exactly what's going on.

596
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,020
It's like no words needed.

597
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,500
There's so much, I was actually just, I found some listicle thing of, I think they were

598
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,200
video game theme parks.

599
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,920
So we've done a fake theme park, Final Four, they're video game theme parks.

600
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,380
And I was like, oh man, all these things look great.

601
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,680
And then I was doing, going through other things, you know, which in Scratchyland and

602
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,080
I was really like, as we wind down Simpsons, I assume we're winding it down in the next

603
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
few years.

604
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,200
Wouldn't we have wanted Itchy and Scratchyland over Krustyland?

605
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,880
I get why, I understand why, but wouldn't have been better if it was Itchy and Scratchyland.

606
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,240
Yeah, that's a tough thing to do.

607
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,880
Now you're getting into, it's kind of a fake Disneyland.

608
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,840
I don't know how you do a mini version of it in a way.

609
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,160
Yeah, but I just want to see some of the things from the episode.

610
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,000
And like, I guess what I'm saying is I'm like, oh, this is exactly what is in there and it

611
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,600
fits because, you know, it fits the theme park from the IP, whatever fits.

612
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,960
But I was like, oh man, if it was exactly though, as I was thinking about it.

613
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,440
I mean, it's a lot of the same jokes and it works and I understand why they did it, but

614
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,640
I would have been a little more excited if it was just like shittier.

615
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,960
Yeah, boy, that makes me feel old being like, being there opening week of the Simpsons ride

616
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:03,000
in 2008 because I was working across the street in the Vivid building.

617
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
For Vivid?

618
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
No, I wasn't working for Vivid.

619
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,600
I was working for- Oh my God, what a six year reveal that Jason worked for Vivid.

620
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,960
Jason was- No, the-

621
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Pornography.

622
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Jason was a pornographer.

623
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,440
He didn't know until now.

624
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Vivid owned the building and then rented, like only used the top floor or so for offices

625
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,960
and then rented everything else, everything else out for temporary office space.

626
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:34,500
So I was working on like a string of dog shit reality TV show, like writer's strike filler.

627
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,560
Like the writer's strike was well over by that point.

628
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,280
But they'd already committed to the crap.

629
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,400
Yeah, they are already committed to all of these shows.

630
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,720
Can you call one out?

631
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,720
Yeah.

632
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,680
Are those bridges free to burn?

633
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:53,360
I think the one that people actually did like was called Tabitha Salon Takeover, which was

634
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,360
a spin off of a different haircut show.

635
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,680
Tabitha, I don't even know that I know that title.

636
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,840
Well, she was a big star on the haircut show, I think.

637
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
The haircut show?

638
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
Whatever the haircut show was.

639
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,960
Big star on the haircut show.

640
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,560
But like, are you smarter than fifth grader?

641
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,080
Sheer genius seems to be the haircut show.

642
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,880
This is five seasons on Bravo.

643
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Really?

644
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,560
The haircut show?

645
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:25,720
I just remember what was the someone had a picture of themselves.

646
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,560
One of the production people had like, you know, some pictures of other shows they had

647
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,720
worked on.

648
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,800
And one of them was them on the set of what was Fox News's first attempt at a late night

649
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
like Daily Show?

650
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,360
Oh, the half hour comedy.

651
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,720
Yeah, the half hour comedy.

652
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,960
I was just like, oh, that's chilling.

653
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,120
I'm seeing this because it had already bombed by that point.

654
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,080
But yeah, I was like, they're like, all right, half day, nothing going on day.

655
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,560
And I was like, well, I'm going to Universal to check out this Simpsons ride.

656
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Wow.

657
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Wow.

658
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,280
That's like 15 years ago.

659
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,680
It's like 15 years ago.

660
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,440
And now it's like, well, it's probably wrapping up before the 20 year anniversary of it.

661
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,400
Do you wish it was itchy and scratchy land?

662
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,680
I can see where you're coming from.

663
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,440
Well, I mean, they, there's a not so much.

664
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
You get the doves.

665
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,440
Yeah, you got the beer garden.

666
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,880
You got the quickie mart and like, but like the seven doves wandering like they're, they're

667
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,080
in the topia, the topia areas.

668
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
Yeah.

669
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
But I don't know.

670
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,040
I was just like thinking about how much, how satisfying it would have been if it was like

671
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,400
the Simpsons version of them recreating something really on a full like Disneyland parody in.

672
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,160
I know it doesn't, I know it doesn't make sense.

673
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,320
I mean, I did it interesting, but I was like, oh man, that would have been cool.

674
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,080
Anyway, we'll never have a Simpsons ride again.

675
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,360
But we will have never, I can't imagine Disney building a new one.

676
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,200
No, there's no, we've stuck with this before.

677
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,760
There's no way it's not going to just be like maybe walk around characters at like a special

678
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,560
DCA night.

679
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:05,400
I think that's the best we've had since as established a while back, the ice capades.

680
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:11,000
I think something that was at the ice capades in 1990 will now be at Disneyland in 2025.

681
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,640
That's my guess, but I hope to be proven wrong.

682
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Yeah.

683
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,240
Something that like local car dealerships would do with like knockoff cups in the early

684
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
nineties.

685
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Yeah.

686
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:30,800
You know, um, here's a little site related to universal IP and, uh, and lands and commitment

687
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,640
to properties.

688
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,800
Here's something I didn't realize.

689
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,280
Well, this is stemming from, I discovered that the, the ride, which I'll talk about

690
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,560
in a minute, the ride is called silly swirly.

691
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Oh yeah.

692
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,680
It's their Dumbo equivalent.

693
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:50,440
And I was surprised to learn that this same ride is in universal Beijing opened a couple

694
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,720
of years ago.

695
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,120
Uh, that makes sense.

696
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,720
There's a little, it's not called, uh, this, it's not super silly fun land, but there's

697
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,280
a little, little minion land.

698
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,960
Um, but then I was like, boy, I don't know a lot about universal Beijing.

699
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:11,320
And did you guys know that this park that opened in 2021 not only contains a new iteration

700
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,600
of the water world live spectacular, it's an entire land.

701
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
Water world is a land in this.

702
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,960
Oh, I guess I didn't, I did not know that that's, I mean, I don't think it's like a

703
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,600
particularly robust land.

704
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
I think it's its own land.

705
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,720
Cause what else do you pair water world with?

706
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,760
But it is the stunt show, sorry, the live sea war spectacular and a restaurant.

707
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,000
They like, that seems so insane to me that in 20 you think like, well, water world or

708
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,320
a megaton bomb.

709
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,160
And then like, no, no, no, there is a water world restaurant.

710
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
Wow.

711
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
It's an entirely new premise.

712
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:52,480
It opened it opened in 22 that are open during the COVID.

713
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Just like the Mariner.

714
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,240
Now you can just drink a big cup of piss.

715
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:04,040
What beverage is, what other beverage could you have?

716
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,320
It's like butter beer.

717
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Yeah.

718
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,840
It's their specialized beverage.

719
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Costner piss.

720
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Wow.

721
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
This is so excited.

722
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,080
Did you look at the menu?

723
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,400
Can you decipher it?

724
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,760
The menu seems pretty like nothing.

725
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Chicken sandwich.

726
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,600
I went to the official website and there is this, which I'm going to read the, uh, the

727
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,480
restaurant is called drifters Cantina.

728
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Wow.

729
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,760
It is massive.

730
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,440
It's a big footprint and the vibe, you know, with it's kind of like rustic tin shack sort

731
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,000
of deal that in striving for the water world aesthetic, but plus food, it kind of just

732
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,640
looks like a Joe's crab shack.

733
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,640
Wow.

734
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:46,000
Post-apocalyptic barely posted like the day after the apocalypse.

735
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,240
That's kind of like what the one in San Diego behind the convention center looks like.

736
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,680
It reminded me of that so much.

737
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
Yeah.

738
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,320
I don't know if you've heard of it, um, drifters Cantina and I will read the little plot of

739
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
it.

740
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,600
Like the opening of the world.

741
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,880
Please see where it's been taken.

742
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,800
Using, using whatever washed ashore leftovers from a distant past.

743
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:12,720
The local at holers have constructed a truly welcoming and unique dining experience dive

744
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:19,920
into our seafood basket drifters catch and homemade fried chicken.

745
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,240
I don't like homemade because you'd like to think that chicken is a, a, a being at some

746
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,840
point that what you're, but when made, I guess made as means prepare.

747
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
You know what I mean though?

748
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,520
Does that not imply bizarre fake chicken?

749
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,400
Oh, I actually made interesting.

750
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,920
I've never thought of it that way.

751
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,160
One thing, but anytime that anyone says like homemade or handmade, I don't like it because

752
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,240
it makes me remember that somebody's like hands had to be involved.

753
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Yeah.

754
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,600
I want it to be made by some sort of machine.

755
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,040
I like the handmade detail.

756
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,400
Like a very nice restaurant.

757
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Well sure.

758
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,200
But I mean, I'm just saying that, that phrase or that term.

759
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Oh, sure.

760
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
You're just picturing the hands.

761
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,800
That's why I don't want to think about hands touching all my food.

762
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,600
And if a restaurant was called the hand, a handmade's tail.

763
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,800
No, no.

764
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Thank you.

765
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,480
My, my big thing that I always found so odd about universal Beijing is they have an incredible

766
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,320
whole coaster, but it's rethemed at transformers.

767
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,680
It's in a full transformers themed land.

768
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,280
Oh, but it is the same.

769
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,800
It's essentially it's basically the same.

770
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Yeah.

771
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
20 plus year old ride at this point.

772
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Yeah.

773
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,200
But it's just a launch coaster.

774
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,480
I think the water world restaurant is crazier though.

775
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,600
Oh, it is crazier for sure.

776
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,600
It's just was weird to see the initial concept art and pictures of like, well, that is clearly

777
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,960
the whole coaster, but made into a transformers.

778
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,240
And given that we, what we know in our hearts is the transformers ride.

779
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
Yeah.

780
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
There can only be one.

781
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
I think they have one of those too.

782
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,240
Okay.

783
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,240
That makes sense.

784
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
So they have two transformers rides.

785
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
Yes.

786
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
Whole land.

787
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,560
So the good people of Beijing get to have the moment of intimacy.

788
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Wow.

789
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Yeah, that's great.

790
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,240
And they get to then drink a pee.

791
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,920
At Toler P. At Toler P.

792
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,720
Is the Mariner at At Toler?

793
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
I can't remember.

794
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,040
He's kind of a wanderer.

795
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,640
He's kind of a, he doesn't associate with any tribe.

796
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,200
No, he comes and meets and helps the Atollers.

797
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,920
But he can't, in 2021 they build water world, which is a great show, but they can't rebuild.

798
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,320
They can't make a new back to the future ride.

799
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,760
They can't make a new back to the future thing.

800
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,520
I mean, I think they can't, but maybe they'll prove me wrong by.

801
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,400
Yeah, look, they turned their back on this.

802
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,840
They got rid of it while water world just stayed and stayed to where it's perennial.

803
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
It's like that.

804
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,840
I think maybe we talk about Woody Woodpecker being Universal's Mickey.

805
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Yeah.

806
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,320
I think the water world Atolls are Universal's castle.

807
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
I think you're right.

808
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,220
There's no such thing as weenies in any of the, maybe the islands of adventure lighthouse.

809
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,640
But besides that, but that's never been reproduced.

810
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
So what else do they got?

811
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,600
What do they put in every park?

812
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Atolls.

813
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Atolls.

814
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
You're right.

815
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,680
I think it's going to outlast ET in Orlando.

816
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,160
I mean, it's not in Orlando, but it'll last out here longer than ETA.

817
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,120
Do they ever make a new, what if, if they, if it turned out Epic universe, one of the

818
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,640
lands was water world.

819
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
I'd be thrilled.

820
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Oh, that would be wild.

821
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
Yeah.

822
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
With like a duck and boat ride.

823
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,320
People might be excited about that honestly.

824
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,840
But more than like more Potter.

825
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
You want more Potter.

826
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
Like what is that?

827
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Yeah.

828
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
And I know the ride system is more Costner.

829
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Yeah.

830
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,760
And like the Howie the Train Your Dragon, that's going to have a fun coaster.

831
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,520
I'm sure that'll be fine.

832
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
Super Mario.

833
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,480
Yeah, but we've done a version of it.

834
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Yeah.

835
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,960
Water world land with a new e-ticket.

836
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,920
Costner stock all time high.

837
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
Right.

838
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
You know, that's true.

839
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Uh huh.

840
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,840
So people are going to want to see a figure that from a distance looks a little bit like

841
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
him.

842
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
Right.

843
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,440
So I would be rancher slash governor from the yellow.

844
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
So yeah.

845
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,560
Water world land and back to the future land for expansions for Epic universe would be

846
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
my preference.

847
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
Yeah.

848
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Yeah.

849
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
I think that's what the musical does.

850
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,280
And if it takes off, then maybe water world.

851
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Yeah.

852
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Yes.

853
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,120
And I'm going back to the future, but I would like to spread the leak here that water world

854
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
coming to Broadway.

855
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,000
Going piss drinking you and me.

856
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,680
I mean, look, Mike, it's possible.

857
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,840
They just announced this musical stage musical based on smash the 11 year old.

858
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Did they?

859
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Yeah.

860
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
That's your dream.

861
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
I can't.

862
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Are you ready to audition?

863
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,440
I thought it was an old, well, I could have played into those characters.

864
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,040
I'm not right for any of those.

865
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,600
No, I think you're selling yourself short.

866
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,360
I don't know what's in the show.

867
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,600
The live show might be new stuff, new characters.

868
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,440
I thought it was either an old news story or an early April fool's joke, but like I've

869
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,960
seen it enough times like playbill.com reported it.

870
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,320
Let's get Jason cast in this.

871
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Sure.

872
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,640
Let's put this turn this to main feed.

873
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
Some more people hear it.

874
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,480
You want, but then what happens to like Jason's doing a live Broadway show.

875
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,880
Jason's pressure handling is off the charts.

876
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,320
Good charts.

877
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,440
He'll be able to handle those two things.

878
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,840
No problem.

879
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,000
Kick lines, constant dancers.

880
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Sure.

881
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yes.

882
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Stay in limber.

883
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Right.

884
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Living in New York, which is a low pressure city.

885
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah.

886
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
He's going to be fine.

887
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,240
As long as he doesn't get into fights with three car former three card Monte.

888
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,960
Well, he's going to be hassling weed dealers every night.

889
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Is this fake?

890
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,040
This fake bro turning tables over.

891
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,360
Hey, should I turn you in?

892
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,480
Let me show you the NYPD station right there.

893
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,360
I'll take you right to it.

894
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,040
Let me sing you my new number I'm working on for the show.

895
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Wait, I'm contributing now.

896
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,040
You're singing.

897
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,040
You're in smash.

898
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
You're getting him.

899
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,040
He's writing the songs too.

900
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
I'm the Christian.

901
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,080
I'm working on like he's, he's working on the song.

902
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Like he's working on his voice.

903
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
Yeah.

904
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
I'm learning it.

905
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,080
Sorry.

906
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
Okay.

907
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
But he's no, he's writing it too.

908
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Fuck it.

909
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
He's writing smash.

910
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,080
He's writing it too.

911
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
And shoes.

912
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
No, it's a shame.

913
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
And is it Mark?

914
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
He's been coming up a lot lately.

915
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
He hasn't come out.

916
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
Look, he's very prolific, you know?

917
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
All right.

918
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,920
Well, you're better than him as, as far as writing Broadway songs.

919
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,360
I'm saying it here based on zero evidence.

920
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,600
You heard him in the country bears episode.

921
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
I'm here now.

922
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,960
I'm here now.

923
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,360
I don't know if it overtakes the body of work of Mark.

924
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,360
I don't know.

925
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
I just love that one the best.

926
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
I think.

927
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Um, okay.

928
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,360
So, uh, what have we?

929
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
Oh, the ride.

930
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,120
It was a bit, I went backwards here.

931
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,640
I'm going to get into the ride.

932
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,440
Um, they have a Dumbo type ride.

933
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,680
Uh, it's just a, I, I don't think the term is spinner.

934
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,240
I'm out of my, I don't remember what you even call these anymore.

935
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,000
I realized that's the wrong term, but you know what it is.

936
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,560
It goes around and around and around.

937
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,440
You control the up and down of it.

938
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,380
Um, and this ride is special to me cause that's like, well, I don't know.

939
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,540
We went to this one in sea world, but it's one of my son's first iterations of that and

940
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,840
getting to control it and realizing that, Oh, I'm in control of the joystick, uh, is,

941
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
is so much fun.

942
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,720
But one thing I didn't know until recently is what is the name of this ride?

943
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:12,760
I honestly didn't know in my head it's called super silly fun ride or swings.

944
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Close.

945
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,840
No, the ride is called the silly swirly is the name.

946
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:23,760
And but I think I, I, it makes sense to me that I was confused about it because up until

947
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,480
very recently and I'm glad I took a screenshot of when this was the case until a few months

948
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,760
ago, the universal website called it super swirly again, the name silly swirly, but it's

949
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
super swirly.

950
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,480
And what I'm showing you guys right now is it says super swirly gets super swirly, super

951
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,420
swirly will soar and spin.

952
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,520
And that is right next to the giant logo, silly swirly.

953
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:54,480
It says the wrong name four times in my, in my, in my site here next to a logo clearly

954
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,760
saying a different, so that is the, that's the degree of care.

955
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
Yeah.

956
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Yeah.

957
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Yeah.

958
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
Yeah.

959
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,680
Um, or just a find and replace at least.

960
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,680
Yeah.

961
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,680
But I, you know, I liked when these things that went like, what's that call?

962
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,680
I don't know.

963
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,760
It think we can get so precious with these Millennium Falcon smugglers runs and I had

964
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,920
a little careful, uh, uh, dot, dot, dots and exclamation points.

965
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,360
I love that it at least until 2022, a big corporate theme park didn't know the name

966
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
on the rides.

967
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,360
Oh, sure.

968
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:33,920
Uh, I also have a very fond memory of this ride because in the spring of 2021, as the

969
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:41,600
parks were reopening in California, that was the very first ride I went on in over a year.

970
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
That was your first ride.

971
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,800
That was the first ride cause Jane and I got tickets.

972
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,080
She got to, we went to the taste of universal food festival.

973
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:55,500
A lot of parks were doing like, you know, uh, you know, you get a punch card or a tab

974
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,120
card where you can go eat at restaurants and there's characters walking around and you

975
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,360
can just be in the parks.

976
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,560
And we went in that day and we like got one or two food things.

977
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:12,040
And then very quickly we heard, we saw the rides open.

978
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:20,640
Like they didn't know such, so it was by the end of the day, every ride basically in the

979
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,680
park was open.

980
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,360
And this is where we had heard, uh, that they might be doing like soft opening for secret

981
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,360
lies of pets.

982
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:34,360
So we got in the virtual queue and to kill time before we got the virtual queue, we went

983
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,600
and rode the spinner ride and then did like a print.

984
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,480
It was a very surreal day.

985
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Yeah.

986
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
Yeah.

987
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
So you're like, are you going on rides?

988
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,480
Yeah.

989
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,240
And then you're all that time.

990
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,960
I think we managed to do pets like twice because very quickly all the other rides at like 30

991
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,160
or 40 minute waits and like 30 or 40 minute waits crammed in queues.

992
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,320
That was like still a little sound to be half vaccinated.

993
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:05,760
And like at the time, like, but it was super fun to go like sit on Jurassic patio and drink

994
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,360
a beer and eat a corn dog.

995
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,360
You know?

996
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
Oh yeah.

997
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
It was a huge visit back.

998
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,360
Yeah.

999
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,840
And then we went back to return very fond memories of just like walking around super

1000
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:20,880
silly fun land and going on this ride and the, the, the, the criticism I had at the

1001
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,200
time was like, okay, this place has been closed over a year.

1002
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,120
They couldn't have one guy power.

1003
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,120
Why?

1004
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,160
Like, cause a lot of it gets a little dirty.

1005
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,160
You're saying it was dirty.

1006
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
It was dirty.

1007
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,960
They let it, they let it go to Russ super silly fun land was dirty.

1008
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,960
Yeah.

1009
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,480
I think when you paint stuff fluorescent, you really have to like scrub it to keep it

1010
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,840
from getting filthy, especially that close to San Fernando Valley.

1011
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,120
Like there's a lot of shit in the air.

1012
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,120
Take notes.

1013
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,720
Universal custodial Jason's got notes for you.

1014
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,320
It's look at the universal power washing.

1015
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
Give it a little power.

1016
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
I give it a little.

1017
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,480
There's water in involved in this area.

1018
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
Well in half.

1019
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,480
Yeah.

1020
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,220
And half of it, not in this part, but yeah, I believe they, some of it is called a nearby

1021
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,480
dry zone website.

1022
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:17,160
You know, we learned about, you know, wet play and dry play, you know, from the, the

1023
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,400
great Wolf Lodge episode copy.

1024
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Right.

1025
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,360
And I guess that is as we established the clearest way to say it, but it's like, ah,

1026
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,180
it's still, I don't know about that.

1027
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,180
You still said it again.

1028
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:34,000
I said it again, but I mean, there's no clear way for parents with the young kids like,

1029
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,400
okay, this half is dry and this half is a water play area.

1030
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,880
I think it took them a little while to get the water turned.

1031
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,160
Hi, where can I take my children for wet play?

1032
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,200
I is an adult ever said uttered that phrase.

1033
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,480
I don't think so.

1034
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,520
Not if you didn't, weren't forced to write the copy of it.

1035
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,120
Um, look, this ride is, it's, you know, it goes around and round.

1036
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,120
It is what it is.

1037
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,440
But again, early, early days of getting your kid into rides.

1038
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,520
I've watched, I've watched my boy smile so much on this.

1039
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,120
And the vehicles are really fun, brightly colored a little bit.

1040
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,560
Maybe you could do some feels and some power much, but there are these fun little like,

1041
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,200
you know, like whatever the hell these monster, these aren't anything later in the movie.

1042
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,480
Are they, they're just like random odd monsters or aliens or something, right?

1043
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,480
Yeah.

1044
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,480
It's just googly.

1045
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,480
Yeah.

1046
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,480
Googly eye character.

1047
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,480
That's a good way to put it.

1048
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,600
In the movie, the big beats are like the girls force grew to ride a roller coaster and he

1049
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,280
starts to get sick.

1050
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:46,560
And then Agnes wins her fluffy unicorn, uh, toy, uh, at the space killer, uh, raw, uh,

1051
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,720
carnival game, which is replicated in this area.

1052
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,720
Which they do have.

1053
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,960
So that's like a huge, like big set piece of the movie.

1054
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,280
And then they recreated it pretty exact.

1055
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,880
I was surprised that their word killer appears in a theme park.

1056
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,880
Oh, it's true.

1057
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,440
It says space killer on top of this, this, uh, game basically, but there's, is there

1058
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,920
a not in Disney there's that the word doesn't appear anywhere anymore.

1059
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:20,840
At least did hard rock park have a ride based on Cortez, the killer, long dark ride, all

1060
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,840
the characters.

1061
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,800
Man, that was really realistic.

1062
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,240
I thought it was really him.

1063
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,440
I thought it was the real court.

1064
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,440
Oh man.

1065
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,920
I was listening to that song the other day.

1066
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,920
Yeah.

1067
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,920
Great song.

1068
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,560
Uh, I hope of quality that Neil would approve of.

1069
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,560
I think so.

1070
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,640
Neil's been trying to get his songs in theme parks for a long time.

1071
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,160
And, uh, one of these days.

1072
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,680
So yeah, I was impressed that they, cause that would have definitely been Disney, Disney

1073
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,680
wiped away.

1074
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,680
That's a good point.

1075
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,680
That's a very good point.

1076
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,680
Yeah.

1077
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,960
That's a good joke.

1078
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,720
I mean, I guess it's less of a theme park joke from the movie of like just calling the carnival

1079
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,160
games a space killer.

1080
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,160
Oh yeah.

1081
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,160
Sure.

1082
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,160
Oh, it's a little play on words.

1083
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,160
Yeah.

1084
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,160
Oh, I didn't realize that.

1085
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,160
Oh, that's nice.

1086
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,160
That's good.

1087
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,160
That is nice.

1088
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,160
Nice.

1089
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,160
Nice.

1090
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,160
Nice.

1091
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,160
Nice.

1092
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,160
This whole area is nice.

1093
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,160
A lot of family restrooms.

1094
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,160
How can I ask you this?

1095
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,320
Uh, I don't think there are restrooms in this area, but yeah, no, there is a big.

1096
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,640
Oh, in the, the soap.

1097
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,640
In the super silly.

1098
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,640
Oh, in the, in the wet zone.

1099
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,920
Oh, I guess that's where that's why I don't go over there.

1100
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
Right.

1101
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,920
I don't want to go wet.

1102
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,880
Can you, how good is the, can you see the view from the up the hill when you're in the

1103
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,880
ride at all?

1104
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,840
Can you see that's another thing about it.

1105
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,340
And it's a nice, like that gives it a boost over a say, of course there's similar rides

1106
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:47,540
at a carnival or whatever, but that you have that great view of from over there, it's kind

1107
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:53,120
of like, like West Valley and that view goes and goes and adds a lot to your peripheral.

1108
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:58,480
It's really, it's like, okay, basic ride, get it, but vehicles are fun.

1109
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,920
Weight is short, really nice view.

1110
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,960
Pharrell music playing.

1111
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,040
So some of the Pharrell's, uh, mid to okay.

1112
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,600
Most songs and, uh, and it's nice.

1113
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
I don't know.

1114
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,960
It's, uh, it's, it's a little more going on than just some other little kid.

1115
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,960
Right.

1116
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,760
I'm not a perfection and this is maybe too difficult, but if you take away sort of the

1117
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,480
nostalgia of seeing Dumbo, is this better than Dumbo?

1118
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,360
Think about Disneyland placement for Dumbo.

1119
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,740
Let's just go Disneyland, Disneyland placement for Dumbo.

1120
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:34,760
When you're on the ride, what is the better experience?

1121
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,080
Ooh, you know what?

1122
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:43,680
You know, I being higher up on the high level, it's like a rare thing that makes good use

1123
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,320
of the odd up on a hill and up and down nature of universal.

1124
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:53,120
Yeah, you're certainly seeing more and I'd rather hear some of these Pharrell songs than

1125
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,120
dream.

1126
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,040
Wish your heart makes, uh, you know what?

1127
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,720
Boy, that's an interesting, interesting question.

1128
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,720
Yeah.

1129
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,000
The only one side of it is just kind of a wall.

1130
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,840
I'll give you, because it is on the, this is all on the top of a parking garage.

1131
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,840
Yes.

1132
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,960
And if, and I think if that, and if that wall wasn't there, I think you would feel, you

1133
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,920
could feel like you could just jump off hundreds of feet.

1134
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,600
So that maybe that's maybe the only thing is that wall is a little perfunctory.

1135
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Yeah.

1136
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:25,580
The only thing that could edge is that I guess Disneyland at night in the back of the castle

1137
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:32,080
ambience wise is hard to beat, but there's some, this has a lot in its favor.

1138
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,800
And maybe you got to maybe give it to like fountains on Dumbo.

1139
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:43,160
I do like that, you know, that there's water spouting and just the whole like mechanism

1140
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,960
is beautiful and looks like it's true.

1141
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,960
Being craftsman.

1142
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,960
That's true.

1143
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:56,000
Um, this area, well, one, I think it gave universal Hollywood that despicable me ride

1144
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,440
a leg up because it's like, okay, well, when you exit, there is a gift shop like in Florida,

1145
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,680
but then there's also the carnival.

1146
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,240
There's the pier from the, from the movie that you like.

1147
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:14,600
Um, uh, now that flushes out feeling like you're in Despicable Me for a little while.

1148
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,600
Yeah.

1149
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:21,440
Uh, Florida, um, getting a leg up cause they'll have another big despicable me minions ride.

1150
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:27,720
Um, so, but then the other thing is this certainly filled a need for universal Hollywood cause

1151
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:33,040
they closed down the curious George play area to build the Harry Potter stuff.

1152
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,680
And before that, this was like a Coca-Cola themed like play area.

1153
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,680
Coke soak.

1154
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
Yes.

1155
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,680
So just a wet play zone.

1156
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,360
Not a dry, wet play.

1157
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,600
And it didn't have anything for those who prefer dry play.

1158
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Yeah.

1159
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,840
Everybody's people should really should listen.

1160
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
We really should.

1161
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,440
How have we not done coke soak yet?

1162
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,440
Yeah.

1163
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,440
That's weird.

1164
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,440
Hmm.

1165
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,120
Maybe because there's nothing to say about it.

1166
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,120
Okay.

1167
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,120
Well, that could be a consideration.

1168
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:04,720
It's not saying it's name that we did the entire episode.

1169
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,720
Okay.

1170
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,000
Well, we'll do some digging.

1171
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,720
There's a Coca-Cola like refreshment, like stand by the men of black ride in Florida.

1172
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,720
Okay.

1173
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,720
And that's something fun.

1174
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,640
Uh, it might.

1175
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,000
It's mostly just a bunch of freestyle machines now.

1176
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,600
I think we could want a second gate on the freestyle machine is possible.

1177
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,960
I love the freestyle general freestyle.

1178
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,960
Oh boy.

1179
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,960
They're so fun.

1180
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,360
I guess I could see that.

1181
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,360
Yeah.

1182
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,520
I've never said out loud, they're so fun.

1183
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,400
But I won't at this juncture, but I, maybe I'll, maybe your enthusiasm will be infectious.

1184
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,320
Maybe I mean Wendy's leg up for Wendy's.

1185
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,320
They have them.

1186
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,860
They have them in the drive through.

1187
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,240
You can like, you can mobile or a special drink.

1188
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,240
You can tell them percentages.

1189
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,240
Not that precise.

1190
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,880
How does it, how do you give them?

1191
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,080
But you can say, you know, it's diet coke and it's got some lime to it.

1192
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,600
Like, but that doesn't have the per se.

1193
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,760
It's not the fun precision of that app.

1194
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,760
Yeah.

1195
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,880
But it's mellow yellow with cherry.

1196
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,880
Right.

1197
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,880
Right.

1198
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,880
Okay.

1199
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,000
And they, they decide percentages and you just, yeah, right.

1200
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,080
They're not going to, yeah, they're not doing the 15% cherry 25%.

1201
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,080
Yeah.

1202
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,360
Well, only then when you can like, you know, it looks like, like meters on a color printer.

1203
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,360
Right.

1204
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,360
Right.

1205
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,360
Right.

1206
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,360
That's the true experience.

1207
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,360
Yes.

1208
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,000
But that might have to be bought control.

1209
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,600
You could do it to the percentage of it to the decimal point.

1210
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Right.

1211
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:38,440
Speaking of beverages, maybe one thing to say on the way out about this episode, about

1212
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:43,440
this, this area, this is outside of the gates, but if we're talking about, you know, we're

1213
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,040
covering zones at universal.

1214
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,040
And of course there's all this, it's, it's become kind of this bigger zone devoted to

1215
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:58,520
the illumination films and just feet away from super silly fun land is of course the

1216
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,240
Irish bar where you can go and get hammered.

1217
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,240
Yeah.

1218
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,240
Of course.

1219
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,240
Yeah.

1220
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,560
And just, uh, I, I figure, you know, we're calling shots this year.

1221
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,120
I want to, I want to literally call shots.

1222
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,360
I think that's an episode right there.

1223
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,400
The Irish bar, the Irish bar, we can go and get hammered.

1224
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,400
Sure.

1225
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,400
Yeah.

1226
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,400
It's hard to do it fast.

1227
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,400
I guess I have to slow it.

1228
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,400
There's where we can go to get hammered.

1229
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Hammered.

1230
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,040
Yeah, you're going to ramp it up and then slow it down right there.

1231
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:29,440
It is trying to think what like a whole second gate episode can you do on the hospital that

1232
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,400
would be closest to universal?

1233
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,400
Wait a minute.

1234
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,880
That's what I, your premise is that by doing a shot, you would have to go to the hospital.

1235
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,200
I feel pretty bad.

1236
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:44,720
Uh, when I drink now, I also, also though, I, I don't think, I think there's been a lot

1237
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,680
of judgment of this here bar as if it is just like, take your shot, like do it.

1238
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,920
I'm going to watch you knock those shots.

1239
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,000
This is a place that has alcoholic mixed beverages.

1240
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It does.

1241
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It's got slush.

1242
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
You don't need to.

1243
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It's got a white clothed tall boy.

1244
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,640
Well, you called the shot, you called the literal shots.

1245
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,320
We have to do shots up there.

1246
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,320
You're right.

1247
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,320
A called shot sticks.

1248
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,040
That's what a literal called shot is.

1249
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,600
And if it does send Jason to the hospital, so be it.

1250
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,600
So be it.

1251
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,600
Okay.

1252
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,480
But as we took earlier for, for your, you can handle, we talked, you can handle, we

1253
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,640
talked about it all.

1254
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,320
You can handle all sorts of things.

1255
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,840
You're selling yourself short.

1256
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,720
You're going to get, yeah, you're going to get a shot.

1257
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,720
You're going to do fine.

1258
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,600
And then we're going to just pound and get hammer pound drinks, not pounds.

1259
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:34,080
That's one of my favorite details of the minions cafe is right by the checkout.

1260
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:38,320
They see large cooler, usually filled with like Corona and white cloth tall.

1261
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,320
Oh right.

1262
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,320
Yeah.

1263
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,320
Yeah.

1264
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,320
Real close.

1265
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,320
Yeah.

1266
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,320
Real close.

1267
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,320
That's my only, that's like, it's, it's like overall criticism of universal, especially

1268
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,320
universal Hollywood.

1269
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:51,360
It's like, if there was just sort of a more magical way to introduce this area, if it

1270
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:57,120
was just set up in a little more of its own thing where you can't see the Parisian street

1271
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:03,280
right there, it would just, you know, that all this is the biggest gripe you would have,

1272
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,480
I think with universal outside of the Harry Potter area and everything.

1273
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,120
It's just too, everything's too on top of each other.

1274
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:13,080
And it doesn't feel like it's its own complete land.

1275
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,040
You walk down a Parisian street and then are, and then are in a theme park from Despicable

1276
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,040
Me.

1277
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,040
Yes.

1278
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,880
There's no, it's not transitions or not exactly.

1279
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,880
And I understand.

1280
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,880
I understand.

1281
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,880
I'm not crazy.

1282
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,880
I understand.

1283
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,640
You can say a replica of the Moulin Rouge windmill from the super silly.

1284
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,640
Yeah.

1285
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:34,120
You can take shots while watching the water come out of that monster's mouth, basically

1286
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,120
on the wet play area.

1287
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,600
I don't know if you do have a view of that.

1288
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,600
You don't think so?

1289
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,600
I don't think you do.

1290
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,600
Which way is it pointing?

1291
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,960
You got a hard angle there.

1292
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,960
I think.

1293
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,960
Oh, okay.

1294
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,560
Have you, have you had your son probably not ready for getting splashed?

1295
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,560
No, certainly not.

1296
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:55,160
You didn't teach him like he gets like a little shot of orange juice or something.

1297
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,280
Oh, daddy gets used to the speed and the size.

1298
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,280
Yeah.

1299
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,280
Yeah.

1300
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,280
Big boy shots.

1301
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,000
Older relatives going like, and you just, you tip your finger in a bottle of the Dewars

1302
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
that they're teething.

1303
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
You dip your finger in the Dewars.

1304
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,160
I think just missed our generator.

1305
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,640
Just missed the like, you just rub a little, a little.

1306
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,000
Tiny bit of whiskey for sleep.

1307
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
No, I have not done that.

1308
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,560
No, no.

1309
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,120
But he's not, he's not going in the water area yet.

1310
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,320
No, I feel like I never see anyone in this wet play area.

1311
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,960
That was going to be my question because I've not spent a ton of time here.

1312
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,400
And as a kid, I loved, there was a park we would have to drive like 25 minutes, but there

1313
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,680
was a park that was like spraying water out.

1314
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:46,160
And I, as a kid, five to who knows 10, like loved this park and there were slides, but

1315
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,400
like it was spraying, like I can't even really remember how it was set up, but I loved that

1316
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,400
idea.

1317
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,280
But especially a park like this, that's so local.

1318
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,920
I know there's obviously tourists, but so local.

1319
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,600
How many like adults and kids are doing the water part of it?

1320
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,600
I feel like I've never seen anyone in it.

1321
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,600
Yeah.

1322
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,080
That's sort of what I'm getting at.

1323
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,920
It's literally running and the bucket is tipping over and dumping all the water.

1324
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,920
Right.

1325
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,920
It's a tremendous amount of water.

1326
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,800
It seems like a particularly wet one of the, particularly wet, wet play.

1327
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:20,840
I mean, Orlando, I feel like people are getting soaking wet all the time because you just

1328
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,600
so hot so much of the year you get dry pretty quickly.

1329
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,280
The Southern California climate, especially universal city.

1330
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,600
If you're up on that hill, you're probably getting one of two weather patterns.

1331
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:39,200
It's windy as shit or it's the middle of the summer and you're so much closer to the sun.

1332
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,320
It's very dry and hot and brutal.

1333
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,800
Well, but then also the only way you're letting your kid get soaked is if you're staying on

1334
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,440
one of the hotels on property.

1335
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,440
Because other than that, the kid's going to have to dry off, which I guess is okay, but

1336
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,280
that might be a big pain in the ass and the kid's going to be grumpy.

1337
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,760
Like that would, like it just doesn't seem like it's set up for that.

1338
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,960
It doesn't seem like people are utilizing the water area as much.

1339
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,880
It seems just like a, like a art fixture.

1340
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,880
Let me ask you this.

1341
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:15,160
Is there any way when your kid is a little older, when like daddy and son would get in

1342
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:19,960
their swim trunks and drive up to universal for a morning of frolicking in the minions

1343
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:20,960
water?

1344
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:26,240
I'm so creeped out by the description daddy and son, even their little shorts and frolic

1345
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,240
in their swim trunks.

1346
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,240
I do think daddy going to get any swim trunks and frolic.

1347
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,360
I go to the wet play zone.

1348
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:41,880
My family would pack changes of clothes often if we knew we were doing a lot of water.

1349
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,760
Would you, would your daddy and you go and get in your swim trunks and go into a splash

1350
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,760
area?

1351
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:54,800
Um, you know, uh, King's dominion and Doherty park both had water parks like built into the

1352
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,800
park.

1353
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,600
I'm not even answering this question.

1354
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,600
Yes.

1355
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,440
Well, yeah, we bring a change of clothes.

1356
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,440
How is it?

1357
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,040
The same question is asked to me and I'm tremendously creeped out and Jason just like, why?

1358
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,040
Yes, we did.

1359
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,640
Dornie park speaks my language.

1360
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,760
I know nothing you said was specifically odd.

1361
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,600
There was no, no, yes, there was daddy.

1362
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,600
It's weird.

1363
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:21,640
You say I'm daddy now and that's what I call myself and it has nothing weird about it.

1364
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,240
I say daddy, it's daddy.

1365
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,520
And I say that to my child.

1366
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,600
There's nothing weird about it.

1367
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,920
Now I say daddy all the time.

1368
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,200
I think what you just said was weird.

1369
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,200
I say daddy, daddy.

1370
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,800
One of my catchphrases when I come in the room, when you're done recording this and

1371
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,320
you go home, you're going to open the door and say daddy, you can ask my family and they

1372
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:44,920
will say that one of the, my number one catchphrase in regards to my daughter is it's daddy.

1373
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,920
Okay.

1374
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,920
That's the thing I say.

1375
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,920
I guess that's fine.

1376
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:48,920
So it's not weird.

1377
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,440
I know there's nothing inherently Cree.

1378
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,640
Of course people are daddy.

1379
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,640
People are daddy.

1380
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,640
I understand this.

1381
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,520
I'm aware of daddy's frolic.

1382
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,680
Let's be honest.

1383
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,680
It's the trifecta.

1384
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,680
It's the dish.

1385
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,160
It's daddy plus frolic plus swim trunks.

1386
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,760
I think it's the amount you're saying these things, Michael.

1387
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,240
And I think like, yeah, that's the volume.

1388
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,200
Frawlick is also kind of a choice.

1389
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,200
That's kind of a choice.

1390
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:21,640
And the ask you ever, uh, Hey, you ever dad, daddy, daddy and son ever, uh, did I get breathy?

1391
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:22,640
I would like to go.

1392
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,080
I guess I'm adding that to it.

1393
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,080
Well, what about this?

1394
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:29,360
We leave the kids behind and then like two daddies go up together with their swim trunks

1395
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,480
and frolic in the splash zone.

1396
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,560
All right.

1397
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,680
Have you been reading rich dad, poor dad?

1398
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,840
And that says the word front.

1399
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,280
So Jason, that's the only book I read is a rich dad, poor dad.

1400
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,880
Now that I'm a daddy kind of like shitty kind of debunked in this way of like, yeah, it's

1401
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:44,880
kind of a shit.

1402
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,780
That guy pops up on my like when I'm scrolling through Facebook videos, I think I popped

1403
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,780
up all the time.

1404
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:52,900
I bet he has a lot of thoughts on whether people want to work.

1405
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:59,760
He certainly does a phrase that, uh, there's this one historian or writer on Twitter was

1406
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,120
like, uh, no one wants to work anymore.

1407
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,880
This has been a story in newspapers for over a hundred years.

1408
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,080
This is a, with old examples.

1409
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,080
Yeah.

1410
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,080
Yeah.

1411
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,080
Uh, no, he thinks that, yeah.

1412
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,080
Anyway.

1413
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:17,480
Um, well, this is, I know exactly what's going to lead to this, that the, us daddies and

1414
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,040
this non daddy go up to the Irish bar.

1415
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:25,080
We get hammered and we put our shorts on the hospital.

1416
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,720
We we've frolic in our show.

1417
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,480
We'll be in, we'll be frolicing in our, in our trunks.

1418
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,400
Uh, zero time flip.

1419
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:37,080
Finally, I, I, you know, get my sunset Boulevard floating face down in the pool.

1420
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:42,680
Cause I had like half a shot of sky vodka and don't shoot sky.

1421
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,680
Oh yeah.

1422
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,120
Got me a trouble at the moon.

1423
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,120
Don't shoot sky.

1424
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:54,720
I'm Jason face down in the minions, super silly fun land, like sunset Boulevard dead

1425
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,760
from one single shot of alcohol.

1426
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,320
Half of a shot of alcohol.

1427
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,480
He started talking about a talking hat.

1428
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:08,360
And then before we knew it, he was drowned in the wet play next to sewer.

1429
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,920
No, not next to Kevin.

1430
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,960
That's Kevin's as a playground.

1431
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:12,960
Cute one.

1432
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,560
He's next to the cute one like him.

1433
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,280
No, that's kind of nice.

1434
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,320
Cute, Kevin's died next to cute Kevin's tall.

1435
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,320
Bobby's cute.

1436
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,320
Stewart is regular.

1437
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,320
Okay.

1438
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:28,080
That's how the last thing he said, it's going to be a wild episode.

1439
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,560
He looked at a bottle of Jamis.

1440
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:37,040
Actually no, that was, I believe friend of the show, friend of the show, Kyle Moody,

1441
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:43,120
but like, uh, shots, uh, once Jamis said, and I like very quickly down.

1442
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,120
I was like, Hey, I gotta go.

1443
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,120
I'm so sorry.

1444
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,360
Jason had it.

1445
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,880
Did you leave because like, I don't know what this shot's going to do to me.

1446
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,080
This is the werewolf moment beginning.

1447
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,080
It is.

1448
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,080
Yeah.

1449
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,560
Jason had a toothache that night and he rubbed some of it on his gums, um, to, to calm the,

1450
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,200
the pain he was feeling.

1451
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,080
And then it got too much for him and he had to go home.

1452
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:11,640
I rubbed doers on Jason's gums sometimes when he has a toothache.

1453
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,640
That's Protestant whiskey.

1454
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,640
All right.

1455
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,900
Open up for daddy.

1456
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:20,560
He rubs doers on little Jason's gums.

1457
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,360
So he feels better to frolic in trunks.

1458
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,520
You survived podcast, the ride.

1459
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,560
Thanks for subscribing to the second gate.

1460
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:36,640
If you want to dig even deeper, if the big, if it's always been there, regardless of what

1461
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,200
we say on the way to it, join us on our new, on our, it's not even new anymore.

1462
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,720
Get your out tier club three, uh, well I got to change the copy much like the universal

1463
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,280
website that got the name wrong.

1464
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,960
I'll get tinkering on that.

1465
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,440
Um, uh, I was probably get hammered episode coming very soon.

1466
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,440
Very soon.

Let's go do it right now.

Alright.

Go.
