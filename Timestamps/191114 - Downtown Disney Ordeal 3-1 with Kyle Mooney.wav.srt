1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil rears its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried doughnut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, What secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Boys, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, you will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of the mall.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You have 15 daily very necessary episodes and what's to do so. I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic or boring.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Downtown Disney ordeal level 3 stage 1.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Jason Sheridan.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yep.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm here in this level and stage.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is this makes day 7 of what is if you're just joining us for some reason or just need a recap or refresher.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I do.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm lost track for any number of reasons.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, I know.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And we're all discombobulated from our run in with Rick Wetzel.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So we're thrown.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So to remind everybody what's happening, this is day 7 of a 15 part daily series where we explore every store and restaurant in downtown Disney, which is, of course, the outdoor shopping mall outside of Disneyland, outside of Disneyland, between Disneyland and California Adventure.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If all of this sounds a little trying, that's because it has been.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll be honest about that.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My voice cracked as I said it.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And there's, by the way, if you don't, if this is too much, there's plenty of episodes about rides you can go back and listen to.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Go take a break if you need to.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If this is bothering you, yes.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Go get the taste of the regular.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Two feeds.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Two feeds worth of attractions.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Listen to the Haunted Mansion one again.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Lots of dry info there.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But here we're doing it.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We're doing a different thing.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It has been our deal, but I'm excited because today, tonight we are talking about my favorite thing in downtown Disney.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And doing it with one of my favorite folks.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Returning to the show from Saturday Night Live, Kyle Mooney is with us.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Kyle.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hey, Captain.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is great.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I know.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's great to see you guys again.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Likewise.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I love hearing your voices all the time on your podcast.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thanks.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, man.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you, Kyle.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thanks for listening.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thanks for checking it out.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, of course.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And for returning.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You came here, I mean, not directly, but you were at Disneyland.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Today.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All day.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So what time is it right now?

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you tell that to your listeners?

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Do you not like to reveal that you have?

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's not like the talk show thing where you tape it earlier.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's a good question.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's like, I guess if we don't say it, it's because we want them to think it's like live.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Like even if they know it's not like intellectually, they kind of want to feel like it's live.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We can kind of say.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I was at Disney, I think two or three hours ago, essentially.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That might be one of the quickest ever.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's like full nighttime.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Which and this being this is an episode.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We are now in an area that at one point in some article I read, this was called the Wine

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Bar District where we are in this stage.

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And Kyle, you brought champagne.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We're drinking champagne.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We're sipping champagne.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, I brought some bubbly.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know, I try to treat my boys good.

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hashtag spoil.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Thanks, daddy.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Please call me daddy.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, no.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Got into his disturbing rhythm in this episode.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But you have an assignment now.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I call Kyle daddy.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All right.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I have to do at least several more times.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But I owe you, you know, for the champagne.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You never owe me.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm excited to be here.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But yes, I warned I warned Scott that I would be in maybe a particular shape.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I feel like I'm maybe fine.

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know.

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can't.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm doing fine.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I listen to this after the fact.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Who knows what I'll determine.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But you feel I've been drinking since 1030 in the morning today.

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Damn.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hell, yeah.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You started that or like you got there.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I started my house.

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I took an Uber with a couple of friends.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's a way to do it.

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's a good way to do it.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So all that.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, that's great.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're speaking my language.

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The point was, though, to research for for this.

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Of course.

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
For what we're doing.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Good excuse.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Which, by the way, look, I called you daddy.

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But really, we only during the series answer to the great one, the sector keeper, who now

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
we will pause so that he can tell us what we specifically are doing today.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Boys, boys, today's stage contains the bar in Ballast Point.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Good luck, boys.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
All right.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, yes, two fantastic liquor dispensing locations, Uva Bar and Ballast Point.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And you hit up.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Did you hit up both of these today or you have at various?

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
One of them, at least.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I did today.

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And I have prior to today.

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Nice.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hell, yeah.

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hell, yeah.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So we have a lot of posture.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, wait, really?

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Like, so you had like a drink and stuff?

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So wait, so you have like a drinking problem?

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hell, yeah.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Drinking problem.

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hell, yeah.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Pure bars.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No rides.

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You didn't do.

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Scott, you have described Uva Bar as one of your favorite things at Disneyland property.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah.

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Not even within the.

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm a big fan of Uva Bar.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
List the things, the rides in Disney and California Adventure that you like less than Uva.

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, this probably is the best.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I probably a ton.

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's what I mean.

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean, the ones that are jumping out are like Star Wars Launch Bay and or like the watch

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
on those Star Wars movies.

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Easy.

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But like, what's like a major one?

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Casey, I like you.

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I like going to Uva Bar more than going on Casey on the train where you're trapped in

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
a cage.

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Takes all kinds, I guess.

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Throw in one if you would agree with me.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Throw in a throw a ride under the bus if you wish or don't.

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm just inviting you in, Kyle.

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm trying to like goofy sky school or I really like that that much.

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm one of the I think most people don't like that.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I do like that ride.

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Goofy, really?

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hmm.

175
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
People think it's too like jerky, right?

176
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, it's scary.

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It scares me.

178
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't like a slow moving thing that's high up.

179
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can't.

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm not allowed to do it because everybody who's ever been on it doesn't want to do it

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
again.

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, really?

183
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's a wild mouse, right?

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The one that makes you feel like you're going to go.

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Those drops are you feel like very naked in that they're like very sudden and exposed.

187
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

188
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Kyle, with you and alcohol, I overcame some fears of some rides, both in Credit Coaster

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout, which thank you for your encouragement.

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Man, I just like kicking it with you, dude.

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, jeez.

192
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I mean, you don't I don't have to like overcome goals to impress you.

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
To me, it's just all about like being with the boys and.

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All right.

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Cheers again.

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Like, this has been a great night.

197
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hey, we're too far from each other to actually cheers.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, yeah.

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,500
I also I mean, another one we did that I don't I don't want to put you on the spot here,

200
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,000
but from that Guardians experience, I seem to recall I feel like you do a pretty good

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
job of it.

202
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Whoa.

203
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is right.

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I have heard you guys do rocket on the podcast.

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah.

206
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

207
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Can you give me a moment here?

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I've got to like I'm getting my hair back to like kind of get into character.

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Roll your sleeves up like you've been working on.

211
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's like digging up wires.

212
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The problem is, OK, now what does he say?

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,160
That's the stuff that it's like when this when the Simpsons actors have to improvise

214
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
as well.

215
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
Mark, what are they?

216
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,880
The gantry like what we do.

217
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Your hand.

218
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Yeah.

219
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
My hands.

220
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
I don't want to give you a reading.

221
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,200
I know that's sort of against the actor code.

222
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
You can all do it.

223
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,920
Yeah.

224
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Let's see those hands.

225
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
That's what he says.

226
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Makes you start.

227
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Oh, yeah.

228
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,160
He says, let me see your hands.

229
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Let's see those hands, people is what he says.

230
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Let's see your hands, people.

231
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Yeah.

232
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,160
The problem is my hands don't scan.

233
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
Yours do.

234
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Yeah.

235
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Hell yeah.

236
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
Something in that world.

237
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
Yeah.

238
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Yeah.

239
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Yeah.

240
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:51,640
When I do and I was on that, I took that I did that ride today and I just repeat that

241
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,920
phrase over and over again in like different versions.

242
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,040
Like basically like my hands don't scan.

243
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,040
My hands don't scan.

244
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,200
Yours do.

245
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,240
And I like I see this little puppet above me.

246
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,880
Every time he's like he's about to say my hands don't scan.

247
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,080
I just mean I love it.

248
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
So awesome.

249
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,360
I feel like you alerted me to the oddity of that moment and it is very addictive and yeah,

250
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
we've been doing it.

251
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,080
Well, I like I think usually what I do to correct me if I'm wrong is we're walking through

252
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,880
the after we're out of that room and I just go gantry lift.

253
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Yeah, you say gantry lift again.

254
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Gantry lift.

255
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
My hands don't scan.

256
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
It messes up my gantry plan.

257
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Gantry.

258
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,680
My plan involves a scan with your hands.

259
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,360
My hands don't scan.

260
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,200
Does it ever do?

261
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,640
Is there a super fast version?

262
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
Is it all you can?

263
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
My hands don't scan.

264
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
My hands don't scan.

265
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:15,960
It's kind of it is like yeah, if you're I feel like you guys being comedy people.

266
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,600
I feel like you've mentioned before this.

267
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
I don't know at some point I remember you guys talking about this voice that comedy

268
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
people do.

269
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,080
They'll kind of like the like, hey, here we go or something like that.

270
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
I don't know.

271
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
I don't know when you guys said this.

272
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
That's like old radio voice.

273
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,440
At some point you said that like it's like a voice that all improv-y people do or something.

274
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,000
Like an old timey voice guy.

275
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah.

276
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,640
But I feel like that rocket raccoon voice is almost something that is all is very approachable

277
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,040
to any person who like does comedy if that makes any sense.

278
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Yeah.

279
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,320
It's a little James Cagney.

280
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,440
It's like, well, do what you think James Cagney sounds like.

281
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,200
So the idea of just being able to be like my hands don't.

282
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,840
I feel like it's not far from a character I do on Saturday night.

283
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Like Bruce Shanley.

284
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
It's like almost what that is.

285
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,480
And you give it that gust that like you're really proud of yourself with every word.

286
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Yeah.

287
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
Yeah.

288
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,680
It's I told you about it.

289
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,080
The Epcot preview center that's happening currently.

290
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,840
It is why we talk about it in a future episode, but the moment when this part where you get

291
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,520
that vibe, but in a different place in Florida when there's this boring thing happening and

292
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,000
then he says boring and unplugged.

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,080
And it's really, I don't know.

294
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,760
I feel like it went from something that seemed a little silly to me to like, I'd love to

295
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,040
watch like rocket unplugging anything I don't want to watch.

296
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,400
Is there a lot of that just generally in that?

297
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,600
I feel like are there multiple unplugs and plugging?

298
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,440
You mean the new moon in the gardens of the galaxy ride?

299
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,140
What they did is it starts off in the ride and they just re use the silhouette element

300
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,360
in this preview show video.

301
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
It's clearly the same.

302
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Yeah.

303
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Yeah.

304
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Yeah.

305
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Like coming soon.

306
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,800
But he, when the robot unplugged something, right.

307
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,960
And then you get on the ride and then the silhouette on well, rocket unplugged, he mutes

308
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
the collector, right?

309
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Is that what happens?

310
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Yeah.

311
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,400
Well, he, yeah, he says, let's mute this guy.

312
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,340
And he says that in the pre show.

313
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,560
And then right before the car takes off is when he goes, when rocket unplugs you and gets

314
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
things rocking.

315
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Is that what he says?

316
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,800
I think he says, and gets things rocking or something.

317
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Something like that.

318
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Yeah.

319
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Yeah.

320
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Let's jam.

321
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Let me see those hands so we can jam.

322
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Did you guys, sorry, go ahead.

323
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,360
I was just going to say a rocket.

324
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,160
Its voice is like the universal studios, New York performers.

325
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Hmm.

326
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Yeah.

327
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Like what are you doing down there, sweetheart?

328
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,680
Let's see those hands.

329
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,920
I respect Bradley Cooper so much as an actor and I'm not going to get on this.

330
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
That's assuming it's him.

331
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
It is.

332
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
I think it is him.

333
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Is it him in the ride?

334
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
I believe it's him.

335
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Yeah.

336
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
I think it's him.

337
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Cause they all did their, they're all in it.

338
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Hmm.

339
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
So it would make sense.

340
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Now you guys, I know we're now not talking about the subject we're supposed to talk about.

341
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Thank God.

342
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Yes.

343
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,380
Has there been, I know this exists, I'm sure on Reddit or something like that, but like,

344
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:14,320
do we know all of the songs that are a part of the gardens of galaxy ride?

345
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Yes.

346
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Yeah.

347
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
There's six.

348
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
It's not that many.

349
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Six of them.

350
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,600
And then the like death metal one in monsters after dark.

351
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,480
Have you done monsters after dark?

352
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
No.

353
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,640
Just Halloween specific, but that guy, one of the guys who scored the movies wrote an

354
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,560
original metal song called monsters after dark, which is the best of all of them.

355
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,800
It's the best ride profile.

356
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Wow.

357
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,880
So does that make it then the best in any of the towers anyway?

358
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,920
Is that the best thing you can do in a tower of terror or a gantry?

359
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
That's a good question.

360
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Depending.

361
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Uh, uh, yes.

362
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Wow.

363
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
I will say yes.

364
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,120
As far as just the lift itself, but not the pre-show.

365
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,200
If there was a way to combine moving car in Florida with monsters after dark.

366
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,080
Here's the ultimate tower ride.

367
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,380
Customize it like a Taco bell order.

368
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,380
That's what I'm going to do.

369
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,000
Uh, it's the, it's the, uh, Tokyo tower.

370
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,240
Pre-show that story and all the story, all of it up.

371
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,920
Then add the fourth dimension room from Florida.

372
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,880
Cause it's not in the Tokyo version.

373
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,400
And then it's the guardians of the galaxy, uh, monsters after dark drops.

374
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Yeah.

375
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,960
Doesn't make any sense, but that's the most thrilling version of the ride.

376
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Yeah.

377
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
I think it's good.

378
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,640
I still like hit me with your best shot.

379
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Really?

380
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Yeah.

381
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
We had today.

382
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Yeah.

383
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
Do you have a favorite?

384
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,560
I think parliament, uh, tear the roof off.

385
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,920
Parliament's really exciting in the, in this little Epcot show.

386
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,120
That's cool to hear and to see the model like spaceship, little mini spaceship birth light

387
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,280
up with like funk colors.

388
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Good stuff.

389
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Jackson five.

390
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Yeah.

391
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Yeah.

392
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Want you back.

393
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Controversial.

394
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,880
Let's not, let's not go saying anything.

395
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
It's still on the ride.

396
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
It's still on the ride.

397
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:01,920
It's after dark here at, uh, monsters after dark takes on a new meaning.

398
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,000
Um, I, okay.

399
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,120
Well to get to go some steps over back over to, uh, back to this 2001 era bar.

400
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,480
I've been drinking since 10 30 in the morning.

401
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,360
Was that a full 90 minutes?

402
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,320
How long have we been just talking right now?

403
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Let me look, let me look.

404
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
You're really zonked son.

405
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
It's 12, 15 minutes.

406
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,800
We were talking about, we were doing the voice of rocket record for 15 straight minutes.

407
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,360
This is how we've time escapes us.

408
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,960
Sometimes when the episodes are two and a half hours, we honestly don't know.

409
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
It's true.

410
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
It's like Jack White.

411
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,680
Jack White says he, um, when he gets off stage, he doesn't really like, he can't remember

412
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,240
what what exactly like, I feel the same way when I go on stage.

413
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I don't remember.

414
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Like a lot of what I've done.

415
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
Yeah.

416
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
I've killed, I've killed.

417
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
No, no, I've killed again.

418
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,040
Um, uh, so, uh, who bar was one of your destinations today?

419
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,080
I, okay.

420
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,520
So yes, I'm very fond of a bar.

421
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
I could probably, there's probably a bigger list.

422
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,400
I may be probably monsters, ink thing.

423
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
I'd let's rather go on.

424
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
There's probably a lot of rides I'd read.

425
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,000
I'd less, because if I'm at that property, probably a good 45 minutes hour to have a

426
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,320
bar is on the, on the short list.

427
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,680
Uh, I lit, I fit, you mentioned it when you were here before, which I was, I think part

428
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,120
of like a, or it was like your salvation in like a bad scenario.

429
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Right?

430
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,920
You talked about this, right?

431
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Yeah.

432
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,040
I took like a stem of mushrooms, maybe.

433
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:44,520
It was when star tours, the initial incarnation of star tours was closing and, uh, the three

434
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,400
friends I went with decided to take mushrooms.

435
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:56,120
I, I'm not, I don't typically do, uh, hallucinogenics or psychedelics.

436
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,880
And I did it in this case, I did a very small amount and it was a bad scene for me.

437
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:10,960
Uh, but at some point midday, probably about, I would imagine four or 5 PM we left Disneyland

438
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,960
into downtown Disney and got a beer at uva bar.

439
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,000
And like it brought me to a place that I was like, Oh my God, now I, I can breathe again

440
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,360
if that makes any sense.

441
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Yeah.

442
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
Wow.

443
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
That's beautiful.

444
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,480
That's what this place offers in a much more minor way.

445
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,320
I just, that's how I feel if I'm just like, uh, tired slightly or got too sweaty or something,

446
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,000
but that's what it is like a breath of fresh air.

447
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,160
Uh, and I'm trying to figure out why, like, cause really, I mean, it's like not the greatest

448
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,160
place you've ever been to, but I think within the Disney property where you lower your expectations,

449
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,700
I think the fact that it's, uh, that it's outdoors, it's very mellow, it's not themed.

450
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:01,320
You can take a break from theming and just be at like a, be at a nice relaxing place.

451
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,920
Uh, good beer and wine and dry.

452
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,440
I haven't like covered the gamut with the menu or anything.

453
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,200
Uh, cause I'm just doing a chardonnay probably.

454
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,920
I have a lot of affection for that early 2000s logo, that uva bar logo.

455
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Do you know what I'm talking about?

456
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Kind of like squiggly.

457
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Yeah.

458
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Yeah.

459
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,080
I was going to say that's one of my least favorite things about it.

460
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
I figure, yes.

461
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,560
I'm font picky.

462
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:30,720
But I, I mean, in terms of like choosing aesthetics, no, but I do like when things from the past

463
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,880
had like Florida, when we were down in Florida, there's some stuff that it's like the nineties

464
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,320
never ended in this.

465
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Oh yeah.

466
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
In this thing.

467
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,520
It's like a city walk entirely.

468
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,860
So I like seeing like different decades of stuff, like little remnants of different decades

469
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,860
of stuff.

470
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,360
We'll trip back to 2001.

471
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Yeah, absolutely.

472
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,480
They're bad fonts though.

473
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,240
They're bright, but you can be nostalgic for, yeah.

474
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,800
That's basically what I'm saying.

475
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,920
Like you acknowledge that like aesthetically, if you were designing something, you would

476
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
say that sucks.

477
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,320
But the katal font is more taste is more tasteful.

478
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Sure.

479
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
Very similar.

480
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
It's kind of similar.

481
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,720
But isn't there just like a blocky or letter?

482
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Am I wrong?

483
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,480
I'm just kind of like a, the katal fonts.

484
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
We really, should we get back to doing the rocket raccoon voice?

485
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
I don't know.

486
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,400
Was that more fun than that?

487
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
So what do you think then about the flute?

488
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,280
Cause you, I only learned recently from you telling me that the champagne flute planters

489
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,200
surrounding uva bar.

490
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,240
That's what, when did you notice this?

491
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,420
That's when you're in uva bar, there's some big planters and they go up in kind of like

492
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:41,160
a funnel shape and I only knew this cause I looked at an article that said there's supposed

493
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,960
to be like big champagne flutes.

494
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,560
No, I did not notice that.

495
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,480
I think we, and we're on the upper echelon of people who like and have thought about

496
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,880
uva bar and we've never noticed that.

497
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,440
While we're speaking generally about it before we, if I don't know how deep we're going to

498
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,000
dive into this, katal is the name of the restaurant that's essentially attached that it's a part

499
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
of.

500
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,080
That it's connected to, which we covered a little, I don't remember when.

501
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,080
I don't either.

502
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,680
It's a whole yesterday, a day before.

503
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
Yeah.

504
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,440
You can't even tell that it's attached to a restaurant.

505
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,360
It's very, to me it's its own thing.

506
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
It's weird.

507
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Do you know what I mean?

508
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Yeah.

509
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
Yeah.

510
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
It's not like there's no connecting.

511
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,960
The first thing I think of is when we were last, last year in the city walk saga, we

512
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,920
were at the Hall of the moon at city walk and there's an outdoor section of, of the

513
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,880
piano bar, how the moon, but we had to have a waiter surf our drinks cause you're not

514
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,440
allowed to bring a drink onto the sidewalk.

515
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,120
So there's a man who was standing there whose job was to take your beer from you or your

516
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,040
big blue bucket of alcohol, put it on a tray and he would have to walk it over.

517
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Like a sidewalk.

518
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Six feet.

519
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Width.

520
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Yeah.

521
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Yeah.

522
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,360
But like really that does give those two things some continuity is my point.

523
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,420
There's not, there's nothing, what you're saying, there's no continuity between the

524
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,560
restaurant and the bar.

525
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,000
There's like two separate entities.

526
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yes.

527
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,040
So I want, maybe I want someone to serve liquor back and forth.

528
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
At least you would know.

529
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
What are you talking about?

530
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,520
You want someone to carry, you want an inconvenient liquor carrying hand.

531
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,360
But at a nice restaurant, like I've eaten at like had a drink in the bar at Spago.

532
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,600
And then when the table was ready, they put their like sir, they carry it.

533
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
They carry your drinks for you.

534
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Spago.

535
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
I've been to Spago.

536
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Is that even around still?

537
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
It is.

538
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
It's tight.

539
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
It is.

540
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Yeah, it's great.

541
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
It's really good.

542
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Recently remodeled the last few years.

543
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Have you been?

544
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
I've been four or five times.

545
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Four or five times to Spago?

546
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Yeah.

547
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
I've known you for like 11 years.

548
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
When did you go to Spago?

549
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
My dad, when my dad comes out.

550
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,600
The first time I, when I was first out here for school by.

551
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
My hands don't scan.

552
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Yeah.

553
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,120
That was one of the things my dad knew.

554
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,120
It's like my car doesn't scan.

555
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
My car doesn't swipe.

556
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,240
Did you say my car doesn't start?

557
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,880
My car won't start.

558
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,120
Spago was such a thing in popular culture, like as a reference point, like a name check

559
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
for years.

560
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
You know who founded it?

561
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Wolfgang.

562
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Yeah, Wolfgang.

563
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,280
He founded it with his hands.

564
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,520
So but now it's like, it's not like the, it's still very popular, but it's not like a place

565
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
anymore.

566
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
It's not like.

567
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,680
It's still very popping.

568
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
It's popular.

569
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,200
It's still popular.

570
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,600
I don't know if it's popping.

571
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,320
I don't know how you gauge that.

572
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,680
That's a tougher, it takes a, yeah, it takes a pretty.

573
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:46,040
I do like that place a lot because it feels like 1989 Beverly Hills and like such a cool

574
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
way.

575
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
It feels like.

576
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,080
Also Wolfgang Buck, if he, if Wolfgang Puck is there, he will come out and shake your

577
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
hand.

578
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Yeah.

579
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Like I have shaken his hand.

580
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
I have shaken Wolfgang's hands.

581
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
You did once?

582
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
I didn't know this.

583
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
How many times?

584
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Just the once, just the once.

585
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,600
Oh, dude, does it do his hands scan?

586
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,560
His hands do scan.

587
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,880
He is a friend of Rocket.

588
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Okay.

589
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
I just wanted to know.

590
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
Wow.

591
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
I'm really impressed now.

592
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
I do, that's familiar.

593
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,560
I've heard you, I've heard you tell tale of shaking.

594
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,600
Of shaking Wolfgang Puck's hand now.

595
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
But I guess.

596
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Wolfgang's hands.

597
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Wolfgang's hands.

598
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Man.

599
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
I want to, I'm sorry.

600
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,600
The problem is Wolfgang's hands don't scan.

601
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,600
He's speaking about Wolfgang Puck's hands.

602
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Yeah.

603
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,600
The problem is me and Wolfgang's hands don't scan.

604
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,040
I tried to get up the gantry lift.

605
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Didn't work.

606
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Then I've got my buddy Wolfgang.

607
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Guess what?

608
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,600
His hands don't scan.

609
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,000
So let's try you guys.

610
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't know.

611
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,480
We should treat ourselves sometime.

612
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
It's not terribly expensive.

613
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
You want to go to Spago?

614
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Yeah.

615
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
It's fun.

616
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Let's go.

617
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
I'll go.

618
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
You never invited me.

619
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Okay.

620
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
It's a him and his dad thing.

621
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
I never thought it was.

622
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
It's a him and his dad.

623
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
It only comes out.

624
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Actually, yeah, you have him.

625
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,280
Will it help grease your palms if I call you daddy?

626
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
Huh?

627
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,480
A lot of daddy talks about that.

628
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,280
Hey, last time I was there, they, I don't know what, it was something where it's like

629
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,440
the weight was a little longer than expected, but like by like five, like no one would have

630
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
noticed.

631
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,000
But they came around to a bunch of the tables and gave everyone like free pizzas.

632
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,480
And they're like, we're so sorry for the delay.

633
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,640
You had the pizza with the fish on it?

634
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,800
Yeah, with the salmon.

635
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
They have a pizza.

636
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:31,600
They're like one big thing is like an interpretation of lox in pizza form.

637
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,200
So it's kind of like a layer of creme fraiche and then salmon and capers.

638
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Delicious.

639
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
It sounds good.

640
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Yeah.

641
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I would eat it.

642
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,000
But you guys want somebody you have to carry your drink to?

643
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,480
Well, I'm just saying, I'm saying what Kyle is saying.

644
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
I kind of, it's.

645
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,920
I felt immediately uncomfortable, honestly, but it was kind of neat.

646
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,520
That is cool in a fancy restaurant, but I think it's good that it's a separate, it doesn't

647
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,360
feel like you're in some overflow of the better.

648
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,960
Katal and I couldn't get into Katal.

649
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,320
You want to like I like more than Katal.

650
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,280
I've never sat down in Katal.

651
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,880
The food, though, is seemingly coming from the restaurant.

652
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,320
The layers have to navigate a pedestrian walkway to get to the bar from the kitchen.

653
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
So shout out to them.

654
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
Yeah, that's full of peril.

655
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,480
And I will say I have eaten the food there.

656
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,120
I don't know if you guys have.

657
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,960
I feel like I've had some sort of flatbread or something, right?

659
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Yeah, everyone is.

660
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
They've had chicken.

661
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
You know, I prepped today.

662
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,080
I did some I did some work.

663
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,040
I got I did at least four things off the menu, but I've eaten there quite a bit.

664
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Yeah.

665
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Oh, geez.

666
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
What's shout out some stuff?

667
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
No, that's off the table.

668
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
I love it.

669
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
I'm a man of research.

670
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
So it's nice knowing you guys.

671
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Today we had the.

672
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:54,160
I will say I definitely recommend the corn are rapes.

673
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
Yes, that's on my list.

674
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
I go back.

675
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
These are good.

676
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
I think this is good food.

677
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
I think that's yeah.

678
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Yeah, that's not even like for theme park.

679
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Yeah, those are really great.

680
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
I'm not sure I had had a rapes before.

681
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
I don't I never get that anywhere.

682
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Yeah, I wait.

683
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
I wrote down what it is from the fried corn cakes.

684
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:12,440
Top of the day, I think it's a little bit of a

685
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,200
fried corn cakes topped with pulled pork, guacamole, cilantro and red onion.

686
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Good stuff.

687
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I was about to say the same thing.

688
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,000
It's very important that I read it.

689
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,800
You can just imagine what it is.

690
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,880
I think there's a lot of things to do with that.

691
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,440
I have like the little like I don't like little shaved pepper topping.

692
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
Anything with that?

693
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
You're looking good.

694
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,320
Do you feel like you just like plugged in holes with food here and not at any rate?

695
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
I don't.

696
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,200
Yeah, I feel like it's just like snack wise.

697
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,800
I've never sat down for the proper uva bar meal.

698
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
I've had drinks, certainly.

699
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,120
Yeah, which is always a nice time.

700
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,000
I feel like uva bar at night is the time to do it.

701
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,760
I feel like I don't feel the magic during the day.

702
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Interesting.

703
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,800
I don't think I've ever been there when it's gotten fully dark.

704
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,280
I mean, it's obviously like everything is better at night at Disneyland, obviously,

705
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
for the most part.

706
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,360
But like it's a good daytime spot.

707
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
It's not bad.

708
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
I don't want to trash.

709
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
I'm not trashing it.

710
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,800
It's a good spot, too, like if you want you want a little like respite from the parks.

711
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,360
I mean, if you guys want to hear the rest of my order, you can.

712
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,520
If you don't want to, I'm cool with that, too.

713
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
I'm interested.

714
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
I would like to hear it.

715
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah, I want to hear it.

716
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I would like to.

717
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Well, we got the corn rapist.

718
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah.

719
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah.

720
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,520
I didn't even know if that's the right way to say that phrase.

721
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,320
Yeah, and I meant to look up a pronunciation.

722
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,000
I think we you know, we had them at Jurassic World.

723
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,920
They serve it in the Jurassic World at Hollywood.

724
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
We're good.

725
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
The little corn cakes.

726
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
Yeah.

727
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
I think I like that item.

728
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,640
You don't see it that often.

729
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,480
Yeah, I do like it.

730
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,560
Yeah.

731
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:53,640
We got the happy hour barbecue chicken flatbread.

732
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,020
I think I've had that.

733
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:03,400
That's the one I've had, which is kind of like a kind of California pizza kitchen.

734
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Ste is if that makes any sense.

735
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Yeah.

736
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

737
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Sure, sure.

738
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
It's fine.

739
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
It's good.

740
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
We got the guacamole.

741
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,000
We got the you got chips with that.

742
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Comes with chips.

743
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Cool.

744
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
There's a bowl with spoon.

745
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Loose guacamole.

746
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
I guess it's not another.

747
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,360
We got the buffalo wings today is the other thing we got.

748
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,720
OK, they're good, but they're very like fluorescent in color.

749
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,640
If that makes any sense, they're like super.

750
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,080
I don't want to say orange, but like just very bright in whatever that color is.

751
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
Yeah.

752
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
Yeah.

753
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,880
But I've had these to have these things, these like street fries, which are really good.

754
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,880
And now I think they have carne asada fries, which maybe are the same thing.

755
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,320
But I think they used to come with chorizo.

756
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
But I do.

757
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,360
I think the food there is good.

758
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
I think it's yeah.

759
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Yeah.

760
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
Yeah.

761
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,040
It's like a quick stop gap.

762
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,080
Like we'll go out of our way to go.

763
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,400
And lines not usually crazy, which some of these newer downtown Disney places they can

764
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,240
be and sometimes deservedly so.

765
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
There's some spots in there now.

766
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,320
But yeah, you can pop in there without a big weight and pretty chill, pretty relaxing.

767
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,880
It does have like an elevated look to it, kind of like the new the new bar at Naples.

768
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,080
Like, it's very well lit.

769
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,800
It's very well lit to trick you into thinking like, oh, this is nice.

770
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,600
This is fancy, but not terribly crazy.

771
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Yeah.

772
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
It is nice.

773
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,520
But like that, no, it's like bar rescue tricks, I'm saying.

774
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,920
Like, you know, perceived value, they say in marketing.

775
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,600
But it's not terribly more expensive than most stuff.

776
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,120
Is it a full 360 bar?

777
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,720
Is it a full 360 around?

778
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
It is right.

779
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
I think so.

780
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Pretty much.

781
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Yeah.

782
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
So that's something special.

783
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Yeah, you're right.

784
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
There's no corners.

785
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
There's no corner seats.

786
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,560
Something feels cool about that.

787
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,080
I will say today, I'd never experienced this before.

788
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,240
Like we were in a section, though a lot of sun coming through.

789
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
OK.

790
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
OK.

791
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,040
So there are some non shaded areas.

792
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Yeah.

793
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
OK.

794
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:27,020
I'd never, but up to that, I've been going to this bar for maybe a decade now and never

795
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,360
had that experience.

796
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,880
But the boys I was with, you know, I was new to them.

797
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,960
I said, like, I'm trying to impress my podcast friends.

798
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
All right.

799
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
All right.

800
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,320
What did the boys think of it?

801
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,600
They all were kind of doing their own private reviews.

802
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,640
They're like, yeah, actually, they're pretty good.

803
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,800
But then one of them was like, I don't know, I got to say, I'll tell you later what I really

804
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
think.

805
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,320
Like he like, give the full review while we were there.

806
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,320
I think I think he had some he had some some.

807
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,400
Did he not ever tell you?

808
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,080
No, I don't know.

809
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,440
I think he thought the food was just like, OK, I think the food because we all eat like

810
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,680
theme park food.

811
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,320
I think this is I think this is better than.

812
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,120
To me, it's like, yeah, than normal.

813
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
I think so.

814
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,960
Yeah, I think I think it's better than most.

815
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
OK.

816
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Anything in the parks that could compete or is better, it probably requires a reservation

817
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,960
or a big old wait.

818
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Yes.

819
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,200
That's what really notches this up, that you're just in there and it's it's happening.

820
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,120
I also want to share a really specific menu item that sounds really mundane.

821
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,320
And yet I like it a lot, which is the trio of Mediterranean dips.

822
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,320
Yes.

823
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
You had the trio of Mediterranean.

824
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,600
Yeah, it's great.

825
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Really good.

826
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,280
Yeah, it's I mean, like, OK, hummus and wait, now I'm not sure which is the one I like.

827
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,800
Hummus, Baba, Baba, Baba, Ghanoush and then Mohamara.

828
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,480
I don't think I've said it out loud.

829
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,560
And I think maybe that's the one that I like.

830
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,600
It's like darker and kind of purplish.

831
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,400
And that is a remarkable little little little hummus you can get anywhere.

832
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,960
But whatever that one is, whatever the mystery third one is, it's so.

833
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,200
Mohamara is a hot pepper dip.

834
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
I bet it's spicy.

835
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Will you show me a pic?

836
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,680
Do you got a picture?

837
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,400
This is just the Wikipedia picture.

838
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,200
It kind of looks like a chutney.

839
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Is it?

840
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
No, it's a hot pepper.

841
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
It is.

842
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
We typically get the dips.

843
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
The dips are great.

844
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,480
Yeah, it's like a good look.

845
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,040
You know, what we keep doing it for is like if we feel like we've indulged too much or

846
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,480
had some big too crazy of a lunch or something and we need like the theme park equivalent

847
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,840
of toast, just something simple just to settle the stomach.

848
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah, something quick before we get on the road.

849
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,280
Oh, traffic died down.

850
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,320
This is perfect for that Aleppo pepper ground walnuts, bread crumbs and olive oil.

851
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
Oh, for sure.

852
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,320
Walnuts.

853
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
That is instantly familiar.

854
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Yeah.

855
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Yeah.

856
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,880
A protein kick to it is so good.

857
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,720
Now that I've I need to get Mohamara, I'm going to make a big deal out of Mohamara like

858
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,160
if you like doing Nutella instead of peanut butter.

859
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,280
Do you think they have the uvibar referee?

860
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,480
I will get topped off.

861
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Hell on the heck.

862
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,040
I mean, if there is some, I'll have it, but I don't want to.

863
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,800
I'll let you get there pouring right now.

864
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Yeah, yeah.

865
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,320
It's a rare drinking episode.

866
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,720
This is only like the third drinking episode.

867
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,920
But it makes.

868
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,360
This is the time to do it.

869
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,840
We're a week into this thing, but we're getting close to it.

870
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,640
We're almost like we're not that far from halfway through, which feels less.

871
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,480
It's so much less punishing than city walk so far.

872
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,160
This is where we're at.

873
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,840
I don't know.

874
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,920
Like in workout, like it feels like I am not winded and we're almost at the halfway point

875
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,040
and that feels great.

876
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,880
Well, I mean, we do seven up.

877
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,860
If you're talking about we do a three episodes on Patreon.

878
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,720
So we do seven episodes a month regularly.

879
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
Oh, you're right.

880
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
So this is about seven.

881
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,920
So we just have to do it again.

882
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
Yeah.

883
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,560
So much better than the 19.

884
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
So much better.

885
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
Yeah.

886
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
Yes.

887
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,960
I wouldn't just kind of I wouldn't recommend doing 19 daily podcasts in a row.

888
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,800
I don't know if you've had the pleasure or will have the opportunity, but I don't know

889
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
what that entails.

890
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,280
Like that means like every day you're recording something.

891
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
What does that mean?

892
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,400
Well, we just I mean, it was spread out over a long amount of time.

893
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,560
It felt for I feel like the city work started took forever.

894
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,560
In my mind.

895
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Are you guys really though?

896
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,000
You go kayfabe or not?

897
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,040
Oh, you're like digging through.

898
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
I don't know what that way.

899
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,520
That's a wrestler wrestling term.

900
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Real life or fair story.

901
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
It's like story.

902
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,720
Or is it and how much are we playing up?

903
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
Yeah.

904
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,800
That was because we were just doing a little cave.

905
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
We could give you the real.

906
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
We'll give you.

907
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
We'll give you.

908
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
You're just asking about us.

909
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:52,040
Maybe you're in Cape in general or his friends or that's what I was asking.

910
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
But how would I be?

911
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,320
I'd be fake like I'm not really trying to add on another bit or something.

912
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
I'm not.

913
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,640
I think he's asking how tight of friends are we?

914
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,760
Oh, that's all it was.

915
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
Right.

916
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,280
Essentially, like I think so.

917
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
Yeah.

918
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,720
I thought that we were asking for like the real schedule of like how we were doing this.

919
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,600
I think what Scott was saying, I think you were digging for psych.

920
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,120
You're digging for for Marin stuff is what you're asking.

921
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,800
I'll answer all any question.

922
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,400
I'll answer both of those.

923
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Don't care too much.

924
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,200
We have taken the lessons of our foolhardy early years of podcasting and tried to go

925
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,720
a little easier on ourselves.

926
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,040
That's not answering the question, though.

927
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,520
I don't think I think it's a fair answer.

928
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,200
No, I mean, we're friends in real life and we just had a big, big great trip to Orlando

929
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
together.

930
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
You know what?

931
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,960
I think the biggest thing, because it's a bummer, is that we now I feel like we hang

932
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,480
out for podcast purposes because there's so much of this to do.

933
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Yes, I agree.

934
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
And then we don't make a point of let's just hang out, not know.

935
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,200
It's why the trip was wonderful to hang, even though it still is all we had in Rick.

936
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,160
Well, we hadn't recorded on Saturdays in a while.

937
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,800
I feel like when we tend to record on Saturdays, we'll get a bite to eat or get a drink after.

938
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,480
So we haven't done that in a while, though.

939
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
Yeah, it is.

940
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,960
We got to remember to like put in the time.

941
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,520
What was the relationship prior to the podcast starting?

942
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,480
Well, you know, what's interesting is they were Mike and Jason.

943
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,480
You guys are an improv team.

944
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,880
So we you know, you have to make that blood oath for better or worse.

945
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,440
And Mike and I were friends separately and then we'd all hung out as a unit.

946
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,560
But I do think the podcast has resulted in specifically the Scott Jason friendship.

947
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Yes, I would say so.

948
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,000
The beginning, yes, we just hadn't had the chance, right?

949
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,160
So it has the last line in the triangle really forms.

950
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,960
I. Yeah.

951
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,640
But it's pretty cool, right?

952
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,640
It's great.

953
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,840
It's pretty touching, right?

954
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,360
I love being creative.

955
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Sure.

956
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,960
No, it is.

957
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,640
It's awesome, obviously, to meet people and to form friendships.

958
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,240
And that's so vague.

959
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm so sorry, but like, I think that's true.

960
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,080
Making adult friendships is a difficult thing.

961
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,160
So that's awesome.

962
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,160
Very difficult.

963
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,280
Yeah, they say especially once you get into your 30s, like, yeah, it's even harder.

964
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
That's correct.

965
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,040
And I yeah, I will say this podcast especially has been a reason to like, yeah, these are

966
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,760
like yeah, like, yeah, you guys are like much more recent friends.

967
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,920
Yeah, friend that I've had.

968
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
You're making us.

969
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,720
You've got to like sweet, genuine things here.

970
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
Well, cheers.

971
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Yeah, it's very.

972
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Yeah, it's.

973
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
I brought the whiskey to.

974
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Into the champagne.

975
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
I'm not going to take a little.

976
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
We may go back down.

977
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
We may go back down to a bar after this.

978
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
I mean, I think it's a ballast.

979
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
All right.

980
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
Hell, yeah.

981
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Mike, please do not mix it with your champagne.

982
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
That's gross.

983
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
That's horrible.

984
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
I can do it.

985
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
I'm going to do it.

986
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
I'm going to do it.

987
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
I'm going to do it.

988
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
I'm going to do it.

989
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
I'm going to do it.

990
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
I'm going to do it.

991
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
I'm going to do it.

992
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
I'm going to do it.

993
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
I'm going to do it.

994
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,320
That's horrible.

995
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
I can do it.

996
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:11,280
I put tequila in wine at Dave Ferguson's bachelor party and I got very sick.

997
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
So don't do that.

998
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,080
Like immediately sick or sick later?

999
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,080
I'd have both.

1000
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
All the guys.

1001
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Yeah, that's.

1002
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,400
You poured your tequila into the wine.

1003
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,640
I was like, I think I'd been like really pent up and I'm going to really I'm going to be

1004
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,840
an idiot this weekend.

1005
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,480
It's good.

1006
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,360
This is I don't.

1007
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,760
So Mike just took a pug.

1008
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,160
I want to say a pug is a thing.

1009
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
A pug.

1010
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
It's a dog.

1011
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
A plug.

1012
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
You have a dog in front of you.

1013
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
He's driving me nuts.

1014
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
He's about to knock over the whole area.

1015
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,800
I don't know where it's from.

1016
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,840
This was in my house.

1017
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
A pug.

1018
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,840
You took a pug.

1019
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
I feel like that's a thing.

1020
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Like I took a pug.

1021
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,840
Like I took like a little like a shot of it out of the bottle, but maybe I'm making that

1022
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,840
up.

1023
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
I don't know if that's a phrase.

1024
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,240
I've never heard that before, but it's like it's a cute little three cent or three word.

1025
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,160
Mike just took a pug of the whiskey over there.

1026
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,240
In context clues, you understand what it means.

1027
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
How do you feel?

1028
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Are you do you?

1029
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,640
You're well, you're more of a sipper that you probably aren't like, you know, do you

1030
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,600
like to throw him down too often?

1031
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,680
Yeah, I'm more of a sipper.

1032
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,160
I think I can I can handle it.

1033
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,760
Like I think I can still go if we need to go.

1034
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,480
Like, go if we need to go.

1035
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,960
You mean, no, no, no.

1036
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,560
If we like all of a sudden, start like hard drinking.

1037
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
Oh, OK.

1038
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1039
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Like we had to.

1040
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,480
I don't really want to because like it's, you know, it's a weeknight.

1041
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Yeah, but you're at home.

1042
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,840
Yeah, I got my week off, dude.

1043
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
I'm chilling.

1044
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
All right.

1045
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Yeah, you've got the rare week off.

1046
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
You were very intense.

1047
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
That's what your job is.

1048
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
There's a Buffalo Wild Wings.

1049
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,760
It's open 2 a.m. very close to here.

1050
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,000
We can go right after.

1051
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
That's Mike's superpower.

1052
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,160
He knows any anywhere he is, he knows where the closest Buffalo Wild Wings.

1053
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Yeah, absolutely.

1054
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,200
If you guys want to hang at the I'm down for whatever I have nothing to do.

1055
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,880
We'll go right there.

1056
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,080
I'm ready.

1057
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,400
I think I think it's open unless it's only maybe they're open one on the weeknights.

1058
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
There's also a Barney's Beannery.

1059
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,000
So to be an asshole.

1060
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,760
But if the Buffalo Wild Wings is not open, I don't want to hang out with you guys otherwise.

1061
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
You know what?

1062
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,520
It's important to set boundaries.

1063
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
I understand.

1064
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,320
No, that's that's the attraction.

1065
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,000
That actually speaking of friendship, that you just opened up a window.

1066
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,400
You just by allowing me or inviting me into that, you're saying like you'd be down to

1067
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,800
extend the extend this past this thing, which to me is very meaningful.

1068
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Yes.

1069
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,760
No, of course, I would be happy to extend.

1070
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm extending the pass.

1071
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,680
Yeah, for sure.

1072
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
No question.

1073
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,680
And did I just make this awkward?

1074
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,680
No, I'm just made it weird.

1075
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,400
I think I'm seeing two AM.

1076
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
I'm seeing two AM.

1077
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,880
It's when the Buffalo Wild Wings closes.

1078
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Just saying.

1079
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
Just saying.

1080
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,960
Do we need to move to balance point?

1081
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
Maybe.

1082
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Possibly.

1083
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,360
I said everything I needed to say.

1084
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,600
Look how much talking about it put us in this great mood.

1085
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,280
Like and now we just are like I feel like I'm at Uva.

1086
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Have it like.

1087
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Yeah.

1088
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
Having a glaven.

1089
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
We are in that kind of circular.

1090
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,280
I guess that's yes.

1091
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,280
360.

1092
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
Just like Uva.

1093
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,480
I will say I think the last time I was here and I could be fully misremembering this so

1094
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:38,200
I apologize if I am but and I remember telling this to you Scott that like Uva I swear specifically

1095
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,040
used to have a specific soundtrack that was like old school R&B.

1096
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,400
It was like Earth, Wind and Fire, Cool and the Gang, Shaka Khan, like kind of that steez.

1097
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Really?

1098
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,040
And now I think is it right that Downtown Disney is just all like kind of the same Disney

1099
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
soundtrack?

1100
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,040
Pop music.

1101
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,520
Oh there's more Disney than there.

1102
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,640
I think that it's like not even like individual stuff.

1103
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,960
I feel like you're hearing whatever they plug throughout the entire zone.

1104
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,680
I think maybe they're keeping the theming going like as soon as you get on property.

1105
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,520
Because we were there today and I think it was like maybe even Christmas music but it

1106
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,600
used to be I feel like Uva by I remember specifically like oh it's cool they're playing like Earth,

1107
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,000
Wind and Fire or something like that.

1108
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah.

1109
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,200
Didn't you see you were down there and you saw like a band that was you saw like a covers

1110
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,840
band of this kind of thing or.

1111
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,760
I don't know if that was at that might have been at California Adventure.

1112
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,480
Yeah yeah yeah that's so yeah.

1113
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,840
You know Donna band maybe or what are they called like hmm during like Food and Wine

1114
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,280
Fest like.

1115
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,000
We saw Yachtly Crew.

1116
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You were with us right?

1117
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
No I wasn't.

1118
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,400
Oh I sent you pictures of Yachtly Crew.

1119
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Not okay with me.

1120
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,440
The first time of this of two times that I've seen Yachtly Crew.

1121
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
Oh man.

1122
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
In different spots.

1123
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,440
That's the whole thing.

1124
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,440
Yes.

1125
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,880
I think this was that same.

1126
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,880
That stage.

1127
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,880
Period.

1128
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,920
And like that was like I love all of that stuff because it's like you hear like some

1129
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,360
Bruno Mars tracks.

1130
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,840
Yeah.

1131
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,640
Not much more to say other than the fact that it's cool to hear that.

1132
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,680
Well and that's a Disney escape.

1133
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,660
Hopefully it isn't just they aren't just playing Someday My Prince Will Come in the mall because

1134
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:35,880
you need a I don't know I think you need those escapes so you can dive back into the immersive

1135
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,720
Disney-ness wanting more.

1136
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,440
You were saying Scott I think you did Grad Night at Disney.

1137
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
Yeah.

1138
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,320
And they played pop music on Main Street.

1139
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,280
Oh no yeah that I didn't like.

1140
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,280
Which you said was bad.

1141
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,280
Yes.

1142
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,280
But then I.

1143
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,440
My high school Grad Night where you're hearing like Usher's Yeah.

1144
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,440
Oh yeah.

1145
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,440
In Frontierland.

1146
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
It's not a fan.

1147
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,320
I think that's so bizarre though for one off night though.

1148
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,320
It seems fun.

1149
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,280
I think I don't know if everyone here got to experience the show during the summer of

1150
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,680
Mickey's Mix Magic which I think I declared we do an episode and we have not done an episode

1151
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,680
about yet.

1152
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
I'm sorry.

1153
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,720
But Mickey's Mix Magic has an original song about Mickey getting getting your ears on

1154
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,880
is what they say.

1155
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,200
You know that's a phrase they're using.

1156
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,320
I think to me enjoy yourself.

1157
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,560
Come on everybody get your ears on.

1158
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,560
That's like.

1159
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,560
Come on everybody.

1160
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,560
Either getting hard or cramming.

1161
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,560
That's how Mickey says it.

1162
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,560
I think it's both.

1163
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,160
Mickey talks a bit.

1164
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,000
I think you have to get hard to cram.

1165
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,320
So but at Halloween he says let's boo this.

1166
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
Yeah.

1167
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,080
And then and that means cramming.

1168
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,240
Yeah.

1169
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,320
A lot of things Mickey says means cramming.

1170
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,480
It's all in there.

1171
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,360
It's all there.

1172
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,200
But there that's a very look that's like a very modern song to hear on Main Street.

1173
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
And I loved it.

1174
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,200
I was so excited.

1175
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,200
Now wait a minute.

1176
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,240
Did you when we were in Orlando did you catch any of move it shake it mouse could dance

1177
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,240
it.

1178
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
I know what you're talking.

1179
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,160
Dance it I think is a war crime.

1180
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,320
Someone needs to be held responsible for the copyrighted phrase mouse could dance.

1181
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,960
I did not see it.

1182
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,960
We we.

1183
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,960
I walked by it.

1184
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,960
I would.

1185
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,960
There's a lot of things we missed.

1186
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,120
They were definitely mouse could dancing.

1187
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,120
Yeah.

1188
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:24,120
We you and I both experienced a thing we didn't know existed.

1189
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Yes.

1190
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,120
The rainy day.

1191
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,960
Oh, because it rained very hard this one day.

1192
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,960
Yeah.

1193
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,960
In Disney World.

1194
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,440
And so and so what happened.

1195
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,960
Characters come out and they're slickers like umbrellas and stuff.

1196
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,040
And umbrellas and they have a song.

1197
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,480
They have an original song and we'll Lindsay and I are walking down Main Street.

1198
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,000
That was the last thing we did before we left for L.A. and we were we loved it.

1199
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,200
We were so excited about it.

1200
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,920
So some characters just in their regular outfits, which they didn't have.

1201
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,160
Look, not every character had a slicker.

1202
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
Not every character.

1203
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,160
It's yeah.

1204
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,320
So I agree on the word slicker together.

1205
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,040
Well, I noticed Jason said I noticed that is funny.

1206
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,360
If you want a little peek behind the process, Jason said slicker.

1207
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,840
I went, oh, slickers funny.

1208
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Yeah.

1209
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,920
Keep saying it seriously and everyone will enjoy it.

1210
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
That's trick.

1211
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,920
And I'll say, yeah.

1212
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,920
And some characters had slickers.

1213
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,920
That's what we learned.

1214
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,200
And you know, that's how you do the trick.

1215
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,240
That's once is a phenomenon, twice a coincidence, three times a pattern.

1216
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,240
We took improv five.

1217
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,240
And that's how comedy works.

1218
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,320
Chad Carter in 2009.

1219
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
We learned that 10 years ago.

1220
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
That's tight as hell.

1221
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,480
So you got the drunker you guys get, the more you name check improv theories.

1222
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,480
Yeah, that's right.

1223
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,480
Man, hell yeah.

1224
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,480
Hell yeah, daddy.

1225
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,480
So all right.

1226
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,480
Ballast point.

1227
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,480
Ballast point.

1228
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,480
I have some ballast point stuff.

1229
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,000
Ballast point.

1230
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,480
San Diego in the house.

1231
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,240
Yeah, that's the thing.

1232
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,240
Yeah.

1233
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,120
You must have been when you find out this was your stage, you must have lost your shit.

1234
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,920
Uh, yup.

1235
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:08,240
Speaking of third time is a pattern ballast point like Sanuk and a sunglass icon by Sunglass

1236
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,240
Hut.

1237
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,240
This ballast point in 2015 joined the Constellation Brands family.

1238
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,640
The beverage magnet Constellation Brands bought them for one billion dollars.

1239
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,080
Wait, those other places are also Constellation Brands?

1240
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,080
No, no.

1241
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,600
In terms of like Sunglass Hut is part of Lux Optica, if you'll recall.

1242
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,960
Sanuk is part of a shoe monopoly.

1243
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,040
Constellation Brands is another.

1244
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:41,240
Constellation also owns Corona, Modelo, Pacifico, Spedka Vodka, Paul Mason.

1245
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,240
Oh, Paul Mason.

1246
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,400
Oh, the French.

1247
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,800
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

1248
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,280
Oh, that's good.

1249
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:56,960
But that was, and I don't claim to be an expert by any means, but that this was controversial,

1250
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,960
I think.

1251
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,960
It was, yeah.

1252
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,320
Within the craft beer community.

1253
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,320
Yeah.

1254
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:11,880
But yes, like I'm, I'm from San Diego and like they, we kind of claim craft beer is

1255
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,920
a thing for like, that's a thing about our city.

1256
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,000
Dallas Point started there.

1257
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Yeah.

1258
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,120
But when Dallas Point essentially like, yeah, when they like kind of were sold to this company,

1259
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:30,120
like then I think even like people within that culture and community turned their backs

1260
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,520
on it.

1261
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,160
It felt like a sell, like a corporate move, if that makes any sense.

1262
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:44,120
Also I have bad news and it seems like consumers have also turned their backs on it because,

1263
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:49,460
and I do have to give away my connection to this.

1264
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,800
This is from the website, Good Beer Hunting, an article written by my college roommate,

1265
00:49:53,800 --> 00:50:05,160
Brian Roth, an award winning beer writer, wrote an article about some of Dallas Point's misfortunes.

1266
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:12,640
Production fell by about 110,000 barrels between 2016 and 2018.

1267
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:20,040
And the first half of 2019, the Dallas Point family of brands had sold just under a third

1268
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,360
of the packaged product it did in all of 2018.

1269
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:29,360
I want to, I want to get ahead of this and say like, first of all, like I love you, Dallas

1270
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,360
Point.

1271
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,360
I love your beer.

1272
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,360
Truly.

1273
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,320
Like I'm not believing the hype.

1274
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,640
Like you guys are doing your own thing.

1275
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,640
Go ahead, Jason.

1276
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,640
I'll say.

1277
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:44,120
The Dallas Point location, downtown Disney is always packed.

1278
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,280
I think I had a beer there once because we've gone before and we haven't gotten it.

1279
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,280
Like it's just too crowded.

1280
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,280
I haven't gotten in there.

1281
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,680
I haven't gone to this place.

1282
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,680
We've tried it.

1283
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,960
Why are you guys doing a podcast about this thing you've never been to?

1284
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,960
I've been.

1285
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
I've had a beer before.

1286
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,960
We are punishing ourselves.

1287
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,960
Yeah, we have been.

1288
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,960
I mean it's good.

1289
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,600
We tried to have a meal a couple of times and the line is out the door.

1290
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,600
It's insane.

1291
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,160
It's like a yourself get a number sort of thing.

1292
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,840
It was chill today.

1293
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
That's good.

1294
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,840
You got in there today.

1295
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:21,200
I genuinely think the beer there, the sculpin is the, is the name, is the most maybe famous

1296
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
like around beer.

1297
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,080
And so they've got like a pineapple sculpin.

1298
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,520
They've got a grapefruit sculpin.

1299
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,800
They've got the regular sculpin.

1300
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,280
I think this is a beer I love actually.

1301
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:37,200
I will like go to my, I wanted to bring you guys a six pack of the grapefruit sculpin

1302
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,200
because it's one of my favorites.

1303
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
It's my favorite beer.

1304
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
Yes.

1305
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,200
That's great.

1306
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,280
But that is a $15 six pack.

1307
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,280
And that's true.

1308
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,280
On message boards.

1309
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,280
People are arguing about a beer he likes.

1310
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,280
The price is $15.

1311
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,280
It's good.

1312
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,440
You, Mr. Spongel is upset about the price.

1313
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,820
There's a lot more craft brewers than when Ballast Point started.

1314
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:09,840
And there is a lot of cheaper craft brewers doing the same quality at the price point.

1315
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,920
I will say right now, like I walked into this scenario knowing that we were going to talk

1316
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,720
about Ballast Point and I did like zero research and I'm realizing like you guys have not done

1317
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,120
any research about your craft beer.

1318
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:26,200
Wait, wait, Ballast Point grapefruit sculpin is $12.

1319
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,200
That's a big difference.

1320
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,760
I have to know a little stuff about this because like it is from where I'm from.

1321
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,000
So I have to like at least like pretend to know.

1322
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
It's like, yeah, sure.

1323
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,480
It would be like deep dish pizza.

1324
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,480
Yeah.

1325
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,200
It's like part of the culture and like which it's like probably one of the primary San Diego

1326
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,200
culinary things.

1327
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:50,560
Besides like California burritos or like carne asada burritos or something like that.

1328
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,560
Sure.

1329
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,040
I'm just, I'm looking, look, I'm looking it up just now on Target and you can get it for

1330
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,040
$12.

1331
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,040
$12 is a difference.

1332
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,040
Well, Jason's right.

1333
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,040
It's super expensive.

1334
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,320
It is expensive compared to similar craft beers.

1335
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,320
Grapefruit?

1336
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,320
Who gives a shit about grapefruit?

1337
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,320
What are you talking about?

1338
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,320
Grapefruit is the deal.

1339
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,320
Grapefruit is the important thing.

1340
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,320
Jason's so sad.

1341
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,320
We're talking about fun beers.

1342
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:19,200
Golden Road right down the road sold to a similar amount to Anheuser-Busch a number

1343
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,200
of years ago.

1344
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,200
You're raising your voice, Jason.

1345
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,200
A cheaper price point.

1346
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,200
You're raising your voice.

1347
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,200
Because I'm right.

1348
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,800
You're doing that thing where like why are you doing that?

1349
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,280
Like it is true that it's super expensive.

1350
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,720
I think you're too upset about a fun beer.

1351
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,320
I'm looking, okay, I'm going to look up grapefruit beer.

1352
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,280
But I will say like, wait, why are you looking up grapefruit?

1353
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,560
The price of citrus isn't comparable.

1354
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,560
I'm comparing.

1355
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,600
The price of citrus is now the best.

1356
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,400
We're talking about grapefruit, the best of all of these.

1357
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,560
I mean, that's my favorite of the sculpin flavors.

1358
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,560
Of the sculpin.

1359
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:52,320
I'm talking about Southern California IPA centric craft brewery.

1360
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,320
That's what I'm talking about.

1361
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,640
Take a deep uva bar style bread.

1362
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,280
Hey, give Jason a swig of this whiskey, I think.

1363
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,920
Oh, I don't like that.

1364
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,920
I'm driving after that.

1365
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,920
That's all.

1366
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
You're all good.

1367
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,400
We're going to Buffalo Wild Wings after this.

1368
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,280
You'll have a couple of beers to calm down.

1369
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,680
What do you like about the beer?

1370
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,680
You like the beer.

1371
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,520
So here's the thing.

1372
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:22,560
I'm almost embarrassed to talk about this stuff because I don't feel informed in the

1373
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,520
way that I would love to feel informed.

1374
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,360
But I do like quote craft beer.

1375
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:34,520
And San Diego, as I said, is a spot that it's like, I don't know, San Diego, Portland.

1376
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,520
I don't know.

1377
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,200
There are like a few of these craft beer cities.

1378
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:47,640
Were these when you in like your early drinking career did not until I was basically outside

1379
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,960
of college, did I realize that San Diego, I went to college in L.A.

1380
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,920
I didn't even realize about Ballast Point's existence until I was probably until it was

1381
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,920
like already a thing.

1382
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,920
Sure, sure.

1383
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,360
And then it had to be 21 anyway to go to the places.

1384
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,480
Company which I'm sorry, I forgot the name of.

1385
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,640
Oh, Constellation Brands.

1386
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:15,920
Scott, they also have they bought Robert Mondavi for one point three six billion.

1387
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,200
I knew of it like before it sold to that company like probably two years or three years before

1388
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,120
that, if that makes any sense.

1389
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:30,760
You ever go to any of the San Diego restaurants or to like they have a they have they had

1390
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:35,320
a spot in Scripps Ranch, which is where I'm from in Miramar.

1391
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,160
And Scripps Ranch is truly like my neighborhood.

1392
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,880
And I did go there and I heard about it before I ever went there.

1393
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:51,160
So it was a thing where I was like, oh, there's a craft brew place called Ballast Point.

1394
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:58,520
And it was kind of a zone for people to meet up at and hang out at.

1395
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,760
And so I knew the name and I don't know the Mid-Aughts or whatever.

1396
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,760
Sure, sure.

1397
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,760
Yeah.

1398
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,600
They're like pretty good aesthetically.

1399
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,480
I've only seen pictures of this restaurant downtown.

1400
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,440
Or like, I don't know if you can speak to the San Diego ones, but it seems like they're

1401
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,280
like cool inside, good graphic design.

1402
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,880
Very cool and I will say we hung out at the Ballast Point in downtown Disney today.

1403
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,160
And the dude who served us, very nice guy.

1404
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:32,520
They have specific beers they're brewing just for that downtown Disney zone.

1405
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,520
Wow.

1406
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:39,800
And I believe the guy's name is Chris Klein, who is who is the head brewer at downtown

1407
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,480
Disney and Long Beach.

1408
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:49,440
They have a Long Beach spot as well.

1409
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,920
But they have beers that are only being brewed for just that Ballast Point in downtown Disney.

1410
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,920
Wow.

1411
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:04,480
And these people, the way the dude spoke to us, like he cared about beer seemingly.

1412
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,080
And I don't know if that matters to you or to people, but like it was nice to hear.

1413
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,520
Like he seemingly was like, is there something I'm into?

1414
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:21,920
And like, yeah, they make this, this guy who came up with this recipe used to be a lawyer

1415
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,840
and he decided he wanted to brew beer and this is the one he came up with.

1416
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
Wow.

1417
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,120
Which is very sweet, I thought.

1418
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,120
Yeah.

1419
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,120
Yeah.

1420
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,720
This is the first brewery at the Disney property.

1421
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,720
Right.

1422
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,720
Or in downtown Disney.

1423
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,680
So the first like, you know, they're obviously plenty of places you can drink, but the first

1424
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,400
place where beer is being actually made on property.

1425
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,400
So that's cool.

1426
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,960
And a fun, I think it's an interesting like sign of the times that build a bear workshop

1427
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,680
is replaced by, I think it shows who's going to downtown Disney and Disney.

1428
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,920
It's sort of like less kids, a little and more, more young adults and people who want

1429
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,920
to get drunk.

1430
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,240
You can take, there are six pack or like tall boys you can take to go.

1431
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:13,080
So if you're like staying at a hotel or even if you just want like a broader selection,

1432
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:18,840
then what's at your grocery, you can get it to, you know, take and have those in the room.

1433
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,840
Yeah.

1434
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,000
This pre our overnight for excited talking about that.

1435
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,880
I feel like I got too excited for this show.

1436
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,880
No.

1437
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,880
Yeah.

1438
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,120
Then that was all that was all pretty sincere.

1439
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:36,680
I know we're like, I feel like I'm a beer and wine fan, but I could not like, I couldn't

1440
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,200
like talk about a flavor for more than five words.

1441
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,200
You know what I mean?

1442
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,200
Yeah.

1443
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Even that.

1444
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:51,680
I feel generally defensive because like this brand specifically represents craft beer,

1445
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:58,680
but they got a bat, like, and they're from my city, the city I grew up in, but they sold,

1446
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:07,640
they like, you know, became, they sold to like some major corporation or whatever.

1447
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:12,680
And thereby like people who love quote craft beer, then started talking shit about it because

1448
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,680
it gets like, they sold out.

1449
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,680
Exactly.

1450
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,680
Yeah.

1451
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,720
Which I think a lot of this happens a lot.

1452
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,720
This happens a lot in life these days.

1453
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,720
Sure.

1454
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,720
Yeah.

1455
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,960
But I think in the craft beer world, it happens a lot because like beverage distribution is

1456
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,560
like, there's only like two or three like main distributors.

1457
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,880
But I'm saying that's why you can't get like yingling this far west.

1458
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,320
It's like difficult.

1459
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:41,720
So when places of this size, like of a craft brewer of ballast point or golden road size,

1460
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,200
when they want to expand, they need more resources.

1461
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,160
Like you need to hook up with a bigger.

1462
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,160
Sure.

1463
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,160
Sure.

1464
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,880
Or also like the people who started those brands have the chance to make a lot of money.

1465
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,200
Oh yeah, they also make some scratch.

1466
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,200
Thing I'm talking about.

1467
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,200
Make some scratch.

1468
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,200
Yeah.

1469
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,200
You got to get it.

1470
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,200
You got to cash in baby.

1471
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,600
You know, you don't know how to be mad about it, Jason.

1472
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,600
That's all I'm saying.

1473
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,600
No, Jason, I'm mad.

1474
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,600
What am I mad about?

1475
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,600
You were raising your viewer.

1476
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,600
Are you mad at me?

1477
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,600
I don't understand what you were saying.

1478
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,880
Oh, the price is too expensive.

1479
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,880
It's too expensive.

1480
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,560
It's a higher like they, and they position themselves too.

1481
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:23,160
Like there's a season of Top Chef where like it's, it's like the California season and

1482
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,560
like every other shot someone's drinking a ballast point and in the other shots, everyone's

1483
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,240
drinking Perrier.

1484
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,840
So like they're trying to like.

1485
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,840
Oh, be the bump up.

1486
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,840
Be the bump up.

1487
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,840
I see.

1488
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,840
Sort of option.

1489
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,920
The with beer in general though, I like, I think I'll drink whatever.

1490
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,920
I don't really care.

1491
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,920
It doesn't.

1492
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,920
It doesn't.

1493
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,640
The boy is back in town.

1494
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,140
I could maybe identify, oh, this is a stout.

1495
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,200
This is an IPA.

1496
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,160
I could say this is better than the other.

1497
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,680
But I do think, cause I like, you know, look, I like a sugary drink when they got the fruit

1498
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,740
in the beer.

1499
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,040
That's when I, I go crazy.

1500
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,000
You go a little crazy.

1501
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
You go a little crazy.

1502
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,040
For me at least, which is what crazy for me.

1503
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,040
You had a little more of a pug.

1504
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,360
How's that pug hitting you?

1505
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,360
Oh good.

1506
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,440
I feel, I have that warmth, that like whiskey warmth that you get.

1507
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,440
Nice.

1508
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,440
But.

1509
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,440
The kind that Jason refuses to have.

1510
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,440
Yeah.

1511
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,440
Come on, Jason, do it.

1512
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,440
What?

1513
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,440
Get a little swig.

1514
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,440
Pug.

1515
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,440
I think that's a sparkling wine.

1516
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,440
Get a little pug though.

1517
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,240
Is this a new word?

1518
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,240
Yeah.

1519
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,240
You created a new word.

1520
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,240
I thought it was a thing, dude.

1521
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,240
Swig.

1522
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,240
Swig is the thing you're thinking of.

1523
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,240
Is it like you take a plug of it?

1524
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,760
You take a quick pug of a, of a booth.

1525
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,760
Hold on.

1526
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,760
Maybe.

1527
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,760
Maybe you're right.

1528
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,760
Maybe.

1529
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,760
I don't know.

1530
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,760
I always say, I swear.

1531
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,760
I'm sure you guys are right that I'm.

1532
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,760
Swig is the word I always would use.

1533
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,760
I know swig is a word.

1534
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,760
I know.

1535
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,760
I'm not saying you didn't like the sound of pug.

1536
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,760
I like the sound of pug.

1537
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,760
I know I like the sound of pug.

1538
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,760
Pug, swig.

1539
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,960
Both G's at the end.

1540
01:01:53,960 --> 01:02:03,640
Do you have fun as also for also theme park, San Diego beer brand, Carl Strauss?

1541
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,880
Love it.

1542
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,360
But that's like, I knew of that.

1543
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,600
That's a different, and these are all abstract thoughts.

1544
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:19,720
Like I knew of that when I was growing up and like, Oh, that's a place that has a brewery

1545
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:24,360
that exists here.

1546
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:32,120
But Ballast Point represented like quote craft beer in a way that Carl Strauss didn't.

1547
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,120
Does that make any sense?

1548
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,120
Like, yeah, yeah.

1549
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:38,240
It's like, like IPA or whatever it was that they were doing.

1550
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,240
Well the appraisal.

1551
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:44,000
Just felt like not too far away from Samuel Adams or something at her.

1552
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Oh sure.

1553
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Yeah.

1554
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I don't know where Carl Strauss is from, but I've always known Ballast Point is from San

1555
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Diego.

1556
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,320
Like I know it's like a hometown.

1557
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,400
Like they put it on the cans and bottles and stuff.

1558
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,120
It was like, this is a hometown thing.

1559
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,400
Is it worth going to those San Diego ones?

1560
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,000
If I'm in the area?

1561
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,160
I was at the Little Italy one this July.

1562
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,480
It was cool.

1563
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,680
I think anywhere in San Diego is worth it to go because San Diego rules and we love

1564
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:16,160
what you guys are doing.

1565
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,560
Keep that spirit alive, San Diego guys and gals.

1566
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,760
Not a lot of people are repping San Diego these days.

1567
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,120
You know, Tony Gwynn passed away, but he killed it.

1568
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:28,400
He was one of the best hitters of all time.

1569
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,200
Lindsay Katys from San Diego.

1570
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,200
Yeah, that's right.

1571
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,920
Lindsay, I'd love to talk to you about that.

1572
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,760
She's upstairs playing with a dog.

1573
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,760
She's got his track.

1574
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,760
Then we'll find a minute.

1575
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,760
Do you not like me?

1576
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:48,520
I saw Padres game and after the at Jack Murphy and after the game, Beach Boys with Stamos

1577
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,840
like with part of the same ticket.

1578
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,080
I think I saw the Beach Boys play there too.

1579
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:56,360
I think I saw the Doobie Brothers post Michael McDonald.

1580
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,560
Okay, but post Padres?

1581
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,560
Post the show.

1582
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,400
That was a thing they were doing.

1583
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:10,080
I remember knowing, I'm just having this thought now, knowing that you, I like that music.

1584
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,080
We shared this.

1585
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,680
The soft, the yacht AOR.

1586
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,240
I remember this.

1587
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:21,600
I was not super into that music per se when I was in fourth grade or whatever.

1588
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,560
Sure, yeah.

1589
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:31,160
I remember being at a Padres game and there was a concert after the fact and a dude who

1590
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:37,920
is sitting next to myself and my father being like, oh, the Doobie Brothers is playing?

1591
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,240
Michael McDonald's not a part of the band anymore.

1592
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,640
He really like firm.

1593
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,640
So fuck these guys.

1594
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,640
So he knew it.

1595
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,640
He knew.

1596
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,640
He's like, it's not the same.

1597
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,640
Michael McDonald's not in the band.

1598
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,200
It's not going to be as soulful, but we still might get like the pre.

1599
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:02,720
I've heard it quantified as like, I've even heard people say like, you know, good Doobie

1600
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,480
Brothers and then Michael McDonald Doobie Brothers.

1601
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,080
Are you out of your mind?

1602
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,240
Are you out of your mind?

1603
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,440
People treat that like, oh, Blackwater.

1604
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,240
That's probably, is that pre Michael McDonald?

1605
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,840
I would never listen to that.

1606
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:22,720
I need, but like a live album where he's doing it with them.

1607
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,120
You got that distinct voice.

1608
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,520
Was he with the Doobie Brothers?

1609
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,520
Like 77, 78.

1610
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,520
Oh, it's a very short, right?

1611
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,800
He made his mark as a Steely Dan backup vocalist.

1612
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
Right.

1613
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,800
Yeah.

1614
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,800
Yeah.

1615
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,800
Yeah.

1616
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,400
Plucked in via Jeff Skunk Baxter and just really shaped the band.

1617
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,400
Keep rolling.

1618
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,800
Just really, you know, Latter Day Edition who made a big difference, just like Bill Champlin

1619
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,800
in Chicago.

1620
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,040
I know that's not what this podcast is about.

1621
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,040
But it also is.

1622
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,040
It can be.

1623
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,880
And you know, that's, you guys, you get talking about improv theory and I get talking about

1624
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,880
session musicians.

1625
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,240
Let's talk more about that.

1626
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,800
What we learned in Chad Carter's class, Jason.

1627
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,160
What did everyone think about the fish, the sculpting fish itself, the big fruity fish

1628
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,160
is on the wall in the restaurant.

1629
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:08,360
I gotta say that's hashtag finding Nemo.

1630
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,840
They painted them real big though, like wall sized in the restaurant.

1631
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:18,040
It's a little, it's like the primary and like everybody in the restaurant has t-shirts with

1632
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,040
like that.

1633
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,040
Yeah.

1634
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,160
That there's a specific artist who's doing all of that work.

1635
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,160
Yes.

1636
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,600
And I think it's kind of cool.

1637
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:29,320
I looked, I watched a video on their website because I was like, why did they choose a

1638
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,320
sculpting?

1639
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:38,480
And the answer, and this is a direct quote, deceiving delicious, but be careful.

1640
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,520
That was his answer of why they chose to name it a sculpting.

1641
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,520
Hmm.

1642
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,880
So that implying that the drink might have like a bite.

1643
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:46,880
Yes.

1644
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,560
Because it does have a 7% ABV, which is kind of high.

1645
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,560
Which is true.

1646
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:55,280
I do, that will happen that you have the beer with the higher alcohol percent.

1647
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,280
Yeah.

1648
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,280
You forget.

1649
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,280
Especially with IPA.

1650
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,280
It's only a beer.

1651
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,560
And then you were like, how did I get so messed up?

1652
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,440
I like a session IPA.

1653
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,640
So you get a little of the flavor, but you get less of the kick.

1654
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,640
What's your favorite beer, Jason?

1655
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,200
I like a Golden Road, like the, the either the Wolf Among the Weeds.

1656
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,200
LA.

1657
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,200
We're talking LA.

1658
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,200
Yeah.

1659
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,200
We're talking LA.

1660
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,200
Big slight.

1661
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,200
Watch out guys.

1662
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,200
I'm glad I'm between you.

1663
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:24,520
Wolf Among the Weeds or this, which is the double IPA, uh, or the Wolf Pup, which is

1664
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,320
the, uh, session IPA.

1665
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,320
Wolf Pup's good.

1666
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,320
Sure.

1667
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,320
Wolf Pup is good.

1668
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,880
I like a, uh, Knott's Berry Farm, Boysenberry Cider.

1669
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,880
Boysenberry Cider.

1670
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,880
Or Boysenberry Beer.

1671
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,000
A tradition like a beer.

1672
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
They have it as well.

1673
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,800
I think that's too sweet for me.

1674
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
Yeah.

1675
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,600
I think I can only do one or two, but I do like it.

1676
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Sure.

1677
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,600
I can't do five.

1678
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:49,400
I gotta say I'm one of those guys who will drink anything and get fucked up however much

1679
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,400
I can or will.

1680
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,320
You've made a lot of finger.

1681
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,320
You're going, you went from four, one to four fingers really fast.

1682
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,320
So anything.

1683
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,320
I'll do whatever I can.

1684
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,320
Turpentine.

1685
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,320
Drink whenever I can.

1686
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,400
I'll make fun of whoever the fuck I want to.

1687
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,880
I'll spit in their face.

1688
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,880
I'm kidding.

1689
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,880
I'm sorry.

1690
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,880
Jesus Christ.

1691
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,880
Wow.

1692
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,280
We've been with a monster this whole time.

1693
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,280
Oh my gosh.

1694
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,880
Algesh Curieau is my infamous Curieau.

1695
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,880
Oh, interesting.

1696
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:17,880
Algesh Cider.

1697
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:18,880
I've never.

1698
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,880
I don't know what that is.

1699
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,880
That's it.

1700
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,120
Well, I used to think it was a little more like rare.

1701
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,680
Like you had to pick a place that had it, but Yard House has them.

1702
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,680
Oh yeah.

1703
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,680
Really strange.

1704
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,680
Is Yard House open until two?

1705
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,680
Probably.

1706
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,680
I think so.

1707
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,680
Yeah.

1708
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,680
Yeah.

1709
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,680
Mike got so excited.

1710
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,680
That's a bigger bite than that sculpin because that's a 10%.

1711
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,680
Watch out.

1712
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,680
You know, tiny little goblet.

1713
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,680
But a big old bite.

1714
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,680
Yard House open until one a.m.

1715
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,680
So good.

1716
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,880
How late is AMC McGuffin's open?

1717
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:46,880
Because we could.

1718
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,360
I can be here all the time.

1719
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:52,720
I can just do your podcast with you guys for the next week if you need like a.

1720
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,720
Just you can.

1721
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,720
Ed McBrand style.

1722
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,720
You're going to do a residency?

1723
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,160
I'm not good the way you guys are.

1724
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,160
You guys are so good.

1725
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,240
You don't have to put yourself down like that.

1726
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,240
You're great.

1727
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,240
Anthony, what are you?

1728
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,240
I.

1729
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,040
You do a very difficult job.

1730
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,040
My hand.

1731
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,040
But the problem is my hands aren't skin.

1732
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,680
But at the end of the day, none of our hands are.

1733
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:14,680
That is true.

1734
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,200
The podcast, your hands do have to scan.

1735
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,200
You got to scan.

1736
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,200
Are we done?

1737
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,200
Maybe we're done.

1738
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,200
I mean, I mean, I'll take a little hug and then I can be done.

1739
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,200
All right, I'll take a.

1740
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,240
Give me a hug and I'll take a.

1741
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:27,240
Oh, my God.

1742
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,240
Mike, you're really going for it.

1743
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:33,440
Can I describe to the listeners what's happening is there is a bottle of rye whiskey that I

1744
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,440
inherited.

1745
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:38,080
It's Whistle Pig 10 Year.

1746
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,160
It's a reputable brand of rye.

1747
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:46,160
Yeah, that is now being passed around and we're deciding whether hugging is like just

1748
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,960
taking a sip of whiskey or not.

1749
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,040
Nobody's told me whether that's a bigger ones on me.

1750
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,760
It's hard to get a measure in a champagne.

1751
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,760
Yeah, yeah.

1752
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,760
You got a pub, too.

1753
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,840
Well, Kyle's going right for the pub.

1754
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,840
Oh, geez.

1755
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,840
Yeah.

1756
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,240
Well, that was more than a pug, maybe.

1757
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,240
Well, I don't know.

1758
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,720
You said you tell us what a pug is.

1759
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,720
He created it, Scott.

1760
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:17,040
Let him measure it out.

1761
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,040
Well, pug on three.

1762
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,040
Pug on three.

1763
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,040
One, two, three, pug.

1764
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:27,000
That's for the listener to like kind of visualize what we were doing.

1765
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
All right.

1766
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I mean, noise.

1767
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,560
And with that, Kyle Mooney survived podcast ride.

1768
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:38,000
One of the funner episodes, I think, of the series.

1769
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,840
Certainly very cutting for our other episodes.

1770
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,640
I would go to record.

1771
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,160
I'm saying all of that fun.

1772
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,200
But like this one, we're having pubs.

1773
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,360
You're really mad at me, though, during the episode.

1774
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,760
So you know, we got started talking about citrus.

1775
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,400
Like you start talking about the grapefruit.

1776
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,400
You got mad at me.

1777
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,400
Answer.

1778
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,160
You started talking about citrus.

1779
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,360
But this is like an old this is like a trick.

1780
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,840
Like we know how to gas each other up a little.

1781
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,840
This is that improv trick.

1782
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,560
You know how to get so far from that nice stuff.

1783
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,440
We were in a class in 2009.

1784
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:19,280
I do remember Jason and I talking about theme like it was theme park very quickly.

1785
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,000
So to talk about earlier of like.

1786
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,840
But then you got in that huge citrus fight and the whole friendship never got off, almost

1787
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,840
never got off the ground.

1788
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,640
Jason and I fight about citrus a lot.

1789
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,640
A lot.

1790
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,640
That's a lot of problems.

1791
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,320
I love to I want to know more about your guys friendship.

1792
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,080
That's something I want to know.

1793
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,080
But maybe that's not this.

1794
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,080
Do you have one more?

1795
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,200
Do you have another like one more question?

1796
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,920
We can go out on a question about our friendship.

1797
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:49,120
Any of us, whatever dynamic you're giving me like truly like 30 seconds to think.

1798
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,120
Absolutely.

1799
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,120
Sure.

1800
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,120
Yeah.

1801
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,120
We need a week here.

1802
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,560
Wait while you do here, just don't pay attention as well.

1803
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,560
I said that.

1804
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,160
But I'm still going to say your proper goodbyes.

1805
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:03,560
But the so for more of what has just become, we realize the downtown Disney district.

1806
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,720
So we use make sure you use hashtag DDD.

1807
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,880
Oh, that is a district ordeal.

1808
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,960
Hashtag save the level keeper.

1809
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,320
Hashtag sector keeper cricket wireless severance.

1810
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,960
Tweet that at wireless and not at us.

1811
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:22,280
And for more of the downtown Disney ordeal and the rest of level three, follow us on

1812
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,000
Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

1813
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,560
And of course, we will be back tomorrow.

1814
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:32,120
And hey, three bonus episodes every month that podcast or patreon.com slash podcast

1815
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,720

1816
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,720
That's what it's called.

1817
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,520
Not the web address is patreon.com slash podcast.

1818
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,520
Right.

1819
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,040
I think this pug is getting to me.

1820
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,880
So that being said, that's all of our business.

1821
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,880
Thirty seconds.

1822
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,760
Kyle Mooney, have you formulated a question?

1823
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,760
Hold on one second.

1824
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
One second.

1825
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,760
An item is appearing.

1826
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,760
Oh, you're right.

1827
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,760
It's really nice.

1828
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,760
Yeah.

1829
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,760
Yes.

1830
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,760
Oh, yeah.

1831
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,760
Satchels.

1832
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,760
Oh my God.

1833
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,040
And it is a oh my.

1834
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,040
Wait a minute.

1835
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,040
Hold on.

1836
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,240
It's a it's a medium sized sculpin.

1837
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:10,080
So it's not just a little tiny guy that can't do anything, but it's meaty.

1838
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,480
It's like bigger than other sculpins.

1839
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,480
So he might pack a pretty serious bite.

1840
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,280
Yeah, we could do some damage with that.

1841
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,300
That could really come in handy with whatever boss we're going to face.

1842
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,360
We face bosses, Kyle, at the end.

1843
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1844
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,360
I'm nervous as hell.

1845
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,360
You don't have you don't have to.

1846
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,960
You're about to get out of here.

1847
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,520
Unless you stick around all week.

1848
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,160
But that's up to you know, you should try to get out before there's bosses to face.

1849
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:40,400
So OK, well, hopefully that sculpin can be kind of our attack dog or attack fish.

1850
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,400
Great.

1851
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,400
Kyle, what have you got?

1852
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,760
You don't have to ask me.

1853
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,160
You can also just say you're Twitter or whatever.

1854
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,560
I can turn it off right now.

1855
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,040
I can turn the recorder off right now.

1856
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,040
What do you think?

1857
01:13:52,040 --> 01:14:01,720
I guess you guys met each other like what while you were working on the same improv

1858
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,720
team.

1859
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,720
They these two.

1860
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,720
Well, we were around.

1861
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,040
We were we met each other in an improv class.

1862
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,360
And then a few years later, we were put on the same team.

1863
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,320
I think because one year later.

1864
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,680
Yeah, it was a few.

1865
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:15,440
I think it was 2009.

1866
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,600
We put on the team in 2010.

1867
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,600
OK, that's right.

1868
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,000
Is there more to the question?

1869
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,440
Yeah, are you just clarifying some getting timelines right now?

1870
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:30,920
No, I just I. Yeah, that's what.

1871
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,720
So yeah, we were in class together first.

1872
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,920
We improvised together.

1873
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,560
And then I think because of our association with each other, they put together a team

1874
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,240
of people that at all like a couple of different little groups together that had worked with

1875
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,900
each other.

1876
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:49,240
And so was there a moment where you guys felt like you clicked or got along?

1877
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:54,160
I mean, I think in general, it was I remember we had a class on Melrose.

1878
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,160
Yeah.

1879
01:14:55,160 --> 01:15:00,280
And I do remember very quickly, like like this guy.

1880
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,520
I remember that moment.

1881
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,520
I remember, too.

1882
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,520
Yeah, you guys are pointing.

1883
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,200
I don't remember what I don't remember.

1884
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:10,400
Like the day of it, I just remember very quickly being like, oh, yeah, this guy.

1885
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:17,120
I remember that you I think you did a scene of a man breaking down like in a Taco Bell.

1886
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,120
Well, that's it.

1887
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,120
You're bringing this up.

1888
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,920
It was going to be very interesting for the listener when it really a revelation in my

1889
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,280
improv was when Chad Carter had me do this scene.

1890
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,600
And that's Chad Carter.

1891
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,360
Now you now you just a daily show, former Daily Show writer.

1892
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,720
Does he work on the detour?

1893
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,720
Is that still around?

1894
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,720
I think he's a producer on that.

1895
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,720
Yeah.

1896
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,720
OK, anyway, let's hear the credits.

1897
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:37,720
Yeah.

1898
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:38,720
What else has Chad done?

1899
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:39,720
I don't know.

1900
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:40,720
He's funny.

1901
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:41,720
Funny guy.

1902
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,720
Oh, yeah, of course.

1903
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,720
Yeah.

1904
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,720
Anyway.

1905
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,720
Anyway, you had a now you just have mini breakdowns every time you go to talk.

1906
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:53,160
For years and years, I did a scene about having a breakdown of talk about now I just live

1907
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,680
it out every time I go.

1908
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:59,160
And now you get now now you guys all you've met at USC and you formed a group.

1909
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,960
You started putting videos on YouTube.

1910
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,960
Jason and Mike.

1911
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:08,800
So I remember when we were there, I remember we all got together and I remember thinking

1912
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,880
like you were like I was like this guy.

1913
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:11,880
I remember thinking that.

1914
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:15,760
So I don't know if maybe you don't remember that.

1915
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,280
Am I getting my groups confused?

1916
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,280
So tragic.

1917
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,280
My mythologies are getting tangled.

1918
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,600
Kyle, let's exit to the gift shop.

1919
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:32,840
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1920
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,320
You got to check out this new stuff.

1921
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,320
Let's go.

1922
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:39,280
I don't know what to say.

1923
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,280
You don't have to.

1924
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,880
We've been drinking.

1925
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,920
I've been again.

1926
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,720
You don't know when this show is recorded, but it's now probably I imagine midnight or

1927
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,720
something.

1928
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:53,000
No, no, it's like 1040 and 40.

1929
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,160
It's at least 12 at night.

1930
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,440
But daily it's just happened, though.

1931
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,440
So it is later.

1932
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,440
I also came from New York.

1933
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:01,920
I'm now on the West Coast.

1934
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,280
You've been drinking for 26 hours.

1935
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,080
It is like three in the morning for you.

1936
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,000
I just want to say these guys are some of my best friends and they really do great work.

1937
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,840
And please check out their other podcast episodes.

1938
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,840
Thank you.

1939
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,840
Whoa, that's very nice.

1940
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,840
Thanks, Kyle.

1941
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,840
Oh, man.

1942
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,160
Well, I said all the other stuff so we can just get out of here.

1943
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,160
Yeah, I guess we're done.

1944
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,160
All right.

1945
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,160
We'll see you tomorrow.

1946
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,160
See you all tomorrow.

1947
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,160
Let's Pug it up.

1948
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,160
Pug it up, Daddy.

1949
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,160
Pug it up.

1950
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:33,520
