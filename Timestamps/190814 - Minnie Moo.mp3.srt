1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,440
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,160
I'm Jason Sheridan here with Mike Carlson as always.

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,000
I am here, yep.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,960
And Scott Gerrider.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm here as well.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,320
And today we're talking our favorite sideshow

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,040
carnival freak at the Disney park.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,880
What?

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,720
That's not nice.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,440
That is not a nice way to intro this.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,280
Our favorite oddity.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
Cynical view of this glorious cow.

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,160
No, she's great, but it is a little like.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,040
She's great, but you said freak.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,240
Pay, I like in an endearing way.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,080
In like the movie freaks way.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,640
They all work out in the end.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,240
The green goblin freak like me.

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,320
Like a freak, yeah.

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,160
Needs company.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,960
I mean, I guess I see what you're saying

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,800
that this is a, why is this creature here

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,720
because of a birth anomaly?

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,560
Yeah.

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,200
Which is what would bring you to a freak show.

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,080
Pay your nickel, come into the tent, see the oddity.

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
I'm just saying it's not a nice way.

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,400
You could have said like this.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,240
Okay.

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,200
Charming performer, this charming animal actor.

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,200
This blessed lady of the live theater scene.

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,360
I suppose. Unique bovine.

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,440
Okay, fair enough.

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,240
Fair enough.

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,080
Well look, we'll.

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,920
Well, this is what you get

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,840
when you let me intro the episode.

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,280
Yeah, we can talk about a freak today.

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
We're gonna talk about a.

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,960
Some shit.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,040
When we enter via the skewed view of a Jason.

43
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,880
A twisted world.

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,720
A twisted world.

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,560
I can imagine.

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,720
Of Jason Sheridan.

47
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,840
Here's one of those topics that,

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,440
what's the, I don't know, what's the way to,

49
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,200
some we sit on for a while

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,640
and some kind of as soon as you think of it

51
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,840
and remember that it existed,

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,560
you have to be doing the episode about it.

53
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,280
And that's what, I just remembered Mini Moo all of a sudden

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,640
and we all agreed we had to do this right away.

55
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,720
Mini Moo, the short synopsis.

56
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Mini Moo was a cow that lived at Disney World,

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,760
a black and white Holstein cow

58
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,760
who was purchased by the Walt Disney Company

59
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,600
because her splotches looked like Mickey's head.

60
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
Right.

61
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,400
I did not know about Mini Moo.

62
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,280
Okay.

63
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,920
I may have seen a picture of the cow

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,440
but I was not aware that it had a title or it had a name.

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,920
Okay, you were vaguely aware

66
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,200
that there was some Mickey or cow.

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,040
Yeah, I didn't know.

68
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,640
Does anyone have any memory of meeting the cow?

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm pretty sure I saw Mini Moo in person.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,760
Yeah, I can't, I must have.

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,880
The timing works out that like.

72
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,760
Yeah, so Mini Moo was where again?

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,920
Mickey's Starland.

74
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,800
Mickey's Starland in the early 90s

75
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,800
but lived at Disney World's forever basically.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,480
It's a rare eternal cow.

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,560
Yeah, lucky, by the way, lucky cow.

78
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,240
We would love to live there.

79
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
Oh yeah, absolutely.

80
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,760
Yeah, yeah, and just eat out of a trough.

81
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
Oh gosh.

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,480
Mm-hmm, just fill up a trough with sugary cocktails.

83
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,200
Give me some slop and let me live on the Swamp Land

84
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,040
and I'm set.

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,880
Yeah, essentially, well then eventually

86
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,680
was living in a Disney World hotel.

87
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,240
That's truly one of our dreams.

88
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,000
Mickey's Starland early 90s then moved in the mid 90s

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,880
to the Fort Wilderness branch

90
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,760
where she lived at her remaining days

91
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,240
and had a pretty long life for a cow.

92
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,560
But this was this bizarre attraction

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,560
that came from just a family from Minnesota

94
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,360
contacting the Disney company and saying,

95
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,720
hey, we have a cow with a pretty accurate Mickey shape

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,560
on its side.

97
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,760
Yes, the cow was scheduled to be slaughtered.

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,200
Uh-huh, was a poor producer of milk.

99
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,960
So what justification do we have to leave them around?

100
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,760
Which this is like natural selection

101
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,400
or adaptation really in real time.

102
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,800
If only all animals could will themselves

103
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,880
to have a corporate symbol.

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,800
Right, yeah.

105
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,840
It's tougher to do with any other company.

106
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,320
Like, universal which doesn't really have

107
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,240
a corresponding shape, you would have to if like a.

108
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
The globe maybe.

109
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,360
I guess you could, all right, yeah, yeah.

110
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
And you can, that's a fairly simple shape.

111
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,080
Yeah.

112
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,360
If a cow had a circle and you could claim

113
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,160
that was the universal globe,

114
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,000
then maybe you could sell that.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The circle with a little bit of bars on the side,

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
like the text.

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,640
That'd probably be required.

118
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,520
Yes, yeah, yeah, sort of the latitude longitude lines.

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,440
Apple would be the best, easiest one I think.

120
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,760
Oh, there you go.

121
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,840
Apple cow.

122
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, yeah.

123
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,280
Maybe a cow that with the silhouette of Alfred Hitchcock.

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,880
Could have been more.

125
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Would have been more valuable in the 60s, 70s,

126
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,040
but maybe universal would at least take a meeting,

127
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,880
consider buying.

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,560
Right, because I didn't realize that,

129
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,760
maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves.

130
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,000
I didn't realize there was a cow before.

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't think I knew that either.

132
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
You're talking Mickey Moo?

133
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,520
We're talking Mickey Moo.

134
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,040
So as much as this is called Minnie Moo,

135
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,400
Mickey Moo is actually the original.

136
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,240
Yes, yeah.

137
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,840
Of the cows with a Mickey Mouse face on it.

138
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,720
Mickey Moo at Disneyland.

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
Right, yes.

140
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,760
At the Big Thunder Ranch, I'm assuming.

141
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,840
Yeah.

142
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,560
And Minnie Moo lived first part of her life

143
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,760
after Minnesota lived in Grandma Duck's petting zoo.

144
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,800
Grandma Duck, part of the extended duck universe

145
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,400
of Donald and Uncle Scrooge and Huey, Dewey and Louie.

146
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,080
I would love to live there as well.

147
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,880
Oh yeah.

148
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,840
But the article I was reading was saying

149
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,960
that there was like an arms race created by Mickey Moo

150
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,120
because they had paid money for this Mickey shaped

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,440
spot on the cow.

152
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,280
So then it became.

153
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,280
They opened up a real like can of worms for themselves

154
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,680
now that eventually they had to have a person

155
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,560
like full time dealing with fielding requests

156
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,800
from will you look at this animal or inanimate object

157
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,040
and tell us if it's Mickey enough.

158
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,760
Like a church dealing with like,

159
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,400
we do not need any more crying Madonnas.

160
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,520
Please stop contacting us about crying Madonnas.

161
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,920
If you have one though, what a shame to not be.

162
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,200
Yeah, what if you, yeah.

163
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,680
Not get to donate it, especially if it's blood,

164
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,080
which I know there's been those.

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,040
That I would feel like would be the high demand.

166
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,520
You're not getting shut down for a blood Madonna.

167
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,320
Yeah.

168
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,160
Yeah.

169
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you think that you call the church

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,840
and they're like, no, we don't need anyone.

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,480
Well, what if I told you the tears were blood?

172
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm listening.

173
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,280
It would be the person.

174
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,960
I think they would, if you could get that out

176
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,680
before they hung up the phone.

177
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,680
What if the Madonna was crying into a shape, a Mickey shape?

178
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,120
The tears had made a Mickey shape.

179
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,960
Wow.

180
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,800
On the painting.

181
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,280
Would that be displayed?

182
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,400
Where would that be displayed in one of the parks?

183
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,360
That feels like exhausting gallery art.

184
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,440
That feels like piss Christ or, or.

185
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,280
But you don't know that.

186
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,120
That is a net.

187
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Well, yeah, I guess you'd end up in a bidding war

188
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,160
between the Catholic church and Disney

189
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
and it would ultimately be bought by Banksy.

190
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Yes.

191
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,440
That's a perfect installation for Chismaland.

192
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,600
Chuck Klosterman or Douglas Copeland just on the side

193
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,800
going like, yeah, yeah, I wanna write about this.

194
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
I was just gonna say.

195
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,960
10,000 words here, no problem.

196
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,800
Yeah.

197
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
I was just gonna say it'd be in the Wonder Ground Gallery

198
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,000
at Downtown Disney.

199
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,920
Oh yeah, probably at this point, probably.

200
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,240
Yeah, that's all I think.

201
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,960
I think it would be just nice.

202
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,560
They would just be like, your favorites are together.

203
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,200
The hidden Mickey ears and the blessed mother fairy.

204
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,360
And if it just eternally ran that way,

205
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,240
like no matter how much it cried,

206
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,400
the tears stayed limited to the two smaller pools

207
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,560
and the one bigger pool.

208
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Great.

209
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,640
And that they stayed a perfect circle.

210
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,320
If I could get my AP discount and buy it,

211
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,440
I think it would be great.

212
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
Well, but they always do like lines of stuff.

213
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440
So they would have like, you know,

214
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,080
the religious mashup line.

215
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,240
But then like Shag would draw a version of it.

216
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,080
Shag would draw a version.

217
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,840
Like a retro version of it.

218
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,840
A 60s style.

219
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,680
Yeah.

220
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,520
Yeah.

221
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,360
Cause it's a miracle.

222
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,200
It's not, you know, they could make a bunch,

223
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,720
but only one would be the miracle.

224
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,560
Right.

225
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,600
And they do display the original art in there

226
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,760
and you can buy it for a lot of money

227
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,280
and then they have prints.

228
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,120
Yeah.

229
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
You can just buy prints of it.

230
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,780
Oh, I see.

231
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,280
So yeah, yeah, it's like a naturally occurring print.

232
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,200
Yeah, so the phenomenon would be the original

233
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,160
and that would cost a lot.

234
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,280
And then there would be the similes

235
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,000
and then there would be the locusts

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,760
that would destroy the Wonder Grand Gallery

237
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,120
due to sacrilege.

238
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
This place is an abomination.

239
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

240
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,560
Well, yeah.

241
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,040
So, well, you know, we are only one,

242
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
this is a less religious symbol,

243
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,600
but you know, equally beautiful, equally awe inspiring.

244
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,680
I'd like to think that they,

245
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,840
as soon as the ear shapes formed,

246
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,880
that all these families like cried,

247
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,680
they dropped to their knees.

248
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,200
Well, obviously, like for me,

249
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,720
at least from the way I was raised,

250
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,920
that is much more religious.

251
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Mickey's face is much more religious.

252
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,200
Well, you have better attendance.

253
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,320
Oh yeah, that's very true.

254
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,040
Hopefully my mom doesn't listen to this Patreon episode.

255
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,840
Even though we didn't go to church,

256
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,680
we didn't go, I don't know why this is upsetting.

257
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
If we went, I would get it, but anyway.

258
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,800
So if somehow Disneyland.com slash AP

259
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,080
would track your visits to Disneyland in a year

260
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,800
and your visits to church in a year.

261
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Oh, it would not look good.

262
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,440
86 to zero.

263
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,160
No, higher than 80.

264
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,000
I think I might like.

265
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,520
I can't tell when they reset.

266
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,360
I don't think it's.

267
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,600
Well, mine just reset,

268
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,200
but I'm already back up to like 40, I think.

269
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,640
Mine reset like a year, two years ago.

270
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,960
And I had been up to 110.

271
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,440
And that was like an unbroken stretch

272
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,560
of like five years, maybe.

273
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,280
So I truly could not calculate.

274
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,360
I have no idea how many times.

275
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,080
Well, you've gotta be over 250, I bet.

276
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,280
I don't know, maybe.

277
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,120
How often would you go as a kid?

278
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,560
Only once a year as a kid.

279
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,480
I'm way more now.

280
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,120
When did you get the annual pass?

281
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,520
I've only started having one like 2010

282
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,040
and I haven't had it consistently.

283
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,800
Okay. Yeah.

284
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,000
Maybe you're, I bet you're hovering around 200.

285
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,160
You might be higher.

286
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,480
Really? Yeah.

287
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,280
I feel like you're higher.

288
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,440
Really? Yeah. Maybe.

289
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,040
This might be of interest to the eye.

290
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,880
Could we somehow like,

291
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,200
we just with photographs like figure it out.

292
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,360
Although I don't know.

293
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,760
I didn't have like a camera handy as much in 2005, 2006.

294
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,800
So that couldn't.

295
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,640
Cause then I do you do factor in.

296
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,680
We could compare last 10 years probably.

297
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,520
Yeah. If you factor in like the times

298
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,600
where I would go to WonderCon

299
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,360
and just show up for an hour or two,

300
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,760
like I guess there's a little extra stuff in there.

301
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,160
Maybe, yeah, maybe.

302
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
I wish Disney would have done a better job.

303
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,600
It should have just been linked to my social security number.

304
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
It should come out when I do a credit check.

305
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,840
There should be just information of like my whole history.

306
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,800
And then. Yeah.

307
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
And you should be offered a better credit line

308
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,560
because that proves what a good boy you are.

309
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
Like would a guy going to Disneyland all the time

310
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,480
be a problem?

311
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,880
You think I would commit fraud?

312
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,120
No, I need to buy a new car.

313
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
This would really help me out.

314
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,560
Actually, if you pay the monthly,

315
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
you know, the pay the monthly annual pass,

316
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
you do have to sign like a loan,

317
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,520
a no interest loan document.

318
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,480
So it is probably helpful to your credit.

319
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,560
Right. But I don't know if the credit companies

320
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,320
care as much about the attendance

321
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,480
as much as the payment.

322
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,680
No, but the paying on time, which I have.

323
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,520
Bank of America was for a year or two is constantly getting hacked.

324
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,680
So I was constantly getting new cards.

325
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,720
Oh, yes. That happened to me.

326
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,680
That's why I'm out.

327
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,920
That's it. I get hacked so like it was once every couple of months.

328
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,680
And so I think it's very funny.

329
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,320
If you sign up for Disney email lists, which I at some point,

330
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,200
I signed up for all of them because there's you always hear rumors

331
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,200
of like super secret survey coupon sort of things.

332
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,920
If you sign up for all these nonsense email lists,

333
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,440
they're very colorful and there's graphics and everything.

334
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,280
When there is a failed payment on your annual pass,

335
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,480
they send you a black and white sternly worded plain text email.

336
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,520
Yes. Yeah.

337
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,920
Saying, please call us and update your card.

338
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,600
Legally is the word Disney is barely in there.

339
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Yes. Yeah.

340
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,280
It like the email emits a foul scent, makes you nauseous.

341
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,640
They're trying to poison you.

342
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Mm hmm.

343
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,800
Yeah, they mean business, really.

344
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,000
Less magical, less magical than the fantastic world of many.

345
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,840
Moo and they're there.

346
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,920
Let me go here. I'll go backwards to to Mickey Moo.

347
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
I don't know why we call it many.

348
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,960
Moo when there is also Mickey Moo.

349
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Could we call the episode many and Mickey Moo?

350
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,240
I don't know. I don't like it as much.

351
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,840
Well, I mean, focus on me. Yeah.

352
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,560
I mean, you started to you mentioned that they had to like assign someone to this

353
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,040
because there were other items, too. Right.

354
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,200
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Well, here let me let me explain.

355
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,480
Let me back up to to to Mickey Moo, which was a couple.

356
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,960
I got it back. Let me back up to Mickey Moo.

357
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,600
So this was part of they were contacted by this family.

358
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,560
Now, I forget where Mickey Moo came from.

359
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,440
Fill in if you guys know.

360
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,000
But our notes somewhere.

361
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,400
Mickey Moo lined up nicely to be purchased by the Disney company

362
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,000
because they were doing a state fair event.

363
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,800
Were you guys previously aware of state fair at Disneyland?

364
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,520
Well, I've heard of that. Yeah. Yeah. I know that.

365
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Was that the one where there was like the ball of death on Main Street with the motorcycles?

366
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,280
Yeah. Yeah. Unless that was the circus.

367
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,800
That was the circus. OK.

368
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,120
This was a weird thing where they I think they might have done this multiple years.

369
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,320
And kind of the oddest thing about it is that there were temporary Ferris wheels

370
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,280
all over the park in front of the train station, I think, in front,

371
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,320
maybe in front of the castle, one in Big Thunder Ranch.

372
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,480
So that's just an odd that there's like temporary carnival rides

373
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,320
in what is otherwise a much more mature theme park.

374
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,360
You've also got this poster that I'll show you guys

375
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,600
for state fair at Disneyland, the state you want to be in. Wow.

376
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,520
Mickey or Goofy is a band like a marching band leader.

377
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,880
And Mickey and Minnie are in folksy clothes and they're offering you a big, fresh baked pie.

378
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,360
Jason, are you OK? I'm already out the door.

379
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,880
I don't know where I'm going to, but I'm running.

380
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,360
I mean, if they had a modern campaign where Mickey and Minnie were holding up a pie,

381
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,280
you can't get a full pie in Disneyland, can you?

382
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,600
A full, full fresh fresh pie.

383
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,360
You can and not.

384
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,160
I think getting a slice of pie is a little difficult, honestly.

385
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,880
Yeah. So I'm just saying that that would

386
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,320
because right now there's an issue with attendance at the Disneyland Resort.

387
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,760
And I'm just saying that there's a lot of pie.

388
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,600
Some sort of Marie Callender, buy a pie, get a pie promotion, you're suggesting.

389
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,560
I'm not even I'm not even saying a promotion.

390
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,480
I'm just saying pies.

391
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,600
If you get a full pie somewhere on Main Street,

392
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,560
they were doing some sort of Twitter hashtag of like, hey, we're going to highlight,

393
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,760
you know, treats and and like snacks under eight dollars.

394
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,960
Like that was one of their attempts to drive a business.

395
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,160
But I'm saying pies.

396
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,920
I'm saying if that happened, you would be down there twice as much. Sure.

397
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,640
And your number shoots way up. Yeah, my number. Yeah.

398
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,520
My right. And you you pass me up on the on the visits.

399
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,240
Yeah. So you say if they replaced the current posters with the Millennium Falcon

400
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,000
with just a big flying cream pie flying high.

401
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,080
Oh, yeah, there's an overlay.

402
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,640
There's a pie overlay.

403
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,240
You have to fly a giant pie.

404
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,880
Honda wants you to get inside the pie.

405
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,480
The banana cream pie colon hobos are on

406
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,920
because you have to get it off the windowsill.

407
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,960
Oh, yeah, yeah. Because

408
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,080
Mrs. Mabel is mad at you, but you're also running because you're like,

409
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,640
oh, it's hot, it's hot.

410
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,000
You know, you're yeah.

411
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,160
Getting between your hands.

412
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
We've all done it.

413
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,960
And they they mod out the Honda Anaco robot to be Mrs.

414
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,840
Mabel, to be like a stern woman with a with a rolling pin.

415
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,280
Somebody took my pie.

416
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,480
Yeah. And the Star Wars, the data pad is is the equivalent of

417
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,240
when you aim it at things, it doesn't show you like secret transmissions

418
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,960
or like resistance codes.

419
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,200
It shows you like the markings of like this house is friendly.

420
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,960
This house is good for a meal.

421
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,800
This hat like don't go in here.

422
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,920
Scary dog. Yeah.

423
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,120
The hobo code. Yeah.

424
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,160
You can use the play Disney app to learn the hobo code.

425
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,520
Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

426
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,040
I would like maybe that that seems like a way they could get people in,

427
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,080
like a hobo code themed short time offer in a magic.

428
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,040
Yeah. An immersive hobo

429
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,560
the situation immersive hobo like game, I guess.

430
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah. Like Ghost Town alive.

431
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,800
Yeah. This is actually as I'm saying this, I'm like, there's 100 percent

432
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,520
of hobo code and ghost town alive.

433
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,960
I don't know. There is no, you know, there is.

434
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,080
OK, well, we'll go to not to ask.

435
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,880
I'm also into, by the way, that OK, there was the

436
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,000
Cinderella Castle modded out to be a cake for their birthdays.

437
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,520
There are future.

438
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,640
Is there a future Disney anniversary where it's everything is food?

439
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,320
Oh, yeah. Millennium Falcon is a pie.

440
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,400
That one's ready to go.

441
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,520
Big Thunder Mountain is a big pile of whipped cream.

442
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,840
Matterhorn also whipped cream, probably.

443
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,800
Sure. Sure. Some sort of pastry.

444
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,960
Space Mountain Matterhorn Macaron.

446
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,240
You make it look like the macros that you buy across the door.

447
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,960
All of Macca, the big stack of macaroons.

448
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,600
That's well, no, it's like the actual macro in the Matterhorn Macaron

449
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,080
is a real treat you can buy.

450
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,560
Oh, I didn't know that.

451
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,680
Oh, the bakery. It's delicious.

452
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,680
It's like a coconut macaroon, but stacked and it's got icing on top like it's snow.

453
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,840
Oh, OK.

454
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,080
Could Space Mountain be filled with fondue?

455
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Could that just be a sort like an orange?

456
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,320
It's like the pain pouring out from the top.

457
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,720
That would that's great.

458
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,640
That's even better. Yeah.

459
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,000
Big plops of fudge coming out of it.

460
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Big plops. Yeah, that's good.

461
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,840
Mm hmm.

462
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,200
And then the Grizzly Peak, like as we're doing the other side,

463
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,360
is there a dessert that looks like that looks like a thing?

464
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,320
You could put like a honeycomb in the bear's mouth.

465
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,160
Bears like honey, right?

466
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,720
Well, the mouth is open already.

467
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,800
I mean, it's not exactly what we were talking like.

468
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
It's adjacent to what we were talking about.

469
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
I like it, though. Yeah.

470
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,440
Or a picnic basket.

471
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,040
Oh, that would get copyright weird.

472
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,880
I'm just trying to think of what you could you could wedge a slice of cake.

473
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,640
You could wedge anything in the bear's mouth.

474
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,120
That's true. Yeah.

475
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,600
You could wedge any food you want.

476
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,640
But he stole it from a picnic basket.

477
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,160
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

478
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
They don't they own Yogi Bear already?

479
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,440
It seems like they should. Warner Brothers.

480
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,120
I think Warner Brothers.

481
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,960
It just came out in the wash. Right.

482
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,200
Guardians could turn into like a gingerbread house.

483
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,040
Yeah. Yeah. That would be pretty good.

484
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,800
The colors are already there. Very good.

485
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Just add a little icing. Mm hmm.

486
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,440
All right. So we're talking what 70th anniversary?

487
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,320
When's the next one? It's around the corner.

488
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,840
Yeah, 70, I guess.

489
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,320
Everything is dessert. 65.

490
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,200
I objected to the Cinderella Castle cake before, but I think I was just sad

491
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,360
for the other buildings that they don't get to be dessert.

492
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,480
Yeah, I was.

493
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,000
Did you see there's an holiday overlay on Space Mountain in Florida this year?

494
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,160
For the Christmas Christmas overlay of what?

495
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,560
Space Mountain. What do you mean? What is it?

496
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,880
It's like Christmas music playing and like lights in there.

497
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,200
Wild. Really? I like I want to see what it's like, but I don't think we'll see.

498
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,080
We're at our live show.

499
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,400
I don't think we'll be open by then. And the Speedway too, right?

500
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,320
Yeah, and the Speedway is like some holiday Speedway thing.

501
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,800
So they're getting a little weirder. Yeah.

502
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,520
And I think no ghost galaxy for us, though, at Halloween.

503
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,480
No ghost galaxy.

504
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,800
And we don't get the Christmas thing.

505
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,040
And we don't. I don't believe we get the Christmas thing.

506
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,280
And they had the Jingle Cruise last year, but we didn't have it last year.

507
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,920
But when we had the Jingle Cruise, it was nothing.

508
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,040
It was just like a Santa hat on the elephant.

509
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,360
It was barely anything different.

510
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,240
Don't remind me. Yeah, I'm mad about it.

511
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,680
Still so fucking pissed.

512
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,360
We were I was I was like I was like on the Jingle Cruise.

513
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,240
It'd be really cool. It was not.

514
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,840
I think the last year they did it. They did a little more.

515
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,160
I think you're right. I think I'm just remembering that first year.

516
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,360
The first year was pretty light.

517
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,960
Is there any plot justification?

518
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,240
Is it Santa Mountain?

519
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,960
And it's like a it's like a depiction of his launch, like when he's like

520
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,400
leaving the North Pole going into the sky to begin his run.

521
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,000
I have to I don't remember.

522
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,320
I think it was just like fun Christmas music and colorful lights on Space Mountain.

523
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,720
OK, I don't think it's like you're Santa.

524
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,040
It distracts you from the crippling back pain

525
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,960
that you get from that you get from Space Mountain.

526
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

527
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,400
Not as bad as a Matterhorn, but close, close.

528
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,920
Mm hmm.

529
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,600
A simulation of Santa's back pain from being

530
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,920
100 years old. Mm hmm.

531
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,360
Yeah. Hauling presents.

532
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,880
Yeah. Hauling, hauling a non ergonomic shaped sack.

533
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,400
Being 800 years old in some drawings, weighing 800 pounds.

534
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,560
Eight hundred pounds.

535
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,440
I mean, there's a pretty non flattering drawings of Santa Claus.

536
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
Fair, but I don't know if he goes over 500.

537
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,480
I mean, but he's got that big sack.

538
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,200
I'd like to see the 800 pounds.

539
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,240
Make him eight feet tall.

540
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,360
But the obese Santa Claus for some.

541
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,800
Pounds is like you got to get him out of the trailer.

542
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,760
Like you got to remove the wall.

543
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Not if he's tall.

544
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,040
I mean, if you make him really

545
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
he's also tall.

546
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,440
They well, I mean, he's eight feet and 800 tall.

547
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,320
Eight hundred pounds.

548
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,480
Santa's operates in the rules of eights.

549
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,520
He's eight feet tall.

550
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,400
He's 800 years old and he is 800 pounds

551
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,480
and he has eight reindeer.

552
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,920
So that's true.

553
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,120
And they have to poke him out of bed with their handlers.

554
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,720
Prolly, his almost immovable body.

555
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,240
You have to do an aerial lift, pulling him out of the top.

556
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,480
All these connections and everything.

557
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,280
This is like the Christmas overlay of the number 23.

558
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,320
The number 23.

559
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,040
Don't you see eight recurs all over Christmas?

560
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,920
All right. The days of Christmas.

561
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,000
I know there's 12 all told, but eight is in there.

562
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,520
Right. You have to do eight within the 12.

563
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,320
I'm telling you, eights.

564
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,600
Figure eights when you figure skate.

565
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,440
Yeah, that's a holiday thing.

566
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,480
You turn eight sideways, it's an infinity sign.

567
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,800
Christmas forever.

568
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,280
I think Christmas will live forever.

569
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,000
Christmas will always live.

570
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,800
Santa lives forever.

571
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,560
Keep it in our hearts.

572
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Eights.

573
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,440
All right. Anyway, Scott, an hour ago,

574
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,880
you had some Mickey Moo stuff that you wanted to share.

575
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,440
Please go on.

576
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,960
OK. The state fair event is coming up.

577
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,880
Oh, my God, you have a cow with a Mickey shape.

578
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,200
That would be perfect.

579
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,680
We will buy this cow.

580
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,800
It will live out its days on Big Thunder Ranch,

581
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,040
and it will be called Mickey Moo.

582
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,440
Mickey Moo, also female, I should mention.

583
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,880
Both Minnie and Mickey Moo are females.

584
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,360
I forget where the first one came from.

585
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,760
The second one was from Minnesota.

586
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,320
Hey, why don't we stay on this cow buying spree?

587
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,320
Might as well get this one, too.

588
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,560
The terms of the deal, they could not say

589
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,320
how much it went for an undisclosed amount of money.

590
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,920
So I don't know what practically

591
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,920
a cow with Mickey shapes on it fetches

592
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,520
at market.

593
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,560
It's very limited market that only happened twice.

594
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,280
I bet it went for like 100 grand.

595
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,920
I don't know. I don't know.

596
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,880
Because I don't know. I bet it went for maybe not.

597
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,600
Maybe 50 grand, 50 to 100 grand.

598
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,080
That's my guess.

599
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,440
Somewhere I saw what the.

600
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,800
OK, well, later to jump around,

601
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,960
then this phenomenon kept occurring a little bit,

602
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,720
and they didn't bite too many more times, but they did on these pigs

603
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,640
Mickey Pig and Mickey Piglet.

604
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,640
They got less creative with the names.

605
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,720
Siblings, right? Brothers, I believe.

606
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,400
Oh, I guess so. Yeah, they were bought together.

607
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,520
So so in this, I bring this up to say that I do have a number here.

608
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,400
Teresa Reuter, the owner of these pigs,

609
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,640
did say she and her husband wouldn't lose any money by not sending

610
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,760
the six month pig to market where it would have fetched about one hundred

611
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,440
and thirty dollars.

612
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,240
So that's what we know is that they would have gotten by maybe per pig

613
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,400
one hundred thirty bucks.

614
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,960
So it's at least more than one hundred and thirty dollars. Right.

615
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,400
Is it as much as one hundred thousand dollars?

616
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,840
I don't know. Disney is a little cheap.

617
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,600
And if that's what they're talking if if they sit down with farmers

618
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,240
and they say, well, I'll tell you what, it's got to be more than one hundred

619
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,360
thirty, because that's what I'm going to fetch at market for this.

620
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,920
They might say one hundred fifty sold.

621
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,040
So it's anywhere between one hundred and thirty and one hundred thousand dollars.

622
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,120
That's all we know.

623
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,040
We can narrow down. Yes. Yeah.

624
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,760
I saw in here that it said on this article said Mickey

625
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,200
Moo was survived by Minnie Moo, two similarly marked pigs,

626
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,360
which is what I believe you're talking about.

627
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,280
And a shriveled potato.

628
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,320
Yes, the potato. Yeah.

629
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,200
Do we know how much the potato fetched?

630
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,600
I do have another financial figure related to the potato.

631
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,520
Now, again, as part of the deal, they could not say,

632
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,040
OK, so this is what they made for it.

633
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,640
But let me let me find this info.

634
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,200
OK, so a family in Lincoln, Nebraska, bought a bunch of potatoes.

635
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,680
The mother of said family was about to mash them when she pulled it out

636
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,680
and saw that it was several conjoined potatoes forming Mickey's head.

637
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,400
And this seemed to have some dimensionality to it, too,

638
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,360
where it maybe had the like the the snout and the nose.

639
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,320
There was kind of like it wasn't just the shape.

640
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,480
It was maybe. Did you see a photo of it?

641
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,640
Those exist. Yeah, there's a black and white.

642
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,400
And a lot of info in this, by the way, credit to Rob Plays on YouTube,

643
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,080
who made a great video outlining a lot of this stuff.

644
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,040
So I think in his video, you can maybe see that potato.

645
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,160
But yeah, this one's a real fine because there's some dimensionality.

646
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,200
I'm glad that the cows don't have a 3D Mickey head extruding from its side.

647
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,720
I'd be very concerned about their health

648
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,000
or if their utter was in the wrong place, like off off on the right,

649
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,040
forming Mickey Mouse's smiling face.

650
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,360
That's a little grotesque.

651
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,080
Yeah, I'm describing some Cronenberg and stuff.

652
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,920
Body horror.

653
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,480
Milk me.

654
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,520
They would make it.

655
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,440
It would make it talk.

656
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Well, with projection, with projection.

657
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,400
Oh, it's a projection map that potato.

658
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,320
Yeah, maybe we got to find a new potato that looks like Mickey.

659
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,920
I mean, there are certain chip that looks like blank.

660
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,520
If you search that, like I was trying to find, like, I know there was a chip

661
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,720
or a potato that looked like it had the face of Jesus Christ on it.

662
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,080
That was for sale for a while.

663
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,680
But then you just find all these listicles of like chips

664
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,440
that look like other things or chips like people.

665
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,840
And you're not impressed by those.

666
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,000
That sounds pretty run of the mill.

667
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,840
I I wouldn't say run of the mill.

668
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,280
I would say its own thing, its own ecosystem.

669
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,320
I say, sure, sure.

670
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,120
Are you have you found a bite?

671
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,680
I searched potato Disney World Mickey and I just got pictures of Mr. Potato Head.

672
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,600
OK. Hmm.

673
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,400
Being here somewhere.

674
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,680
So look, if Nebraska family sold Disney and potato,

675
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,280
the deal would be off if they said the specifics.

676
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,960
But in the interim, when this was a now like there was, I think at the time

677
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,160
there were maybe a lot of newspaper articles and weird media about this,

678
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,640
because like any cash for grabs situation

679
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,200
is going to attract a little bit of attention and like how it feels, you know,

680
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,440
and people being like jealous of money for nothing.

681
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,280
Like you just you your cow happened to form this and then Disney buys it.

682
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,320
That's pretty weird.

683
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,040
Other people are trying to get in on this.

684
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,680
So a Nebraska radio station found out about this wasn't sure

685
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,680
if the deal had closed, offered the family five thousand dollars

686
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,200
if they gave it to them to mash up and or turn into French fries

687
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,440
or cook them up or something.

688
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,240
And they turned it down and they said that we turned it down

689
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,440
because we wanted Disney to have it.

690
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,200
But that was more than Disney would have offered.

691
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,480
I'll tell you that.

692
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,520
So five thousand dollars was distinctly more.

693
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,720
They actually commented on that.

694
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,680
Five thousand dollars, way more than they they got for the potato from Disney.

695
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,000
But they wanted the honor that living in the park. Right.

696
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,680
This is also negotiating tactic.

697
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,280
They're going to pull on us if any of us ever work for Disney Plus

698
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
acting or writing.

699
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,160
Well, the honor it's less.

700
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,560
We heard your podcast.

701
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,520
We know you just say, well, let's get lucky.

702
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,960
You set foot on this lot at all, motherfucker.

703
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,240
What if we invite invited you to the

704
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,720
PhilharMagic premiere press event? All right.

705
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,480
All right. OK. So so the salary becomes two hundred dollars per episode of

706
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,360
22 episode dramatic series I'm producing for you.

707
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,520
OK, can do.

708
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,880
But I got a free slice of pie at the premiere event.

709
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,680
All right. Great. You get a voucher.

710
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,440
So it'll be three dollars. Yeah. Close enough.

711
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,880
So wait, so who offered them five thousand a radio station?

712
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,440
Oh, OK. Yeah. They said no.

713
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,640
It's all all of this story harkens back to an earlier,

714
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,120
not just like to the time of carnivals charging you to look at oddity,

715
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,800
but to like a time when like the oddly enough section of the newspaper was like

716
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,800
that was the good wholesome.

717
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,400
Now I feel like all the AP, oddly enough, stuff is like

718
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Florida Man on meth opens fire on cartoon.

719
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,840
The statue of Cartoon Alligator or something like that.

720
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,880
Or like two bath salts face years met and get married, got married.

721
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
Yeah. Try to do it.

722
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,040
Graduations.

723
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,400
Try to rob Ronald McDonald statue.

724
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,120
Yeah, I was just going to say, like the bath salts would look like Mickey now,

725
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,960
at least like there would be a little bit of cuteness in the middle

726
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,120
of a horrible story about people. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

727
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,320
And when do they get into the drug market? Disney. Yeah.

728
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,560
That's a dystopian future thing in 30 years that like Disney is one of the main

729
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,760
pharmaceutical companies and they they sell pills.

730
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,640
They sell their like make whatever their brand of it's not Xanax.

731
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,280
It's Dysnax and it's it's got Mickey ears.

732
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,800
Yeah, that is. Oh, it's not.

733
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,200
It's not out of the question with the way all the corporations are merging

734
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,600
into just like one giant company.

735
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,320
It is not out of the question.

736
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,280
They will just have to own pills.

737
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,920
Yeah, that will be like, well, Universal owns their whole pill company.

738
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,680
And Warner Brothers owns a pill.

739
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,440
Comcast owns a pill company and AT&T does.

740
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,080
So we need our own pill company.

741
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,320
Not officially, but like I feel like I have seen news stories of like ecstasy

742
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,200
pills that look like cartoon characters. Oh, yeah, that's like, yeah, sure, sure.

743
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,240
So at what point do they get in on it?

744
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,000
And why Warner Brothers is missing out, not selling their own Daffy Duck

745
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,880
ecstasy pill.

746
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,880
When does Universal start selling minion official minion memes?

747
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,320
Minions, yeah.

748
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,760
They're perfect. They're pretty pill shaped as it is.

749
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,640
Oh, yeah, those would go in nice, easy, very easy.

750
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,120
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

751
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,160
Nobody looks forward to taking one.

752
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,040
But you see the friendly face of Bob.

753
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,880
Bob. Yeah, right. Bob.

754
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,760
It's a collab.

755
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,240
Minions, minions, ex fentanyl.

756
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,960
And the thing talks maybe to or just says like banana.

757
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,600
Oh, yeah. That's good.

758
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Or just goes like, oof.

759
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Right.

760
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,400
Yeah, I mean, this is like a joke, but also doesn't seem like.

761
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,400
It's possible. Honestly, it is very possible.

762
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,760
There'll be two companies left and they'll own everything.

763
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,360
Sure. So, yeah.

764
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,280
And like if I'm going to take anti-anxiety medication.

765
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,720
Well, yeah, you're going to go with an IP you like.

766
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,640
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

767
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,760
You're not going to do some generic pill. Who gives a shit?

768
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,160
Yeah. Go with a brand you trust.

769
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,200
Yeah. It's made me happy for a long time.

770
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,000
And now they're going to make me happy.

771
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,160
And well, five times a day. And well,

772
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,960
you're going to fix me. You're going to fix my body.

773
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah, they'll own pills and weapons.

774
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,560
So I didn't want to jump around too much, but it did build to a point.

775
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,920
I found an article where there there was a literal person who was in.

776
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Her name is Pam Parks.

777
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,040
And she was among others.

778
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,520
She's a PR person for Disney.

779
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,840
But among her other duties, she was put in charge of the perfect Mickey file

780
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,800
and she would assess offers that came in

781
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,040
and did them the dignity of responding like when the when the article

782
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,760
I found in the Orlando Sentinel, it's you know, here's a little case study.

783
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,160
She just found out about a cat that has sort of Mickey spots on its side.

784
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,720
And she wrote a whole letter and said, your cat is adorable.

785
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,800
You must feel very blessed and very proud.

786
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,960
Unfortunately, at this time, I have to tell you that it does not

787
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,320
constitute a perfect Mickey. Wow.

788
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,080
Which this is also in dystopia where this is some weird area and kind of like,

789
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,160
but it is not a perfect Mickey.

790
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,440
Measure the circumference.

791
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,560
This is she worked out of a warehouse.

792
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,760
And I feel like I made this reference recently.

793
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,080
I can't remember if it was in conversation or on the podcast.

794
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,680
The part of doing a podcast.

795
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,640
I don't remember what we said.

796
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,840
Pam Parks works out of the warehouse from Raiders of the Lost Ark.

797
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,200
At the end, they put the Ark in the top men.

798
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,200
Top men, Dr. Jones, are working on it.

799
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,560
So she locked these cats, unfortunately, to assess them.

800
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,720
They have to keep them.

801
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,400
Like if you if you show us your cat, we now own the cat.

802
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,520
And then the cat is put in a crate.

803
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,760
So there's a warehouse full of Mickey shaped animals.

804
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,800
Yeah. We probably haven't seen a quarter of the perfect Mickey's.

805
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,920
Yeah. Yeah. Perfect Mickey.

806
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,840
And if they knew they have to control the population of perfect Mickey's also,

807
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,040
because if they're if people knew how many, how often it was occurring

808
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,720
in society, then everybody would be hounding them for money.

809
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,560
So they have to act as if it was only these two cows and these two pigs.

810
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,400
And this right potato or else they'd have to shell out for it to everybody.

811
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,720
So the only perfect Mickey's that are the more unless you found more

812
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,040
are the two pigs, the two cows and a shriveled potato.

813
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,280
Yes. Those were the only ones that they acknowledged.

814
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,880
Acknowledge and publicize.

815
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,400
And you know this.

816
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,600
How long this position was around for?

817
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,360
Sure. I mean, they didn't do any purchasing, I don't believe,

818
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,400
past 1992 because that article that I read was from 92.

819
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,480
And I don't I'm not aware of any since then.

820
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,240
She even says, like, you know, we're pretty careful with this stuff.

821
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,560
And even, you know, in the food thing, I don't think we're just going to go

822
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,880
buying up anything.

823
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,240
And I think also very little besides a potato would work in this area.

824
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,600
Although you never know. I just heard about a strawberry.

825
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,960
So that was a real cliffhanger in the article.

826
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,600
Pam Parks has a strawberry to check out.

827
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,800
Whatever happened to that perfect straw, perfect Mickey's strawberry

828
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,200
in the warehouse, the examined by top men.

829
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,080
And it's been growing and growing.

830
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,360
And one day it's going to crack out of that crate.

831
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,640
Do you think this is all do you think this is almost like aliens in Area 51

832
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,520
for when a new CEO comes into Disney, like when Iger came in,

833
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,640
they were like, we have to show you the perfect Mickey's

834
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,880
and they bring him into like a warehouse.

835
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,320
And it's like perfect strawberry Mickey.

836
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,360
And it's just animals.

837
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,920
They're some dead, some alive with perfect Mickey shapes,

838
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,840
just being bought to be kept out of the public eye.

839
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,920
It's like the collectors, like some are in cryogenic tubes.

840
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,680
And yeah, it's the collector from Sardines of Galaxy.

841
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Yeah, it's exactly like that.

842
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,320
They just had to copy what it looks like.

843
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,680
And then Iger's like, oh, my, my God.

844
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,440
And it's down in the, you know,

845
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,760
it's the broadband Glendale area of southern California is filled with Disney

846
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,160
offices, warehouses, sound stages.

847
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,600
So it's very possible the perfect Mickey's are stored by the train tracks

848
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,560
before the brewery, but after the strip like the strip club.

849
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,160
And there's like a guy, there's like a Brent Spiner from Independence Day

850
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,600
style scientist that's in there that's curating all of it.

851
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,040
There's some very interesting things happening around here.

852
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,920
Right. Look a lot.

853
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,960
Well, then I think what we need to do is start a Facebook group

854
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,760
for anyone who is interested in raiding this place.

855
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,280
Area area, M.M.

856
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,400
If we Naruto run, we can run faster than their bullets.

857
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,120
They can't stop all of us.

858
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,280
Yeah, I mean, yeah, they can't stop all of us.

859
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,760
Cut to nine people in this group.

860
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,080
None of us making eye contact.

861
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,080
Oh, hey, good to see you.

862
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,120
How long you been in the group? Three months. OK, cool.

863
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,520
Well, you want to go do it then?

864
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,800
Save the perfect Mickey's.

865
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,200
Go save this perfect Mickey's.

866
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,200
I think I'm excited to see that strawberry gunned down all of us right away.

867
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,960
Very easily.

868
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Bred in a lab to have perfect Mickey's all over our bodies.

869
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,760
Bob J.

870
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,240
Peck overseeing it.

871
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,400
Yes. Very good.

872
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,120
And speaking of gunned down, Mickey Moop passed away in 1993.

873
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,960
And.

874
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,840
Oh, no, no, no.

875
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,200
I mean, well, there's only this is that's a way that barnyard animals die.

876
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,560
That's for sure.

877
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,640
I found an article is that

878
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,720
the official company line is she died of old age.

879
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,440
But according to Disneyland spokesman John McClintock, very strong name.

880
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,760
Mickey Moop was used in eyes because of, quote,

881
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,240
some kind of intestinal disorder, the vet determined to be terminal.

882
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,480
And now Mickey shaped tumors in the intestine.

883
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,800
That's a kind of that's the kind of perfect Mickey you don't want to.

884
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,480
And now that's too hard to remove.

885
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,120
That's the problem. Yeah.

886
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,760
So and how old was Mickey or Mickey Moop?

887
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,480
That's Mickey not Mickey.

888
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,720
Mickey Mickey Moop died in 1993.

889
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,560
Minnie Moop lived longer, much longer, lived until 2001.

890
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,400
Her page, 15 years old.

891
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,800
The how old? 15, 15.

892
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,800
Long for a cow.

893
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,160
Old for that kind of. Yeah. For a cow.

894
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,720
Her fandom page listed years active as 84 to 2001,

895
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,040
which is just the years alive.

896
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,240
Years active, years active.

897
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,600
Well, that's where you say for a band, like how long they toured for.

898
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,920
It's very strange.

899
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,360
That's how long she was a cow.

900
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,640
The whole life. Yeah.

901
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,480
The Mickey symbol, though, was she was born with it.

902
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
So that is she was in it is.

903
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,280
She was an active piece of Disney branding for her entire life. Right.

904
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,640
Yeah. You know, we haven't talked about really is what.

905
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,240
So what was this?

906
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,240
So, OK, so Mickey or Minnie Moop

907
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,680
was in the parks and they advertise this in in 1991

908
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,400
is the 20th anniversary of Disney World.

909
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,440
And there was some like a big newspaper spread

910
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,480
and something in Reader's Digest or something.

911
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,440
It was like 20 new things for our 20th anniversary.

912
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,440
And number 18 or 19 was Minnie Moop.

913
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,000
Come see Minnie Moop, the miraculous cow with the Mickey shape.

914
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,480
And you could go, you pet it, probably.

915
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,440
You could touch it.

916
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,720
You could watch it walk around.

917
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,840
And that was it, I guess.

918
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,040
This video is on YouTube of people filming Minnie Moop. Yep.

919
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,880
I mean, like, I think a cool, a cool thing to have there.

920
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,200
But once you see it, that's kind of it.

921
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,280
There's no show just sort of walks around and is a cow.

922
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,000
This has me concerned because I feel like I've seen the phrase

923
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,880
50 new things for the 50th anniversary.

924
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,120
And I'm very curious how they're going to pad that list out.

925
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,640
It's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot more. Yeah. Yeah.

926
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,040
Yeah. Well, that's what the labs for.

927
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,280
Right. They're going to open up the vault.

928
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,320
Forty five of the 50 things are cows.

929
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,520
They've been amassing them and breeding them.

930
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,680
There's one is a ride and 45 are cows.

931
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,640
And then five new Instagram walls,

932
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,720
four new Instagram walls, one cupcake.

933
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
Yeah, it's like a lavender triangle.

934
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,040
Cool. Graham, if you could.

935
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,360
OK. And then, you know, obviously, Graham, those cows.

936
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,600
Mm hmm. So the Iron Man cow.

937
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,600
Yeah, it's it's all iron cow.

938
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,640
Bing Bong Moo.

939
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,000
Spider Man Moo. Spider Man Moo.

940
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,560
I don't think they could.

941
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,520
I mean, many so many boo was eventually moved to the Fort Wilderness

942
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,120
Resort and Campgrounds Tri Circle D Ranch.

943
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,200
But the grandma's petting zoo pictures, like people are just sitting

944
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,640
on top of the fence, like liability.

945
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,840
I guess I mean, you could pet a horse pretty close in a pet.

946
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,760
But like they had a they always had cast members there of like,

947
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,960
no, you can't climb on the fence.

948
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,560
And like the early 90s, people were just like hanging over into the pen.

949
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,680
Though that may have just been the photo op, like let's, you know,

950
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,840
act as if you can get up close.

951
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,160
Oh, that's true. Maybe.

952
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah. Rub that Mickey head.

953
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,360
But you're not getting that close.

954
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,400
Yeah, I'm surprised you I would think you would have done the.

955
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,360
You've seen the cow.

956
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,800
We were there for the 20th.

957
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,640
Like we have 20th merchandise.

958
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,680
Because when we used to go to Disneyland, when they when Big Thunder

959
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,640
Ranch was still there, you always wanted to make a point of seeing the goats

960
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,560
and seeing the. I love the cow.

961
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,360
There was a cow there.

962
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,720
There was a cow and there was the horses would be in and out.

963
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,320
Yeah, yeah, the horses were there.

964
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,360
The horse was the was the horse, the one that we were there when there was.

965
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,600
He had a giant erection.

966
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,120
I think so. Yeah, it was insane.

967
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,480
Wow. So but we would always go not to see the erection,

968
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
but to see just the goats in general.

969
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,600
Yeah. Yeah.

970
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,760
So I would think that that would have left some.

971
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,720
There's got to be a photo of you.

972
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,920
There's got to be a photo. Yeah.

973
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,800
If you had that interest.

974
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,840
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

975
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,320
We got to I got to start digging next time at home

976
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,920
because we had a tendency to box up photo.

977
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,320
Keep keep photos in good condition. Box them up.

978
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,160
But also by photo albums.

979
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,680
Yeah. Never look at them and never get them in the albums.

980
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,040
Yeah, we have. Yeah, we have.

981
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,880
We got I got to go through all of it, too.

982
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,680
Yeah, I keep finding good little treasures.

983
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,200
This thing's I've been meaning to come bring on the show and talk about.

984
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,880
We barely opened up the vault.

985
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,200
Our vault, our vault, our warehouse.

986
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,440
There's a lot of good stuff in there.

987
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,920
So perfect.

988
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,320
A lot of perfect good boys in those.

989
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,520
I I'll tease this.

990
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,480
I found a magazine article.

991
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,800
I wrote like a I had some like magazine project for school.

992
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,120
Oh, my. And I.

993
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,640
We had to like populate a whole magazine and I styled mine like Entertainment Weekly.

994
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,000
Your favorite magazine.

995
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I loved it too.

996
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,400
That's why Lent was rough for me growing up because I on

997
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,120
were Good Friday because I had to be sad that Jesus was on the cross

998
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,320
and I couldn't go get my entertainment weekly.

999
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,560
So I did my own entertainment weekly and I wrote a cover story

1000
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,920
about Hollywood being very immoral.

1001
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,200
Oh, my. Wow.

1002
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,480
As a 10 year old boy.

1003
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,080
My goodness.

1004
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,680
I've been meaning to bring that in.

1005
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,320
I don't want to say any more about it, but I will.

1006
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,960
We will. One of these episodes, you will hear 10 year old

1007
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,480
Scott Garner's thoughts about Hollywood morality.

1008
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,720
Oh, wow.

1009
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,040
Where were you? Just I don't think I knew the word morality.

1010
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,320
Well, you are not as good of a Catholic as I was in any kind of.

1011
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,240
You are in any kind of.

1012
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,200
Just a quick tease.

1013
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,080
So where do you think you got all of that information from?

1014
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,920
From church? Yeah, probably from like

1015
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,480
homilies, because I do remember I always lit up when there was a pop culture

1016
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,840
reference in a sermon, and this would have been after that.

1017
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,560
But I do really specifically only one of my only church memories

1018
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,160
was when the priests started getting into.

1019
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,560
And there is a film.

1020
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,920
There is a vile film coming to theaters across this country.

1021
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,800
A film called Dogma, which it is supposed

1022
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,920
that Christ was made in an impure way.

1023
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,080
And like, wow, I think I remember like powder being talked about in a sermon.

1024
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,600
And I was like, I will never see this filthy dogma.

1025
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,120
How dare they?

1026
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,440
Actually, you were you were

1027
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,200
following the trend, like most of America said, I'm not going to see dogma.

1028
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,040
Actually, you were on on trend for that.

1029
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,880
Now psyched for dogma, too. Yeah.

1030
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,000
I cannot wait to see how emaciated every member of dogma to it

1031
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,920
and how they explain Chris Rock's not being involved.

1032
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,880
Mm hmm. I just as just a counterpoint, like

1033
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,240
Protestant, like Presbyterian pastors and stuff,

1034
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,280
when they would bring up pop culture, it would always be a way into the sermon.

1035
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,760
And I cannot I lost track of how many times I would hear someone going,

1036
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,680
you know, I was at the mall this week and and it was it was always something so.

1037
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,760
And like I it was like I saw a poster that's,

1038
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,120
you know, for sale of a kitten and it said, keep your head up.

1039
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,760
And Jesus gave that message to the apostles as well.

1040
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,640
To keep your head up when you're feeling blue and

1041
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:42,720
we are all fighting an infinity war against the evil forces of this.

1042
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,000
You know that I would like I'm now I'm upset.

1043
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,680
I didn't know if we're going to get stuff like that, because I bet they're

1044
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,080
getting really culturally to keep the kids in the sea.

1045
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,800
You missed out on the comic book Bible.

1046
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,840
What do you mean? We talk about.

1047
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,160
Oh, well, this was we would get like little serialized pamphlets of it.

1048
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,000
But you could also buy a full like Archie Goodwin or so,

1049
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,120
like some big comic book person illustrated a full comic book.

1050
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,280
But they would sell on infomercials and stuff.

1051
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,720
I would I would read that. Yeah.

1052
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,840
I know Bible Man, the Willie Ames show. Oh, yeah.

1053
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,200
I mean, we honestly, now that I say it out loud, that's an episode.

1054
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,160
Yeah, I know.

1055
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,040
You know, Bible Man. Oh, hell yeah.

1056
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,400
I know the freeze, but I know the context.

1057
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,800
Oh, maybe we just cancel everything we're doing next and we do Bible.

1058
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,880
I found really cheap Bible Man invitation, like like a birthday party.

1059
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,560
I invited people to a birthday party with Bible Man

1060
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,480
invitations when I was like 19 or something.

1061
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,840
Oh, yeah. Bible Man's on the docket now. Yeah.

1062
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,080
That's a thing. Yeah.

1063
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,240
Let's just expose you to it. Yeah.

1064
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,520
Don't look at it. Yeah.

1065
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,800
I I Scott, I feel like you have a book,

1066
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,720
a book of essay or like a one man show in you of like, you know, I even

1067
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,040
it's one of the things that's helpful about a podcast.

1068
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,240
You start a podcast and you think, well, I'm not in.

1069
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,960
I don't have stories from my life.

1070
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,080
And then you start like digging like, I wonder if there's an old Disney map

1071
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,920
in this box. Oh, my God.

1072
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,320
I wrote an article about immorality in Hollywood.

1073
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,400
And you really forget like, oh, that's not what other kids did, is it?

1074
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,680
Oh, I drew something I called a better Disney map.

1075
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,720
I did make OJ land.

1076
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,920
I mean, you didn't make a parody, topical parody.

1077
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
That is park. Yeah. Yeah.

1078
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,680
The listener is listening to this for some reason on Patreon and hasn't gone back.

1079
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,560
What episode was that? I don't remember.

1080
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,640
I think it's Mission Impossible. Oh, really?

1081
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,360
I believe I think it's a Mission Impossible episode, I think.

1082
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,320
Yeah. Don't tell that sounds right.

1083
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,720
Yeah. That photo, that photocopy, one of my prize possessions.

1084
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,320
I also have mine upstairs. I have not got.

1085
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,000
Yeah, I kept it.

1086
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,560
I just found the original in this box of treasures.

1087
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,720
Let's all any if you're going home soon, Jason, next time you do my let's all

1088
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,920
make sure we end up with a lot of treasures.

1089
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,960
We can even do it.

1090
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,000
We could spread them out through episodes.

1091
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,480
We could do an episode that is like, you know,

1092
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,560
raiding the pockets, the right vaults of it.

1093
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,960
Sure. There's a lot of incriminating shit.

1094
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,440
And by that, I mean, yeah, so pure that it is only incriminating

1095
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,360
in a strange, perverse way. Yeah.

1096
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,960
Yeah. In a literal sense.

1097
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,440
Jason, of course, playing a Nazi is a 12 year old.

1098
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,720
I mean, someday he's got it.

1099
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,200
I got it. I got it.

1100
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,000
So that's coming.

1101
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,840
Let me as we let's let's get our remaining many things in here.

1102
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,280
Did you guys know that Minimoo was welcomed to

1103
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,680
Disney World with the with a there's a little like photo op day

1104
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,080
in front of Mickey's house, you know, where the where he needs to make a call

1105
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,320
and uses the den, there's a big sign that says welcome Minimoo.

1106
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,160
And he and Minimoo is being welcomed by a generic Disney spokesperson,

1107
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,520
Mickey, in kind of a ranch uniform.

1108
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,880
And can you see who that is on the far right?

1109
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,440
I know you're a little far away from my iPad.

1110
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,760
My eyes are not so good.

1111
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,480
And I know this is not the answer.

1112
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,320
It looks like professional wrestler Brian knobs, but that is not who it is.

1113
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,520
And with the white hair.

1114
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,760
Here, let me let me zoom in.

1115
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,560
Yeah, it's a guy with big, thick black glasses.

1116
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,600
I think I have a guess.

1117
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,680
Yeah. Is it Bruce Vila?

1118
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,560
Is that right? Bradbury? No, no, no.

1119
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,840
It's Harry Carrey. There you go.

1120
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,640
Harry Carrey, famous Cubs announcer Harry Carrey, yeah,

1121
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,680
was on hand to welcome Minimoo, a cow with a Disney, with a Mickey

1122
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,720
ship into the part. Well, because his famous catchphrase,

1123
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,080
when something impressive or cool would happen, he would say, holy cow.

1124
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,720
And that's why that's great.

1125
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,680
Yeah. Right.

1126
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,840
I was looking at the picture and thinking, who's this Harry Carrey looking guy?

1127
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,480
Oh, my God, it is him.

1128
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,280
Yeah. This site, whatever this what WDW Magic, I think, said.

1129
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,360
And they bring up that he was on he was he happened to be there

1130
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,160
because he and several of the Cubs were taking a special vacation

1131
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,080
with fans of the Cubs.

1132
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,280
What does that mean?

1133
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,600
Talking about what you could win a trip to Disney World with with two Cubs

1134
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,280
and Harry Carrey, which do we know which Cubs they were?

1135
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,640
Doesn't say this is my era of actually following baseball

1136
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,400
when I was in first grade.

1137
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,640
OK, I guess with the Cubs, who would you if you could have picked Cubs

1138
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,880
to go to Disney World and Andre Dawson and either Ryan Sandberg or Mark Grace?

1139
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,000
I would take Sean Dunstan as well.

1140
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,360
But those are the top three.

1141
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,800
Those were like the that was the trinity of of that era of the Cubs.

1142
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,080
Sure. Yeah.

1143
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,320
I'd also like to say that WDW Magic

1144
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,320
also because I was looking for more information about this historic

1145
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,280
Harry Carrey trip to Disney World.

1146
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,360
And this site has like a year by year, you know, big things in Disney World

1147
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,840
history, and they list they have sections for every year of famous people

1148
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,480
who visited Disney World. Wow. Really? That's really good.

1149
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,360
Yeah. That site has the real dirt.

1150
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,680
That's got good rumors. Oh, really?

1151
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,960
Those message boards. But it's it's hard.

1152
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,600
They are hard to navigate. Oh, sure.

1153
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,720
OK, layouts where you get good.

1154
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,720
I mean, they were the only sources of Harry Carrey.

1155
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,960
Yeah. And I should say, boy, this, you know,

1156
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,960
you would like to go to Disney World with the Cubs.

1157
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,160
But I think any of these guys

1158
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,280
we'd love to hang with at Disney World in 1990.

1159
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,320
Bill Lambier, basketball legend, Bill Lambier,

1160
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,160
Millie Vanilli, Wow, Gerald McRaney, major dad himself.

1161
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,920
Oh, wow. And Jonathan Frakes, another one of my heroes.

1162
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,080
I know you would have loved to go to Disney World with Jonathan Frakes.

1163
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,080
What year was that? 1990.

1164
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,160
Wow. So he's like three years into being Riker.

1165
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,560
Mm hmm. Wow.

1166
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,920
You could have seen Mini Moo with Jonathan Frakes,

1167
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,680
potentially with Harry Carrey, Carrey calling it a holy cow.

1168
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,760
Harry Carrey, Jonathan Frakes and two of the Cubs.

1169
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,520
Any two. And then me.

1170
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,280
I wasn't though that year I was not yet into Star Trek The Next Generation.

1171
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,960
I was like six.

1172
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,960
I think I didn't get into it until I was like nine.

1173
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,800
OK, but any time. All right.

1174
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,440
Yeah, we could rewrite history.

1175
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,960
I would have still like this charming, handsome actor problem.

1176
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,320
But like I like the I like this guy.

1177
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,520
You would have left your parents for him.

1178
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,640
Yes. If you'd like to adopt me, I'll leave.

1179
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,880
I'm living with him now.

1180
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,920
But if I was like, we're not going to church or anything cool,

1181
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,320
like he's whatever he's up to, I'm interested in.

1182
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,360
I would have been on the set of Star Trek The Next Generation.

1183
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,400
I don't know. Been the greatest.

1184
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,840
I really wish now if you could change.

1185
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,760
Well, if I could bring each other, but if I could change one thing,

1186
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,040
I probably would have been adopted by Jonathan Frakes while on a Disney World trip.

1187
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,200
Yeah, hopefully my mom's not listening to this.

1188
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,560
Yeah, really?

1189
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,920
I would have abandoned my parents immediately

1190
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,720
to go with that handsome soap opera actor.

1191
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,280
They could have visited you once a year.

1192
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,560
You would meet at Grandma Duck's farm once a year for your parents

1193
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,160
to your biological parents to say hello briefly.

1194
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,160
Once in a while.

1195
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,440
But then you got rides to do.

1196
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,320
And he married soap opera actress Jeannie Francis, who he's still married to.

1197
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,560
So like it would have been a showbiz family.

1198
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,760
Yeah, this would have been great.

1199
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,680
I would have been a little showbiz boy.

1200
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,680
Man.

1201
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,520
My mom is Jeannie Francis.

1202
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,520
Yeah.

1203
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,400
That's what I always said.

1204
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,280
Like, oh, like the next.

1205
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,240
So if you're thinking about beating me up back off, back off.

1206
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,080
Hell immediately.

1207
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,840
As Commander Riker is my father.

1208
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,080
My message board find less less interesting.

1209
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,000
But when I was looking for many new stuff, I found an old message

1210
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,280
work called Intercot.

1211
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,280
OK. And

1212
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,720
the only thing that's really noticeable of this is the phrasing.

1213
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,600
Their their thread about Minimoo dying was just so blunt.

1214
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,960
It just said Minimoo has died.

1215
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,200
And for whatever reason, my mind jumped to the scene

1216
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,000
and children of men where they're in the coffee shop and they're like

1217
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,240
little Jojo, the youngest man in the world, has died.

1218
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,760
It just seemed a little intense.

1219
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,280
Also said Minimoo died of natural causes.

1220
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,160
So I'm assuming no foul play suspected, no autopsy done, I'm guessing.

1221
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,440
I would assume that's right.

1222
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,520
Was survived by a child.

1223
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,320
What?

1224
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,920
Minimoo had a baby named Baby Moo.

1225
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,320
Wow.

1226
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,200
And here's a photo of Mickey and Baby Moo.

1227
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,560
What? Hold on.

1228
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,120
Unless I'm hold on, let me reread this to make sure it's not Mickey Moo.

1229
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,920
Does Baby Moo hold on?

1230
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,040
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Have a spot.

1231
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,320
Is it like this is?

1232
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,400
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

1233
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,560
Mickey Moo had a baby. I'm so sorry.

1234
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,600
OK, that's fine.

1235
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,760
Moo had a baby named Baby Moo.

1236
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,240
And here is a photo of me, a real Mickey feeding Baby Moo

1237
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,200
with a bottle with a bottle.

1238
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,480
He's got my dream e-ticket attraction.

1239
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,080
Yeah. And this is from discovering the Magic Kingdom dot com.

1240
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,360
Whoa. So I like a lot of good websites today.

1241
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,960
So, yeah, some new stuff.

1242
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,120
So Mickey Moo had Baby Moo.

1243
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,800
Wow. That's very charming.

1244
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,320
A fake big mouse feeding a real baby cow.

1245
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,320
But with no Mickey symbol of any kind, it appears more black than white.

1246
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,400
Whereas Mickey Moo had just a black Mickey.

1247
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,680
Very white and then only the big black spot.

1248
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,720
Yeah. But a real nice like little bow around his neck.

1249
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,200
So without the spot, they Disney assuredly slaughtered this cow.

1250
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,480
Yes, Baby Moo was killed within the first three weeks of its baby.

1251
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,680
Moo's baby was death not reported on by any support.

1252
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,560
There was poison in Mickey's bottle.

1253
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,000
And not taking care of you.

1254
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,320
That's for sure.

1255
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,360
You don't promote the corporate IP.

1256
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,440
Get my face next time.

1257
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,080
Let's not forget, Mini Moo had a plaque has plaque.

1258
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,920
Oh, yeah. A memorial plaque in the

1259
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,080
Fort Wilderness Resort, which I which makes me say

1260
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,000
there's been a campaign recently.

1261
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,480
Richard Girth, the longtime greeter at the Grand Californian, passed away recently.

1262
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,040
And people are trying to get a statue or a plaque of him.

1263
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,720
If we can have one for Mickey, Mini Moo, surely we can have one of Richard Girth.

1264
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,160
Yeah. Just a shout out.

1265
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,120
Shout out to Richard.

1266
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,760
Mickey's face on him anyway.

1267
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,280
Did he have a no, he just had a kindly smile and was also known for escorting

1268
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,680
some brides at the wedding chapel.

1269
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,880
People, people would walk them down the aisle, walk them down the aisle.

1270
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,880
Yeah. People, people who would stay at the Grand Floridian regularly

1271
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,560
loved seeing Richard Girth when they arrived.

1272
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,560
OK, so they say if they didn't have like a father or something, maybe.

1273
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,360
I yes, I believe that's the he was the closest thing.

1274
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,520
They had a father.

1275
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,160
If they hadn't been adopted by Jonathan Franks and Jeannie Francis,

1276
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,800
which so many children don't get that luxury.

1277
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,680
Oh, very sad world.

1278
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,600
We're hitting the 50th, the 50th of Disney World,

1279
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,400
50th anniversary suit.

1280
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,960
I just want the park covered, the whole property covered with

1281
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,720
very niche specific memorial plaques.

1282
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,120
So that's what you're going to be going there for.

1283
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:10,040
That's I'm hoping at least 10 to 20 of the 50 new things are plaques, statues.

1284
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,320
Most of them commemorating greeters at the various hotels.

1285
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,440
Greeters. Yeah.

1286
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,200
Greeters and slightly unusual.

1287
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,640
Fallen restaurant brethren, flying fish, spoodles,

1288
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,280
flying fish might still be. I can't remember.

1289
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:30,120
I was thinking how though now like that now, but to is on the spot where

1290
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,000
once Mickey Moo roams and that maybe that there's I think there should be a plaque

1291
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,800
commemorating that like here you are, like probably on the farthest end of it,

1292
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,560
maybe like the Droid Depot.

1293
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,120
Let's put up a plaque that says on this spot,

1294
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,640
mini Mickey Moo, the cow once took a big shit.

1295
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,760
Well, but I feel like I 100 percent agree with you,

1296
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,040
but it is the only way I'm so excited.

1297
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,120
I can't get it out.

1298
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,400
It's the only land with a milk stand.

1299
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,880
It has a milk stand.

1300
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,040
Oh, wow. You're right.

1301
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:09,600
Yeah. The cow lineage remains.

1302
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,640
Yeah. That's very nice.

1303
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,240
What a nice tribute.

1304
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,240
Yeah. Non dairy, I guess.

1305
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,640
But I guess so throughout its history, that corner,

1306
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,720
the other northwest corner of the park has always been the milk zone.

1307
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,840
Thanks, Star Wars, for keeping that tradition alive.

1308
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,120
They should do white milk, too.

1309
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,080
Yeah. Not just green and blue.

1310
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,880
So it's weird in space.

1311
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1312
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,360
And that's the true tribute to Mickey Moo.

1313
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,560
Nice, decent milk producer.

1314
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,040
Do we see any info on that?

1315
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,880
Don't know, because many was not.

1316
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,160
Many was not. Many was not.

1317
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,120
Many was really dissed by her former owners.

1318
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,240
I'd also like to say that in the story where they almost like, hey,

1319
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,400
if we have a cat with a Mickey spot and hey, for the right sum of money,

1320
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,720
we might be willing to part with the cat, which like as a cat owner,

1321
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,080
hey, monsters, what the fuck?

1322
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,200
You're going to sell your cat to like a and they said no.

1323
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,480
Disney would say no because dogs and cats require too much like personal

1324
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,640
care, but a cow could just kind of walk around.

1325
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,760
What a fucking asshole family.

1326
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,400
Here, take our cat, give us $200 and it's yours.

1327
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:23,120
Yeah. How much would I sell Ed Edwin for if he had a Mickey

1328
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,920
Lindsay's here upset about that?

1329
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,920
I'm just saying hypothetically, how much would it have to be if he had like a

1330
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,880
little Mickey like you would sell me before it went in that take Sharpie,

1331
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,040
draw Mickey ears on your forehead.

1332
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,040
But one of those yard sale, one of those labels people only buy for yard sales.

1333
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,480
Like the numbers scribbled on it and you're like, I think it's a six.

1334
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,360
I think let's, let's just say I got as much money for him as I would at a state

1335
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,480
fair, $130.

1336
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:56,760
You rejected the radio station's offer to mash Jason into, into a plate of

1337
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,600
mashed potatoes.

1338
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:04,520
That's how he has it in his will that he wants to be buried in a bunch of

1339
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,080
potatoes after living out many years, roaming Disney pastures.

1340
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,280
You know, as we say that, I don't think I've ever been to a state fair.

1341
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,040
I have no idea where the Pennsylvania or New Jersey ones, but I think we're

1342
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:20,880
coming up on the, the, the California state fair and the LA county state fair.

1343
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,440
I feel like orange County, but in Minnesota, been to Ohio.

1344
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,360
Wow.

1345
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,640
I feel like not only do we have to go, you have to enter some sort of contest.

1346
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,280
Ooh yeah.

1347
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,440
Yeah, absolutely.

1348
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,600
I don't know which one.

1349
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,840
Past guest, uh, even Anderson has one ribbons.

1350
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,320
I was thinking pie eating, but it could be pie making.

1351
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:41,800
Yeah.

1352
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,640
You know, that's true.

1353
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:52,520
Um, you know, Mini Moo opened the Osceola fair, one of the big Florida fairs.

1354
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,440
Uh, bike.

1355
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,600
She, it was like, let's, uh, cut the ribbon to open the fair.

1356
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,280
You can't cut a ribbon if you're a cow.

1357
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:05,120
So they made a ribbon out of hay for the mo to chew through.

1358
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,120
Yeah.

1359
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,440
That's pretty delightful.

1360
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,160
I wish they did that at rope drop.

1361
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,360
It's a park.

1362
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,960
I wish the end of main street, a cow had to come out and eat a

1363
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,440
hay ribbon every morning.

1364
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,480
Or if you're successfully sold due to your Sharpie spot on your forehead, then

1365
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,720
a big like sausage link opens the park.

1366
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,200
Love to chomp through some summer sausage to welcome everyone.

1367
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,720
Shoo, shoo, shoo.

1368
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,000
Milk will be your award.

1369
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,120
He died quickly eating only a diet of summer sausage and milk.

1370
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,640
Once a day.

1371
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,880
First thing in the morning.

1372
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,920
And then it was mashed up like potatoes.

1373
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,120
Life well lived.

1374
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,320
Uh, we should probably wrap it up.

1375
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,680
You see, I've puggased the ride, the second gate.

1376
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,880
Uh, Hey, what a blast.

1377
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,640
And, uh, if any of you, if anyone listening as a Mickey birthmark or

1378
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,320
anything, let us know.

1379
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,960
Um, and we'll try to sell you to Disney.

1380
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:07,960
Yeah.

1381
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,560
I just cut us in on a piece of it.

1382
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,280
We'll broker it.

1383
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,000
Um, thanks for listening.

1384
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,240
Uh, where are we at with live shows now?

1385
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:14,720
I don't know.

1386
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,440
I'll keep checking.

1387
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:15,720
Yeah.

1388
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,360
Some of them are still happening.

1389
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,280
Yeah.

1390
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:18,960
Orlando.

1391
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,120
We're going to Orlando October 24th to look at that plaque, that mini move plaque.

1392
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:24,680
Yeah.

1393
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:24,880
Yeah.

1394
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,920
Uh, for wilderness.

1395
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,440
Might be it.

1396
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,360
We're going to do that and then leave.

1397
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,440
That's probably about it.

1398
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,840
And that's what the show will be about.

1399
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,240
Yep.

1400
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:30,680
Yeah.

1401
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,960
The theme of the episode is the, is the plaque, the main, the mini

1402
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,080
black and we're not even going to talk about the cow.

1403
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,440
It's going to be about like the, the making of the play, like the thickness

1404
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,200
of the letters and the quality, how it's fastened to the wall, if we can remove it.

1405
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:44,600
Yeah.

1406
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,840
Maybe a little, what the rest of the wall is like and the molding on nearby doors,

1407
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,040
but only if we have time.

1408
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:49,320
Yep.

1409
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,200
So yeah, uh, get tickets to that.

1410
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,680
See you in Orlando.
