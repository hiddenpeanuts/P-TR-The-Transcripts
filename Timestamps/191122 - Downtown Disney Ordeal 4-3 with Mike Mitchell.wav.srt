1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil rears its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried donut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, With secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Boys, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, he will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of the mall.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We have 18 daily, very necessary episodes and much to do so.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic or boring.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's the Downtown Disney ordeal level four, stage three.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We are working our way ever slowly, ever surely through Downtown Disney, the retail center,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
in between Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson's sticking in there too.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, I'm hanging in there and Jason Sheridan.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes, I was doing well. My madness levels have subsided from the underworld.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And then the last few days I've just been watching, unfortunately,

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
compulsively watching a lot of Mayor Pete dance videos and it is driving me more insane again.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I hate it and I cannot stop.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So you don't know how to do the Mayor Pete dance?

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, you do the up and then you do it like all four sides and then you do the spin and then you do all four sides.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is it similar to the there's a we played a Chuck E.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Cheese song on the Chuck E.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Cheese episode where it was like me and my friends, which is sort of it sounds like the Bruno Mars song,

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the one that he did with Mark Ronson.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And there's a dance associated with that.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And it's similar to the Mayor Pete dance.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Similar. Yeah.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yours is the first one I've seen because I've avoided any video of this.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So you set the standard for me.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah. Don't don't start going down this rabbit hole.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Though I fear you will. I don't know.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Knowing you're some of your Internet deep dives.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Sure. But I've already been down such a rabbit hole about today's topic, about today's owner, the owner of today's restaurant.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And there's only one. There's only one in today's stage.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And along with that, there's only one guest we ever wanted to talk about this very special place.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As as announced at PTR 23 months ago from Doughboys from Love and returning victorious from Atlanta, Georgia as a movie star.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Mike Mitchell is here. Thank you for having me, guys. Thanks for coming back.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
As you know, we've been planning this out since the announcement day back at D23.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was tough to keep it under wraps.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A lot of NDA is required.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I mean, you should have seen when we unveiled the video of you saying Earl of Sandwich, everyone definitely knew what was happening and why they knew the context for sure.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Exceedingly clear.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
They must have known as much as I did when I was doing it with like when I put the hat on, I was like, what's happening here?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah, right. Should we say the original idea was you were going to be there live?

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I was going to be there. Yeah. And then I had to leave. I had to leave. I had to go to Hollywood.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Came calling. Yeah. I'm calling after a long time.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
After yes, you got the call. You answered the call.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Like so many of us, you went off and have shot an exciting movie for months and months while we've just been sitting here doing this shit trapped in an ordeal.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's called The Tomorrow War. Answer the call. Colin answer the call. I'm very excited about it.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There's a lot of good mojo around that phrase. I'm really glad they adopted it.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What was what was the deal with answer the call like like what does that mean as a subtitle?

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, you know, it's there's a few things going on. One, it wasn't originally there.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It was like tomorrow eventually evolved into edge of tomorrow colon live die repeat.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah. And then just straight up live, die, live, die, die, repeat, which is a better name.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you think so? I think I like edge of tomorrow better. I think I liked it.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think it is vague. I think lived. I repeat is more specific. You're just supporting tomorrow titles is what you're doing.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
True. Team tomorrow. But this is this is the exact same thing.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This movie was called Ghost Draft and now it's called The Tomorrow War.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I mean, do people I like that. Yeah. Do people like that better? Yeah, I think I like that because Carlson's. Yeah, I'm mixed.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But Ghost Draft. But I feel like maybe Ghost Draft evokes something in my head.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But I don't know if it's actually what the movie is from what I've heard. Yeah, I don't know.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't know. I think it was I thought it was kind of a cool title. Maybe I just got used to it.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If it's if Ghost Draft was about ghosts getting drafted onto football teams, which is kind of what I think of it.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We're drafted to like fight a war. No, no, no, no. Football teams. Oh, for football teams.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I like that, too. It was like you could draft OJ Simpson. He's still alive.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And who would draft OJ first? I don't know why I thought OJ.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Football player. Yeah. Yeah. Passed away. Yeah. Merlin Olsen.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I bet that's all I can name and he might not be dead either. Walter Payton. Yeah.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I got a first pick again. Oh, shit. OJ Simpson. I was OJ Simpson again.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're so big in the sports memorabilia world. You run into him every now and then in Vegas.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He and I have beaten down some people for some merchandise.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You got recruited. You were one of those guys. I got recruited.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's why they cast you in Tomorrow where they knew you looked good in a lineup of guys with guns.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But getting back to it, Answer the Call is a play on who you're going to call, right?

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, that never hit me until years later saying it was never going to call.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Wow. That's what that is. Oh, my God. They are the one.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But it's it doesn't work. It's not it's not perfect.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because who you want to answer was Ghostbusters. It was solved in the song.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The answer was Ghostbusters. Yeah. Yes.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And it was also solved by Dan Eckhart's cameo in Casper where he said somebody else.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Somebody else. Good point. They also could have just called it Ghostbusters colon who you're going to call.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's that's that's that makes more sense to me.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But this is, of course, the only mistake that was made.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hmm. Yeah. Yes. Perfect. I have not seen it.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I haven't. You've never seen it. I never saw it.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why? You never saw it either. No, I don't see a lot.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Even in my watch. I don't really. Yeah, I don't know.

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I didn't. Well, I have a question for you.

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is Casper like an insanely weird movie? I haven't watched in a long time.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's got some very odd stuff in it, for sure. The cameos are the strangest.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You just flip through and find I don't even want to say who.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But when Bill Pullman looks in a mirror, the some of the strangest cameos,

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you could never guess who's around the corner when he looks in the mirror.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Wasn't Father Guido Sarducci, isn't he in the movie? Yes.

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And then he goes in and that they this is this.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This still is in my head from back when I was a boy.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He goes in and then they like twist his head around backwards and he leaves with his neck broken.

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah. Have we seen the ghosts be violent until that point?

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But they kill they they twist Guido Sarducci's neck around.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They snap his neck in an attempt to kill him. But it's just a full reversal.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah. Well, they do. You hear him go like, ah, and then like, you know, chairs and dust goes flying.

107
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But nothing bad, nothing like a full neck rearrange.

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And this is also a very fun like a like an SNL character.

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What was Guido? What is he like?

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Back in the underworld where we just came from our second gate episodes,

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
we talked about the Blues Brothers and our perpetual confusion about why them and what is it and why like, is it comedy?

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And Guido Sarducci is another one of those. It's a little lost.

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I remember liking him as a kid. But like my wife, Erin, like if she if he comes up, like, what is that?

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What is he? What was the joke there? What is the bit?

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I can't remember. I've seen a number of Father Guido. Isn't he always smoking?

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Is it smoking? Just like smoke regularly. Is that the bit that he's a priest and he smokes?

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No, I don't think it is. I think that you know, Mitch knows.

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm going to tell you what I personally think it is.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think so much of the joke is his name is Father Guido Sarducci.

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And the voice. He's real Italian.

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I mean, Guido is like a like, isn't that like a thing of like a super?

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Maybe that maybe that he's kind of this like, yeah, this odd stereotype kind of sleazy guy.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah. I guess that's the bit.

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We all know that that's so weird to me.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We all know who he is worse than the Blues Brothers.

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The Blues Brothers, at least we know, like, well, they sing the songs and they're in Universal Studios.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Have you watched Sarducci recently?

129
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't mean the actual bit. I mean, in terms of popular culture.

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, I see. It's like, yes, someone may be able to point at the Blues Brothers and go like, oh, yeah, the Blues Brothers.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't think like Zoomers can point and go like, oh, Father Guido Sarducci.

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know. I'm wondering what the or it's only it's the guy from Casper.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's the guy. Oh, yes, they might know.

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But how do we all sit here and know Father Guido Sarducci? Like, sure.

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I guess we were all I don't know. Did you watch SNL tapes growing up?

136
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
In 40 years, we'll like well, like in 40 years, no one will know who the Tab Brothers are.

137
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll say that much. Your character, you and Tim Kalkax's characters.

138
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Tim Kalkax's character that we did.

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But as of now, there's a lot of Halloween costumes, I feel like that one comes back around a lot.

140
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This is not what I was trying to get with this.

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Not trying to get revenge.

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I was trying to think I was sadly trying to think of like a bad character I did. I'm like, oh, I just don't do characters.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I have no characters that I do.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, but you have whoosh.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Whoosh. Oh, yeah. Whoosh is great.

146
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In 40 years, will people know who whoosh is?

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Whoosh might get its own life like you kept pumping the YouTube algorithm towards whoosh.

148
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Whoosh being a character that was a sketch on the show, but also lives as YouTube links where you can wish your friend,

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
assuming it's a name that you guys chose, you like fill in that happy birthday, Michael, and you dub over.

150
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's a customized birthday message.

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You're being very nice, but in 40, like, first of all, will whoosh get a walk on role in like the My Pet Monster live action movie?

152
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's my question.

153
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It just doesn't make sense that Father Guido Sarducci is in this movie.

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But you have to remember that SNL in the 70s, and especially when there was peak Sarducci, that SNL had like 35 million viewers every week.

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Everyone was watching that show.

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And Quaaludes were legal.

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
My question to you is what are the peak Sarducci years? Because you said peak Sarducci.

158
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, because Sarducci lasted until like the early 90s, right?

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
They kept using him.

160
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, he would come and do... He hosted the show after the man who played him left the cast.

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There were episodes in the 80s where Eddie Murphy's cast member, it's like with your host, Father Guido Sarducci.

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Really? Wait, who played him? O'Donoghue? Don Novello.

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, yeah. Of course. Don Novello.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Did anyone have that fact in their head?

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Was he a writer too? He was, right? Yes.

166
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah.

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You know what's going to happen is like some New York comedian is going to get mad at us for like belittling Guido Sarducci.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Maybe.

169
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Sarducci is a fucking... Who are you guys?

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
My whole fucking persona, Sebastian Maniscalco. That's why he was my inspiration.

171
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I never would have done it without Sarducci.

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have two questions. One, is Don Novello still with us?

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, I believe so. Yeah.

174
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Has Father Guido Sarducci been in a car getting coffee with Jerry Seinfeld?

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He should be.

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Right? Doesn't that seem like a given?

177
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think I have his last appearance. He delivered the benediction at the Stuart Colbert rally to restore sanity and or fear.

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Fuck off.

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Fuck off.

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He was wearing his classic white clerical collar, a long red trim black coat with cape, zebra vest jacket and black beret.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So that is maybe that on the Wikipedia at least, maybe there's another appearance.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They hand to get Sarducci for the ultimate comedy rally.

183
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Bring Sarducci back.

184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, to those New York comedians who will get upset at us.

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Comedy isn't that great right now. I would like a Sarducci cameo.

186
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Oh man, Sarducci going like, high, high hopes for the living.

187
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's the Mayor Pete.

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Hey, if he gets the nomination, Mayor Pete, Father Guido.

189
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh, and the ticket.

190
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Imagine that on the bumper sticker.

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Six months now, like two months of Biden, two months of Warren, two months of Mayor Pete.

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The Bloomberg months are going to be so miserable.

193
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It is funny that it does just switch. It just switches around.

194
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There's a little carousel. We're going to hear about all these dipshits.

195
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Everybody gets to be leading the pack.

196
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
February, I mean, when regular, it will hopefully get better when regular people start actually pulling fools.

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And it's not just like Ivy League weirdos on 24 hour cable just talking all day long.

198
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Also, I know this is kind of a weird place to announce this, but I'm going to be running too.

199
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I honestly thank God. Thank God.

200
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You might have the you're enough of an everyman.

201
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It will be, you know what, it was going to be Democrat.

202
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There's going to be some bad optics when they're like, what's the First Amendment?

203
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And I'm like, uh, no, we like that.

204
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We don't like, we're sick of, we're sick of even know what all is like Trump.

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Trump knows too much. We need somebody who can't even.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You guys need to say the world needs someone dumber than Trump.

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And that's what I'm running on.

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Mitch, you will have to distance yourself from some of the like home temp from like scooch and whitey Bolger, the third like town.

209
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I think that's actually no, I think that's wrong. I think they're in the cabinet.

210
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, OK. I think you're right. Yeah. Oh, the whole game rivals, right?

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And Jason, I just want to say that whitey Bolger is a fucking rat and I don't like whitey Bolger.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You know what? You're right. No, I don't like him because he's a murderer. He's a bad man. Yeah, of course.

213
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I went to Sunday McLean's when whitey Bolger was probably just at Sunday McLean's.

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's just crazy to me. Oh, yeah. I would have recognized him.

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I feel like and I would have gotten killed. An old man would have killed me probably without a gun.

216
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He probably would have just beaten me to death.

217
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The 80 year old man would have beaten me down to death. What year?

218
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Like in the two and like the like in 2005, I was going like all the time.

219
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Wow. And that's like I feel like in that stretch, you would like prime time.

220
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah. Do you like do you feel like you've done enough that you've enjoyed since then that you're like, it's probably good.

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I didn't die in 2005 or that better way to go.

222
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It would have been a very interesting thing like the it's it's an Irishman death.

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You guys have it right now. That's a cool like, yeah. Cool guy killing him.

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Neat. That's a cool death. You would have had like Horatio Sands on now instead.

225
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You would have had someone who would respect or look up to you without you.

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The Horatio Sands would have filled by here. That doesn't make sense.

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So it would have been doing doughboys with Weiger. Yeah.

228
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So I do. Don't want to lie here. Huh?

229
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He's in the Mandalorian. I don't know. He's the first thing that came to my mind.

230
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He's in a scene or two. Two scenes. He's the he's the fish.

231
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He's the fish man. He's blue. Yeah.

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I know we should. I mean, we should talk about the damn Merla sandwich.

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We also haven't talked to you about theme park stuff in a long time.

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You've been a galaxy edge now. You feel like you're going to get mad at me.

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
No, no, no. I feel like I've been curious. I don't know.

236
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You're going to the park all the time now. Like sea change.

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Carlson, Carlson, has you come around? Are you?

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I want to use and I want with Carlson to the to the park.

239
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We had a nice time. We had a great time.

240
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It was like a podcast, your summit, because Lindsay and Kelly were there.

241
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah. T-Creates was there. And we took a picture in the Millennium Falcon, like

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
the waiting room, whatever. Like, do they call that the social quarters or whatever?

243
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I forget the official name. By the chess set.

244
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The chess room. And everyone's like, wow, can't look at this.

245
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What is this? What's coming to fruition to this?

246
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
We're all like nothing. We just went together.

247
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We went because we could go to it. Yeah. Basically, we were just having a nice Saturday afternoon.

248
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
People that was like a traveling Woolburys type super podcast.

249
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It wasn't. Stop demanding the collaboration.

250
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's not it's well, it's happening now. I don't know what you see.

251
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You came around. You've you've now you probably you had a decent time, but now you're like losing.

252
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I had a decent time. Here's what I think about Galaxy's Edge.

253
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm not sure I'm going to disagree with you, by the way. I think we might be on the same.

254
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I think my favorite thing about Galaxy's Edge is the Ronto wrap.

255
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Sure. Yes. I think the Ronto wrap is delicious.

256
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I go Cantina and then Ronto wrap. But yes, I turn on the Cantina a little bit.

257
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Look, I still think it's one of the better things about that entire park there or section of the park.

258
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But I I I don't think it's that great of a.

259
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I want now that I go to Disney, I'm like that is like I don't we were just there.

260
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Mike Carlson and I. Yeah, we went to go to Earl and then we popped in the park for a few hours.

261
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I had no urge to really go over there and do anything.

262
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There was nothing I really wanted to see over there.

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We were we were just in Disney World and we didn't really go to their Galaxy's Edge because we know it because it's the same.

264
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And there's other things we want. We wanted to do things that are only there.

265
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Here's my issue. Yeah, I first of all, the Cantina should have aliens in there.

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And when the last time I went in there, I've been in there now three times.

267
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You go up to the counter, you stand there and you drink your drinks and like there and then there's like people behind you and it's crowded.

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Unless you get one of those seats, which we did.

269
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, Jason, that was a great day. We all sat down in the booth and that was great.

270
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But like, why is there like why are there aliens in there? Why isn't there more fun happening?

271
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It doesn't make any sense to me. That's a big complaint.

272
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Like as it's starting to age, like that that was the stuff cut for cost.

273
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The equity actors walk around actors, people speculating that when Rise of the Resistance opens, which I think will like

274
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
we are all looking forward to seeing what this massive new ride will be like.

275
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But like they got to get some actors in there and they think people are like maybe they'll do some life day stuff.

276
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And there's a life day mentioned in the Mandalorian, but nothing for this year at least.

277
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So just just even walking around the park like the bloom.

278
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
First of all, the blue milk is like feels like a complete bomb to me.

279
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It doesn't feel like anyone cares about the blue milk and it was like butter beer.

280
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's no butter, which is what they wanted to be.

281
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I feel like. Yeah. And then like I was walking around the park.

282
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I saw Ray there and I was like, I don't know if anyone cares about seeing Ray or if that's even a thing.

283
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
There's no there's no Darth Darth Vader is the guy that you need to have just walking around.

284
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I think maybe this calculation of not just putting it in original movies is an odd calculation.

285
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I think it's I think it's a terrible calculation. I think it's so off.

286
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And like to be like, it's actually in this timeline.

287
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's like who cares about the timeline?

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
People go into the theme park, don't care about the timeline to start.

289
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I see Chewbacca in Admiral Ackbar and shit like that.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Just put them in that land. Star Tours is like all over the place with a timeline.

291
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
No one cares. Yeah.

292
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
This is the ultimate proof that nobody gives a fuck. We are with new characters, prequel characters, original characters does not matter.

293
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Nobody actually cares. It doesn't matter.

294
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Or show. I don't know if somebody care.

295
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like, well, it also like if it's if it was a real heart, like the idea I think in their head was like,

296
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
this is really going to be like a specific part of the larger Disney Star Wars narrative.

297
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But then they cut all the fun stuff.

298
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So like if it was truly like a bustling town full of like 30 original characters and droids,

299
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
where in the Star Tours scene, that's the main thing they're pushing.

300
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Like there's going to be 20 droids everywhere you look.

301
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You can see it at the end of Star Tours, that little tease for Batuu.

302
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah. It's full of droids and aliens and they're nowhere to be found.

303
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And when that stuff isn't there, it's like the landscape of of Galaxy's Edge is like just like an old dusty canyon.

304
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So now I'm like in this old dusty...

305
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Casca's Rocks, an unpleasant place to film.

306
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's an unpleasant place. It's like.

307
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And this was another thing with and I said this to you, Carlson, but like they should have done like it should have been like,

308
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
oh, God, now I can't remember the name of it. Sky, the sky. Cloud City. Cloud City. Thank you. Best spin.

309
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Cloud City. Like why don't they make like a Cloud City restaurant or something where you like take an elevator.

310
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I used air quotes there. Oh, I'm like you think you're in Cloud City and you have lunch up there or something like why didn't they?

311
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And why wasn't there like Hoth? Why couldn't there have been like a snowy part of Star Wars land?

312
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Like like it just feels like they probably think they're going to do that eventually.

313
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's my guess. But then also, I think there's an overcalculated.

314
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We've seen in the new movies, they really are like most things have to be on the desert planet, which is weird because it's like they must have done a poll where it's like,

315
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
which planet do you know the best from Star Wars?

316
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And it was like Tatooine, but didn't like completely gauge like, do you want to live on Tatooine?

317
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
No, you're going to have drinks.

318
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Who comes from the leaves Tatooine? Like you get out of the place. Everyone leaves.

319
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's where he wants to, doesn't want to live anymore. Yes.

320
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah. So yeah, I think if you haven't been, do go.

321
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Like the first one or two times is good. But like the revisiting, like they do need to switch it out.

322
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We're so going to get some hate on this.

323
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh, it's going to be me. It's all right. I mean, it's taking out on me. All right, you cowards.

324
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I think people like us who have gone a lot are starting to notice like, I wish there was some new experience.

325
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I wish there was something new to discover. Like, yeah, we got this big thing coming.

326
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But I almost like, like there's so much pressure on that last movie.

327
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I liked The Mandalorian and I was kind of like, I didn't know a lot about it going in.

328
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And I was like, I kind of like, I wish they just made more like low pressure TV shows, opposed to movies.

329
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
They build up so much. It's like, I kind of, this is like a little slower.

330
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
There's a lot of practical stuff. There's a lot of cool creatures. Cool creatures. Yeah.

331
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
There's more creatures. Yes. Some of whom you're like, oh yeah, those guys. I like those guys.

332
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm glad to see those guys back. And like, I kind of, yeah, they just build it up.

333
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So, and I'm not expecting them to introduce like new restaurant concepts or new rides immediately or stuff like that.

334
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But like, yeah, some new aliens. Like, look who's been spotted. There's a new character walking around.

335
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah, that's pretty simple. Who's this guy? Who's that guy? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

336
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And also, I mean, and I was going to say, I agree with you too on Mandalorian.

337
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Like there's stuff that annoys me about Mandalorian, but like that second episode, I was like, we said this, this is what Disney Star Wars was.

338
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It was like this level of like episode two of Mandalorian where I'm like, oh, it's like they're walking around and having fun.

339
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And the Jawas are there and he kills it. And then like big monster fights kind of weird and fun.

340
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And yeah, like, yeah, it's like you were saying, it's like they barely even talk in that second episode.

341
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm like, this is more fun to me than all the Disney movies are. And like he is a little endearing to me because it just gets his ass kicked.

342
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
So much of those first two episodes. And then I mean, it's hard to deny Baby Yoda. Like who's going to say Baby Yoda is not cute.

343
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's very cute. And then also at the same time is like a thing where I'm like, Baby Yoda, what is going on here?

344
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But then also I do agree that it's very cute. But the big issue with the land is that the ride isn't that good.

345
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah, we're all feeling it. Well, the Mark P ride, we got the B ride before the A ride.

346
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
People don't know that people go there and don't know it like the big ones coming.

347
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So if you pay your money to go there and that's what you wait for over an hour for and you get that.

348
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I think I just like I wanted to love it so much when we went in and I did.

349
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And even like I was probably in my head like Mitch is probably not going to like it.

350
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Now I hear I like I think I think you had the same thing, too.

351
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I think I think what we're all finding is like good first good like couple visits and then you start thinking about what is this ride really?

352
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And what is this mission and what's with the coaxium and the I will say that the ride never really passed my test my test because I also was an engineer the first time I was.

353
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I was in the third row and I was like the thing with the ride is we want to Carlson and I went on star tours on on the on our Earl of Sandwich Day.

354
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We went up we went over and that was one of the we went on the Haunted Mansion.

355
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I never done the Haunted Mansion the the the Jack Skeleton version of Haunted Mansion.

356
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And we did that.

357
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And then which I also I don't know if I love it.

358
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And then and then we did Star Tours and Pirates of the Caribbean.

359
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Those are the three rides and we did today and Star Tours.

360
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I was like I love start when we were doing Star Tours.

361
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I was like I love Star Tours even with the new stuff.

362
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, I like Star Tours and because it's big memorable.

363
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Okay, you probably don't like seeing Glass Jedi stuff but the but even like you remember the moment of all the red dust gets over your screen and you got to wipe it off.

364
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And where are we now?

365
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And felt like there's moments that you that for sure and out and you remember the Disney movies being in it hurts my soul.

366
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But I I I do and I enjoy Star Tours still.

367
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But my thing is is like Star Tours is how many years old 30 years old or something.

368
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah, I mean, they obviously updated the new version of it's like what 10 years old now 2011.

369
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Yeah, but still even even then like why is that ride more exciting than the Millennium Falcon?

370
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I think we've pinpointed it.

371
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's Mo it's there's two things there moments that are like fun that you remember like when you get on you're on the when you're underwater you get stuck in the things mouth when like you get crash on Jakku.

372
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah, the guy holds up the sign that fell off here or the yeah the logo the Star Tours logo.

373
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah, that's fun.

374
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And it's fun.

375
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
He's yelling at you and the guy getting stuck on the windshield.

376
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah, you're tilted in that moment too, which is really fun like you're kind of stuck on an angle because you crashed.

377
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But when they leave it in your hands, you make the moments you and maybe strangers you don't know how to fly a complex video.

378
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, it's a very video gamey like it looks it looks more video gamey than Star Tours does.

379
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, because it has to be like rendered in real time.

380
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So they can't get it looking as good probably yet.

381
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The technology isn't there.

382
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I mean, it looks more video gamey than like Death Stranding.

383
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yes.

384
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It looks more realistic.

385
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It does look more realistic.

386
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That's a great point.

387
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
What like fix that?

388
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Don't make it in real time.

389
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Make it some bullshit where if you don't pull the fucking if you don't pull the life speed thing, then like it's a slightly different version.

390
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And that's all the thing that like it's one thing that changes.

391
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's not like an exact moment or something that you have to be like we're pushing the buttons and we're doing the thing.

392
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Just make it.

393
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah, make it so that it's a it's already the outcome is there and someone can pull the thing to go into light speed and it's fun.

394
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Right.

395
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So they need the new missions.

396
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
They I don't think they know how badly they need the new mission.

397
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah, I'm sick of the teases on this.

398
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
They need to get them in there.

399
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We don't care about coaxium.

400
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Also, we need to get rid of the bars in the do you know how there's like the black bars to make it look realistic?

401
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah.

402
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah.

403
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Get rid of them.

404
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Have it just be a big screen.

405
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
What the what the hell is going on here?

406
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Don't you feel like Star Wars people would go but that's not what the I am a Star Wars loser and I don't give a shit that it would be.

407
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
They take it out.

408
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
For God sakes.

409
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It looks bad.

410
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I restrictive.

411
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I've got two words for a new mission that I think could satisfy everyone.

412
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Rescue Chewbacca.

413
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Wow.

414
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Right.

415
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's he's around.

416
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
No sends you on a mission.

417
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Chewbacca has been captured by the what is it called in the new movies?

418
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What is the what are the first order?

419
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I guess the cast from the first order.

420
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I could not remember legitimately.

421
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I think it's probably the first order.

422
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And so I think the first order is to rescue Chewbacca.

423
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So you have to rescue Chewbacca.

424
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I got two words to you.

425
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Right.

426
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah.

427
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Jar Jar come.

428
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Now are those words to fix the writer?

429
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There's just words you wanted to say.

430
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I just want to say Jar Jar.

431
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
No, I think this is the mission.

432
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You get miniaturized.

433
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You fly up Jar Jar's day.

434
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
There's a blockage.

435
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's like it's like that.

436
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Oh, it's like body wars.

437
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's like you can't just manipulate freely.

438
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yes, so that he can produce a child.

439
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah.

440
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You're helping him be able to see you're like, like he's it's like unsnipping him essentially.

441
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Can I just say this?

442
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Can I say that in Mandalorian, if there was a little baby Jar Jar, not Jar Jar himself,

443
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
but a little baby.

444
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah.

445
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Wouldn't that have been pretty good?

446
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It has to be Yoda.

447
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
If it was just cute, cute baby Gungan.

448
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I think there's the first.

449
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Finally in these new things.

450
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Is Jar Jar dead at the end of the prequels?

451
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
No, no, I don't think so.

452
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
No, no, he's alive.

453
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah.

454
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Is he still alive in the Disney in seven, eight and nine?

455
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
How do Gungans age?

456
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I don't know.

457
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't know how Yoda is.

458
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I think he's all in question.

459
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
What with Yoda?

460
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I think he's alive.

461
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
He'd be so old.

462
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
He'd be old though.

463
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
He met Anakin as a boy.

464
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
He was, I think, at least a teen.

465
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Old Jar Jar, a little slower, has an eye patch.

466
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
That's good.

467
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Ooh.

468
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And his dick doesn't work.

469
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Well, that is...

470
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Mesa dick don't work.

471
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Mesa needs...

472
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You're gonna fix my cum?

473
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Sorry, I know this isn't Dope-wise.

474
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I shouldn't say cum over and over again.

475
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You're gonna help me know.

476
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
There we go.

477
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That is a worry.

478
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah, we ran into that.

479
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
We decided not to censor it when Bugsy was on.

480
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Oh, and he said the C word?

481
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah.

482
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Well, our editor only has so many hours.

483
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
He said the nut, like he said what I said, or he said something else.

484
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Well, we've already said cum.

485
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Anything and everything.

486
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Let's just say cum again.

487
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Bugsy, that's a nefarious figure.

488
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This episode is already funny because we're all just so relieved to just take a few minutes to talk about theme parks.

489
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Anything else!

490
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah, because the sector keeper is not here.

491
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I've been saying over the weekend, friends of mine have been saying, I'm dying to talk about anything but Downtown Disney.

492
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I can't wait.

493
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Whatever the next... I don't care what it is.

494
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Any stupid, the dumbest, slow...

495
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Give me... What's a bad ride?

496
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Any of that shit in Dinoland USA?

497
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'll talk about those for two and a half hours.

498
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm going to Disney World.

499
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I mean, it would be helpful to me.

500
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm going to Disney World next week.

501
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Oh, no kidding.

502
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And I haven't been in like 20 years, basically.

503
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
2005 was the last time I went.

504
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So 14 years.

505
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
We can give you some tips.

506
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Chicken guy.

507
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I told Mitch about chicken guy.

508
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Okay, okay.

509
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, the sauce squad.

510
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You have to sign up.

511
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I don't want to be two words like this.

512
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Is it a two word?

513
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Well, our brains have melted so much.

514
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Chicken guy.

515
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
High hopes, sauce squad.

516
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Well, it's probably time to start.

517
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Do we need to ask the sector keeper?

518
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
We know what we're doing.

519
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Fuck him.

520
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
He's going to be mad.

521
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That's right.

522
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
This is about the level keeper who we're trying to save.

523
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
By the way, he's a character we haven't met yet, but we're trying to free him.

524
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We have to do it by talking about everything.

525
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Oh, he or her.

526
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
He or she.

527
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And we're trying to free him by he or she by talking about all the very interesting 18 days worth of interesting stuff at Downtown Disney,

528
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
which is why today we're talking about Earl of Sandwich.

529
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I mean, I think we wanted to have you on as a professional sandwich eater.

530
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That's right.

531
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Big chain restaurant reviewer.

532
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But it's like this.

533
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I've said this before, but my dad was brought back to life.

534
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
He'd be like, what are you doing?

535
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'd be like, I like eat sandwiches and food for a living.

536
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'd say this to my dad.

537
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
He'd be like, oh, and then he'd disappear back to wherever the netherworld.

538
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
He could stay, but he chooses to leave.

539
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
He chooses to go away.

540
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
When I saw my kid and just ran out of stuff to talk about.

541
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It was nice.

542
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
He eats Subway now for a living.

543
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And how many episodes about all these?

544
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
How many Carl's Jr.?

545
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
No, really.

546
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Well, so this is a chain.

547
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You guys haven't hit Earl of Sandwich.

548
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We haven't hit Earl of Sandwich.

549
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
No, yeah.

550
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's out there.

551
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
There's like 30 of these things.

552
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Wow.

553
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And I find this to be like, well, let me just, I'll just say this.

554
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Disney announces a new hotel.

555
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
We've covered this with some of the Fallen Brothers that we talked about not long ago.

556
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Things that they shut down.

557
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
They shut down everything in this area of downtown Disney.

558
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Rainforest Cafe, ESPN Zone, AMC Theaters, these massive building.

559
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Gone. Everything's gone.

560
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
A Starbucks is kicked out and Earl of Sandwich is kicked out.

561
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
This is June 2018.

562
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Earl of Sandwich opened in November 2012.

563
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So it's been there for a while.

564
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Good little run.

565
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Popular.

566
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That's funny that it opened in 2012 because it feels like it's been there since like 1960.

567
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yeah, it's true.

568
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm like, this is it.

569
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You just got to forgive their out of date style.

570
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
No, no, no.

571
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Only since 2012.

572
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And in fact, even more recently than that, because these massive big box locations, once the hotel was canceled, they couldn't come back.

573
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
They couldn't figure out how to come back.

574
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The Rainforest Cafe is like, we'd love to come back.

575
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't know if we can.

576
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
We sold all the furniture.

577
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The animals have all been killed and shot.

578
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We can't wait for his cafe is no more.

579
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The only the Starbucks did too, but the only the survivor, the cockroach of this apocalypse, Earl of Sandwich came crawling back.

580
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And you know all this, Mitch, that I don't know if Mike filled you in that this place was shut down entirely.

581
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's possible you forgot some of this information, this interesting information that I was.

582
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
No, you know, I was.

583
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
October 2018, right?

584
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It reopened October 2018.

585
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
A few months later.

586
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Did it really?

587
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Oh, yeah, it was closed.

588
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It was closed down.

589
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh, I did not know this.

590
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Reopened October 2018.

591
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Everything removed, all the furniture, the sign.

592
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I told you the rainforest was gutted.

593
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It just wasn't gutted.

594
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So they just reopen it.

595
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Wow.

596
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
They just turned the toaster back on.

597
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Turn it back on.

598
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That's insane.

599
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Seemingly raised everything one dollar in price.

600
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I saw pictures for 2018 to 2019.

601
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I was like, oh, that's the only difference.

602
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Huh?

603
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's stuff.

604
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'll say this about Earl of Sandwich.

605
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Probably the most the cheapest thing in downtown Disney, like the most affordable, like quick lunch.

606
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But not but also not cheap by any like normal human standards.

607
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Human standards by theme park, resort district standards.

608
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It is very funny that like talking about Star Wars like that, this is like the outer the outer rim of downtown Disney is kind of like a jacku or something where it is.

609
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It is just like a junk planet where like a junked out AMC that's empty.

610
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's just like the shell of a rainforest cafe.

611
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You want to have the habit from a truck?

612
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The habit burger truck.

613
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Why don't working at the habit?

614
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
That's one quarter portion.

615
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's that's what this is.

616
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Earl of Sandwich is basically what's his name again?

617
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That shitty character, one quarter portion.

618
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yeah.

619
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Uncar plot.

620
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yes.

621
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Is that what you were saying?

622
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah.

623
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yes.

624
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Earl of Sandwich is in car blood.

625
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That's what it is.

626
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
There's nothing else open there.

627
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That's exactly right.

628
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah.

629
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You want to do if any business exchanges have to run through this creep.

630
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
That's insane.

631
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
One hot lead this sandwich.

632
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I it's a it's a survivor.

633
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It is everything else.

634
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Like these giant corporations could not bring their restaurants back and only Earl of Sandwich.

635
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And I just think it is it's why we there's only this one today.

636
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
There's there's so much to talk about.

637
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's so strange to me that I will I will go ahead and say just from photographs and from and from videos and stuff.

638
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The sandwiches to me look kind of gross.

639
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And I think it's weird that this gross looking sandwich place is the one hanger on.

640
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But I don't I could be wrong.

641
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You were the guys who went and visited.

642
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Well consumed.

643
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'll just also say right off the bat.

644
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
The thing that's perplexing about this place is that Carlson and I we got our sandwiches.

645
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
We went outside to sit down and there were no tables available.

646
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Every single table was taken.

647
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Now Earl of Sandwich.

648
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It was we had we had to sit inside.

649
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But it was like we weren't there on like a crazy day or anything like that.

650
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
No.

651
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And the park wasn't so crowded.

652
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I mean, I would think this is like one of the cheapest options.

653
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah.

654
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Cheapest best options in the whole resort.

655
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Best.

656
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Well, by comparison.

657
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Cheapest cheap.

658
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm tying cheap and best together.

659
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
That's the quality of best.

660
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah.

661
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You got to take it to the outdoor seating at the Disneyland Hotel, which is what I did the day we opening day of Galaxy's Edge.

662
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
At some point, I was just so wiped out and needed to eat.

663
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I was like, I'll just get a sandwich at Earl of Sandwich.

664
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I was and I liked mine.

665
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I was surprised.

666
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
What do we what would we think?

667
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Well, we were mixed on it.

668
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
We got quite a we got three.

669
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
We got three sandwiches.

670
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We got a tuna.

671
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We got a melt tuna melt.

672
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah.

673
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And we got the holiday turkey sandwich.

674
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And I'm really one.

675
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
What was the last one we got?

676
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I have a picture of it.

677
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It was like the Earl's sandwich.

678
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It was the yeah.

679
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
The original 1762 original 1762.

680
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That one's pretty simple.

681
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Just roast beef, cheddar and horseradish.

682
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That's right. Yeah.

683
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
That one for that's all right.

684
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I've had the Chipotle chicken avocado.

685
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I like that one.

686
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I had to say, though, I I will say this is one of my quirks.

687
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I get really weird about hot sandwiches and lettuce.

688
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Like lettuce on a burger.

689
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm OK.

690
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Toasted sandwiches, even if they toast it first and then put the lettuce on,

691
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
it gives me the willies.

692
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Sure.

693
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I don't like yellow mustard on lettuce either.

694
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I think that also something about that makes you think if the bread specifically is hot.

695
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
If it is sold to me, if it's like a burger with all the fixings, I'm fine with it.

696
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
If it's sold as like a toasted hot sandwich and an ingredient is lettuce.

697
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I agree with that.

698
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't know.

699
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Onions work hot or cold.

700
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah.

701
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But lettuce, there's something weird about it.

702
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
No, it wilts. It's disgusting.

703
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And they put in a pretty giant healthy piece of lettuce.

704
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Sort of like, yeah, to cause that to shrivel and shrink.

705
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah.

706
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
They should put it on after.

707
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah.

708
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
They do, though, don't they?

709
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Don't they?

710
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I watched video of it being made.

711
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh, I thought it was before.

712
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah.

713
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Thankfully, you watched a video of it being made.

714
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Well, I did because I was researching the owner of this establishment.

715
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'll get to that later.

716
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Let's talk about the food.

717
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Okay.

718
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Only some of the sandwiches have the dreaded lettuce.

719
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Only a couple of them.

720
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I like the dreaded lettuce.

721
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The dreaded lettuce.

722
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I had a Wendy's spicy chicken sandwiches the other day, which I said that I gave up Wendy's

723
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
and I caved and I got a spicy chicken.

724
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
For the show, right?

725
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Well, yeah.

726
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, there you go.

727
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
For your podcast.

728
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
See?

729
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
But it was dreaded lettuce.

730
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
The lettuce had been...

731
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And it will always get a little bit warm in the sandwich.

732
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
The bun isn't supposed to be hot in the spicy chicken sandwich, but I got some of the dreaded lettuce that you're talking about.

733
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I think...

734
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It feels like hair.

735
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Oh.

736
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I think if you're that spicy chicken sandwich, if you're getting the lettuce and tomato, you got to eat it quickly.

737
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
If you're just getting a plain, you can wait a second.

738
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It feels like wet hair.

739
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Once it gets to that level, it gets sloppy and gooey.

740
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
This hair isn't really sloppy and gooey.

741
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Anyways, moving on.

742
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It sounds like that big egg that the...

743
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The jawas break into?

744
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah, that the jawas break into in Mandalorian.

745
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:36,000
That was very funny that they... the Mandalorian had vaporized some of their brothers or sisters, and then he brought them an egg, and then they were like, yay, and they just ate the egg.

746
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
All is forgiven.

747
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And I still liked it better than any other Star Wars thing I've seen for a long time.

748
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Of all these big complicated stories that you feel a little confused or just let down by, and then a man rescues...

749
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
The man gives some creatures an egg.

750
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yes, what a great tale.

751
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Truly, it was.

752
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Hooray.

753
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It's a lot simpler than this whole podcast event we've been doing.

754
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Extremely, yes.

755
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Guys, it's all that tidiness and storytelling, you know?

756
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Like the downtown Disney or...

757
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Narratively, my goodness.

758
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I... okay, but what's the overall feeling about the quality?

759
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So, what's the feeling of the sandwiches?

760
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So, the tuna melt, here was the issue with the tuna melt, is that it was too in between a tuna sandwich and a tuna melt.

761
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It wasn't bad, but it just was like...

762
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah.

763
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It felt like maybe like a heated up tuna sandwich in some ways more than it felt like an actual tuna melt.

764
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:32,000
They needed like... there's probably a setting they cook everything on or toast everything on, and they might need like an extra 30 seconds for that one.

765
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah, I agree with that.

766
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
That sandwich.

767
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And like the... yeah, because like the cheese was just kind of like falling out of it, remember?

768
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It was... it wasn't terrible.

769
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No.

770
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The original was good, it was heavy on the horseradish.

771
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Signature sandwich worthy? That's what I said, question mark.

772
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I don't know.

773
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Like you question that being the one that they push?

774
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah, I mean, like was... is that the one that kind of blows us all away? I don't know.

775
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah, because if they have the branding on it, that's sort of... yeah, like this is the thing you should get.

776
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah.

777
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yeah, that was probably my least favorite, I think, of the three.

778
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And I kind of pushed that one because it was the original.

779
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yeah, it made sense to get it.

780
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah. And then the Thanksgiving on a bun or whatever they call it, the gobbler, I'm with you, Jason, that it's called the gobbler.

781
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah.

782
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Get the hell out of here if you're saying something else. It should be...

783
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It's the gobbler. Holiday turkey sandwich isn't a better name to you.

784
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Gobbler's fun.

785
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Gobbler's fun, yeah.

786
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Gobbler's fun.

787
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's what we call the wah-wah outside of Philadelphia. They make gobblers.

788
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah, it's fun. Gobbler.

789
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Northeast, I know you guys call it gobblers.

790
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
We call it gobblers, baby.

791
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
This phrase isn't copyrighted. They could have used it and they didn't.

792
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It is fun. It's a thing a turkey actually says. He says gobble.

793
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
He does say gobble.

794
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
He does say gobble.

795
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
He called the gobbler.

796
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It doesn't save him from the killing, but he does say it.

797
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Only our president can do that.

798
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Only our president.

799
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
What if, man, this is a way to turn Trump into the biggest villain if...

800
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
He doesn't pardon the turkey?

801
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
No, he pardons every turkey.

802
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Oh, wow.

803
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Nobody gets turkey in the city.

804
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So no one gets turkey when they just give it.

805
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You won't walk into your Thanksgiving. There's a big fast food buffet like when he entertains sports teams.

806
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Hell, and probably there's a fucking turkey walking around your house because there's so many.

807
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah.

808
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Oh, yeah.

809
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And they're all free and they're just in our backyards bothering our kids and pets.

810
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
My mom does get wild turkeys sometimes by our house and it does look like an alien is just walking around.

811
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
My mom too.

812
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah.

813
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And they're kind of scary.

814
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And they're a little mean.

815
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Yeah. They're very much like velociraptors. They talk about that in Jurassic Park.

816
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
At the end of Jurassic Park, if you remember, he looks out the helicopter window and he sees turkeys walking on the ground.

817
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And he says, like, that's what they evolved into.

818
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Do you remember this moment in the movie?

819
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
In the first Jurassic Park?

820
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
In the first Jurassic Park.

821
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The very last scene.

822
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
The very last scene. He looks out the window.

823
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's that scene.

824
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And there's a little crew of turkeys walking outside Jason's mom's house.

825
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That's right. It fades to black. Well, because most people shut it off.

826
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It says directed by Steven Spielberg.

827
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Then it comes back. So this can happen.

828
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
But don't turn the movie off.

829
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And Jason's mom is waving at the camera saying, hi, Jason.

830
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Which must have been a thrill for you in 1990.

831
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It was. The 90s, we were all freaking out.

832
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
But they're scary. I agree with you. They're a scary little animal.

833
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Yeah. Yeah. Well, Earl Sandwich is doing their part.

834
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
They kill them off. What do we think of the Gobbler?

835
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It was good.

836
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I like the Gobbler. Yeah. I think I like it. Even if a tuna melt's OK, I like a tuna melt maybe the best.

837
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
But I think the Gobbler was good. Everything tasted good.

838
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I mean, it tasted like a OK Thanksgiving. And I don't mean that in a bad way.

839
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Yeah. OK Thanksgiving. That sounds funny.

840
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Fine. Again, fine. As we began this podcast series with, we knew we were saying fine a lot.

841
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I will say like fine for what I when I say like La Brea Bakery is fine.

842
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I will say like Earl of Sandwich is fine plus.

843
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh, this bums me out because it makes me feel like there's been Thanksgivings.

844
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
We were like, that was a fine Thanksgiving. And it sounds like a bummer.

845
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It sounds like a bad Thanksgiving. I mean, look, you're not going to have home runs every Thanksgiving.

846
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
That's true. The whole endeavor is fine.

847
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm not. I never like Thanksgiving itself. What a fucking awesome Thanksgiving.

848
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I've never been that into Thanksgiving. I'll be honest.

849
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It was never one of my family's favorites. The food's not my favorite area of food.

850
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Oh, I like the food. I disagree on this. I like the food quite a bit.

851
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It's a bummer when you get a bad Thanksgiving. Sure.

852
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I mean, like, I guess Thanksgiving is like so family heavy.

853
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Like you have to go and see like family and stuff.

854
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It's probably just baked in as a child. Like as a child brain thing of like,

855
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
yeah, there's going to be a lot of like seeing everybody and feeling like pressure.

856
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And then like, I like food. OK, there's no presents, no presents.

857
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
No costumes. You know Christmas is coming and you can feel it.

858
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Yeah. So there's probably it's probably all that. Yeah.

859
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
That's my guess. Not as fun. Yeah. But I don't hate it.

860
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I think it's Christmas minus. Oh, that's good. I see.

861
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That's right. Fine plus. Fine plus. I like just as far as like holiday characters go.

862
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm going to be on my own here. But the Thanksgiving turkey comes in at number one.

863
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And Santa's number two, just in my mind. Whoa.

864
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That's the Thanksgiving turkey is one. Is he threatening you?

865
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
No. Is that turkey threatening you? Jason, no.

866
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I bet you're crying. It's fine. OK.

867
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
When I said that they come to my mom's house, they don't threaten my mom.

868
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
They don't. Everything's fine.

869
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But I think those gobbles meant tell your son on his podcast or any other podcast.

870
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
My mom FaceTimes me, has just turkey claw marks on her neck.

871
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,000
They all pilot a car for the. Mom, what are they doing to you?

872
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Are those turkeys hurting you, mom?

873
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
The turkey, the turkey wearing like a pilgrim hat and a scarf or something.

874
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Is that the Thanksgiving turkey officially? Remember, there actually used to be like

875
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
my mom would put up like in the way that like, do people still do this?

876
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
They still do this. Like at Halloween, that you would have this stuff that you put on.

877
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You just tape it to your windows that were like a cat coming out of a pumpkin.

878
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Just a like the classic decorations. Yeah.

879
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Thanksgiving, we did have like a turkey one where you just put it on the window where I feel like people.

880
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I think that's like a thing of the 80s and 90s that no one no one's given decorations as much anymore.

881
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Right. Probably not, because we'd have pilgrims and Native Americans.

882
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yes. That would be like a little. Yeah.

883
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
The cartoon with like the brads that would make their arms move. Yes.

884
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That's what you're talking about. Yes. We had those.

885
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Very Brad heavy holiday. Well, the 80s were also brads.

886
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Brad fever was sweeping the nation.

887
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So flexible. Yeah. Yeah.

888
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I think that that there's not as many holiday like Thanksgiving decorations,

889
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
but I don't know. Maybe if we went back to the Midwest, they're still there.

890
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
They could be. That's a good point. Yeah. Or yeah, who knows?

891
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's still the 80s in the old Midwest.

892
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Still Brad fever out there. It's always the 80s.

893
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
We were talking about this as we were leaving the real test, I think, because toasting makes things better.

894
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It just does. It covers up imperfections.

895
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It covers up maybe cheaper ingredients.

896
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:10,000
We were saying that that once once Subway started toasting, I was like, I guess Subway is like not that bad just because they they toasted all this.

897
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Like the shitty taste was slightly toasted out of it. Sure. Sure. Yes. Yeah.

898
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah. Do we talk Jersey Mike's because they don't toast.

899
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Well, I think the quality is already there. So you don't need to toast.

900
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And Mike's way is their version of toasting. Sure.

901
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
That's Mike's. Yeah. If there's any like blandness to what's inherently there, Mike's way covers it up.

902
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah. So we realized after we were leaving, what we should have done is asked if we could get one sandwich untoasted to really say.

903
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I mean, they do have wraps and salads. You can write something called the true test.

904
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah. The true test of like the ingredients is the untoasted sandwich.

905
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Here's what I realized. I didn't know this until I was reading online. They do French bread pizza.

906
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Oh, curious about that. I'm sure it's fine.

907
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I'm sure it's fine. Did you have brownies or cookies?

908
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Like they're one of the places that have them like stacked up at the register.

909
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I've had brownies. Yeah, I've had brownies.

910
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I was like, I want to get ahead of it before there was a rumor started.

911
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Store bought, cafe bought or restaurant bought brownies.

912
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I find very dicey proposition. I find stale very quickly.

913
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Sure. Okay. If you're going to dump a bunch of ice cream on top of it and then it gets moist because it soaks up the ice cream.

914
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
But if you're just eating that alone, it could be a bummer.

915
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Yeah, I agree with that. Are these sandwiches too, they're so bready.

916
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Like you look very thick. A lot of bread and it's not like extra special bread.

917
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I was just on the way out that I said, I said, I don't want to ruin this and tell you before we do the podcast, Mike.

918
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
But I said, we got to talk about that bread. What's the deal with the, is the bread that good?

919
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I don't know if the bread is that good. Yeah.

920
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I feel like it's a place that's like anybody thinks it is. Yeah.

921
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And the bread is just kind of like, it's just okay. It's not.

922
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That's a lot of it to be the main feature. It's not a.

923
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Take up so much height. Yes.

924
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It's not a, you can't sit anywhere here on a random day in downtown Disney.

925
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yeah. Yeah. That may just be, it may be the price point and it may be just like lack of quick options in general.

926
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I encountered the same. They have this in Disneyland Paris in the horrible mall outside Disneyland Paris.

927
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And I went in there just to get a banana because it was the only like piece of like fresh food anywhere on that property.

928
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But it like smelled bad in there and the same thing, like just like, yeah, like line out the door, jam, but every table, every restaurant at this Paris mall was like that.

929
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Just to some, just a McDonald's. I mean, I hated that place so much. But the, but yeah, why?

930
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Disneyland Paris itself? I mean, I don't have the best things to say about Disneyland Paris in general.

931
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
But the, the, this shopping center outside is just the most nightmare.

932
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I think it's one of the things that got me thinking about Earl of Sandwich. Like it's here too. You're fucking kidding me.

933
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,000
This thing, this virus is spread. This, what you guys are seem to be saying is like fine, fine plus.

934
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah, fine plus. And in the context of Disney, it's like, if you can make it over there, it's a good option.

935
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
What? Cause it's like, you'd rather have that than maybe like the food at the Tomorrowland Terrace.

936
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah. I don't know. You don't think so. But Tangerowat Terrace at Disneyland Hotel, miles better.

937
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Yeah, sure. But I think maybe you call that something different because it would even use, you just kind of sit down for that.

938
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Like quick service. Oh, you think quick service, are you calling quick service different than this?

939
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I think quick service is different than Tangerowat Terrace. Certainly better. Oh, well, it's all kind of mushed together,

940
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,000
but I'm including the quick service at Tangerowat Terrace. That was quick. I don't know what they call it.

941
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah, but no question better. A little more, but in this case a better step up.

942
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
But Earl of Sandwich that said does is better than Tomorrowland Terrace.

943
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Yes. Mike's not sure. I'm not sure. I think I would just rather eat any old shit in the park than I would.

944
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Really? Huh. Yeah. Cause you're there already. You're there. I don't know. You're there, you're happy.

945
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You're having like fun snacks, you're happy. Yeah, I wouldn't. You know that I like pizza port. Yeah, that's true.

946
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
That's true. Yeah, we've been wanting to talk to you about pizza port. That's another episode though.

947
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yeah, I know. After I try to get a pizza port put on my body so they could just feed pizza right through a port.

948
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Just beam it in. Dear God, what a hacky loser I am. I liked it. I like it too.

949
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I find that inexplicable. We've talked about this. I think pizza port is wretched. I like pizza port quite a bit.

950
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's just like such a theme parky, big slice of cheese pizza. I don't know, I'm having fun.

951
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I like the idea of that, but that price is notched up and up and up and the quality is going down.

952
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,000
See, but I just think of theme park. I mean like those sandwiches were not cheap. They were like what? $14 or something?

953
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Not each. No, no. Are they $8? $8.99. $8.99. $9? Okay, that's not. I rounded that to $9. Call me crazy.

954
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:10,000
It was $9 each? No, actually that's not a bad deal. Yeah. I mean it's a lot. For a theme park, yeah, again, with a discount, we also have a name, pass order discount.

955
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So then you do get a 40 cents off. And you get validated. Sounds like you bought $20 worth of food.

956
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Yeah, we would have if we had been parked in Pixar Pals. Yeah.

957
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
That is funny that like the most people who go through downtown Disney are parking in the theme park parking.

958
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:39,000
They're not parking in downtown Disney at all. They were parking in the theme park parking as opposed to like City Walk where it's all just one parking mass.

959
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Oh, I see what you're saying. But there's are there any. I couldn't even imagine that going to like the movie, like going to the AMC theater just because like you lived in Anaheim or something.

960
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'd go anywhere else. It's such a pain to get in and out of there. Yeah. Yeah. I imagine using that as your base theater. Yeah.

961
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I am having I had a very specific memory when I started researching this of right after Earl of Sandwich opens. Mike, you picked me up at the airport and you plugged your phone into your car speaker or whatever.

962
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And you're like, listen to this. You got to hear this. Like it's like a new single came out. It was just some theme park podcast.

963
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And it was a guy just really worried about like, I don't know about these picnic tables that are all of sandwiches.

964
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I think specifically. Yes, specifically the benches. But like you picked me up and it was it was like the vibe of the back to the future.

965
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Like, you know, that sound you've been looking for. You got to hear. And when he's playing, it's just someone going like these benches are going to get very hot in the summer.

966
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It doesn't seem like there's enough of them. And I, of course, I like the show two years before. And I'm like nodding along like, yeah, you're right. Good call.

967
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Mike is the king of the point and the smirk like, huh? Yeah, that's not being satisfying in the league.

968
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah, that's true. The underwhelming point in style. That's what the point in smile is.

969
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Well, I think that's why you're smiling. You're like, I know it's going to be sort of a nothing. Yes. Yeah, I just I just told you about Joe Pesci's new single with Adam Levine.

970
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That's a point in smile. Oh, yeah. You really built up. And you wait till you hear who the duet is. Wait till you hear Joe Pesci's duetting with.

971
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:21,000
We had a great time pumping that on the five, you know. Joe Pesci has a new album coming out, but he sings two songs with Adam Levine.

972
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
What in the world? Don't you think that's weird? That's weird. Yeah, that's a novel. That's not the theme park podcast.

973
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
But it's a weird pairing. But Adam Levine is like everywhere, always all the time.

974
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
But Joe Pesci, it would make more sense that he was like singing with Joe Pesci or something.

975
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah, certainly. Like that was me. Have you seen the Irishman? Not yet. I saw it. The reveal of the Irishman is that the Irishman is Adam Levine.

976
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Oh, it makes a lot of sense now. It's not as funny, honestly, knowing that. But he's fucking ripped, dude. Yeah. So jacked.

977
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Well, OK, if we're wondering why this place persists and why it does not go away and why it came back from the dead entirely,

978
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I think you have to credit a guy who I would call the comeback kid. He's got so much fighting spirit.

979
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
He's a guy who who brought Planet Hollywood back from bankruptcy twice.

980
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,000
That is a brand that like wanted to die, was on its way to death. And he kept fighting and he hung in there.

981
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And he is one of the people who Earl of Sandwich is named after. And that is the owner Robert Earl.

982
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Robert Earl is the owner of Planet Hollywood, Bucatabeppo and Chicken Guy, which we have discussed.

983
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Yes, we are discussed very much in the woof in the life of a single woof.

984
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Chicken Guy, a recent new restaurant endeavor with Guy Fieri and good things.

985
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Shockingly affordable, cheaper, better than Earl of Sandwich. Wow. Cheaper than Earl of Sandwich. Wow. Yeah.

986
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And this man now, Robert Earl has finally met his flashy shirt match. What with Guy Fieri? Yes, that's true.

987
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I feel like it's a match made in heaven. He's in restaurants aren't his only endeavors.

988
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:19,000
He, of course, a producer on a film we all know and love, 2015's Wild Card starring Jason Statham.

989
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Of course. Yes. So he fronts the money for some quality Hollywood entertainment. Also the Expendables.

990
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And yeah, he's the producer of all the Expendables movies. Oh, his boy, his boys in it.

991
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Arnold's because he goes back or Arnold and Stallone. Yeah. Yeah. Uh huh. Uh huh. He goes back.

992
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Now, he's not the only owner of Earl of Sandwich because Earl of Sandwich is also invested in by a literal Earl of Sandwich.

993
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:55,000
The man's name is John Montague and he is related to the original Earl of Sandwich, who's credited with inventing the sandwich entirely.

994
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Yes. Do you have the stats on that? No, I have it from the Morning Joe interview with him and Robert Earl.

995
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:08,000
1976 is the first sandwich recorded as being eaten in London. No, 1976.

996
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Oh, what? 1762. Sorry, sorry. Whoa. I said the wrong thing.

997
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,000
1976, damn. 1762. Sorry. Yeah. That's, I was going to say there were no sandwiches. It says it right here.

998
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's on 1976. I literally, my eyes are failing me. I have to say that is some very good like British Empire like storytelling and stuff.

999
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Because Yesterland pointed out and other people have pointed out, people have been sticking meat in bread the world over for centuries, if not millennia.

1000
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Yeah. Yeah. And they tried to claim it, right? Do you, let me ask you this, Jason, would you celebrate that date or year now that you know it?

1001
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Now that I know like it's a. Like that, you know, which day were you celebrating the sandwich's invention in general?

1002
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Every day. Okay. I love a sandwich. I love a sandwich too. Yes, certainly.

1003
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And this guy, one of the co-owners of this is like, it's my family. We did. The Earl of Sandwich is a guy who, what said like, I'm too busy or I, or there's several stories.

1004
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Either he's busy with paperwork and government or he's like, he's playing a card game and just put meat between bread and bring it to me.

1005
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Right. And that and then the other people gambling or doing business with him are like, oh, very good. I'll have the same as sandwich here.

1006
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And then a sandwich show. And so it got deemed or they coined that phrase after his jurisdiction.

1007
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And that's the tale. And trickled down to the Hoi Ploy. Trickled down from the upper crust to the lower crust.

1008
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, they passed it on to us very kindly.

1009
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:54,000
The Earl of Sandwich is an odd fellow. He's up on your screen right now. Yes, he looks great.

1010
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It looks like he doesn't at all look like the painting that ages in an addict while someone else stays.

1011
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Like a strange Johnny Depp prosthetics character. I have good news though.

1012
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:16,000
In this series, I Googled John Montague plus Jeffrey Epstein and got no results.

1013
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:25,000
With any royal days, but is a British British title Landy's in the House of Lords.

1014
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
You know, there's got to be some he's got to be some sex plane involved. It's just not Jeffrey Epstein.

1015
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I'd say we need to put the British royalty all on an island somewhere surrounded by water, separated from everyone else.

1016
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
But they are already that you're recommending. There's just a lot of bystanders.

1017
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:52,000
There's a lot of working bystanders. But the real driving force behind this is a Brit I'm very fond of.

1018
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Robert Earl. And please feel free to interrupt and interject. So I don't make this just a history lesson.

1019
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
But OK, I've been building up to this for a while. I know. OK, OK. Deep breath.

1020
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm just I'm so excited about Robert Earl. And I he really got on my radar because I was thinking about I was thinking about Planet Hollywood.

1021
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I think having come from the planet Hollywood in Paris and just going like what is up with like why aren't why why are there still Planet Hollywood's around?

1022
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:25,000
What's the deal with this place? And I started Googling him and I found a YouTube series and the series is called Robert Earl's Be My Guest.

1023
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And in this you get us you meet this man, you get a sense of him. He basically he sounds a lot like Robin Leach.

1024
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:42,000
He's a very just like, you know, like a very far be waving his arms around excitable British man.

1025
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
If there's other people in the frame, he is the one talking guarantee.

1026
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
He wears really loud silk shirts. It's all very Mike Love S.

1027
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And he flaps his arms a lot. And he hosts a show that seems to have aired on some like the cooking channel or somewhere.

1028
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But now it's on a YouTube channel, videos that have like 300 views and I am the three hundred and first.

1029
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And here's the premise of Be My Guest. Robert Earl takes you to restaurants that he usually happens to be the owner of.

1030
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
He gathers up a bunch of guests to join him. Come be my guest. He orders food for them.

1031
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,000
He just points and says, you'll have a pizza and then leaves, goes back to the kitchen where he makes the food.

1032
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:33,000
He's like helping do it and putting his finger in the food and licking his like until tell the cook, look over there.

1033
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And then like sneak a little like hit of ricotta.

1034
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And then like and then he makes the cook say like, I did it better than you didn't die.

1035
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Yes, of course, Mr. Ely is. Yeah, I knew it.

1036
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And then he comes out, delivers the food proudly says, and I made it.

1037
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Chef Robert made the food and then he gives the food to his guests and then just starts eating it himself as well.

1038
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
He just starts grabbing like he'll just put like put his hands in the pasta.

1039
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,000
He'll just grab a meatball. He'll like there was there's one I watched about the Earl of Sandwich.

1040
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And there's a he makes food for construction workers for a group of construction workers.

1041
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And then he just has a sandwich and he just grabs it and just starts eating it.

1042
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And even he even will say like, let's share this and then grabs it, which sharing, I feel like is the person with the food is supposed to make the traditionally.

1043
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Yeah, they bring up the sharing process.

1044
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
But so he's respected by blue collar guys. I like them now.

1045
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Well, let me are we sure of that?

1046
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Well, they're sandwiches. It sounds like it's fine.

1047
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Just watch this. I've made you throw this on a TV before.

1048
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Yeah. Well, so let's let's find out.

1049
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Let's we can all you can judge with me. Do the blue collar people like him or not?

1050
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Here is a scene from Robert Earls. Be my guest.

1051
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Going off into Orlando to find some construction workers and I'm going to grab them and bring them in to have some.

1052
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I'm going to grab them. Good afternoon, guys. Good afternoon, construction workers.

1053
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
He did do that. Yes.

1054
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
How do you feel about coming over to the sandwich and having a great lunch with me?

1055
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Sucks. Oh, man. They don't like him at all.

1056
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
He said, like, how would you feel about having a wonderful sandwich with me?

1057
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
It sounds good. Be more enthusiastic.

1058
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:38,000
He's just like he bought you be louder. You laugh, you smile. Construction worker.

1059
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Put your hat on backwards. He truly never learned their names either.

1060
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
No construction construction workers. That's who you are from here on out.

1061
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You blue collars. You he he's much more.

1062
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So, you know, did that air somewhere? Do we know?

1063
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Or was that just like a pilot that they were throwing online?

1064
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Because all we've we've come across this before. All of these rich guys want to have their own show.

1065
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
They all want to be Mark Cuban or something.

1066
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
They all want to have some show where they do things.

1067
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And I think sometimes they just say, like, OK, get a crew there, make the show.

1068
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
They'll never know. They'll never check. Right. As far as he knows, he has a show.

1069
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Right. He may not have checked, but like they were like, you know, the ratings just came in and they're great.

1070
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Oh, wonderful. Better than they're better than Saturday Night Live and Peaks are do she?

1071
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I mean, he had this show on the cooking channel, which is a very odd endeavor to begin with, because it's not the Food Network, but it's owned by the Food Network.

1072
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
That was on Cooking Channel. Or it's related.

1073
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Wait, yes. The cooking. So the cooking channel is a thing that it's a digital channel and it is owned by the Food Network.

1074
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And it is a thing that you when you are in a hotel or you get digital cable and you're like, oh, what are these extra channel?

1075
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You're like, what the fuck is the cooking channel? Oh, yeah.

1076
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And like that's with some very there's some very odd stuff on there.

1077
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
This man pointed at construction workers.

1078
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:13,000
You're my friends now. He's left a beam for me that I'm interested in that show because he does seem more energetic than he does on all the interviews I watched.

1079
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
He's like kind of sedated on the interview, like Mourning Joe.

1080
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And there's one on KTLA when he's making this poor woman worker. You watch that too. Yes.

1081
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
They're always like, and she does all the work.

1082
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And he points to the like this poor employee that's going to have to make a sandwich live on KTLA.

1083
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And he's got his arm around her too much. This is another point. Yes.

1084
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
OK. In every bit of food.

1085
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And I've watched several at least clips, many episodes of Robert Arrows Be Our Guest.

1086
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
He always has his arm around everyone. He's always just grabbing for the food.

1087
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And he just has his arm around everyone he's ever talking to.

1088
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And that includes the men, I will say, out of fairness, but it also certainly includes the women.

1089
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Let me just like you're right on the news. That's the deal.

1090
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And then here's another clip I took here. Just watch this interaction.

1091
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Hang on. Dear God. These construction workers.

1092
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
They want me to put my hand on the small of your back and leave it there.

1093
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
They don't trust you to make it. I have to watch you and keep you in arms.

1094
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And that segment is a minute and a half long. And his arm is around her the entire time.

1095
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
She goes all the way down the sandwich line and it never moves.

1096
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
But it's also true when he's in the book, a De Beppo kitchen in a different.

1097
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
He owns a book, a De Beppo, a book, a De Beppo.

1098
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
He's in the book, a De Beppo kitchen with a guy who's been his chef for a long time, sort of a portly fella.

1099
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And he he roasts this man a little bit. And so, you know, things happen with the guys, too. Here we go.

1100
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:59,000
You're so autistic, Dave. I think that's why you hired me 26 years ago. You're a hundred pound lifesaver. That's why all my profit is gone.

1101
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:07,000
That's not fun. No. And then he like taps his tummy. That's why all my profit has gone to your belly.

1102
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Oh, my God. To your Lord. This guy's awful. He's OK.

1103
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Well, I was thinking that we might need to throw this might not get me out of what you just said.

1104
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I've been thinking we need to use the word allegedly, but maybe I'll throw that in. He's awful. Allegedly.

1105
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
He clears this legally. That's the magic word.

1106
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Looks like the older version of do you guys know Wyatt Coke? He's the son of one of the Coke brothers.

1107
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Oh, man. Designed very expensive, very garish shirts for rich people.

1108
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I do know him. Yes, I know him.

1109
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
This video is going around a while back with him like talking about this.

1110
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,000
He's the Coke member or the member of the Coke family who does the least bit of ill in the world.

1111
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So it's like he's just a rich, fail son who just designs expensive shirts.

1112
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
He just does aesthetic ills. Yes, he does aesthetic ills.

1113
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:00,000
But he got Robert in the video, Robert Earl like and there feels like there's a straight line.

1114
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I wonder Robert might buy some of those shirts. Robert has probably bought them.

1115
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
My good friend, Mr. Coke. Another great shirt.

1116
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Can you be a fail son? My question is, can I be am I a fail son?

1117
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
No, you are doing well.

1118
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Can you be a fail son without being like a millionaire?

1119
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Can you be a fail son without being a millionaire?

1120
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I think you can, but I think especially the the idol children of the rich who have like businesses that like I don't know that that shirt company makes a profit.

1121
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Just a madman and then like, yes, this pattern.

1122
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And it's like, well, the shirt body will be parrots, but then the cuffs will be little umbrellas.

1123
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
And it's just like, this is what that doesn't go together.

1124
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And you know, he leaves the factory and like, OK, make it happen.

1125
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Now off to play off to South Beach.

1126
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
People have to figure out like, OK, how many threads does he want?

1127
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I don't know. Just figure it just do. Yeah. Just give yourself a raise.

1128
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
He's not paying attention. He doesn't care.

1129
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
This company, we have a billion dollars.

1130
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
This company is supposed to make 500 shirts this year.

1131
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I have a million dollars to play with.

1132
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I'm going to say a little more to and again, don't let me just make this a dry history lesson.

1133
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:20,000
But as we say, fail sons, there's a lot of fail sons involved in the back story of Robert.

1134
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
He himself, I don't I mean, he's not a fail anyway. No, extremely successful man.

1135
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
But there's a lot of great sons involved.

1136
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
We have to go back to the story of Hard Rock Cafe.

1137
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And it's always, always great to do so.

1138
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:42,000
OK, Hard Rock Cafe was started by Peter Morton and Peter Morton's dad founded Morton Steakhouse.

1139
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:52,000
And his son is the founder of Pink Taco, one of the most hellishly named things ever in the world.

1140
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I think a horrible thing. I figured I found it closed in Century City.

1141
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So yeah, the Sunset Boulevard one is closed or still open. Is it too?

1142
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I don't know. I don't know. God, I hope it's closed. Fingers crossed.

1143
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
What a horrible name. Oh, and wait, I should also say with Morton Steakhouse.

1144
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So yeah, the the the founder of Hard Rock Cafe's dad founded Morton Steakhouse,

1145
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
but now it is owned by Tillman Fertitta. Mr. Shut up and listen himself.

1146
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Yes, because it's in the Landry restaurant group.

1147
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
And it is like good. It is like a nice place with good service.

1148
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Oh, yeah. But that's his dad. That's not him.

1149
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Peter Morton is Hard Rock Cafe, which we've all done to mixed results.

1150
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
All right. Hard Rock Cafe City Walk City Walk. It's leaving us. Oh, no.

1151
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Confirmed. Confirmed. It's pretty. Confirmed. What's taking over the Toothsome Chocolate Factory

1152
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
that's in Orlando, the Willy Wonka Rippoff. I don't know if it's fully confirmed,

1153
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
but I have seen it in enough sources where I generally would believe it.

1154
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
But I guess where the people murmur about the tables outside of. No, no, they I would never.

1155
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I need at least work up there. I mean, like Margaritaville just opened and that feels like it's.

1156
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Yeah, people have said that's not doing well. The movie theater does well.

1157
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And all those nightclubs closing. And since we did our series, the City Walk Saga last year, like nine things.

1158
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It's a reckoning. Wow.

1159
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
People are saying, though, that it actually might not be as much about stuff not doing well

1160
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
and more about Universal wants to own everything up there.

1161
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Universal owns Toothsome. They own Anahito's, they own Ilvino.

1162
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Yeah, so they're replacing everything with stuff that Universal or Comcast owns. OK.

1163
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
So that might be more about it, because I think Hard Rock is usually still busy.

1164
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Yeah, Hard Rock is one of the good spots to grab a drink or something before you go see a movie or something.

1165
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Yeah. Yeah, it's huge. It's weird that it's closing. It is weird.

1166
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Maybe that is. Maybe they are chasing them out of town.

1167
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Well, but there's one on Hollywood Boulevard, so they at least have something in the area.

1168
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Oh, I know. That was our Doughboys. That was an awful. That certainly was.

1169
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Oh, man. I mean, any time you're going to Hollywood Boulevard, it's never you never want to go there.

1170
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Yeah. No, for any. Yeah. Yeah.

1171
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:07,000
But I mean, a worldwide franchise, I mean, it is I think we can't say Hard Rock is successful.

1172
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Oh, yeah, certainly. Yeah. Yeah.

1173
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I would say that if downtown Disney, like we were on the outer edges, if you kept extending downtown Disney,

1174
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
it would turn into Hollywood Boulevard.

1175
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It's basically that's like it's starting to get like where we are like Earl of Sandwich area.

1176
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
If you like kept going further, it would turn into Hollywood Boulevard based on shittiness.

1177
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
And now there's and there's like weird grifters and dirty.

1178
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
There's weird grifters. Yes. Yes.

1179
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
John Travolta is the fanatic.

1180
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
There's bad. Bothering people.

1181
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
There's bad Mickey Mouse costume people walking around.

1182
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
How did this happen?

1183
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,000
OK, so but yeah, Hard Rock Cafe is successful, but not very good.

1184
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It was started by, OK, this guy, Peter Morton and Isaac Tigrit.

1185
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I was talking about him the other day.

1186
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
He's the guy who's like the blue, the blues.

1187
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
He started out as a blues and like the blues are, you know, really the hub of the blues is Harvard.

1188
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It's got to be Harvard and Danny Aykroyd.

1189
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,000
So these are the two guys who found this, the both like old money people.

1190
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
They hate each other.

1191
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It's a bitter divorce that goes on for six years or so.

1192
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Tiger like we got to get Tigard out of here.

1193
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,000
He sells his shares, his side of Hard Rock Cafe to Robert Earl.

1194
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Robert Earl has been a sort of successful restaurateur.

1195
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Mike, I feel like you might be aware of his British food, his British chain restaurants.

1196
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Did I see that on your computer?

1197
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Well, there's a lot of them.

1198
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Tell me the one year because I have so much text on here.

1199
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I was thinking about Shakespeare Tavern.

1200
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Well, yeah, but that's the one that turned into a different one.

1201
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
No, I don't know. What do you have?

1202
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
OK, because there's so many here.

1203
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Hagen Whistle, Lord and Ladies, the Crumpets Muffin.

1204
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
OK, so he is first.

1205
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Yeah, in April of 83, the Tootly Doo.

1206
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
His first one was on Church Street.

1207
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Oh, OK, Church Street.

1208
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
And it was Shakespeare's, it was just called Shakespeare's.

1209
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And then that was eventually changed into King Henry's Feast, which was a Medieval Times style restaurant, which is this picture here.

1210
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You can see it.

1211
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
OK, but it was a Medieval Times like dinner and a show.

1212
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
So he had a whole like he he was doing a lot. He was experimenting is what I'm trying to say.

1213
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Yeah. Imagine not.

1214
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I'm not just going to start one British chain restaurant.

1215
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I'm going to start like five.

1216
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Yes. The walk around characters just talking about their gout.

1217
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Oh, my feet.

1218
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
The favorites.

1219
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I changed my dressing.

1220
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I don't relate to that too much.

1221
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
He's talked about how he was building an empire in Orlando.

1222
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
He had Wild Bill's Wild West show and Mardi Gras, Royal Orleans.

1223
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Oh, my God.

1224
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:53,000
So it was an international drive and Baby Nova, which was next to the Villa Nova.

1225
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And eventually all these places closed except for Park Plaza Gardens, which is one I didn't even mention.

1226
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
So he was building all these separate restaurants at the time.

1227
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Right. Right.

1228
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:11,000
To try to take a hold of Orlando, which he saw as it was about to explode because of Disney World and sure enough.

1229
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And he was very, very smart about it.

1230
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:23,000
It's the next big there's going to be so many construction workers, new restaurants everywhere.

1231
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
So so he's trying to become a theme restaurant titan.

1232
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Right. So he buys shares of the best so that he can launch his biggest attack.

1233
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Because I think he's already got the kernel of like I need to do the biggest and the best.

1234
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I need to learn from the biggest. Yeah.

1235
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I have a quote from him in 1988.

1236
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
He set his sights on a small music theme chain of restaurants that was based in London at seven locations.

1237
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
It was called Hard Rock Cafe.

1238
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I fell in love with it, says Earl and thought I could grow it both in profitability and size and managed to do that.

1239
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Well, so he did. He doubled it.

1240
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Yeah, he loved it.

1241
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I fell in love. Eric Clapton's guitar.

1242
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
You know, it's crazy that I went to London when I was in second grade or when I was like eight years old.

1243
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:13,000
And I think we did go like Hard Rock Cafe was viewed differently at one point where it wasn't like it was like, oh, a cool place to go.

1244
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Yeah. Like a complete trash dump.

1245
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Yeah. In London. Yeah, it was cool when it opened.

1246
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Yeah, it actually had a cool air.

1247
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Because there was nowhere to get a real American burger or real American barbecue.

1248
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Yeah, what was the corporate history like your bank where banker and bread maker can break bread together.

1249
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Awful. These people are all horrible.

1250
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:42,000
So anyway, so Robert Earl and I'll say this again, allegedly from a lawsuit that happened.

1251
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Yes.

1252
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
He is like, I'm going to. All right.

1253
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I will grow Hard Rock Cafe and then I will take everything that I learned and I will bring it to my own restaurant, which he did eventually.

1254
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Planet Hollywood with a guy, Keith Barish, whose son later started Black Tap Burgers and said this is where all of the restaurants we've been talking about all tie together.

1255
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:10,000
So he's like a weird little like agent within Hard Rock Cafe, learning everything he can and even dissuading them from doing things they want to do.

1256
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
They really want to expand in Las Vegas.

1257
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And he's like, Vegas is trashy. It's a bunch of it's commercial crap that don't go to Vegas.

1258
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I don't approve. And then, of course, Planet Hollywood is all over Vegas.

1259
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
He was like trying to chase him out of town, essentially, like planting the seeds.

1260
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Wasn't there a casino? Was there a plant?

1261
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Still is. Oh, there's still a hotel.

1262
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Well, there's a hotel. But he was the owner of that story is tragic because it was the Aladdin.

1263
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Right. And America just said we got to get racist like after 9 11 that the Aladdin, even though like people's perception was like, well, we don't want to go there.

1264
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Really? That's why they had their. Yes. That is why.

1265
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
But Aladdin is a beloved cartoon.

1266
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

1267
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Wow.

1268
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
People were so so many people were so freaked out after 9 11.

1269
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
They're like, well, we can't go to the Middle Eastern because so they rebranded it.

1270
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
They were losing a lot of money.

1271
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:11,000
That's then they rebranded it to the Planet Hollywood Casino, which is funny because the Planet Hollywood restaurant is across the street at Caesars.

1272
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Or one place.

1273
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Yeah.

1274
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
It's in another place.

1275
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
That's insane. A magic carpet didn't fly into the towers.

1276
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Yeah.

1277
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'm not proud of this, but on September 12th, I was in Disney and Aladdin came out and I was like, get him out of here.

1278
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I chased him off. I feel really bad about it now.

1279
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Yeah.

1280
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
You chased him out.

1281
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
He's laid a charge of other racist children.

1282
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Racist children.

1283
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:47,000
But that's why there's still the buffet there is still called like the the spice road or something.

1284
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
It still has a lingering name from the end of course.

1285
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
You know, you can find in the Planet Hollywood Casino an Earl of Sandwich.

1286
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Of course.

1287
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Yep. Of course. Why would you not?

1288
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
He is so he was getting gambling.

1289
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Bring me something.

1290
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
But I can keep playing Keno.

1291
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
The origins.

1292
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
He bought it.

1293
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
He bought the casino, but then he has sold the casino since.

1294
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
OK, I believe so.

1295
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:16,000
It's to Harris because there's only a couple different MGM Harris and then like Steve Wynn.

1296
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
So like about I think it was already like in 2010 he sold he still gets like a licensing right for the name.

1297
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Oh, but he does money from it.

1298
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Yeah.

1299
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
But now he does watch casino yesterday.

1300
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I can't do it.

1301
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Yeah.

1302
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Irishmen.

1303
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Oh, yeah. I've never actually finished them.

1304
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I could have watched.

1305
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
You never seen Casino.

1306
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Yeah, I haven't finished.

1307
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Wow. That's stupid.

1308
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I need to. It's really good.

1309
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
You got to. You saw the Irishmen or no?

1310
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Yeah.

1311
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I love it.

1312
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I saw. Yeah, it's great.

1313
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
That's great.

1314
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I love Pesci.

1315
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Hasn't missed a beat.

1316
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Oh, he's so good.

1317
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I thought he was so good at that.

1318
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
He's so good.

1319
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Yeah.

1320
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I also it's sad because I because there's aging technology.

1321
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
I don't know what how old Pesci looks like right now.

1322
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I'm not sure how old he looks.

1323
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Yeah.

1324
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Yeah.

1325
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
We're like the same thing with De Niro.

1326
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I'm like, is De Niro like as old as he is at the end of the movie now or is he like what level old is he?

1327
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I have no idea.

1328
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
They make him look pretty bad.

1329
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
They make him look pretty shitty.

1330
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I hope Pesci isn't what he is at the end.

1331
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yeah, I hope not.

1332
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Oh, God.

1333
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I hope he isn't for a long time.

1334
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Yeah.

1335
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
She's wonderful.

1336
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Pacino is so funny at that.

1337
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
He seems like he is having so much fun.

1338
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Oh, he's great.

1339
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
He's so good at it.

1340
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Pacino is yelling.

1341
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
You're happy.

1342
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Sure.

1343
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
You're having a blast.

1344
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
And Adam Levine is really good.

1345
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Adam Levine.

1346
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I'm sorry.

1347
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
He's really good.

1348
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Like, oh my God.

1349
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
The aging technology, he still looks really good.

1350
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
He looks better older even.

1351
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
He's still got those beautiful eyes.

1352
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And when he's like a little baby too, they go like they show them when they're like babies.

1353
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Baby Yoda.

1354
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
He's baby Yoda-esque.

1355
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Oh, that's right.

1356
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
The baby is him.

1357
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I didn't put that together.

1358
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

1359
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,000
When they find Baby Adam Levine made a play for control of the Teamsters.

1360
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,660
I've heard that the Mandalorian uses the Irishman technology.

1361
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,000
They actually have the Yoda puppet.

1362
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Oh, yeah.

1363
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
And they use that technology to make him look like baby Yoda.

1364
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
They scanned his face with the THD.

1365
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,280
Okay, so all this to say that I just find it funny that he's like he's like waiting

1366
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:11,240
and then he strikes and like I have my own restaurant idea and I'm going to use everything

1367
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,240
I learned.

1368
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:18,000
And then Morton, who hated him from day one, sues him for 1.5 billion dollars.

1369
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Wow.

1370
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,480
Stallone's part of the suit.

1371
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,200
Schwarzenegger's part of the suit.

1372
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,960
And they're bitterly exchanging words all over the trades.

1373
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,480
The stock price is plummeting.

1374
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,560
It's a big like they go to they do turf wars.

1375
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,760
Like they're moving to Toronto.

1376
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,520
We're going to Toronto to we're going to chase him out of town.

1377
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,760
Bitter rivalry between these two.

1378
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:40,040
And while Hard Rock Hard Rock probably won ultimately because there's so many more of

1379
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:45,520
those, Earl escaped, you know, Scott Free and the suit was dismissed.

1380
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,780
So he didn't Hard Rock didn't successfully sue.

1381
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:52,180
But there's one thing and here's what here's what I've been getting to.

1382
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:57,300
He also he was a thorn in the side of Morton, the owner, because he suggested a lot of ideas

1383
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,720
that they didn't want to do.

1384
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,720
They like just like you guys come to my restaurant.

1385
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,200
He's like tossing out ideas left and right.

1386
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:08,240
And one of his ideas and he's he was excited enough about this to talk to New York magazine

1387
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,660
about it.

1388
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:16,360
One an idea to keep the restaurant fresh is a cartoon called The Hard Rock Rascals.

1389
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,360
Oh, I did not see this.

1390
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:27,000
And the plot of Hard Rock Rascals would be Janis Joplin, Elvis Presley, John Lennon and

1391
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:33,800
Jimi Hendrix, or at least characters based on them, discover an old jukebox that transports

1392
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:38,640
them to Rockopolis and teaches them about the origins of music.

1393
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,640
Wow.

1394
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:42,640
How did we not get that?

1395
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,640
That is the 90s.

1396
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,940
The perfect 90s artifact that doesn't exist.

1397
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:51,360
Is this idea still up for grabs?

1398
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,000
Can we get if they didn't make it?

1399
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,520
I think cartoon like coming out, yes, coming.

1400
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,520
There's a Netflix cartoon.

1401
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:01,280
Yes, but that's not going to be this because that doesn't have a job.

1402
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,280
Why are they rascals?

1403
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,280
Why are they Hard Rock?

1404
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,480
Are they little kids?

1405
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,480
I think what this is.

1406
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,480
Yeah, I think it's like Little Rascals.

1407
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,000
I think what this is, this is Muppet Babies.

1408
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,600
It's a Muppet Babies of John Lennon.

1409
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,960
Yeah, they were all friends somehow in their own areas.

1410
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:21,440
They're all who learn about rock from a jukebox, even though they had to be born before rock

1411
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,560
and roll, a horny Elvis baby.

1412
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,560
That's wow.

1413
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,160
And he's like, you're very much.

1414
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:34,680
He dates like he dates like an angel that's not even born yet.

1415
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:40,400
A pre soul that hasn't made it into a body.

1416
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,400
She's negative three.

1417
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,400
Oh my God.

1418
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,400
World.

1419
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:49,840
Yeah, I feel about that.

1420
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:50,840
Rascal Elvis.

1421
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,760
This is a bit dicey.

1422
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,440
This is hacky of me, but I can't help but think about it.

1423
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,440
Yes, please.

1424
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,720
Of what it was like.

1425
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:03,320
It must've been terrifying to have Arnold Schwarzenegger and Stallone yelling at you,

1426
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,520
like to have both of those guys mad at you.

1427
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,520
Yeah.

1428
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,080
And being like, like just like screaming at you.

1429
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,080
I don't know what you want.

1430
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:16,440
Just like screaming at you about the restaurant must've been terrifying.

1431
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,440
The both strong guys.

1432
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,440
Yeah.

1433
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,080
And you're just like, no, I want to do it my way.

1434
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,280
Like he was just being like a little shit.

1435
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,280
Not to that.

1436
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,280
No, there is buddies.

1437
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,280
Oh, there's buddies.

1438
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,280
Okay.

1439
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,280
Still he's producing expendables for them.

1440
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:29,280
Oh, so they were.

1441
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,280
Yeah.

1442
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,280
We get along great.

1443
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,280
They're buff like construction workers.

1444
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,280
It's possible they've had beefs.

1445
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,080
But they were yelling at the Morton's.

1446
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,080
Who, who, who were they?

1447
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,080
Who, who, who was the last guy?

1448
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:42,880
This guy is an enemy of Morton who runs Hard Rock Cafe and suggests, which should be a cartoon

1449
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,880
is Hard Rock Rascals.

1450
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:44,880
He is.

1451
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:45,880
He was right.

1452
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:46,880
I think he was right.

1453
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,080
We're how, look how delighted we are all by this idea.

1454
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,360
We would have already done a couple episodes about this if it existed.

1455
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,360
So yeah.

1456
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,360
Yeah.

1457
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,760
I mean, that could be future podcasts is just doing radio plays of Hard Rock Rascals.

1458
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,760
Are there scripts?

1459
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,280
Like, you know, there's all those Star Wars scripts, George Lucas commission, but they

1460
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,600
never made for the TV show.

1461
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,960
Are there, is there a full season of Hard Rock Rascals?

1462
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:08,960
There will be.

1463
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,960
There can be.

1464
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:16,000
All you need is a little bit of imagination, a little bit of will and final draft.

1465
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
That's true, but a dream.

1466
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,440
I'd rather have the Earl, you know, written one little spot.

1467
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,760
He was writing them.

1468
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,560
Well, at least at least having them oversee, like, like George Lucas.

1469
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,560
I'm Jimi Hendrix.

1470
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,560
He's doing the voices.

1471
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,560
Yeah, I think he's.

1472
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,360
Oh, that's even better.

1473
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:37,280
I think Planet Hollywood really haze running through my bottle.

1474
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:45,200
Imagine all the people pooping in that diapers.

1475
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,200
We got to get him.

1476
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:50,280
Take a take another little poop from my diaper, baby.

1477
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:55,000
It's a British man voicing a baby Janis Joplin.

1478
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Yeah.

1479
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,360
Come to my birthday party.

1480
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:01,760
I'm having it at the kids zone called Ultimont.

1481
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:06,560
Some great security.

1482
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,560
My memory of childhood.

1483
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,760
Wait, no, no, you're about to do it.

1484
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,760
Yeah.

1485
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,760
Yeah.

1486
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,760
Me and Bubba McGee, the like Bob, Bob.

1487
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:22,480
My bottle is Bob on the game.

1488
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,480
What's this?

1489
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,800
An old jukebox.

1490
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,240
What's it say on it?

1491
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,240
Passport to Rockopolis.

1492
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,960
Should we touch it, baby Elvis?

1493
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,320
My friend wrote a few songs that are really bonkers.

1494
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:39,320
Little Charlie Manson.

1495
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,360
I like them being adults and then going to Rockopolis.

1496
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,840
Then they're the then they're the babies.

1497
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,920
I think that's even more fun.

1498
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,120
That's what it is that they go until they get to Rockopolis.

1499
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:55,600
They become they found an old jukebox and it took them to Rockopolis and then they became

1500
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,600
rascals.

1501
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,600
They're heart rock rascals.

1502
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,680
They were rock stars and now they're babies.

1503
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,720
Heart rock rascals.

1504
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,720
Rocking their way to your heart.

1505
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:11,480
My memory, real life childhood memory of playing Hollywood is that stuff started going downhill

1506
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:16,040
when in the early years they would brag about in our chicken fingers.

1507
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,320
They're rolled in Captain Crunch.

1508
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,320
They're sweet.

1509
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,440
They're only Captain Crunch and Corn Flakes.

1510
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,720
And when they lost, when they stopped paying the license and when it just said they're

1511
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:28,440
rolled in sweet cereal, I was like, something happened.

1512
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,960
It's like fun.

1513
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,680
That was like a kid.

1514
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,240
Like you get the kids attention to me.

1515
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,760
I was like, chicken Captain Crunch chicken tenders.

1516
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:36,760
Yeah.

1517
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,080
And so what I wonder what they were.

1518
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,320
I wonder what sweet cereal.

1519
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,400
Could they even use Captain Crunch anymore or was it like me or like Robert or falling

1520
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,360
out with Captain Crunch?

1521
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:51,640
Go fuck yourself, Captain.

1522
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,320
Or the or the disrespecting his service.

1523
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,920
Wait, what did he say?

1524
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,480
What did Captain Crunch sound like?

1525
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,480
They're great.

1526
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:02,480
Wait, that's what I thought too.

1527
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,480
Well they're out of here.

1528
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,480
They're great.

1529
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,480
I use it too.

1530
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,480
Yar.

1531
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:10,240
Although the Earl of Sandwich was a Navy man and Captain Crunch was a Navy man.

1532
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,800
So maybe that was the conflict.

1533
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,800
Yeah.

1534
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,800
Yeah.

1535
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,800
Different wings.

1536
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,920
We could have won Waterloo if you had followed my advice.

1537
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,880
I guess they did win Waterloo.

1538
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,320
Oh, I forget.

1539
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,320
We know militaries.

1540
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,320
Yeah.

1541
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:26,680
I was busy following my nose.

1542
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:31,360
That's another cereal thing I say as well.

1543
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,600
Yar.

1544
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:38,200
The point is Robert Earl, I mean look, we'd all just lit up at an idea of his.

1545
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,200
Yeah.

1546
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,600
There's something magnetic about this man.

1547
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,560
I mean everybody describes him as charismatic.

1548
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:52,620
He lights up a room clearly and I feel like when you're asking why does this okay sandwich

1549
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:57,620
place come back from the dead, it's got to be just the sheer force of will and probably

1550
01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:01,400
from him go like construction workers, start putting it back up.

1551
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,360
Make it happen again.

1552
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,480
He had, he was saying there's an interview with him.

1553
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:08,840
He was having, he had a couple rough years when like Planet Hollywood stuff went down

1554
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:13,520
but he said it was like most of, 26 years of his like 30 years of his restaurant career

1555
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,520
were meteoric.

1556
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:15,520
Meteoric?

1557
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,520
That is shocking.

1558
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:20,440
It is so hard to open and maintain a restaurant.

1559
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,440
Yeah.

1560
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,440
And.

1561
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,200
Alone like you know 300 of them.

1562
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,200
Yeah.

1563
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,480
The advice he was going to give himself, he said if like if somebody asked him like advice

1564
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,120
you would have given yourself and he said maybe focus on one instead of opening up a

1565
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,240
bunch because that's what he did.

1566
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,520
He got two you know.

1567
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,120
But that also works.

1568
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,080
Like opening up a bunch works.

1569
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,080
That's true.

1570
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:44,680
I mean Planet Hollywood fell apart but it is still you know, I mean that went from 300

1571
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:45,680
to six.

1572
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:46,680
Four.

1573
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,160
But the brand's still around.

1574
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:55,000
You think he'd give us the advice maybe focus on one episode a week instead of a bunch daily?

1575
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,600
I think he would appreciate the ambition.

1576
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:03,000
Even the inventiveness like the Hard Rock Rascals that were with his characters.

1577
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,460
He would say like I only have one note.

1578
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,880
You're all babies.

1579
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,960
Pretend you're all babies.

1580
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,440
Pretend you're all babies.

1581
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:14,280
Crawl around, clap your arms to and fro.

1582
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,780
Goo goo gaga says Jason.

1583
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:18,440
Goo goo gaga.

1584
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:22,640
Well there you have it.

1585
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:24,760
You were roped into an early sandwich experience.

1586
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,720
I hope you had a decent time.

1587
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:27,720
I had a great time.

1588
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:34,200
I guess Mike Mitchell you survived podcast The Ride but now I don't know what happens

1589
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,200
exactly.

1590
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,280
He missed the sector keeper earlier so I don't even know if he's.

1591
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,320
Yeah we kind of just didn't even want to bring him in.

1592
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,320
This is a boss level.

1593
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,320
And he's not here.

1594
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,320
And yeah this is a boss level.

1595
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,480
So this is usually the point where the sector keeper gets possessed.

1596
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,560
So what happens instead?

1597
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,560
Oh Mitch are you okay?

1598
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,560
I'm not feeling so good guys.

1599
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,560
Mitch Mitch.

1600
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,560
What's happening Mitch?

1601
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,560
Oh my god.

1602
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:56,880
It's me Robert Earl I've possessed Mitch.

1603
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,880
Oh no.

1604
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:58,880
A guest has been possessed.

1605
01:31:58,880 --> 01:31:59,880
This is the first time this has happened.

1606
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:04,880
Oh my god I'm so sorry Mitch if you're in there I'm so sorry.

1607
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,880
We're all white.

1608
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,880
Mitch looks like where all my profits were going.

1609
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:09,880
Look at this big belly.

1610
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:10,880
Don't insult Mitch like that.

1611
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,880
That's not nice.

1612
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:12,880
He's lending you his body.

1613
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,880
Don't bang Mitch's belly like that.

1614
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:16,880
I can feel his big belly and his tiny little wanker.

1615
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:17,880
I can feel it.

1616
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:18,880
I can feel it.

1617
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:19,880
I can feel it.

1618
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:20,880
I can feel it.

1619
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:21,880
I can feel it.

1620
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:22,880
I can feel it.

1621
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:23,880
I can feel it.

1622
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:26,520
Oh my god so you're really experiencing his body.

1623
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,480
We do have a good opportunity here.

1624
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,480
Would you mind.

1625
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,080
I don't want to put it.

1626
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,080
Would you show Mitch's wanker?

1627
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,080
Of course.

1628
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,080
Check it out everyone.

1629
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,080
Scott what the hell.

1630
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,080
Check it out.

1631
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,080
You're gonna get canceled.

1632
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,080
That's pretty small.

1633
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,080
Ordeal has made you weird.

1634
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,080
Guys it's Mitch Scott what are you doing?

1635
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,080
It's me Robert Earl again.

1636
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,080
Oh no.

1637
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,960
Hey Mike were you just taking a picture of me in that one second that I was staring really

1638
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:49,720
close at Mitch's dick?

1639
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,480
Yeah because I was gonna cancel you later.

1640
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,480
Oh god.

1641
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:56,520
I don't think that is what I mean when there's a spirit involved I think the lines are blurred.

1642
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,560
Anyway let's deal with this for now.

1643
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:02,640
You guys I want you the podcast the ride to be my guest.

1644
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,640
Tonight you're eating dirt.

1645
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,640
What?

1646
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:06,640
Dirt?

1647
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:07,640
Yes I'm gonna kill you.

1648
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,640
Oh okay.

1649
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:09,640
Oh no.

1650
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:13,560
We're gonna use your construction worker friends to dig graves for us.

1651
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,640
I got all my best friends here the construction workers.

1652
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,560
I see them they're appearing oh no.

1653
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,840
The expendables grab them boys.

1654
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,720
All the expendables.

1655
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:26,240
Put your hands on them like I put my hands on all my guests.

1656
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,240
Oh no.

1657
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,160
Terry Crews is holding my arms.

1658
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:31,120
Now make them do the man Pete dance.

1659
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:36,480
Don Blundgren is touching my lower back and we make it to high high hopes for the living.

1660
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:39,920
That's very demeaning.

1661
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:44,520
And I put my spell of cobs on you so now you're tied and slow while doing this.

1662
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,520
Oh no.

1663
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:49,200
This is a very jet lead I think.

1664
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,200
Get off me.

1665
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,120
This is a discernible variety of bread.

1666
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:53,120
It's not quite your body.

1667
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,120
It's not quite French.

1668
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:55,120
It's weird.

1669
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:59,040
Yes tonight's the lifestyles of the bread and the dead.

1670
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,480
Oh my god that's a clever.

1671
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,800
That would be a great actual like horror movie.

1672
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,800
His titles are good.

1673
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,800
You can't just mitch his wit.

1674
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,640
Do you have Robert what are other ideas for TV shows?

1675
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:11,640
Anything else that could be a rat skull?

1676
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,640
Nah moving on.

1677
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:14,640
You're right we should uh.

1678
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,840
Hey we need to focus on getting him the fuck out of here.

1679
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,840
What do we have in the inventory?

1680
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:20,840
We can't get much at this level.

1681
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:26,160
We've got a pitcher of sangria and Carly gave us those Lego avatars very nicely even though

1682
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,920
we allocated the Lego store to a different stage.

1683
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,440
But we have our little selves.

1684
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:31,960
Hey you know what we should do?

1685
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,480
We should send those Lego guys up as urethra.

1686
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,480
Oh good idea.

1687
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:38,480
No just like they did to Jaja.

1688
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,400
Climb up his peel.

1689
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:46,400
First block it so Mitch can't reproduce and then go up into the brain and get Earl out

1690
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,400
of there.

1691
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:48,400
Alright little fella.

1692
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,400
Pull the avatars out.

1693
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,680
Put this helmet on.

1694
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:51,680
Hey best of luck.

1695
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:55,640
Hey do you know what today you're joining Cranium Command.

1696
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,520
Go little guys.

1697
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,520
There they go.

1698
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,520
Scurry scurry.

1699
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,520
Oh it actually feels okay.

1700
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,880
I actually kind of like it.

1701
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,520
I'm getting off on it mate.

1702
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,000
Oh that's weird.

1703
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,120
Is having those characters in Mitch's dick actually making Mitch's dick bigger?

1704
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:12,200
Yes it looks pretty nice actually.

1705
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,800
It's a decent size now.

1706
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,800
Oh wait but they're moving through.

1707
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,480
They're moving up to your brain.

1708
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,480
I can see I have a neural connection to my avatar like in the movie Avatar.

1709
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,760
Oh did you plug your braid into that Lego's body?

1710
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,920
I plugged my braid into the Lego's into the KCK man.

1711
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:28,920
Oh yeah.

1712
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:33,840
Wow so you're connected to one of those things called avatars.

1713
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:34,840
Cool.

1714
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:35,840
That's right.

1715
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,840
You can see inside Mitch's body.

1716
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,840
It's a little rough.

1717
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:41,840
It's okay.

1718
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:42,840
No judgment.

1719
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:43,840
We're all getting older.

1720
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,840
What are you seeing in there?

1721
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,440
What organ would you see that was like?

1722
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,840
I see the wrappers of all the food.

1723
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:50,840
The wrappers?

1724
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:54,040
You're telling me that he eats the wrappers with the food on it?

1725
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,040
Is that what you're saying?

1726
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,040
Well it's like a movie.

1727
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:58,240
It's like Rick and Ralph when you see all the logos.

1728
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,880
You see all the logos.

1729
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,880
Mitch has got to learn to not eat the wrappers.

1730
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:03,880
It's like Osmosis Jones.

1731
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:04,880
There's a city in here.

1732
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:06,520
Why did I choose to possess this one?

1733
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,520
He seems the dumbest.

1734
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,160
He's eaten wrappers left and right.

1735
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:14,080
A very poor possession on your part Mr. Earl.

1736
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,240
You don't make every good decision.

1737
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,720
Sometimes you make the bad ones.

1738
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:18,720
No.

1739
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:22,400
Like opening restaurants too quickly or letting Legos climb up a peel into your brain.

1740
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:27,480
The avatars are free climbing his spinal column like Free Solo which you can now watch on

1741
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,760
Disney Plus.

1742
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,760
They're almost at the brain.

1743
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:31,760
Good point Jason.

1744
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:32,760
They're going to make it like Free Solo.

1745
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:33,760
Spoiler.

1746
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,760
Spoiler alert.

1747
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,760
The man does not fall to his death.

1748
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,080
Are they in the brain yet?

1749
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:40,080
They're at the brain.

1750
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,080
They're at the brain.

1751
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:43,040
Oh they're seeing all of his good ideas.

1752
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,160
They're seeing all the good ideas.

1753
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,160
Quick voice.

1754
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,160
Give them to me.

1755
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,160
I want them.

1756
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,160
No.

1757
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,160
Quick voice.

1758
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:50,160
Activate the areas.

1759
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,160
Activate the areas of bad memories.

1760
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,080
The Tiffs with Stallone and Schwarzenegger.

1761
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,080
The Tiffs with Morton.

1762
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,080
No.

1763
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,080
The bad memories.

1764
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,080
They're flooding back.

1765
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:58,080
No.

1766
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,080
Schwarzenegger's screaming at you.

1767
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,080
No.

1768
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:02,080
Inflicts in his muscles.

1769
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,720
There's only one way out of this.

1770
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:06,360
I'm going to touch my juke magic jukebox.

1771
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:09,320
Oh we brought his magic jukebox with him.

1772
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,320
No.

1773
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,320
And turn into a little baby.

1774
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:12,320
Wait.

1775
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,320
Mitch is now a baby.

1776
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,320
Mitch is now a baby.

1777
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,320
Oh no.

1778
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,320
There he goes.

1779
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,320
Wait.

1780
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,320
Mitch is?

1781
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,320
Well the body is.

1782
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:20,320
No.

1783
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,320
What I'm seeing is Mitch is a baby.

1784
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:22,320
I'm seeing Mitch is a baby.

1785
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,320
His wanker still looks the same to me.

1786
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:26,320
Teeny tiny baby.

1787
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,320
That didn't change you anyway.

1788
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:28,320
That didn't change Robert Earl.

1789
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,320
Okay.

1790
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:40,360
Well then I think what we have to do is maybe we need to make baby Mitch man up by giving

1791
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:43,880
him a full pitcher of sangria to himself.

1792
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:44,880
Here you go little baby.

1793
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:45,880
Here you go little baby.

1794
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:46,880
I'm going to cancel you.

1795
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,880
I'm helping you like the Mandalorian.

1796
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:48,880
Guys.

1797
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:56,040
Oh the avatars are climbing out of Mitch's ear and he's back to full size.

1798
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,040
That's what happened.

1799
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,880
Well to be honest.

1800
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,360
Long story my man.

1801
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:06,400
Yeah but Robert Earl possessed you and some Legos crawled up your pee hole.

1802
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:07,400
Jesus Christ.

1803
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:10,080
Am I going to be okay?

1804
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,400
The way you're eating I don't know.

1805
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,400
What?

1806
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,400
What did he say?

1807
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:19,760
Well even going to Hogwarts you unwrap the food on Doughboys before you eat it right?

1808
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:20,760
Huh?

1809
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,760
Never mind.

1810
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,760
I think you're going to be fine.

1811
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:25,760
You're going to be fine.

1812
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,320
Look at your dinner partners the next time you're eating with folks.

1813
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,320
The point.

1814
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,320
Oh my god.

1815
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,400
I said you survived podcast the ride preemptively.

1816
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:36,400
Now Mike Mitchell you survived podcast the ride.

1817
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,400
Wow.

1818
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:38,400
Wow.

1819
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,400
God guys.

1820
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:40,400
I can't believe it.

1821
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:45,960
I felt the evil force in my body and I just felt it go away after I drank that sangria.

1822
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,200
That was all it took.

1823
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,520
Just feeding a child sangria is what did it.

1824
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:51,520
You guys are heroes.

1825
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,520
Yes.

1826
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:53,520
Feeding a child sangria.

1827
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,720
Forcing liquor onto a little baby.

1828
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,600
You beat Robert Earl.

1829
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,920
I feel pretty good about it.

1830
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,880
Maybe I'll go giving liquor to babies more often.

1831
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,240
Wait and look.

1832
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:03,440
Look at the coffee table.

1833
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,320
A giant toasted party sub is appearing.

1834
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,320
It must be the item.

1835
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,320
Is it a gobbler?

1836
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:09,320
It's a big gobbler.

1837
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:15,760
It's a party sub sized toasted gobbler wrapped in that sort of unnerving Earl of Sandwich

1838
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,160
tin foil we didn't get a chance to talk about.

1839
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,160
Oh with the Union Jack.

1840
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,160
It's weird right.

1841
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:22,640
It has kind of a Union Jack but it crinkles so easily.

1842
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:27,520
It just makes me think of Austin Powers' underwear.

1843
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,520
But that's cool.

1844
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:29,520
It is cool.

1845
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,520
He is cool.

1846
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:31,520
Like eating hair.

1847
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,520
Like the lettuce at Earl of Sandwich.

1848
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:33,520
Yeah.

1849
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,520
Lettuce.

1850
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,880
I'll get you next time podcast the ride boys.

1851
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:37,880
Oh wow.

1852
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:38,880
Geez.

1853
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,000
His spirit flying away.

1854
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Perhaps to Rockopolis.

1855
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Yeah I think he went to Rockopolis.

1856
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,680
Where hopefully he stays.

1857
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:46,680
Yeah.

1858
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:47,680
Unless.

1859
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:48,680
Teaser.

1860
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:51,680
Unless he comes back somehow.

1861
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,720
I guess we'll have to see.

1862
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:54,720
Oh boy.

1863
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,720
Guys that was wild.

1864
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:58,640
Wow that was really insane.

1865
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:05,600
And if you see any photos posted later that appear to be me and you in this room and I'm

1866
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:10,680
looking at your penis that's been unzipped those are clearly deep fakes.

1867
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,680
Oh wow.

1868
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:12,680
Geez.

1869
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,240
You're so specific about what the deep fake will be.

1870
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,240
I don't know.

1871
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:17,240
I just got a vision.

1872
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:20,200
It must have been like a cosmic thing from all these spirits being around.

1873
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:22,320
I don't know why I said those specific words.

1874
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:25,040
That's why I wanted to but one last question before I go.

1875
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,000
Why am I wearing a diaper?

1876
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Hmm.

1877
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Well.

1878
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,360
That's just a little idea for you.

1879
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:35,480
It's between you and your god I guess to sort out.

1880
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:38,520
I just a little lifestyle suggestion for you.

1881
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,240
You know have some fun with it.

1882
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,240
Alright hell yeah.

1883
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,000
See what possibilities it opens up.

1884
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,880
Yeah you don't have to go to the bathroom now.

1885
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,880
That's a good point.

1886
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:47,240
You can record whenever you want.

1887
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:48,480
This is a great idea.

1888
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,480
Yeah.

1889
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:53,800
Now you can just be podcasting nonstop without even bathroom breaks.

1890
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:54,800
Yeah that thing.

1891
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:55,800
The podcast fan's dream.

1892
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:56,800
All your fan's dream.

1893
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:57,800
The podcast.

1894
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:58,800
Learn the Mayor Pete dance.

1895
01:40:58,800 --> 01:40:59,800
Like yeah.

1896
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:03,120
And then make a shit in your diaper.

1897
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,720
A little diaphy.

1898
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:08,840
Mitch thanks for being here.

1899
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,840
Thanks for having me guys.

1900
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,440
Any exit through the gift shop.

1901
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:16,640
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1902
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,040
No.

1903
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,720
The Tomorrow War in 2020.

1904
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:20,720
Yeah.

1905
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:24,200
Do you mean the movie or the actual war that's coming?

1906
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:28,200
There's going to be a Tomorrow War in 2020.

1907
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:30,480
US versus Rockopolis.

1908
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,400
Well I'm enlisting.

1909
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:34,400
What a battle it will be.

1910
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,080
We'll destroy those babies pretty easy.

1911
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,600
Yeah fuck those rascals.

1912
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:41,520
And then Doughboyz on Head Gum and the Patreon.

1913
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,200
Give it a listen.

1914
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,200
Yeah.

1915
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,200
Yeah great show.

1916
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,200
That's it.

1917
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,200
Fun stuff.

1918
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,200
Indeed.

1919
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,200
I wonder if you'll be the last Doughboy of the series.

1920
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:50,200
I wonder yeah.

1921
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,200
Question mark.

1922
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:52,200
Hmm.

1923
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,840
Anyway as for the rest of the stuff.

1924
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,080
Y'all came from the underworld.

1925
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:59,280
Hopefully you came from the underworld but if you didn't all those episodes are still

1926
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:04,560
