00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Forever... dog.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,120
Warning! The following podcast contains slow-moving objects, shells, and little games that gave

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,840
one of the hosts a little trouble.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:36,680
This is Mario Kart Bowser's Challenge on Podcast The Ride.

5
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,320
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast about theme parks that's like an unstoppable red shell

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,480
aimed at your funny bone.

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Right?

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,400
I'm Scott Gardner, Sean Puchase and Sheridan.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,000
I admittedly don't know a lot of very specific Mario Kart things, so I was like...

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,800
I wouldn't call that one very specific.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
That's a pretty...

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,720
Well, you really don't if you don't know the red shell.

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,960
I know the...

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,680
I don't think it dawned on me.

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,880
Is it like that in The Ride, too, that the shells operate differently depending on color?

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,200
If you can believe it, I didn't get a good sense of what the specific shells do in the

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,680
Mario Kart Ride, which we're talking about today with our third host, Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
I want to explain, too.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
I remember I have to cue...

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,440
I want to cue something up for pretty early, maybe in the podcast.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,120
And then as you did the intro, for a second I kind of gave...

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,960
I was like, hmm, I give like a good nod and I forgot I was on the podcast.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,040
I forgot I was involved in it for a half second.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,600
I went, oh, yeah, because there was a dead space.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,960
I'm very afraid of you to admit that.

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,160
I have had moments like that, you know.

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
Oh, yeah.

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
We've noticed yours.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,040
Oh, jeepers, thanks.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,680
You're usually looking, I think, at like a fact or something.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,160
You'll be looking at your computer sometimes.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
That's true.

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
You do go down.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
You do go downward a lot.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,720
Well, I make the notes and then they're far too small or disorganized for me to actually

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
utilize sometimes.

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,200
Get that font bigger, first of all.

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,600
You're like, we can look over and you're just like mouthing like the name of like a ride

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
system or something.

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
And you're like trying to...

42
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Or milk.

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,200
You're just trying to say milk, right?

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Water coaster.

45
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
We've given you such a...

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
EMF ride systems.

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,000
We've given you such a neurosis on this, but you're just like, don't say milk, don't say

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
milk, don't say buka de bepo.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is it pepo or bepo?

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is it pepo or bepo?

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ah, shoot.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I just said beka.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wait, buka de bepo.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Buka de beki?

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,840
I found a new way to say that wrong.

56
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,120
So yeah, so it was a good remark is what I'm saying.

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
Great.

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
We're all agreed.

59
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
Did you find what you were looking for?

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Yeah, yeah.

61
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
I know what it was.

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,920
Does this need to be organically woven into?

63
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,360
Well, I mentioned it, I guess.

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
I don't really know.

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Feel free.

66
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
We in general...

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,560
Look, overall, we are talking about Mario Kart Bowser's challenge or as for some reason

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,040
it's known in Japan, Mario Kart Koopa's challenge.

69
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Right.

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Yeah.

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Sure.

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
I guess he's more King Koopa there.

73
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
I don't know.

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,760
Yes, he is more known as King Koopa there than Bowser and Bowser here.

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,480
But I don't know, maybe you had a different way to intro this, but I guess I'm just going

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,400
to do it now because right up top, there's a very important thing we have to talk about.

77
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Sure.

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,080
Because I don't like when stuff like this happens on the podcast and I have to just

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,480
put it out there and say it.

80
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,640
Are you doing some pennants?

81
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,240
Yes, I guess you could say that.

82
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,240
Yes.

83
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
So I just want to put...

84
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,480
Okay, I'm just going to make sure this is playing here.

85
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,040
On the last podcast, the Riot episode that was live, new, I said a statement that was

86
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,720
incorrect.

87
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,400
And I'd like to apologize for that statement.

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:57,800
I said that the Toadstool Cafe shared a kitchen with the Lorelaut Panda Express.

89
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Right.

90
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Right.

91
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,480
And I said it confidently.

92
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,440
I thought I knew it because honestly, I've heard it from two different people, two different

93
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
places.

94
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,160
One unsourced on Twitter, of course, and then a friend of mine who goes across the Inside

95
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,320
Universal Message boards and said that there is...

96
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,720
You did couch it as a rumor.

97
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,200
So give yourself that.

98
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Okay.

99
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
You didn't say it was a rumor.

100
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,360
Yeah, but I said it confidently and I don't like that.

101
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:26,160
And I would like to formally apologize to the audience for misleading you.

102
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,480
Toadstool Cafe has a separate kitchen from the Lorelaut Panda Express and that Panda Express

103
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,520
has not been moved because there's some sort of a licensing agreement and they couldn't

104
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,240
just get rid of it blanket.

105
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,680
The Panda Express earned its right to still be there.

106
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Correct.

107
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Yeah.

108
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
So I just wanted to do that up top.

109
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,200
I hate to bring the show down early, but there it is.

110
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,960
It's brave of you.

111
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,080
It's manly of you.

112
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,320
That's the way to be a man.

113
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Thank you.

114
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,640
It's a way and age to own up to it.

115
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
Thank you.

116
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,400
And just try to improve and try to be better.

117
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Thank you.

118
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,960
I just don't want to be the George Santos of the show after this and then after the whole

119
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,200
Frank Marshall situation where I incorrectly said that he spoke at the Jurassic World

120
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
opening ceremony.

121
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,480
Well, you have to get ahead of these things before I get ahold of them and certainly before

122
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,840
Griffin gets ahold of them.

123
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
That's...

124
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Yes, exactly.

125
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Like me, we can handle.

126
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,400
If this ends up, if the ball ends up in Griffin's zone, like, oh man, if he shows up in the

127
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,880
group text, you're done.

128
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
He's coming here.

129
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,320
We're going to do a full hour on the kitchen and he's gone to the kitchen and it's impossible

130
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
to share the space.

131
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,840
The outlets, the electrical outlets wouldn't even make sense in the same...

132
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,440
There's that cord long enough to reach to keep food hot in the hallway.

133
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,640
I assume there'd be like a hot hallway that would keep food fresh as you walk from the

134
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,520
Panda Express to Toadstool Cafe.

135
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,480
Fundamentally, there is no way that they could share a kitchen and it would make sense.

136
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
You couldn't heat...

137
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,600
You couldn't make a hot hallway is what I'm saying.

138
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,200
That's what it requires for food.

139
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,360
The two locations are so far away that that hallway has to be hot or else the food...

140
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,480
And I know for a fact that all of these establishments, especially the Panda Express and the Lower

141
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,800
Lotta Universal is incredibly concerned with your food being piping hot.

142
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Oh baby.

143
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
You're the Panda Promise.

144
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,560
Yes, that's right.

145
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
That's correct.

146
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:32,400
Well, I think it's appropriate that you do that, Mike, because I think there's a little

147
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:40,800
bit of making amends and a little bit of redemption, I think, that we're aiming for with this episode

148
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,400
in general.

149
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,760
And allow me to explain because this is our second episode about Super Nintendo World,

150
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,760
which we two weeks ago covered in a broader sense.

151
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,640
And now we're back to a kind of more focused on the Mario Kart ride.

152
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:04,020
And in between, almost immediately after, we got to go again to Super Nintendo World.

153
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,540
And full disclosure, this was with press perks.

154
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,300
We were part of the press and we were there for a press day.

155
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,720
And therefore, the crowd was cut in half, in more than half.

156
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,160
Into a third of what it would be.

157
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
A quarter of the preview.

158
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Might have been a quarter.

159
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,600
Yeah, yeah, that actually might be correct.

160
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,540
So there were a lot less people.

161
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,880
So that is important context.

162
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:40,400
However, getting to experience this land again, but with that context, I started feeling like,

163
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,240
I think maybe we cut this place a raw deal because I don't know if the listener felt

164
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,280
this way.

165
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,320
But I think after we recorded, I certainly was feeling like, boy, that was a grouchy

166
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,800
episode that we recorded about Super Nintendo World.

167
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,120
That's how I felt.

168
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,800
And I'll ask you guys how you feel.

169
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,680
I don't incredibly regret it because it was very crowded and there were some difficulties

170
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,600
to it, but it did.

171
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,200
I think we came in with a lot of negativity that stayed throughout the episode.

172
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,080
And as soon as we were there on this other day and got to experience some of these other

173
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,320
things, I felt fun and positivity.

174
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,320
I felt what some of these other theme park bloggers and vloggers because they were all

175
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,600
a glow.

176
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,560
And here we are grouching and complaining.

177
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,400
But what do you think?

178
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,400
It's tough because we look, we do try to keep it real on this show.

179
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,800
OK, so sometimes, you know, I go, OK, everybody because, look, everybody wants some access.

180
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
That's nice.

181
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
I beg for access on the show regularly.

182
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,860
So, yeah, we want it.

183
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,000
But then we don't we don't always play the game at which might jeopardize that access.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,520
Now, we've seen now Disney.

185
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
We have no hope.

186
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,320
We will never be on Disney's list.

187
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
No, no, no.

188
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,000
Who they go because you have to be 110 percent positive.

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,120
You have to be a Disney princess in terms of perkiness.

190
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,840
You have to be like who's who's like the most positive one, like the enchanted, whatever

191
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
her name is.

192
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Yeah.

193
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Is that right?

194
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,360
You know, everything's like you have to just be so hyper positive about it.

195
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
So we're out there.

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
Universal, we're on the line.

197
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,080
But we we still we want to be we want the sexist, but we want to be positive, too.

198
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
And I don't know.

199
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
This is all honest.

200
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Yeah.

201
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
So so we're straddling the line there.

202
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,220
But also, it's like we went as civilians that day.

203
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,560
This was our experience.

204
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,200
This is how we felt.

205
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,600
That's a valid thing to do.

206
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,560
And I said, look, I said nice things.

207
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,040
I said some glowing things about the land and the way.

208
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
And I still feel that way.

209
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
I did.

210
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
I feel it all did.

211
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Yeah.

212
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,040
So I did feel we were a bit grouchy and I was like, is that right?

213
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,640
Do I did I not get the ride exactly?

214
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,300
We'll get to the ride because that's what the topic is today.

215
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,880
So there were some things where I was like, OK, we didn't get a chance to sort of do everything

216
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,560
in a comfortable fashion.

217
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,920
So there was a question of like, I'm sure we're missing stuff.

218
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,720
I feel it's a bit incomplete, but knowing that we'd have a part two pretty quickly,

219
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,080
I at least felt pretty good about that.

220
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Yes.

221
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
Yeah.

222
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,200
Well, and we start doing some of these things and I'm expressing to both of you guys, you

223
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
know what?

224
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm having a lot of fun and I'm a little worried that we are kind of harsh land.

225
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,720
And Mike said, I kind of see where you're coming from.

226
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,120
I might kind of agree.

227
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,760
Jason said in a quote, I will never forget.

228
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
It's really funny.

229
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,280
I think Comcast can take that.

230
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I don't care.

231
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,720
I love that recording.

232
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:48,680
And I like driving by the opening ceremony was going on as we're wrapping up.

233
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,440
We saw I saw a little of the fireworks driving down Lancashire Boulevard.

234
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,720
But yeah, I don't know.

235
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,560
I didn't think I think I think I gave some pretty light jabs.

236
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,040
But like, I don't know, it's going to be so gnarly for like the first six plus months.

237
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
This is true.

238
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
This is true.

239
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,000
I didn't view it as that we I was not concerned about harshness to Comcast.

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,100
I just thought we maybe just came off like grouches.

241
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
That was my concern.

242
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:20,600
Oh, well, I felt pretty ill after that first round of food before the second round.

243
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,800
I did like what I had better the second round and I felt normal.

244
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,960
What you're saying the food was the 11 a.m. spaghetti.

245
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, the 11 a.m. spaghetti.

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,680
And which was not on the day that we recorded.

247
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,720
But it was still lingering in your mind.

248
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,440
It was decaying your mind.

249
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
He was keeping it real.

250
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
I was also a little disappointed by the sweets.

251
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,520
And then, of course, the second time around the matcha cake.

252
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,480
I was like, OK, I like this one.

253
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,520
Yeah, I'm going to go right after you.

254
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,280
Now maybe it's different tastes and maybe they were different on different days.

255
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,080
I think you were kind of harsh on that tiramisu.

256
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,360
Yeah, it didn't taste like any tiramisu I've ever had.

257
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
It didn't know.

258
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
That's right.

259
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
That's not like fine restaurant.

260
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,840
I also I'm on edge because I think we're saying this word wrong.

261
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Yes.

262
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,120
So I think I saw somebody mention this tiramisu is what I believe it is.

263
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
I've heard both.

264
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,040
OK, that's how I've always heard it.

265
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,080
But maybe I'm saying it completely wrong, too, because I believe me, I've made plenty

266
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
of gaps on this show.

267
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,640
Well, including I don't want to leave myself open because you know what I did last time

268
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
about that song again.

269
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,280
No, you know what?

270
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,520
I didn't get to have it the first time because Chef Toad didn't make enough.

271
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
And you're right.

272
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,640
It's not like some like great restaurant tiramisu.

273
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Right up.

274
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,640
You guys are saying tiramisu.

275
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Tiramisu.

276
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Tiramisu.

277
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,280
Tiramisu is how I always thought it was.

278
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
But again, I don't know.

279
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,640
We're putting an emphasis in the middle.

280
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
OK.

281
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,880
Yeah, but again, I'm not really teaching you.

282
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm just this is how I always heard it.

283
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
But I don't know.

284
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Yes.

285
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Could be completely wrong.

286
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
I like it.

287
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,120
But again, I don't have the best track record with Inside Universal Studios Hollywood Food.

288
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,240
Have had wonderful meals at CityWalk at pretty much anywhere I've eaten at CityWalk.

289
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,360
Wait a second.

290
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,480
Do you not remember the CityWalk saga?

291
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,800
Did it all just vacate your mind all of a sudden?

292
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,280
Let me remind you about Wetzel's Pretzels, my friend.

293
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,480
Oh, well, that's like a take.

294
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,280
I'm at real restaurants.

295
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,720
Yeah, no, I forgot about the Wetzel's Pretzels saga.

296
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,200
You had wonderful meals at Bubba Gump.

297
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
We had a nice time.

298
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,560
Yeah, we had a nice time and nothing was wrong.

299
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,520
My food was, you know, fine.

300
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,720
That's hardly the definition of wonderful, my friend.

301
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,520
I was looking at the whole experience.

302
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Scotty, you're trying to be positive.

303
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,560
Scotty, you're trying to keep it real.

304
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
I'm trying to keep it real.

305
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,560
You want the guy to be positive and he's trying.

306
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,080
It is a thing I've worked on there.

307
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,840
Don't say the first thing that comes to your head.

308
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,400
Don't say your initial reaction.

309
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,000
Sit on it for 30 seconds.

310
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,480
I was going to bring this up later in the show, but I think the land in this attraction,

311
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:58,720
in general, I think a lot of recent stuff in recent years, Avengers Campus, Galaxy's

312
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,480
Edge, I have come to appreciate more as time has gone on.

313
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,160
So yeah, Pandora, I think I liked immediately.

314
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Pandora was an immediate.

315
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Pandora is pretty great.

316
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Yeah.

317
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:19,120
Well, in terms of stuff that is good, well, here's a big difference.

318
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,920
Is that this time, in addition to the lighter crowds, Jason, the first time you had the

319
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,240
power bands, we now, Mike and I now had the power bands.

320
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,960
This gave us the ability to play the mini games, the games which get you the key.

321
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,320
Nowhere you collect the key, which get you, sorry, you three keys.

322
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,720
Get you access to Bowser Jr.

323
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,520
You can play three different games or you can repeat games.

324
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,720
You can play one game twice or three times.

325
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,040
They get harder as you go along.

326
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
Oh, that's a way to get the three keys.

327
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
You can keep going.

328
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Okay.

329
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Okay.

330
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,000
I also just read that they are doing, I think Carly posted, they are doing standby for Bowser

331
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Jr.

332
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
A standby line for a little while.

333
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,480
Where you do not have to get the, yeah, which is good because again, I think these lines

334
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,000
are going to be so crazy that it's going to be tough to like stand in three different

335
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,760
lines in order to get to another thing with a line.

336
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
That's all going to be hard.

337
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,240
But look, if we take crowds out of the equation, we had the bands now, we're able to play these

338
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
games.

339
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
I loved these games.

340
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,160
I had so much fun and I feel like I was watching them the first time from the outside like,

341
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
oh, that's it.

342
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,360
It's a Goomba on a roller thing.

343
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,320
Playing it is a whole other, I thought these were all delightful.

344
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Agree disagree?

345
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,760
Yeah, I liked the, I did like the games.

346
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,320
I don't think I'd wait more than 10 minutes for any of them.

347
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,520
I agree for sure.

348
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,920
And a $40 add on to do any of them is a little steep.

349
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,960
It's significant and I don't love the idea that like some of the strongest attractions

350
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,360
in this land require the band.

351
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,000
You know, it's not like I've never felt shut out of the lightsaber experience in Galaxy's

352
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Edge.

353
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,160
I don't want that lightsaber.

354
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,880
I don't care about doing the show that much and that's a much greater expense.

355
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,080
But this I'm a little weirder about where like it does stink that it takes $40 to do

356
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
some of the best stuff there.

357
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,600
I did see that if one person gets the three keys and goes to Bowser Jr. they can bring

358
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,400
a few people without power bands.

359
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,800
Oh, what the limit is.

360
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Oh, that's good.

361
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,160
This might be another Carly nugget wisdom.

362
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,080
If you're staying at the hotel, you can bring some of your friends to the club in Vegas

363
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
is what you're saying.

364
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Oh yeah, basically.

365
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
The V.I.

366
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,280
We just said Bowser Jr.'s VIP language.

367
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,360
Yeah, which is what I did to in Vegas a couple of years ago.

368
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,240
I got a loud sigh when I did it once in Vegas.

369
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,520
Oh, we got a loud sigh.

370
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,920
You bring you bring in like six guys in their mid to late 30s and that's it to a club in

371
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,120
Las Vegas.

372
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
They don't really like that.

373
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
They don't care about that.

374
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Believe it or not.

375
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,200
Let me tell you something in Los Angeles in the world of podcasts, mid to late 30s guys

376
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,160
are the most in demand demographic.

377
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,960
Right this way, sirs.

378
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,120
There's two city blocks in Los Angeles where we're on top.

379
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
I got more.

380
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,040
I mean, it was just me and Jane, but I still got a guy going, yeah, no, it's not here.

381
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,120
Take these risks.

382
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
That's not going to work.

383
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Take these risks.

384
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Just escalator.

385
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,160
When we were in Vegas, they were trying so they were trying to write reasons to not let

386
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
us in.

387
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
It was like, OK, well, are you staying at the hotel?

388
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
I'm like, yeah, we are.

389
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
We're here.

390
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
There's a car.

391
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,720
OK, well, you have to have passes for this.

392
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, we get these free comps.

393
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,560
We talked to our guy.

394
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,160
We met a guy outside and he gave us these comps.

395
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
OK, all right.

396
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Hold on one second.

397
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Like going to figure out like looking what can we do legally to keep these guys out?

398
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,920
And then like they were in where they were.

399
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,040
They were in like gang attire.

400
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,600
No, look, they are not gang attire.

401
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,240
I had the name of two.

402
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,720
I did at the front desk.

403
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,120
I'd like a couple of front desk people.

404
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,160
And even the guy at the club was just like, fine, I don't want to deal with these two

405
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
weirdos.

406
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,520
Yeah, we just waited a while and we just outlasted their patience basically and then went in to

407
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,720
off the record club at the Park MGM in Las Vegas.

408
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,360
So anyway, I was going to say about the four.

409
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,600
So it is like a magic band.

410
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
It's like a snap race.

411
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
You are right.

412
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,560
It does not perfect like the magnet on it.

413
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,040
It's first of all, I like the feeling of it.

414
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
I like it.

415
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,560
It's like, yeah, but it does have some kind of like bunches up here and there on me.

416
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
You are right about that.

417
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,480
I'm not sure if they'll fix that for the next round of them.

418
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,160
But the whole, I will say this because you're saying about like paying to do these experiences

419
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,520
and you wouldn't wait 10 minutes and we'll come back to this thought.

420
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,920
But the thought I had is like, this is going to be worth it for you if you're living in

421
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,320
Los Angeles and you're coming here a couple of times a year.

422
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,480
That's a real like that's where you're going to get the big fun, I would say, out of all

423
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,960
of this stuff versus the one person who's coming once who might not even know all this

424
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
stuff exists.

425
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Yeah.

426
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
And it's confused by some of it.

427
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Unless they're really motivated to.

428
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Unless they're very motivated.

429
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,400
I know about this stuff and I want to do it, which might be listeners to the show.

430
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,480
I mean, I just, my overall thing, I just, I think this is all going to be great in 2025.

431
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,600
I think it's all just got to die down.

432
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:27,440
But like once it is not super slammed, now we have like a range of little experiences

433
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,160
that are, you know, an odd little underground corners.

434
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,840
That's not really a thing that's been in Universal before.

435
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,640
And like we were saying last time that it's great.

436
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,520
It's a great cartoon world you enter with heights and when hefts to it, you know, it's

437
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,080
all going to be ultimately great for the Universal landscape.

438
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,560
It's just, it's going to be a tough, tough for six months, I think.

439
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Okay.

440
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,480
Well, I do give them credit because they have been running virtual cues to get in the land.

441
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,680
And I think we all think, you know, I think we can all say on some level, that's a bit

442
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,200
of a pain on the other Pete's waiting on a six hour, four hour line, like what have you.

443
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,240
And wait times, I've been looking at wait times the last few days on this and like,

444
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,800
how is it generally affecting the park?

445
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,760
And wait times are still kind of low.

446
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,720
Like it's very much, you think of Disneyland as a locals park, but universal Hollywood

447
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,000
is to an extent too.

448
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,680
I mean, you got a lot of tourists certainly.

449
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,720
But a definitely on weekdays.

450
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,360
So wait times are noticeably lower for not for this brand new thing, but for all the

451
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
other stuff.

452
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Yeah.

453
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,400
Everything else seems, I'm going to throw a bummer out.

454
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,720
Mike Scollins, friend of the show we had on was there the other day.

455
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,160
He said Mario Kart ride 220 minutes wait and then it broke for an hour.

456
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,280
Oh geez.

457
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
That is rough.

458
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,880
These are rough numbers.

459
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
That's hard.

460
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Yeah.

461
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,720
I saw it at 240 one day when I look 240.

462
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,200
What gets longer than this?

463
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,720
Maybe we're ignorant.

464
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,460
Florida listeners could tell us like, Oh, this thing was busy in five hours for months.

465
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,960
But like these are some of the biggest numbers.

466
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,280
I feel like I've heard.

467
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Oh yeah, maybe.

468
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Yeah.

469
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
And this city for sure.

470
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,140
But this is, you know, we still, we're hurting for rides out here too.

471
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,300
So like anything that's new is just going to be astronomical for like six months.

472
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,260
It's like, there's not many other places for people to go at this point, but that is still

473
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,560
even higher than I think I've seen.

474
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,120
And somebody correct me if I'm wrong.

475
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,680
I don't think opening summer transformers was ever that crazy.

476
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,100
It should have been, but I don't remember going.

477
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,480
It was just the people were too like emotionally bereft.

478
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,440
You know, it's just such a, such a weighty experience.

479
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,520
It's like, you know, the, you know, people don't go see the whale over and over again.

480
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Right.

481
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
That's true.

482
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,360
All year, you know, you got to let it sink in.

483
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Yeah.

484
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Yeah.

485
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,720
And you go, and you go back and see the whale again.

486
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Right.

487
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,320
How many times are you guys up to on the whale?

488
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Seven.

489
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
I haven't braved the screener.

490
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,560
I think I'm running out of days too, cause sag words are Sunday.

491
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Shame on you.

492
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,640
I took a day and I saw the 1040 and then I stayed in the theater.

493
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,000
I had a popcorn lunch and then I saw it again and then a jujube snack.

494
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And then I saw it again.

495
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,200
I took a whole day, just four, no five whales in a row.

496
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,080
These mini games, I'm going to, I didn't also didn't realize they had their names.

497
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,240
They don't have like clearly labeled names, but I looked up the names and the names are

498
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
all good.

499
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
I liked the names.

500
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,000
Goomba crazy crank.

501
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
That's one where you spin a crank.

502
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,080
You got to spin it fast enough to make the Goomba fall backwards.

503
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,280
So satisfying when it works.

504
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,140
I don't think that's the hardest one in the world.

505
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:44,120
That was my baby holding shoulder that I was really leaning on and it was pretty sore because

506
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,760
I was really cranking that thing.

507
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Yeah.

508
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,200
I was really, it was like a Jack in the box kind of crank, but much bigger.

509
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
And I was going to town.

510
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,520
I felt like on it in my mind, I was like doing like a Hercules thing.

511
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,480
Oh, like just this thing was going so fast.

512
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,280
Everyone was like, Oh, look at the strong man.

513
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,640
One of the labors you have to do.

514
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,400
It probably looked to please Zeus.

515
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,480
I would do anything to please him.

516
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Yeah.

517
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,320
Um, you really, whatever as much cranking it as you had to do, please them.

518
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,000
If it pleases Zeus, I will crank it.

519
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,120
Let it sit there.

520
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,900
Uh, in, in order.

521
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,420
Then we played Piranha plant nap mishap.

522
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,440
This was the turning point where I'm like, yeah, I'm having a lot of fun.

523
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,580
And I think we were being a little, this was such a blast to just really quick premise

524
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,840
here.

525
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:42,160
There is a big sleeping Piranha plant and you were in a little patch surrounded by giant

526
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,000
alarm clocks and those are going to start going off and you got to hit all of those

527
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,080
things so that he does not wake up.

528
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Yeah.

529
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,280
And this is a good one for a group because we all three got to play it together.

530
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,240
They're all lighten up red.

531
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,920
This thing I've never have.

532
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,400
I felt more like I was on a Nickelodeon game show.

533
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
That's exactly what I was about to say.

534
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Yeah.

535
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,320
I'm literally going to say like, this feels like a live action game show in the middle

536
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
of a theme park.

537
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Yeah.

538
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Yeah.

539
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,960
Kids game show and winning feels fantastic.

540
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,360
The only thing missing is, uh, that, that host, uh, uh, Phil, I don't remember his last name,

541
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,520
the video arcade guy.

542
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
Oh yeah.

543
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Yeah.

544
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
What is the song?

545
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,360
We did that was great and you did the best and now we're going back to the stage.

546
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,920
I don't know if you remember this about Nick or Kate.

547
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,160
He would always improvise a little song.

548
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Really?

549
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
That guy.

550
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
I give it up.

551
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,040
I think that must've kept it interesting for him.

552
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,080
Every episode of Nick arcade, good host.

553
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,200
I don't remember that.

554
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Like them.

555
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,840
Uh, look at if you watch an episode, um, that's great.

556
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
That was fun.

557
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,080
Koopa Troopa power punch.

558
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:51,200
Uh, in this one, there is a green shell going back and forth, uh, in and out of a pipe and,

559
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,360
uh, you have to cause a chain reaction with pow blocks.

560
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,080
You have to hit it at the right time so that another one goes and another one goes and

561
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,280
you have to, which will hit the green shell and cause it to shoot up and hit a Koopa Troopa

562
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,040
with the same green shell.

563
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Very tragic.

564
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Yes.

565
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Sort of a good cannibalism.

566
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,040
You feel like do it.

567
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Yeah.

568
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,680
Um, but, uh, but you know, that's more of a, like, that's not a running around game.

569
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,920
That's more like, like, uh, you know, reading the room.

570
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,120
That's like getting that, that rhythm right.

571
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Yeah.

572
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,320
Um, and I enjoyed that a lot.

573
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
You guys did it and I, I didn't do it.

574
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,240
I can't do it.

575
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,240
I don't know why.

576
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,540
I was not sure what I was doing wrong.

577
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:32,160
The accuracy on these power bands is it's not a hundred percent, you know, thank you

578
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,200
for letting me off the hook.

579
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,040
You might have to hit it a few times.

580
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,720
Well, it's the same technology at the very base.

581
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,040
It's the same as like the tap to pay credit cards, I believe.

582
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,240
Oh, really?

583
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
It's that same, same sort of thing.

584
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,720
Think about how many times that's not worth it.

585
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Yeah.

586
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
Apple pay.

587
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,800
Sometimes you really got to shove your phone onto the little console there to get the

588
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Apple pay to work.

589
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Yeah.

590
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
I've done it.

591
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
It's the same premise.

592
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Yeah.

593
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,360
I think though, at least towards the end of the day, somebody told me that an employee

594
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,040
told me that, uh, actually you don't, at least this is true of the coin boxes.

595
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Yes.

596
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
I don't hit them with the band.

597
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
You do it with your hands.

598
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
You just do it with your hands.

599
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
So it's a little farther away.

600
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Yeah.

601
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
We learned that at the end of the day.

602
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,720
This is the tough thing again about people, even people that are fairly well educated

603
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,720
about what's going on is that there's so much crap to know to get in there and to really

604
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,760
like, like experience all the fun stuff.

605
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
Yes.

606
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:32,440
And like, there should be like a big book, phone book size, like the guide before you

607
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
go in there.

608
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,040
You are given a Nintendo power is back.

609
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
That would be cool.

610
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
That would be cool.

611
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,480
Any Nintendo powers that give you all that.

612
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
That'd be great.

613
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,920
You get a very charming map with the, um, power bands.

614
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
On the app?

615
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
No, in the, in the box.

616
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Oh, you do?

617
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
There's a map in the box.

618
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
I threw the box away.

619
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
I know.

620
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
It's very easy.

621
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
It's kind of like hidden down in the box.

622
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,840
Well, I need a, I need a manual to tell me not to throw away the manual.

623
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,200
You watched me throw away the box.

624
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,000
Uh, I think I learned about it after that.

625
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,720
Oh, so you didn't get the map either.

626
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,680
No, I held onto my boxes.

627
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,640
So I just threw my bag in my backpack.

628
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,840
Really didn't see the map.

629
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:17,680
It's also the, um, like infographic kind of cartoon in the phone app that tells you,

630
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,540
yeah, you have to get the, uh, did you like do your username and stuff?

631
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,540
You created one.

632
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540
Okay.

633
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,040
So we should say that too, before you even start doing these mini games.

634
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,320
And we probably said this on the other one, but you go in the app and then you pick a

635
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,800
unique username.

636
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Yeah.

637
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,840
It cannot be like they're running out of them basically.

638
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,880
Oh, well, I tried multiple names and was denied.

639
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
Oh, what'd you, what'd you try?

640
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,360
I was trying, I, my first one, I think I tried Michael Luigi with the L's, you know, bridging

641
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
the gap between the name.

642
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,720
It said invalid name.

643
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,480
And then I was, I think I, I tried Michael Luigi 69 and it said, this is not an appropriate

644
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
name.

645
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
Please choose a different one.

646
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,360
A tad body.

647
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Please choose a name.

648
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,320
Choose a number that is less body.

649
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:11,880
And then I said, I tried Mr. McFistario and they said no to that.

650
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
What?

651
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I don't know.

652
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Maybe.

653
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,120
And then I tried, uh, Luigi Carlson.

654
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
No.

655
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
What?

656
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,000
I said no on that one too.

657
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,360
I didn't know about any of this.

658
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,640
I got mine on the first try.

659
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
Yeah.

660
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,720
So then I did put, I believe Mr. Mike Fisto is my name.

661
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
That is my official Nintendo.

662
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Well, no complaints for you.

663
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
Got your, your dream.

664
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
You got your wish to be Mr. Mike Fisto.

665
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Yeah.

666
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,800
But I was trying to add fun Mario stuff into it before.

667
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
So I got it fine.

668
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,600
I was happy with my name, but it was just like, I got seven different tries before they

669
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,720
accepted one.

670
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
This is great.

671
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,760
Like, you know, remember when any social media has the handles, you know, it's, they always

672
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,080
say it's, this is like internet real estate.

673
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,720
It's only one chance to grab these names, uh, whether it's Twitter or Facebook or whatever.

674
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,240
Um, and I got mine's a little basic.

675
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,560
I kind of off a bird.

676
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,880
Oh, I went for Scott.

677
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Oh, really?

678
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
That worked.

679
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,480
I got Scott out, but maybe Oh is not so maybe if I tried Scotty, Oh, that would have been

680
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
out.

681
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
Maybe Jason, what was yours?

682
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,920
I don't remember.

683
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,240
Was it anything fun or was it just like, might've just used been something I use when I just

684
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,760
like, God, I gotta make a login for this.

685
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
What do you, what's your go to?

686
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,320
I don't want to, you don't want to say, I don't see your email.

687
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,640
Is it your email?

688
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,680
I don't think it was my email.

689
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,560
It might've had my full name in it.

690
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Okay.

691
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,400
Does it have, is it like, is it just Jay shared in your social security number?

692
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,300
Sometimes it's not social.

693
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,760
It's my social, but not one digit, so we'll never figure that out.

694
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
All right.

695
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
All right.

696
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,720
He said, I don't remember as he flashed to entering the name loves that pussy.

697
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:00,040
Oh, that did go through the mention of the mere mention of fist got him flagged.

698
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,760
You did, you did one with one was a dollar sign and one was a Z. You got it.

699
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
You cracked the code.

700
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Yeah.

701
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Well, I said pushy.

702
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Oh, smart.

703
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:18,440
Um, so I like these games and then the, the culmination of the games that you get access

704
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,280
to this Bowser Jr thing.

705
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,680
I loved the Bowser Jr thing.

706
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Oh yeah.

707
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,400
This was really like this actual like Nick arcade and the level type thing.

708
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:35,080
And I thought it made the most good of anything in the land, including the ride.

709
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,360
Unfortunately, we'll get to that, but I think it did the best job of making you feel like

710
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:46,520
you are Mario or you are in a video game, which is a big promise to have to keep up

711
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,880
in super Nintendo world.

712
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Yes.

713
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,320
I guess if you're listening to this, you don't care about necessarily spoilers, but I went

714
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,120
into this room pretty cold and you're all in like front of a big video screen and they

715
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,000
basically are like projecting your silhouette onto a digital screen and stuff is coming

716
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
at you.

717
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Blocks are going.

718
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,680
So if in real life you jump like three times that amount on the screen and like hit a block,

719
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,480
which looks really silly, but fun and it feels, you kind of feel it.

720
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,680
There's, and there's enough like little rumble, I feel like to it that you sort of, it's,

721
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,600
you feel like you're jumping like Mario.

722
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Yeah.

723
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,880
This is, and this is one of those, cause I think that in general, there's a, I don't

724
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,760
want to say like infection in all of a, of a imagineering and creative right now at theme

725
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,880
parks where you have to be the experiencing this and you're the superhero.

726
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,320
That's a little too much for me in general, but I will say this does kind of fulfill the

727
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,240
promise of it.

728
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,800
Like as far as everything's in recent memory that are like you compete or you participate.

729
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Yeah.

730
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
You throw fire.

731
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,920
Uh, I was gonna say fire flowers.

732
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
That's not what it is.

733
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
You throw fire balls.

734
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Yeah.

735
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
You get a fire flower.

736
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Yeah.

737
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Yeah.

738
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,280
That's, that's a huge thing to get to do in super Nintendo world.

739
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
That's a thing you want to do.

740
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,640
And it is a fun and it's like, there's no goggles or anything.

741
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,280
They figured out a fun prac, like kind of practical way to do it.

742
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,560
It works.

743
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,720
It's not as buggy as other things like this.

744
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,200
And then at the end they try to give you kind of the feeling of the whole group jumping

745
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,960
and landing on the flag.

746
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Yeah.

747
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,160
That's another big, like, yeah, that's fun.

748
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,360
I think we talk about this kind of stuff a lot, just the, like when you hear the premise

749
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,640
of the thing, what are the, what, what do you want to do?

750
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Yes.

751
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,040
And then a lot of them are in this little, this nook, it almost feels secret.

752
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,320
Honestly, you go through little corridors and the, the actual experience room is little

753
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
in the queue.

754
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
Yeah.

755
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
It was great.

756
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,760
Oh, the queue has got pictures of baby bow or Bowser Jr.

757
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,680
Oh, there is very cute.

758
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Very cute.

759
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
Bowser Jr.

760
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,600
I learned in current Canon is bought Bowser's only child.

761
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Is that right?

762
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Yeah.

763
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,440
The Koopalings since like, what is this?

764
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,400
Oh, forgive me.

765
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,960
It said in 2012, our current story is that the seven Koopalings are not Bowser's children.

766
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,120
Bowser's only child is Bowser Jr.

767
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Okay.

768
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
So those are relatives.

769
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
They're like his nephews or something.

770
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
I think they're just as well.

771
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,120
Oh, no pun intended.

772
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,040
But now Miyamoto was at that.

773
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,560
We did not get to go to the opening ceremony, you know, and I, this wouldn't be an episode

774
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:28,080
about a new thing without me bitching about not getting to go, getting, getting one good

775
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,840
free thing, but being selfish and wishing he got to go to the one where Miyamoto, Mr.

776
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,480
Miyamoto was there, Mario's dad.

777
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,560
Yeah.

778
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,680
That's what I was like, Oh no, cause we were recording and then the ceremony you, you told

779
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,520
us we were recording while the ceremony was happening.

780
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,760
I was like, ah, I want to see Mario's daddy.

781
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,040
That's what I want to see.

782
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,240
But oh well.

783
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,040
I guess a different free day where we got to, we're over on the land that was very empty

784
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,160
was, was pretty good.

785
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
I'm glad we didn't.

786
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,880
I'm glad we weren't there because if I'd been next to you and you had, he'd come out and

787
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:11,000
you had said Mario's daddy, I would have had to like, no, I'm with these guys.

788
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,360
I'm with ordinary adventures.

789
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,640
I'm a daddy too now.

790
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
Mario's daddy.

791
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,640
I'm a daddy too.

792
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,040
I believe, I think maybe he told the story here.

793
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:27,000
Anthony Gio once recognized a Shiguru Miyamoto and like Hollywood and Highland, it was during

794
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,640
an E3 and like went up to him and like, was like so excited to meet him.

795
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,640
Wow.

796
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
But this is like 10 years ago.

797
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,080
There's no way that's the first enthusiastic American who has just gone up to him.

798
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
100%.

799
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,760
I assume he has like a Donkey Kong style, like gorilla guard that swats away.

800
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,600
So annoying, a video game fan throws a barrel.

801
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
She's Gio running up.

802
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,680
How Highland just gets a Gio eats a barrel to the face.

803
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,760
He keeps an eye out for the nearest pits wherever he goes.

804
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Oh yeah.

805
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Yeah.

806
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:10,340
Um, I, another thing in this, the, um, we talked about the, I'm going to coin a phrase

807
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,660
and lack of a better one.

808
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,520
We talked about in runaway railway.

809
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,640
For me, it was the little chipmunk candle costumes from that Christmas short, uh, for

810
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,920
you as the lonesome ghosts.

811
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Yes.

812
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Yes.

813
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
The mirror, the, the stand.

814
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,800
Um, I'm going to, I'm going to call this the object gasp.

815
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,240
This is something, if it is a property that you care about, you were hopefully as with

816
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,120
their, you know, Millennium Falcon, the biggest full of object gasp.

817
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,940
And I had a big one.

818
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,640
My biggest one was the, I had to look up what it's called the Koopa clown car, which is

819
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,120
like the, the clown bowl with the little propeller on the bottom.

820
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,640
The Bowser flies around and at the end of three, Mario three, I think.

821
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,040
Super Mario world, I believe is the world is the first appearance of it.

822
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
Okay.

823
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Yeah.

824
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,560
Um, yeah, that I see one of those physicalized relief.

825
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,800
I mean, the land is full of stuff like that, but seeing, being in a small room, I think,

826
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,040
and, uh, and I'll throw Mike's term in intimacy.

827
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
That's right.

828
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,360
I had the intimacy feelings big time.

829
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,880
I had intimate feelings seeing the Koopa clown car and a big Mecha Koopa, the windup.

830
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
Oh yeah.

831
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
Yeah.

832
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,320
Like just, I don't, I'm not usually an object gasp kind of person.

833
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,000
There's not a ton of big IP where I like, Oh that, but these are, we've been seeing

834
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,880
these things our whole lives and you imagine how like, just like bright and vibrant.

835
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,920
And I mean, the only thing missing is that I couldn't hug them.

836
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,440
I know they're evil objects, but I wanted to hug them.

837
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,000
I feel like we could have, I guess you couldn't have touched it, but in my mind, I think you

838
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,600
could, I was like, Oh, it's close enough to do it, but I guess they probably don't want

839
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
you doing that.

840
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Weren't paying attention.

841
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:58,960
You could have, um, I guess elsewhere in the, um, you know, getting look moments of intimacy

842
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,680
with let's say characters who we've all, this time we got to do photo ops with Mario Luigi

843
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,160
and princess Peach.

844
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,480
I think I'm just going to set you up, Mike.

845
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,240
I know there was an aspect of these meet and greets that you were excited about.

846
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,280
So if you have any thoughts to share.

847
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Yes.

848
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Uh, yes.

849
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,880
So they, uh, Peach talked, I, which I like, this is not the main thing I'm going to talk

850
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,360
about here, uh, which is nice.

851
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,160
And like, it was all fun and the character faces look good.

852
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,920
The costumes look good.

853
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:37,520
All of the hair on the characters, the human hair didn't look real, but kind of looked

854
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
real.

855
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,280
Was that enough for you?

856
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:46,680
It was more than enough for me because you wish you could have their hair equal.

857
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
They had, yes.

858
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,920
They all had like seemingly like realistic human hair.

859
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,440
The Mario Luigi had realistic mustache hair.

860
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,880
It looked like it was sort of like very, like immaculately combed or something like the

861
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,480
mane of a pony, like a prize winning pony.

862
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,400
Like it looked like, I, I, maybe I'm describing it wrong, but all of a sudden, like when we're

863
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,000
taking the photo with the characters, I look over and I'm like, is it real?

864
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Is it hair?

865
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Is it hair?

866
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,200
If you do these photos, absolutely.

867
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,560
Just like, don't be so focused on the camera.

868
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:26,200
Turn to the side and get, get a close up look at this hair, which is it's, it's hair 2.0

869
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
as far as I'm concerned.

870
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Yeah.

871
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,320
We're all, we're all running up the back by not having hair as good as these mascots have.

872
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:42,760
What I like about the photo is that you two and Mario and Luigi are doing the like jump,

873
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
the punch in the air.

874
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,560
And I'm just, I've got a dipshit wave going on.

875
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:53,120
And I did have a moment where like the photographer said, power up.

876
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,640
And I thought that's just what, okay, they don't want to say smile.

877
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,660
They'll say something land appropriate.

878
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,880
And as soon as I did that, I was like, oh my God, are they doing the jump behind me?

879
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,080
That's all right.

880
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Everyone's you.

881
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,000
Most funny is, is knowing that I have heard that those Mario and Luigi heads are real

882
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,160
heavy and that visibility is low.

883
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,880
That real pony hair is really heavy that they use on the heads.

884
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Yeah.

885
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Seem like it.

886
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,400
Yeah, there's real, there's silver in there.

887
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:30,440
There's a little silver, you know, give it some life.

888
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,600
These people can only have, you can only be Luigi for two days or else the cancer risk

889
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,160
becomes so high.

890
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
Yeah.

891
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,000
The radiation on those things.

892
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,480
It's like the old movie monster makeup where it's like, oh no, how many times do you play

893
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,480
that character?

894
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Oh no.

895
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,320
It looks cool.

896
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,520
You know, and you want to be remembered for how you looked on the screen and not how you

897
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
died seven years later.

898
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Yeah.

899
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,680
So those were, those are really fun.

900
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,880
I mean, that's really fun.

901
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,960
We like to take photos with the characters, you know, that was nice to get to do that.

902
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,040
Again, yeah, you're going to have to wait probably a long time.

903
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
Yeah.

904
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,520
This is my only, that's the problem.

905
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,040
That's what I don't go back on from the, from our, our grouchiness the first time around

906
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,560
is that like, look, it is going to be tough.

907
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,960
I, and it's where you do wish that they had carved out more space for this and not created

908
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,800
this dense landscape of just like, there's eight things to do and eight very long lines.

909
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,440
It feels like, yeah, I mean, I go and know it's a space issue, but it feels like you

910
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,400
could have done like some little cat, like, cause the, uh, sorry, I'm thinking when you're

911
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,360
walking to the Bowser Jr thing, there's fun little hallways.

912
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,660
And if they had like a fun little hallway into like a less themed area that has more

913
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,480
character meet and greets and that had some seating and it wasn't as like impressive or

914
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,320
crazy as the, like the main part of the land.

915
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Sure.

916
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
It feels like stuff like that.

917
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,880
You're like, oh, that would have really moved the crowds around a little more of this open,

918
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,080
especially this opening summer, not just this one courtyard that can feel a little oppressive.

919
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,760
Like you, you're kind of anxious to get out of there and not certainly not to go wait

920
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,720
in another line in the one courtyard.

921
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
Yeah.

922
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,480
I am pretty used to theme park crowds at this point, but I think it's the being surrounded

923
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
by walls.

924
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,680
Like the crowds and the walls.

925
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,800
That was making me a little anxious.

926
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,760
I think it is like there's like, we were feeling like where, um, what was the, like, like we're

927
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,440
a hamster in a shoe box or something a little bit.

928
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,720
And there's like so many hamsters in the shoe box because the walls of Nintendo are so high

929
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,960
because they really do.

930
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,320
It makes you feel immersed immersed in there.

931
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,360
Like almost, I guess any other than like maybe Diagon Alley or something where Diagon Alley

932
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,280
is pretty much, you can't see outside of it.

933
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,000
But other than that, yeah, this one is smaller than that.

934
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,920
So you really feel like you're in a little shoe box.

935
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,520
But you know, actually you can see outside of the land because there is a problem with

936
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,400
the sight lines.

937
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,320
This land is a real problem with sight lines and we need to talk about it.

938
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,520
I mean, you can see the panels.

939
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,640
You can see the panels of the walls, they should paint over those, but you know.

940
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,840
Some of the other like, yeah, look, you can't get rid of the, like, do you want the land

941
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
or not?

942
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,760
The place they had for the land has a big universal skyscraper in there and they can't

943
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
get rid of that.

944
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,600
Hogwarts is in front of an NBC universal building.

945
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,840
Yeah, that one's worse.

946
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
You can see it.

947
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,200
That one actually is worse than some of this Nintendo stuff.

948
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,960
And also, well, here's let me go back to my situation with the grass.

949
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Oh, yeah.

950
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,640
I came around on the grass.

951
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,800
I ended up liking the grass.

952
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,320
Even if I share the opinion of the tweets, I if I don't like the tone of the tweets,

953
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,600
I still hate them.

954
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,760
I'd rather see somebody I disagreed with who wasn't being fucking annoying.

955
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,200
That's how I feel.

956
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,200
Actually the sight lines of sight.

957
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,640
Also, it's a comedy pod.

958
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,000
Go yell out what are the other million psycho theme park news websites that aren't supposed

959
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,800
to like another fight at the Magic Kingdom like, oh God.

960
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Yeah.

961
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,000
According to certain news sources, there are bloody drag out fights every single day in

962
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
every single theme park.

963
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah.

964
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,440
I, there's one more thing before we get to the land.

965
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,600
This a little bit of a also a sequel to the episode from two weeks ago.

966
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,800
There was another visit to the toadstool cafe.

967
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
That's correct.

968
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,760
Which gave Mike a choice.

969
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:45,960
Do we double down on the same behavior of the first round with the escape with the food?

970
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,920
Or do we just give it a go?

971
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Less people.

972
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,440
We try to have the toadstool food in the fun toadstool environment.

973
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
Yeah.

974
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
But what's more fun for this show?

975
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
That was, I got to see it in real time.

976
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,440
And I'm so glad you caught a little of it.

977
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
I was afraid you're going to miss it.

978
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Right on the tail end.

979
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,440
Yeah.

980
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,760
It was a little late, but I got there just as, as crucial decisions were being made.

981
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Yeah.

982
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,680
So I ordered soup from the toadstool cafe.

983
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,680
They had the-

984
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,680
The hollowed mushroom soup.

985
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,680
They had-

986
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,680
I bowed to Andrew Grissom, an apology.

987
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,960
They did have the soup.

988
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,240
But the short ribs while on the menu boards had already sold out.

989
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,640
The press loves their little short ribs.

990
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,200
Toad has not made enough of the little short ribs today.

991
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,920
The heated hallway is broken and we cannot bring your short ribs from the kitchen in

992
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,920
the long haul.

993
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,040
It could be lukewarm short ribs.

994
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,040
That's okay.

995
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,040
As warm as Chef Toad.

996
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,040
A special event, not judging.

997
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,320
No points deduct for the lack of short ribs.

998
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,120
Also probably shouldn't be eating short ribs at two o'clock in the afternoon.

999
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,760
At least it wasn't 11 though.

1000
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
It wasn't 11.

1001
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
Yeah.

1002
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,160
So you're 11 AM spaghetti with too many meatballs.

1003
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,360
Too many meatballs.

1004
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,640
What did you have for lunch that day?

1005
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,640
I skipped lunch.

1006
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,640
Okay.

1007
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,640
Cause you probably ate some.

1008
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,800
I ate a late breakfast and went, yeah.

1009
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,160
What was in my stomach was a little tiny candy bag from It's Sugar.

1010
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
Yes.

1011
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,200
You were texting me your It's Sugar as I was parking.

1012
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,080
I was in It's Sugar and I went, oh my God, they have, they have a little like cases of

1013
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,720
Pez like individual Pez you can put in the big bulk candy bag.

1014
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,720
Yeah.

1015
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,440
The fun of Pez without that pesky toy.

1016
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,120
Well, here's how I find out that you text candy stuff to Jason.

1017
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,120
Of course.

1018
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,120
And text Mandy stuff to Jason.

1019
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,120
He texts me candy stuff.

1020
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,400
So all we text each other X-Men shirts and candy stuff.

1021
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
Oh yeah.

1022
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,200
And some of these X-Men shirts.

1023
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,640
I found one I really liked and messaged the seller.

1024
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,120
I said how much?

1025
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,120
Oh yeah.

1026
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,120
I said $1,000.

1027
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,120
That's vintage.

1028
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,120
Fair enough.

1029
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,120
Fair enough.

1030
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,120
Everyone's got to make a living.

1031
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,120
I'd value it.

1032
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,120
If it were mine, I would value it at that too.

1033
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
Yeah.

1034
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
Yeah.

1035
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,080
So, so yeah, I ate a little candy, but then yes, I ordered the mushroom soup.

1036
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,480
Because again, as I revealed last time, big mushroom guy, a big, big mushroom guy.

1037
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,480
Oh yeah.

1038
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
That's right.

1039
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,480
So yeah, I ordered the mushroom soup.

1040
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,880
I ordered a, what's the lemon smash thing?

1041
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,880
What's it called?

1042
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,320
Oh, the honey lemon, lemon squash.

1043
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,720
Yes, the squash.

1044
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,720
Yes.

1045
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,480
And then I ordered the boba things in it.

1046
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,880
And then I got, what did I get?

1047
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,880
The dessert.

1048
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
I got the, not the-

1049
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
Did you get the tiramisu?

1050
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,880
Tiramisu.

1051
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,880
Tiramisu.

1052
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,880
Yeah.

1053
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,880
Yeah.

1054
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,880
That's right.

1055
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,880
So yeah.

1056
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:30,160
So I, here I tried, so here I tried to get ahead of it.

1057
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,760
I didn't want to be like on my heels trying to figure it out, playing defense.

1058
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,720
I want to play offense with the good people at the Toadstool Cafe.

1059
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,720
And I helped.

1060
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,320
So I asked, I immediately asked the person at the counter, I want, you know what?

1061
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,040
I'd like to eat this outside if it would be possible.

1062
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,320
Could we get, and then like she looked a little bit like, why are you talking to me about

1063
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,320
this?

1064
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,240
But she said, oh yeah, maybe we have, they could get like some sort of a to go thing.

1065
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,360
And I was like, I don't remember.

1066
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,160
But so then I asked again, there was a person who takes you to the table.

1067
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,840
Again, I was trying to stay on top of it.

1068
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,440
I asked this poor person, oh, by the way, I'm going to probably end up taking this.

1069
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,000
Cause you think, oh, oh yeah, we'll, we could get you a to go, whatever.

1070
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Everyone was just trying to pass the buck.

1071
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Everyone was really nice too.

1072
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Everyone was really nice.

1073
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Everyone was really nice.

1074
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I don't know where the, what is he talking about?

1075
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,400
No one has ever wanted to not eat in the silly cartoon.

1076
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,880
Why would you want to do that?

1077
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,120
The food isn't good enough to eat outside.

1078
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,520
What are you doing?

1079
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,320
So then a very, very, very nice like manager of the establishment.

1080
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,040
Like I got the sense that he had some sort of like official, like I'm just kind of monitoring

1081
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,280
the situation and making sure everyone's good and everyone feels like they're being taken

1082
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,280
care of or whatever.

1083
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,280
He was a really nice guy, a foot and a half tall, big mushroom for a head vest.

1084
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,560
Seemed a little overwhelmed, but it's okay.

1085
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,840
When he jumped, his legs kind of like went in the air.

1086
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,600
He like hovered there for a second and then he came back down and a big turtle captured

1087
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,240
him and you never saw him again.

1088
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,240
Yeah.

1089
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,440
Uh, but he made the big mistake of asking how we were doing.

1090
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,880
And I explained what I was looking forward to him.

1091
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,560
Well, the third person in the totes look, I was being nice.

1092
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
I don't think I was being rude.

1093
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,120
I was being self-deprecating as well to know that I knew this was a bit silly.

1094
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,200
And he was like, he's like trying to figure out like, Oh, you know what?

1095
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,480
We're not really, we're going to, we're going to work on getting a to go soup situation,

1096
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,920
but we don't really have that happening right now.

1097
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:27,760
Again, because if you don't know the soup come, this is the best display of food in

1098
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,760
the restaurant.

1099
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,360
It comes in like a, not ceramic, but like a sturdy feeling plastic.

1100
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,360
Yeah.

1101
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
Yeah.

1102
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,560
Like a big one, not one of the, the Mario mushroom.

1103
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,840
You get a big plastic toy to drink your soup out of, which is fun.

1104
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,600
It's a big Mario mushroom.

1105
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,760
But then he goes, he, he kind of, I forgot, I should have really remembered exactly what

1106
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,200
he said, but he goes, well, he goes, you know, we can get one of like cupcake to go.

1107
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,320
Hey, we can try the cupcake to go container, I guess, if you want.

1108
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,320
And I go, yes, thank you.

1109
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,320
That would be really great.

1110
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,320
He goes, okay.

1111
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,960
So he went to the back, he came out with it and boy, this worked like a charm.

1112
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,400
He did joke like we're not liable for this.

1113
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,400
Yes, he did.

1114
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
That's good.

1115
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,400
First hammer.

1116
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,480
And cause I was like, I think, I think the soup would probably fit in a to go box, but

1117
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,160
uh, well we were going to do like a regular to go box.

1118
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,760
You put like a hamburger in, which was really going to be messy.

1119
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,760
That was not going to be a good idea.

1120
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,800
It was a sturdy, it was pretty sturdy.

1121
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,640
Well yeah, but it was, but that's not what I think there was like, it wasn't just to

1122
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,240
go container, like a bigger.

1123
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:36,840
Each one of those kind of, um, uh, paper ones, kind of cardboard kind of card stock paper

1124
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,800
that the inside is a little glossy as like a coating.

1125
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,800
Sounds horrible.

1126
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,800
That one is still not super soup.

1127
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,800
That's insane.

1128
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,800
Also the wider you get to see it.

1129
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,520
It's like, the amazing one just brought like an Amazon box and put my soup in there.

1130
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,280
Uh, uh, so, so he brought the cupcake container, boy worked like a charm.

1131
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,740
I poured the soup right in there and I was like, yes.

1132
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:01,920
And then I took the drink and I took the Tierra missu and I took it outside every time I'm

1133
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,920
going to say it.

1134
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
So much worse.

1135
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,560
I don't think we're saying it right.

1136
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,560
Okay.

1137
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,560
Now we fixed it to Tierra missu.

1138
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,560
Say it like Edwin.

1139
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:17,040
Uh, uh, uh, and then, yeah, so I took it outside and I was just sitting with a to go cupcake

1140
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,200
container, drinking my delicious mushroom soup.

1141
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,360
Drinking.

1142
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,360
I was Ukraine.

1143
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,360
Take the spoons.

1144
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,320
So you're going to have a container sipping, sipping the soup.

1145
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,640
Now you said the word delicious.

1146
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,640
Yes.

1147
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,040
And I, um, I'll leave it to you to describe it.

1148
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,160
I didn't taste it so I couldn't say the look of the soup once put in the clear plastic

1149
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,160
container.

1150
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,520
Um, we made a little video and I think we say it in the video, but the, the look of

1151
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,600
this brown fluid was somewhere between gravy and vomit.

1152
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,320
I've eaten a lot of mushroom soups.

1153
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:02,560
I thought it was kind of par for the course, but I think it's the, that it's in a fun

1154
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,160
mushroom and then you remove it from that context.

1155
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,280
It was just this like brownish gray.

1156
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,200
It divorced of the fun.

1157
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
Yes.

1158
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,400
It looked pretty busy.

1159
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,300
This is something you would eat at a, at a bus station.

1160
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,680
It looks like, uh, uh, you're like, you've had a problem like with your stomach lately

1161
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,000
and you've been like puking a couple of times a day.

1162
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,460
So like here, we're going to give you a container to, to take a sample of your vomit.

1163
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,880
So it looks very clinical.

1164
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:32,080
It's like a clear plastic thing and it's like, yeah, like a grayish thing.

1165
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:36,680
They're like, you puke, okay, puke into this little plastic dish and then bring it in and

1166
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,000
we'll analyze it at the lab.

1167
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,360
I think you're being a little unfair to both vomit and soup.

1168
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,040
I've had a lot of experience with vomit and I can't say I've ever had gray one.

1169
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,560
Well, in my scenario, there's an issue.

1170
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,560
Oh, okay.

1171
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,040
Oh, I'm saying this is not gray.

1172
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
What color is your vomit?

1173
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,960
It's kind of like orange ish or sometimes the, uh, uh, biolish yellow.

1174
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,480
Orange always really?

1175
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,480
No, not always.

1176
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,840
I can't say I vomit.

1177
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,560
We're the ones a year at this age.

1178
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
You know, thankfully.

1179
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,560
No, no, no.

1180
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,120
Last time you puked.

1181
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,160
Um, great question.

1182
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,160
Maybe when I had COVID.

1183
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,160
Oh really?

1184
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,080
I think I got a little queasy.

1185
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,080
Okay.

1186
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:19,120
Um, uh, I do remember one time a few years ago where you were, uh, I was feeling ill

1187
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,900
and you said, oh, you should try zinc.

1188
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,880
So I went to write it and got zinc pills and I took it on an empty stomach and I vomited

1189
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,400
nearly immediately because I didn't know.

1190
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,720
Watch out for that.

1191
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,720
Yeah.

1192
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,360
So I, I eventually I would eat like a handful of Cheerios or crackers or something with

1193
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,680
it and I know it works for some people.

1194
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,320
I don't found it really worked for me.

1195
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,880
That's when you put the, uh, put your zinc tablets in that pes dispenser and you just

1196
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,880
kept popping them.

1197
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,880
It looks like Tweety Bird.

1198
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,640
Tweety Bird has betrayed me once again.

1199
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,240
You got the 12 zinc before you threw up.

1200
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,240
Wow.

1201
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,240
Uh, yeah.

1202
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,920
So, uh, did it, did it taste like gravy vomit?

1203
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,560
No, it tastes, it tasted like, like good Campbell's mushroom soup.

1204
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:10,280
It wasn't like, again, it wasn't like some sort of, uh, what delicacy type mushrooms.

1205
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,240
It was very much like solid canned soup.

1206
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,240
It's cream.

1207
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,240
It's thick.

1208
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,240
It's creamy.

1209
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:24,640
Uh, yeah, I would assume for outdoors, your lips, hot summer day, a good sipping on a

1210
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,640
soup.

1211
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,200
You know, we've all been there.

1212
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,840
You know, I never related to the, the John Mellencamp sucking on a chili dog, but sucking

1213
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,520
down some soup from a plastic container.

1214
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,240
Now that's my summer.

1215
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,240
That's my summer.

1216
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,240
I heard loud coins go off in all directions.

1217
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,240
Yeah.

1218
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,560
So, uh, I liked the soup.

1219
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,400
I thought the soup was good.

1220
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,960
Um, quick service soup was good.

1221
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960
Okay.

1222
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:55,000
Well, now that we've described the quick service soup and recounted some of Jason's zinc vomit

1223
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,360
memories, I think we are now ready to talk about Mario Kart Bowser's challenge.

1224
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,160
This is the big ticket item at the land.

1225
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:11,800
Uh, it's the, it's the big ride, the only ride in, in this version and, uh, woof, where

1226
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,320
to, I don't know where to begin.

1227
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:21,760
I am now worried that the positivity cliff that we are precariously on will suddenly

1228
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,760
decay.

1229
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,760
If you go, okay.

1230
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,600
Well, if you glance at the reception section on Wikipedia, like it's like it says, like

1231
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,600
there's a reception.

1232
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,600
Really?

1233
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Yeah.

1234
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Okay.

1235
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,160
It has already gotten, and I was very shocked to find one of my, uh, you know, criticisms,

1236
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,280
uh, their criticisms for this and some other rides.

1237
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,280
Oh, okay.

1238
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,920
I'll be with that in the, in the, in the name of positivity.

1239
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,920
Sure.

1240
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,920
I'll let us build up to it.

1241
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:51,960
I will also say in the name of positivity, excited in the line, excited on the ride,

1242
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:57,440
laughing and giggling on the ride, got off the ride, smiling up a storm.

1243
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,440
That is, that was my reaction.

1244
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,440
Sure.

1245
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:06,400
And I will say listeners go on this ride, have a fun time on this ride, but I think

1246
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,440
maybe the more your thoughts spin around.

1247
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,440
Your expectations is the nice way to say it.

1248
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,440
Yeah.

1249
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,440
Yeah.

1250
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
Okay.

1251
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,120
The queue and all the stuff is amazing.

1252
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,120
So great.

1253
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,840
Let's be, let's be positive here.

1254
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,840
Oh, great.

1255
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,840
So good.

1256
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,080
That big statue of King Koopa, Bowser right at the start.

1257
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,080
Really good.

1258
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:33,520
I just like everything they made into a practical statue effect picture is per like truly like

1259
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,520
perfect.

1260
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,520
Yeah.

1261
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,200
And really exciting to see your dream taken from your dreams.

1262
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:44,080
Oh, and kind of like environments that you don't get to see.

1263
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,480
Like they're, they're, they're, they're inventing stuff in there in the ride.

1264
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,800
There's things that are more directly from a video game, but I don't maybe now forgive

1265
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,800
me.

1266
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,960
I'm no Mario expert and I've, I'm maybe not caught up with some of the last few games,

1267
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:02,240
but it seemed new to me to be in some kind of Bowser office in which he is plotting,

1268
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:08,400
where you get a sense of the method behind the madness and you see the blueprints for

1269
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,860
bullet bills and some of the things that he attacks the Mario and Luigi with.

1270
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:20,360
And you see like his, uh, uh, uh, schedules and appointments like have lunch with Iggy

1271
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,640
and Roy.

1272
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:27,720
Like that you, because you sort of, it is funny to think about Bowser being the, uh,

1273
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:33,560
mentor of a lot of the bad guys or just the person corralling a lot of the bad guys.

1274
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,760
And this feels like being in the office of a very important man.

1275
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,760
Yeah.

1276
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,760
Yes.

1277
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,760
Which is, yes.

1278
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,760
Fun.

1279
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,800
I actually, maybe that is referenced somewhere and I'm forgetting what it is, but that is

1280
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,800
very fun.

1281
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:51,680
All of it is really like just feels like it was made with like the most, I don't know,

1282
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,680
care.

1283
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:57,520
That sounds stupid, but the most like, uh, uh, I don't know, perfect recreations, I guess

1284
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,520
right.

1285
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,520
Which is what I've already said.

1286
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,760
I still believe though, I, I have many times said, I think universal has taken the lead

1287
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:11,200
in terms of spending and, uh, uh, you know, and really that they've done really grand

1288
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,640
attractions lately while Disney's kind of like dressing up photo opportunities and stuff.

1289
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,520
I think they're taking the baton a lot of ways, but universal Hollywood still remains

1290
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,920
low and immersive environments.

1291
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:28,240
I'm like, I got to take a thousand pictures kind of environments and, uh, this is that

1292
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,240
big tie.

1293
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,240
Everything's aligned.

1294
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,240
Yeah.

1295
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:37,000
Every bit the equal of, of runaway railway in terms of so much to look at and fix that

1296
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
on.

1297
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,760
But the ride itself, I don't, I don't, I don't like it that much.

1298
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,760
Yeah.

1299
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,760
I'm sorry.

1300
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,760
Yeah.

1301
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,760
This is such, okay.

1302
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,240
The reason this is, and it's not just because last time we, maybe we felt like we were

1303
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:55,400
negative or something, the reason it's so hard for me to say this is because doing Mario

1304
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,840
Kart is a dream, a childhood dream.

1305
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,040
It's I and everything else leading up to it.

1306
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,080
You can tell the passion, the love of all of it, the work that went into it.

1307
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:14,880
And even the ride itself, I feel like effort and money went into this brand new technology.

1308
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,240
You feel like the F like you feel the effort.

1309
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,880
It's like the love guru.

1310
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:25,280
You felt the effort in that movie and things that we love.

1311
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,280
It's the effort.

1312
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,280
You feel it.

1313
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,760
You know, this guy, you know, Mike, you know, creative tried, like they were trying to do

1314
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,760
something.

1315
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,760
I like it.

1316
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,760
Yes.

1317
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,760
And you're like, I'm going in here, babe.

1318
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,720
This is going to be my favorite thing to love guru.

1319
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,040
It's going to be my favorite thing.

1320
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,040
And okay.

1321
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,920
Then maybe this is not completely a fair comparison as far as quality level of movie quality of

1322
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,920
the ride.

1323
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,000
There's no sitar version of extremes more than words.

1324
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,760
It's not a similar thing.

1325
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,400
It's not the quality levels are not the same, but it Bowser's kind of like, you know, Republic

1326
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,280
cereal level super villain.

1327
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,040
He's not a nuanced character like guru tug at my foot.

1328
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,840
He's not like guru tug at my poota.

1329
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,840
Yes.

1330
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,840
I completely agree.

1331
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
You know what?

1332
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,840
Toad gets punished.

1333
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:13,000
He gets flattened by that thwomp much in the same way that similar similarly diminutive

1334
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,280
verntroyer the hockey coaches made the subject of physical violence.

1335
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,480
No love guru.

1336
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,080
Poor verntroyer gets the shit kicked out of him and love guru for some weird reason.

1337
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,080
It is so funny.

1338
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,080
I, I, we might've said this before, but we can't.

1339
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,640
I'm sure as far as two and three celebrating, having fun with this.

1340
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,640
And now love guru would just fuck him up.

1341
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,640
It's so mean.

1342
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,400
Make fun of how he's over and over again.

1343
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,960
Anyway, but we're talking about the ride.

1344
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,960
That's right.

1345
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,160
So that's, so that's really the reason.

1346
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:46,520
It's not that I feel like I have to make good for the thing, the last episode we did, but

1347
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,080
I I'm still holding out hope that like, I'm going to like it.

1348
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,920
I'm still, we're going to go.

1349
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,920
I've talked to a few people and the people that like it seem like, you know, by ride

1350
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:03,320
10, you know, you get, cause like I can, that's even what I was saying earlier, or it's like

1351
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,120
going a lot and doing it like, okay, you'll know all the ins and outs.

1352
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,920
Now you'll see that like you're collecting coins and that's fun and you'll get on the

1353
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,280
leaderboard and that's fun.

1354
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,640
And now you know everything to do and you know exactly how it works because there's

1355
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,360
a lot to this ride that I didn't know anything about.

1356
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,240
That's kind of confusing.

1357
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,240
You're being prompted.

1358
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,880
Cause we should, we should step back.

1359
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,600
You're the ride is like, you're in a big go-kart.

1360
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:36,240
You put on like a fun Mario plastic hat and you attach AR goggles to it, which then you

1361
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,880
go on like a dark ride, um, which are the Mario Kart levels.

1362
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,400
And then in the AR glasses, you see the other racers like all of the Koopa Troopa stuff

1363
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:52,160
and cartoon characters and other effects and onscreen prompts and graphics.

1364
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,160
The main, your steering wheel gives you two main abilities.

1365
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,760
One being to turn when they, when there's arrows and they tell you to turn and the other

1366
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:08,040
being firing shells, so you're firing shells with these prompts and characters and a ton

1367
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,440
going on in those goggles.

1368
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,760
Yeah, a lot going on.

1369
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,440
I think maybe I'll say this, maybe too many shell.

1370
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:22,000
Like it to me at some point I was like, I feel like I'm not, I feel like I'm in a shooter

1371
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,360
game now.

1372
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,120
Like the driving became secondary to blasting people's shells.

1373
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,260
Like imagine the first part of the Cars Land ride, car, radiator Springs racer.

1374
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,960
It's going slower.

1375
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,320
You have goggles on and you also have to like, it are pretty rapid pace shoot shells at Mater

1376
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,320
and the other car.

1377
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,320
Oh, not Mater.

1378
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,980
Well, maybe Mater other different cars.

1379
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:49,080
So you're kind of watching this digital video game on your goggles and then there's a real

1380
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:56,800
life set behind you and it doesn't, my brain wasn't accepting these two realities as one

1381
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,520
it was after a couple of rides.

1382
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,200
Blended together for, yeah.

1383
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:10,960
I will give it this credit that when there are, there are big physical items and characters

1384
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,280
in all of these rooms.

1385
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,280
Yes.

1386
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,920
Like you get a piranha plant and you get the chain chomp and it's cool to see those and

1387
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,840
you know the difference between what's in your goggles and those things, but there's

1388
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:29,720
also screen effects here and there and characters that appear, you know, huge characters that

1389
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:33,640
appear via screen primarily in that first ride.

1390
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:38,920
I was like, I'm not exactly sure what's in the room and what's in the goggles now very

1391
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:44,520
clear to me, but I, it is such a, an overload of visual information, which again, the first

1392
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,840
time I was like laughing a lot just at how much it was.

1393
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,640
And I was kind of surprised to look at ride throughs and go, Oh no, that was, that was

1394
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,640
on the wall.

1395
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,640
That's in the room.

1396
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,720
This was only in the gut.

1397
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:00,440
So I, at times it all fused together in a way that worked for me.

1398
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,440
Cause yeah.

1399
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,880
So you're going, so yeah, you're going through a dark ride and there's like, you know, imagine

1400
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,840
like a, the haunted house in Mario Kart or whatever.

1401
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,320
And it's like, the set looks perfect.

1402
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,220
The practical set is real.

1403
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:17,200
And then you're like seeing like, yeah, you're, you're watching like part of a virtual boy

1404
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,480
on these glasses while it's happening.

1405
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,620
And then after that, after that you'll kind of stop by a big screen and they'll be like

1406
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:28,160
Bowser on it and you shoot shells.

1407
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,280
So like that stuff to me works a little better.

1408
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:35,280
Cause you're not, your brain is just looking at one thing versus trying to balance out

1409
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,520
a video game and the sets.

1410
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,520
Yeah.

1411
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:46,960
And the, the confusion that comes from turning and moving and watching the characters that

1412
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,480
are doing mostly the same thing overlaid, but it's still a little jumpy.

1413
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,480
Yeah.

1414
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:58,120
I mean, I definitely, I think a lot of people have been on this ride have been deep into

1415
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,320
the ride and off the ride and going like, did I do it right?

1416
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,240
Did I have the goggles on?

1417
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,320
That's what I'm saying.

1418
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,600
It's a little like that.

1419
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,600
That's it.

1420
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,600
That's how it's supposed to look.

1421
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,600
Yeah.

1422
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,720
It's, it's a little, uh, well, in addition to that, I think Jane and I got off the ride

1423
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,920
was like, I'm a little dizzy.

1424
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,920
Like I don't.

1425
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,920
Yeah.

1426
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:23,480
I found my focus would go be, I would either be focusing on the set or it'd be focusing

1427
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,280
on the, the AR.

1428
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,280
Yeah, it doesn't.

1429
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,280
Yeah.

1430
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:33,520
I think a lot of this stuff we're seeing lie and we're, we are the beta testing.

1431
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,920
This is a generation one.

1432
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,320
This is a PlayStation one.

1433
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,800
And maybe you're saying maybe a ride down the road cracks the road.

1434
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:45,800
I think, I think, yeah, it, it might, I don't know if they just jump.

1435
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:51,400
Like I really like toy story mania and sometimes I have a lot of fun on a buzz late your Astro

1436
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,400
blasters.

1437
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:58,480
Um, but I feel like this, uh, spider-man, uh, web slingers, I feel like is simpler than

1438
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
this.

1439
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:04,880
Like he tells you, like how to do this, but you know, the room where they're explaining

1440
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:12,440
to you what you're going to do is very, there's a lot of screens, there's sets, um, there's

1441
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,320
fake like a racing outfits and stuff.

1442
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,760
And I happen to like focus on the one screen and Jane was still looking around and she's

1443
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,760
like, what do I, what do I do?

1444
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,520
Like I was like, oh, it's all info.

1445
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:30,080
I was, and I was like, okay, I think, I think they're probably going to show us how to do

1446
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,320
this three more times of where you get on the ride.

1447
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,000
And sure enough, that was the case.

1448
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,840
So like they did repeat it a lot.

1449
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:43,120
Um, and I'm sure the infographics are, are helpful, um, with international travelers

1450
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,480
as well, where it's like, oh, no one's speaking English, but it also was very busy.

1451
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,480
Infographics.

1452
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,240
I think you can feel that it's, it must be the same video as in the Japanese version

1453
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:59,120
because it's, it's very Ikea manual or like, let's, let's say as few words as positive.

1454
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,680
Is there any, are there any words in the video?

1455
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,920
I mean, there's word, there's like titles on screen here and there, but I think they

1456
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:09,640
made those animations to work anywhere, which is smart for that reason.

1457
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,120
But then you're left a little confused about specifics.

1458
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,200
It's really the, it's the anti guardians of the galaxy.

1459
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,200
Yes.

1460
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,200
Like here is all the information and backstory in the world.

1461
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,200
The anti David Danipour.

1462
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:26,640
You can ride without ever thinking about the hands thing, you know, you can just like,

1463
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,160
oh, I stumbled into this thing and they're here, you know, um, this you kind of need

1464
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,160
to know.

1465
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,640
You kind of, you're not exactly sure which information to do this.

1466
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:39,480
It's a lot of information and, um, eventually got it.

1467
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,480
I think reading about it after they're like, and each car works together.

1468
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,800
And I was like, I didn't know I was supposed to be working together.

1469
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,880
Yeah, I thought I had to get to a hundred shells or a hundred coins.

1470
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,680
And I think everybody individually has to get to a hundred, but you all do, but you

1471
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:01,800
all do, which I didn't realize cause a Bowser one-handedly when we did it.

1472
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,800
Oh really?

1473
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,920
I don't remember on mine and yeah.

1474
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:11,920
So if, yeah, if, if team Mario wins, cause this is like a, it's a general challenge that's

1475
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,120
been issued by Bowser to everybody who's getting us.

1476
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,600
So you're on team Mario.

1477
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,560
So you're on the good guy's side, not the bad guy's side.

1478
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,040
Uh, if it says team Mario at the end, then you won.

1479
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,760
If it's team Bowser, then you, you didn't, I honestly don't recall.

1480
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,920
It seems probable that we lost.

1481
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,320
Uh, um, boy, one thing I, let me, let me just really say.

1482
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:36,880
And if you didn't get this already from me mentioning that 220 minute wait, this is,

1483
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,880
this is a single rider.

1484
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:42,160
If there ever was one, you missed some cool rooms, but like you'll see, come back and

1485
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,600
see them in a couple of years.

1486
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,160
I think you would be psychotic to do.

1487
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,600
I liked the guy, I liked the queue, everything I saw the queue.

1488
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,320
I think you'd be crazy to do that long of a queue.

1489
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:57,940
And also I don't think this rewards you being in the same car as your party.

1490
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:03,960
Because like, you should only do this if you have children, if you're a guardian to people

1491
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,560
who need to be in the car with you.

1492
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,760
Otherwise, if you can split up, split up.

1493
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,760
It does not matter.

1494
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:13,260
And I say that because like, sure, maybe you could celebrate, Hey, we did it.

1495
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:16,040
If you're in the car with who you came with.

1496
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,440
Uh, but not really because you have big clunky goggles.

1497
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:24,600
You know, you literally can't, if you're, you know, if your mom's in the row in front

1498
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,920
of you, she can't turn back and look at you because she's got a big clunky thing on her

1499
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,920
head.

1500
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:34,200
I actually heard this from a neighbor who went and they're like a little anxious on

1501
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:39,760
the ride because it couldn't tell if they're like child, like six or eight was like freaking

1502
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:50,040
out as you know, it was hard to like just look over and check on them because, uh, even

1503
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,800
I didn't think like, let me try taking out the AR.

1504
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,200
I think one of you said you tried like Scott.

1505
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,560
Well again, and I feel like I'm falling right into what Mike was saying.

1506
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,280
We're like, you're getting the reviews of the 10 time visitors.

1507
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,680
We're saying, well, if you do this and if you know this is good.

1508
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:10,240
My review was I liked it more the second time without the AR, the point of the ride, like

1509
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,360
what the whole thing is designed around.

1510
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:16,640
And I did like it because I just, I just wanted to know what was in the rooms and I wanted

1511
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,080
to see a chain chomp without all this stuff.

1512
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,640
I wanted to see the, you get a thwomp outside.

1513
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:25,320
I keep talking about how I like seeing a thwomp, but I really like seeing this one in this

1514
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:32,840
room with an animated face with a screen face, uh, uh, piranha plants, the amazing, um, the

1515
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,600
especially and I looked at, I, you want to say it's Luigi's mansion, but it's actually

1516
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,600
twisted mansion.

1517
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,240
A lot of, uh, most of this stuff is kind of pulled from Mario Kart eight.

1518
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:45,160
I didn't realize, um, except for rainbow road, which is N 64.

1519
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,920
So it's a little bit of a mix, but twisted mansion is the level and it looks that one

1520
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:55,480
especially you're like, I'm so glad the clutter is out of the way because twisted mansion,

1521
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:00,900
it's this like, you know, it's this optical illusion set where it's bending all crazy

1522
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:04,320
and the screen in the back makes it look like it's an infinite hallway that's bending in

1523
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,900
an impossible way.

1524
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,160
And there's chandeliers swinging back and forth and that room, especially I'm like,

1525
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:14,420
I'm so glad I'm just looking at this without a bunch of graphics, not letting me appreciate

1526
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:17,040
the great set design work.

1527
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:24,040
It's like you're driving in your car and like a couple like characters like got on your

1528
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,720
windshield and they won't like, if somebody put like pictures on your windshield of the

1529
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,600
Mario characters while you're driving, you're like, what the hell?

1530
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:39,200
Wipers on you're like, I'm trying to see what the wipers are smearing it more than help.

1531
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,200
Yeah.

1532
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,200
So we put like a big decal.

1533
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,320
So we put like moving decals on your window or you're driving.

1534
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,320
You're like, I'm trying.

1535
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,320
What?

1536
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,320
Am I hallucinating?

1537
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:53,720
I, yeah, I, well, it's kind of like in Mario Kart when you get squitted on and now you

1538
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,120
can't see what happens in this.

1539
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:01,480
I actually pull that effect off pretty good, but it's like an entire game of being squitted

1540
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,720
on you get squitted on.

1541
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,720
Yes.

1542
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:09,920
I don't would be the word, but I went with squitted and it's fun.

1543
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:10,920
Squitted.

1544
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,920
Yeah.

1545
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,920
I don't know.

1546
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,840
I mean, maybe the AR goggles, but like with less like a digital characters and carts just

1547
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,640
constantly in your vision, absolutely.

1548
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,640
You know what?

1549
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,360
Make it feel more like an early Mario Kart where there's a, there's a few, cause the,

1550
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:32,760
cause the further you get, they are chaos and it's great.

1551
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:38,200
That's the appeal of, I love every, I've said, this is the only video game franchise I've

1552
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,200
kept it.

1553
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:44,040
I love every Mario Kart, no matter what, and I love that they're crazy as hell, but I kind

1554
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:49,240
of want, Hey, let's go, think about this thing about back to the future, the ride, how the

1555
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:54,720
whole idea of it was you got, it's one car, it's Biff so you can focus on Biff and then

1556
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,160
you don't end up nauseous because you have a focal point.

1557
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:03,280
I think maybe that what if you're after Bowser only and you just, and the chaos comes from

1558
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:08,000
what's around you and not like, yeah, there's 20 characters at all.

1559
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,560
It's a little overwhelming.

1560
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:14,560
Maybe another character every now and then, but I think like, have like, have a little

1561
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,000
randomized video at the beginning and it's like, you are toe.

1562
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,080
Like I was like, wait, are we just us?

1563
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,000
We're not one of, wait, hold on.

1564
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Yeah.

1565
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,040
We're just four humans on a kind of regular car.

1566
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,040
Yeah.

1567
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,040
We're just here.

1568
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:32,200
We're on the, we're on the base car from Mario Kart eight is what I found out.

1569
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:36,720
If you don't customize and pick all of the kooky vehicles that you have at the beginning

1570
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:42,720
or that you unlock as it goes on, you know what everyone wants to be in the first car

1571
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:46,640
old, you always, you want to be Mario and you want to have basic car.

1572
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,640
You don't want to have all the crazy flying.

1573
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:54,200
I think that's a big, like think about just how excited you are at the mirror.

1574
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:58,600
You're on the snow white ride and Oh look, I'm bashful this time.

1575
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,680
I'm sleepy this time.

1576
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:06,240
If it was different ride vehicles, you just that.

1577
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:10,600
That's a more exciting, different every time than the interactive element.

1578
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,600
Yeah.

1579
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:17,600
I think the randomization, like the randomizations on the two guardians attractions now at this

1580
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,600
point.

1581
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:23,960
Um, and I of course can't think of any others, but let's say guardians, uh, mission breakout,

1582
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,480
the knowing there's a different song, you don't know what song you're going to get.

1583
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,360
I think that's more fun.

1584
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:35,040
Like I think that's more fun than most gamification then like, yes, then you're in control of

1585
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:39,280
all these thousand things that don't really add up to anything as opposed to the, just

1586
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,160
the impact of, I got me with your best shot this time.

1587
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,160
Yeah.

1588
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,360
You've waited in line for a while.

1589
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,760
Get ready to do some tasks.

1590
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,760
My man.

1591
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,760
Yeah.

1592
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:49,760
Yeah.

1593
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,760
I don't know kids.

1594
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,360
Like, do we know, do kids like this?

1595
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,720
Maybe we're old.

1596
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:58,480
Maybe we're some old guys saying like not getting it or our brains are too slow.

1597
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:02,440
Let well my counter to that is this.

1598
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,440
All right.

1599
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,760
Kids like playing video games.

1600
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,660
They want to be in control.

1601
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:10,240
So we've created this video game like experience where they can control everything.

1602
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:15,040
Uh, sort of where you control, you don't control the speed or the path, but you control some

1603
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,960
of the things going on in your goggles.

1604
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,000
So your control is what?

1605
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
25%.

1606
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,820
You know what you have 100% control of Mario Kart, the video game, which I think a kid

1607
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:27,780
would rather do.

1608
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:32,600
You know, this literally gives you less of the Mario Kart experience than Mario Kart.

1609
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,920
Well, look, when I said, you know, are we too old for this?

1610
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,240
I look, that was kind of rhetorical.

1611
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,920
I know we're young guys at heart.

1612
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,920
Okay.

1613
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,760
We can, we would be right in this if the kids loved it and the kids got it.

1614
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,240
I was just trying to be nice and trying to act like we maybe we're trying to be philosophical,

1615
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,080
but no, we're smart and young.

1616
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,080
That's the thing.

1617
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,160
So we would know if this were to young and we, and especially you Mike, get what teams

1618
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,160
are into.

1619
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,160
Thank you.

1620
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,160
Yeah.

1621
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,160
Yeah.

1622
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,160
You know what?

1623
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,720
I was in hot topic before when I was, was waiting for Jason at city walk.

1624
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,400
That's the, that is the primary way to tell.

1625
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,400
Sorry.

1626
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,720
And that's the big thing, Mike.

1627
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,720
You're still cool.

1628
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:08,720
You know, I am still cool.

1629
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,720
Thank you.

1630
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,720
You know what?

1631
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:14,580
Speaking of, I forgot to tell this anecdote at the hot topic at city walk, zoo TV pops

1632
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,120
were on sale edge.

1633
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:22,360
Adam and Larry were on sale, but not Bono as the fly.

1634
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,360
So I was so excited.

1635
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,400
Cause it's like, so many teens had bought it.

1636
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,660
No, no.

1637
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:28,660
So I got so excited.

1638
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:29,920
I go, Oh my God, zoo TV.

1639
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,840
You too pops are on sale.

1640
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,880
I think it's like buy one, get one for a dollar.

1641
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,320
I go, I'm going to get all four of these.

1642
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,320
It's going to be $20.

1643
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,280
It's going to be like making out like a bandit here.

1644
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,240
And then I was like, Oh no, where's the fly?

1645
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,240
Where is he?

1646
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,260
And I went over to the regular priced pop section at the hot topic at sea walk.

1647
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:50,440
And there he was up on the regular sale shelf, the fly.

1648
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,240
So I'd have to pay regular prices and then it wouldn't even work.

1649
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,740
Cause it was buy one, get one for a dollar.

1650
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:56,740
It wouldn't have added up.

1651
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:58,280
I'd have to get two Larry Mullen juniors.

1652
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,400
Well, I don't believe that you don't have an alert set up on your phone to get like

1653
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,800
a discount fly, uh, funko elsewhere.

1654
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,880
I do, but it hasn't popped up yet.

1655
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,880
Oh, okay.

1656
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,880
But this is what I'm saying.

1657
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:11,880
I'm in hot topic.

1658
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,920
I'm looking at the deals that the young people see.

1659
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:14,920
Okay.

1660
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,920
Okay.

1661
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:21,280
The ultimate landscape where young people go to share ideas about what is cool and what

1662
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,440
will be cool next.

1663
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,440
That's right.

1664
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:30,200
I saw a Funko pops of twisted the, the clown based rap group that were like kind of on

1665
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,520
ICPs label, I think that maybe have been around for 20.

1666
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,320
They were on the psychopathic records family.

1667
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:39,320
I believe twisted was in the psychopathic records family.

1668
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,920
So I saw that, but yeah, young people like me.

1669
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,360
You know, if Michigan is to be believed, then young people, if young people in Michigan are

1670
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:52,200
excited about insane clown posse, therefore it must be true in the rest of the country.

1671
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,200
Yes.

1672
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,200
I mean, I'm not there.

1673
01:16:54,200 --> 01:17:00,000
I mean, look, we joke about a hot topic and Spencer's gifts are probably keeping malls

1674
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
alive.

1675
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,200
I'd never see, I never see those closed.

1676
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,640
I'd like to say, could we all just agree?

1677
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:07,640
Thank you.

1678
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,640
Hot topic.

1679
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,640
Thank you.

1680
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,640
Hot topic.

1681
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,840
Cause they, they've changed with the times, you know, they're from when we were younger,

1682
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:16,040
but they still are very relevant to the kids.

1683
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,840
That's how I feel connected to the youth.

1684
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,840
Oh, sure.

1685
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,840
And Spencer's.

1686
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,840
We all do.

1687
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,480
Spencer's has so many like sex stuff.

1688
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,480
Spencer's has had a lot of lives.

1689
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,480
Spencer's has changed a lot over the years.

1690
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,080
The Spencer's in the Galleria.

1691
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,600
It's just like there's a whole wall of sex stuff in there.

1692
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,520
I hope that you're not implying that one of the things that teens are into is sex.

1693
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,240
Well, I would never, they shouldn't be.

1694
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,240
I wasn't.

1695
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:41,600
So they shouldn't be either.

1696
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:47,920
There's one constant, whether you're a teen in the nineties or today, you don't like sex.

1697
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,920
Same deal.

1698
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:53,320
We did, when we were in Japan, we did Mario Kart VR.

1699
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,240
Lindsay and I did it and it was awesome.

1700
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,240
And it was the same one.

1701
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,760
I think there was like touring around here.

1702
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,360
There was, I forget where it was.

1703
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:04,520
I didn't go here, but we did it in Japan and it was awesome.

1704
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,920
It was like people were shrieking, like the size, like the scope of everything.

1705
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:12,200
Like when you were in there, it just felt like such better VR than I had ever done before.

1706
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:16,160
And you were in a little chair with the steering wheel.

1707
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,320
And I remember, I think it was a big chain shop and Lindsay, like it came out as Lindsay

1708
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,040
like shrieked and we're like, this was incredible.

1709
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,800
And I'm sorry, this was, what is the, is it all in the helmet?

1710
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,800
Is it all in the helmet?

1711
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,800
Yeah.

1712
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,040
So it was just, yeah, completely digitally rendered like a regular Mario Kart.

1713
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,040
It looked.

1714
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:37,000
But you're in a car and it's so the car that you're steering is combined with.

1715
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,860
So you're sitting in a seat that looks kind of like a car and you've got a steering wheel.

1716
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:44,440
This was in like an arcade or a VR kind of place.

1717
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:48,000
Okay, I was just making sure you weren't driving through the street.

1718
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,760
It was not because I went to that.

1719
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,240
That's not in the, I don't think you went to Joypolis.

1720
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,800
I don't, I don't believe cause that's on there.

1721
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,520
That was on this like little Island almost.

1722
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,520
Okay.

1723
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,520
What am I thinking of something else then?

1724
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,120
I'm trying to remember what the name of the place was.

1725
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,560
It was all VR stuff.

1726
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,560
Yeah.

1727
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,560
It was a Sega thing.

1728
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:06,400
Maybe it was a, I forget what the name of it was, but it was all enclosed.

1729
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,400
If it was a Sega thing, you got to boot up that apology.

1730
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,600
So wait, well, it wouldn't have been a, what are we saying?

1731
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,600
It wouldn't have been a Sega thing.

1732
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,560
You're right, you're right.

1733
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,160
Why am I getting this confused then?

1734
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,160
A tentative piece.

1735
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,160
I got to look where that is.

1736
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,160
Tentative piece for Smash Brothers.

1737
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:23,440
Well, you know, Sega and Nintendo now are, they are a little more, you know, together.

1738
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:26,520
But there's Mario Olympic games that nobody likes.

1739
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,520
That's right.

1740
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,520
They've done one of those a year.

1741
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,280
I've never played a Sonic and Mario game.

1742
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:35,520
I have pictures from when I was little that I drew of the two of them, Mario and Sonic

1743
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,360
getting along and going on adventures together.

1744
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,960
I was so obsessed with this idea.

1745
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,320
You dreamed of a better world.

1746
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,760
And I would dream of the game.

1747
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,360
I would almost do not do it in anything that was in depth as far as game design.

1748
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:50,600
But I used to imagine what the game would be like of Sonic and Mario.

1749
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,840
And it was not them competing in the Olympic games.

1750
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:59,240
In the real cities where the Olympics were held.

1751
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:00,240
Yeah.

1752
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:04,360
That was not, it was maybe got a little more fantastical than with Nagano or whatever.

1753
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:07,760
I was like, Oh, Mario's going to fight, you know, Dr. Robotnik.

1754
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:08,760
Oh, that's going to be cool.

1755
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,760
And the Sonic will have to fight.

1756
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,920
I'm like thinking of this and then I was not thinking.

1757
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,480
And then like Tails will throw the javelin.

1758
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,480
Tails will throw the shot put.

1759
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:17,960
Like that was not part of it.

1760
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,840
And they still have yet to do.

1761
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,840
I don't know.

1762
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,800
I wonder if that's even on the table, but you would think that at a certain point that

1763
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:29,960
would have been the big, the big ticket item was to team them up in like an ultimate platforming

1764
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:30,960
game.

1765
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:31,960
Team them up.

1766
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:32,960
Everyone wins.

1767
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:33,960
What if they switch powers for a level or two?

1768
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,960
Fantastic idea.

1769
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,120
Mario goes fast and Sonic's got to go slow.

1770
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,040
Mario's got to take all his clothes off and he grows like little spines.

1771
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,440
Whoa, he's got to look like Sonic.

1772
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,440
This is what?

1773
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,440
This is what a year thing.

1774
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,560
Mario just wearing Sonic's shoes, no clothes.

1775
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:55,720
He kind of grows like flesh colored, like whatever the porcupine like spines or whatever

1776
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:56,720
you call it.

1777
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:57,720
No, well Knuckles has spines.

1778
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,560
Why did you, why did you make my nice idea all nasty?

1779
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,520
I mean it's better because he looks like Sonic.

1780
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:09,080
This is what happens to your brain when you don't like sex earlier in your life.

1781
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,400
It reroutes into strange places.

1782
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,480
But then Sonic puts on the overalls and he gets a mustache.

1783
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,480
Sonic wears a mustache.

1784
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,080
And it's got that voluminous hair.

1785
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:25,680
It's show pony hair that Sonic's wearing under his snout.

1786
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:31,480
So that's, yes, that, but it was not, it was not competing in the freestyle swimming.

1787
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,200
It was trading clothes.

1788
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,960
Do they trade clothes next to each other?

1789
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,600
Do they watch each other change clothes?

1790
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,640
Yes, they do watch.

1791
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:43,120
You watch it and there's a prompt that you do participate.

1792
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:48,320
You like hit the A button and you take off the overalls and then you hit B and you pass

1793
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:52,680
them to Sonic and he struggles to get them on and he gives his shoes.

1794
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,680
I like.

1795
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,320
It's nothing erotic about it.

1796
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:00,240
It's just a purely, it's just for the, it's the only way they're going to defeat Bowser

1797
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,600
and Robotnik together.

1798
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,440
These buddies trading clothes, we do it all the time.

1799
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:05,440
That's right.

1800
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:10,040
Real masculinity is being comfortable with your body and others.

1801
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:14,080
The animal bodies.

1802
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,240
I think the thing you went to was called VR zone.

1803
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,240
Okay.

1804
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,240
Okay.

1805
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:22,080
And the thing was called Mario Kart arcade GP VR.

1806
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,080
Was it in Shinjuku?

1807
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,800
Yes, that was what it was.

1808
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,800
I got confused.

1809
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,800
I apologize.

1810
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,120
Thank God we caught it here and I wouldn't, didn't have to do it in the next episode.

1811
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,340
No, don't get the song out.

1812
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,340
But no, it's awesome.

1813
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:36,600
Like I understand why that's on the table when you're talking about the big flagship

1814
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,520
ride for the first Nintendo theme park land.

1815
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:44,200
Like you, oh man, we wouldn't it be awesome if you get to be in the car and you get to

1816
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,280
do the shell stuff and all, like I get it.

1817
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,280
But then there was probably somebody and I don't know that, but it was like, it should

1818
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,280
be practical.

1819
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:55,000
We know we have done a lot of screens here.

1820
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,880
We've done a lot of screens and maybe we don't want to do that.

1821
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,200
We want to build practical things cause that is so impactful for people and it'll be like

1822
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,160
different than what we've done before.

1823
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,840
And then all the ideas came together much like Indiana Jones and kingdom of the crystal

1824
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,060
skull, all these different ideas and like, let's try to make all of it work at once.

1825
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,800
But that one worked perfectly.

1826
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,800
What are you saying?

1827
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,040
As assuredly will the next one.

1828
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,040
Oh yeah, that did.

1829
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,040
Yeah, you're right.

1830
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:25,760
Well, we, I mean, we both, I think came to the same conclusion of like kind of wish this

1831
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,000
was just a super Mario world dark ride.

1832
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,760
Well, that's a different, yes.

1833
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:36,440
I said in the last episode that I felt like we were getting a Mario cart too soon.

1834
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:37,440
Yeah.

1835
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:42,840
I mean, they're also building this for Orlando and Singapore officially announced Orlando.

1836
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,520
I think I've heard the rumors so much.

1837
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,440
I didn't realize it hadn't been officially announced until that event.

1838
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,440
Right.

1839
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,440
We're late about it here too.

1840
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,880
So yeah, no, I, that would have been good to start with, but obviously, you know, you

1841
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,720
can start with Mario cart.

1842
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,720
It makes sense.

1843
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:04,000
It's just like, I felt it's just like too ambitious and it's a little ahead of its time.

1844
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,200
And really the first Mario ride.

1845
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,640
It's a big deal to be that.

1846
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:17,080
And you want it to be just so classic, you know, in the way that Harry Potter has pieced

1847
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:22,840
off different elements of Harry Potter, but the first ride needed to be very, let's hit

1848
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,720
big beats and nail big beats.

1849
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,080
And I think they did.

1850
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,080
I did.

1851
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:34,320
I mean, I, on a positive thing, it did have a moment of delight for me.

1852
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,880
Again, I'm not even, I know Rainbow Road, even I remember that one.

1853
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:43,480
So when that kicked in right towards the end, I was kind of delighted by that in a way that

1854
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:48,600
like, I really liked the thing in the Jurassic park boat ride where like you see the giant

1855
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,880
Mosasaurus and it kind of cracks the glass a little and splashes and then you get splashed.

1856
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,960
I think that's really fun.

1857
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:04,360
And so like I, in a similar fashion, I think the Rainbow Road a bit was fun, but just park

1858
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,200
ride a dress where we're right.

1859
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,520
There's a big drop at the end.

1860
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,160
There's a big, so this is a problem here.

1861
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:13,680
So at the end of the ride is the Rainbow Road and Rainbow Road rules.

1862
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,120
I've been obsessed with the Rainbow Road my whole life.

1863
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,720
They've never gotten it wrong.

1864
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:21,200
Every Rainbow Road is better than the last 80% of my life.

1865
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:25,800
I've thought about the Rainbow Road once a week, like, like starting with Super Nintendo

1866
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,680
Mario Kart, like my sister, my whole life has been a Rainbow Road.

1867
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,040
I love rainbow candy.

1868
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,040
I love Rainbow Road.

1869
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:36,160
And you have rainbow Johnny Pops I got from sprouts.

1870
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,880
The other, they are delicious.

1871
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:41,320
They're like seven different colors, not just a normal like bomb pop three colors.

1872
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,520
No, these have like seven different flavors in them.

1873
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,200
I'm obsessed with the rainbows.

1874
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,920
Thank you for explaining what Johnny Pops are.

1875
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,880
Cause that is not a universal reference.

1876
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,240
I did not know where you go.

1877
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,240
Oh really?

1878
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,240
You didn't know?

1879
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,240
I thought it was cereal.

1880
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,240
Oh really?

1881
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,240
I should show you.

1882
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:58,520
Uh, Johnny Pop has like a cute little like boy with glasses on it.

1883
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,520
Oh, okay.

1884
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,520
Well I like that.

1885
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,520
Yes.

1886
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,800
Uh, I know you, I, I'm surprised you don't know what those are because I feel like those

1887
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,800
would be a brand.

1888
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,800
Now here's the thing.

1889
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,480
I spent $6 on these popsicles.

1890
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,480
That's a lot for pops.

1891
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,480
Yeah.

1892
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,480
Yeah, it is.

1893
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,920
But the flavors are good.

1894
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,680
They're better than normal flavors.

1895
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:19,720
You're well, it's a big challenge to good.

1896
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:20,720
The good humor.

1897
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:23,240
So, so, um, yeah.

1898
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:29,360
So like what happens is that's the last part of the ride and this ride does not go fast

1899
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,360
at all.

1900
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:31,940
No, not at any point.

1901
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:36,080
And it's not us like griping that we needed to go like, Oh man, it's only going 10 miles

1902
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,640
an hour and we want it to go 60.

1903
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:41,200
No, it goes one mile an hour basically the whole time.

1904
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,200
Very slow.

1905
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,480
It's the same thing they do with Fast and the Furious.

1906
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,720
They made like a thing where it's like, okay, what's a big part of this franchise going

1907
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:56,200
fast slow down a minute about, uh, you know, and I, I feel like that's why they're again

1908
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,440
a rumor that they're building a big Fast and Furious roller coaster.

1909
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,280
Ah, something that goes fast.

1910
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,680
Something that goes very fast and very simple to explain.

1911
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:08,440
So you go, so you turn this thing and it's Rainbow Road and I'm going, okay, I'm a little

1912
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:11,560
mixed on what I feel about this ride, but here we go.

1913
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,700
Rainbow Road.

1914
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:17,040
There's like a kind of starry effect that happens in your AR goggles and then you're

1915
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,440
in the ground lights up.

1916
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,440
Yeah.

1917
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,440
Uh, yeah.

1918
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,440
The huge rainbow pattern on the ground on the track.

1919
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,960
And then the goggles try to trick you.

1920
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:31,100
The goggles try to trick you into thinking you're going fast in this Rainbow Ro, uh,

1921
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:39,160
Rainbow Road room and you're not going fast and I'm too smart to be tricked like this.

1922
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:43,800
I know we're not going fast and it's not given it.

1923
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:48,080
It's so promising and then you're like, no, I didn't do it.

1924
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,080
I didn't feel it.

1925
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,600
It's set up as the finale of the ride.

1926
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,600
It's a big thing.

1927
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,520
We've all thought about our lives.

1928
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,720
This hurts me to do, to do this episode.

1929
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,440
I am in pain to do this episode.

1930
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:01,160
I really am because again, everyone works.

1931
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,280
I know they worked so hard on this.

1932
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,880
I know they did.

1933
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,880
Yeah.

1934
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:06,880
Yeah.

1935
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:14,200
But does the blame ultimately lie with the like the at the top decision makers who were

1936
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,280
like, yeah, we could do Murray cart and here's the space it can have.

1937
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,280
I don't know.

1938
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,280
It's a good question.

1939
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,400
If it was a space thing and they said, okay, well, so, cause it's a space thing, then it

1940
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,760
can't have a big stretch like radiator Springs where we go fast.

1941
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,520
I don't know if it's that or it's just that like they were, they were sure that they wanted

1942
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:34,240
to do the AR component and because of that, you can't go fast.

1943
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,240
Yeah.

1944
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:40,480
And then people will be puking up gray mushroom soup on the Mario cart ride.

1945
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:45,440
If you're going every day, like if I'm, I think, I mean, if I'm trying to imagine doing

1946
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,880
AR while you're on that stretch in radiator Springs and it seems insane.

1947
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,440
Well, wait a minute.

1948
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,640
Orlando's getting the donkey con coaster too.

1949
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,640
Yes.

1950
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,640
Yeah.

1951
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:58,880
So you can, you can puke your mushroom soup up there or any of the other numbers of epic

1952
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,040
universe roller coaster.

1953
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:04,600
Well, yeah, but I, my stomach was more settled on a roller coaster than it is getting like

1954
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,720
two forms of media at once.

1955
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,720
That's more of the issue.

1956
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:09,720
Yeah.

1957
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:15,720
I ate a big, uh, uh, like a big thing of Chinese food and went right onto a credit coaster

1958
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:16,720
at once.

1959
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:20,920
I drink a big beer, did big thing of, uh, of Chinese food.

1960
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:25,120
And then we went over and I remember going, Oh, I shouldn't be doing this.

1961
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,120
This isn't a good idea.

1962
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,720
I was fine.

1963
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,600
I felt better after that.

1964
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:34,380
I yeah, actually I handle roller coasters and, uh, pretty well.

1965
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:35,800
And most drop rides.

1966
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:36,800
Yeah.

1967
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,360
Well, I love, you know, I love a drop ride that's except with the legs dangling, but

1968
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:45,480
if it's inside, if I'm inside in a little box going far up, far down, I'm loving it.

1969
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,400
That's my favorite, like sensation as far as big show rides.

1970
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,400
But yeah.

1971
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:55,400
So it's like, again, yeah, the, I don't want to belabor the point, but I mean, look, they

1972
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:58,440
didn't have a huge plot of land at universal Hollywood.

1973
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:02,640
They demolished a bunch of sound stages, but that only gets you so far.

1974
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,600
Because obviously it was probably the answer to that.

1975
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,600
Yeah.

1976
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,600
Cause obviously the land there is bigger.

1977
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:11,280
So obviously they knew they had more space to work with, but I wonder, was it designed

1978
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:15,560
with the idea that it can slot nicely into Hollywood and then slot wherever into Florida?

1979
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,560
I don't know.

1980
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:21,840
I don't plan was, yeah, maybe they had to think of all those factors, but transformers,

1981
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,040
like there's two levels to it.

1982
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,040
And I don't know.

1983
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,440
There's some, they can't all be the best ride ever made.

1984
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,760
My, that's the thing.

1985
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,600
They can all be transformers, but, uh, yeah.

1986
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,360
So I don't know.

1987
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:40,160
Let's let's talk, uh, solutions as if, uh, we would solve anything because they're not

1988
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:44,200
going to get rid of it and making it, but what, what is the ideal?

1989
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,320
What is the Mario Kart ride of our dreams?

1990
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,240
How do you actually do it?

1991
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:52,480
Before we do that, and maybe this plays into it, I have something that is starting to become

1992
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:57,680
a recurring narrative in like new rides and stuff that happens every time.

1993
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:04,200
And it happened with this and it's starting to feel like, is no one learning a lesson?

1994
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,200
Like what are you doing?

1995
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:11,000
Like, you know, the, the test ride, the test seat at the entrance of the ride is this like

1996
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,680
a recurring thing, a Tron, they have it.

1997
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:21,080
And it's some people like physically cannot fit in the ride.

1998
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:25,260
And I have heard, I think there was like on the local news, there was a universal rep

1999
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:30,080
or PR person or so was like, well, it's because the seats are designed for little children

2000
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,440
and then like a certain size of adults.

2001
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:37,600
But it's like, you need to put more variables and like, you need to put more than just like

2002
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:42,840
one or two kind of accessible rides because it's, it's odd.

2003
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,420
It's happened with forbidden journey.

2004
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,420
It's happened with this Tron.

2005
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:47,420
Tron is a different seat though.

2006
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:48,420
Right.

2007
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,420
Or am I wrong?

2008
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:53,680
Doesn't Tron have a different one or two little car kind of, yeah, yeah.

2009
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,280
Tron doesn't have that, right?

2010
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,280
I don't know.

2011
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:00,880
From what I've seen, I haven't heard that it has that, but it, it's also very-

2012
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:01,880
Pets is a problem.

2013
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:02,880
I've seen a lot of pets.

2014
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:03,880
Pets.

2015
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:04,880
Yeah.

2016
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,880
Um, avatars, I think is tough.

2017
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,960
Um, size wise, uh, for a flight of passage.

2018
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:09,960
Yeah.

2019
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:10,960
Yeah.

2020
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:11,960
That was, that was one.

2021
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:15,800
And then they got in a real, I think they may have solved the issue with river journey

2022
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,780
where it was like, there was no wheelchair accessible vehicle.

2023
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:24,760
And it's like the, it's also, it's also weird on another level cause like the test seats

2024
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,520
also become photo ops.

2025
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:29,220
So some people are testing to see if they can get on it.

2026
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,440
Some people are just taking pet and that, I don't know.

2027
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,040
That's just so odd to me.

2028
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,040
Like it's strange.

2029
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:38,080
Audition and via people might not know that's what they're supposed to be doing.

2030
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,080
Yeah.

2031
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,080
Yeah.

2032
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,080
It's crazy.

2033
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,080
Figure it out.

2034
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,080
Figure it out.

2035
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,560
Like you can build, you can build bigger.

2036
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,720
Like I don't think it's the designers at fault.

2037
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:51,360
I think it's probably the budgets, you know, as usual, it's the money.

2038
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,360
Maybe.

2039
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:53,360
Yeah.

2040
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,360
I don't know.

2041
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,680
Well, whatever our fixes that we're going to say here would fix that problem.

2042
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:57,680
I think.

2043
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:58,680
Oh, absolutely.

2044
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,240
We're going to, we will definitely fix it.

2045
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:06,280
I think the other level of weirdness is these places spend so much marketing of like everyone

2046
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,280
can come here.

2047
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,680
It's like, this is a very accessible place.

2048
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:12,560
Then you get there and that is not the case on some.

2049
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:17,280
Well, to the billboard say universal Hollywood, the most accessible place on earth.

2050
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:22,400
No, no, I just, but I mean in the market, I swear there's been like stuff of like people

2051
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:25,960
with disability and like they're like, these are safe places to travel to.

2052
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,480
You can come to this destination experience.

2053
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,160
Uh, it sure.

2054
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:34,240
Well, yeah, it's weird that it keeps, I don't know, it's happened to us.

2055
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,240
Especially.

2056
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,240
Yeah.

2057
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,240
It's really universal, I think too.

2058
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,240
So it's not so good.

2059
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:44,000
Um, but what is again the like, and solutions is the wrong word.

2060
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,960
It's really like, what, what is the blue sky?

2061
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,320
What is the, let's go back in time.

2062
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,800
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2063
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,960
If you, if you could have been in those rooms, what is the Mario Kart ride?

2064
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,120
Well, I would have handcuffed myself to the desk until they listened to me at a certain

2065
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:03,680
point, but yes, I think, I think it's probably like just rip radiators springs off and just

2066
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,720
add, like just still steal it.

2067
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:06,720
Sure.

2068
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:11,680
And it's a big, like it's, it's darker or it's dark ride scenes that you're slower

2069
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,760
for and then you get fast at the end.

2070
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,440
Yeah, and there's a little bursts of speed and oh my gosh, you almost hit, you know,

2071
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,680
Bowser, you know, whatever.

2072
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:22,480
And then at the end it's rainbow road and it's probably inside.

2073
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,480
You almost hit Bowser.

2074
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,480
Yeah.

2075
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:29,760
20 feet rocket rod straight away.

2076
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,160
You almost got him.

2077
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:35,680
And then like, yeah, like you're gonna, you know, there'll be a couple in the same way

2078
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:40,440
that the, that on the poos, honey hut and in the, uh, runaway railway, there's like

2079
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:46,160
vehicles that are just robots or just like a, a figure of like one of the other character

2080
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,160
racers.

2081
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,480
So you get the sense that you're racing against the actual characters.

2082
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:50,480
Yeah.

2083
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:51,480
Uh, yeah.

2084
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:52,480
And then you go in and out.

2085
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:57,760
I mean, there's also a version of it where it's just like an elevated it's like, it's,

2086
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,760
I don't know if they, do they have any wifi controlled like Disney style rides?

2087
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,760
I don't think so.

2088
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:06,440
No, no, but it's like that to like runaway railway technology and you're just kind of

2089
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,800
zooming around this room.

2090
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:12,640
And well, you don't have a speed problem there too.

2091
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:19,760
I was thinking about this too, cause yeah, it is like Disney completely did what it should

2092
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:24,320
be, but they can't access that technology.

2093
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:28,920
Literally would have to be something different, but they're patenting patenting patenting

2094
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:29,920
patenting.

2095
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,920
What did I say?

2096
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:31,920
It's not panting ting.

2097
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:32,920
I know that.

2098
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:37,200
Panting, panting, we were, I was up late for the, they are panting,

2099
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:40,200
Tiram Tiram,

2100
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:45,200
Yeah, that's right.

2101
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,200
Right.

2102
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:47,200
Sure is.

2103
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,200
It's late.

2104
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,200
Uh, uh, yeah.

2105
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,320
Like they're, they're doing all the weird, cool stuff.

2106
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:56,040
Like there's different crazy things that they've like put down on paper that they might use

2107
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:00,560
one day, like stuff where like little houses like kind of open up and different, like big

2108
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:05,160
show building things for like a live show where the audience moves up and down.

2109
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:09,040
Like they're doing crazy stuff or working on crazy stuff here and there.

2110
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,920
So I don't think it would be too big of a stretch for them to figure out a version of

2111
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,360
what Disney does.

2112
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:15,360
Yeah.

2113
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,360
Yeah.

2114
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:22,400
Um, I think, yeah, I, I, I think they, it is, they got caught on one detail, which sounds

2115
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:27,840
cool and it's, I think we were open to how this could work the whole time they were developing

2116
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:32,040
it, the idea that you're seeing your opponents and the goggles and that, cause that is, it

2117
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:36,440
is a big part of Mario Kart is, you know, crazy high.

2118
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:40,040
It's not even just that there are other racers is that they're like spilling out in crazy

2119
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:45,880
ways with shells and banana peels, but speed, you do need speed.

2120
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,000
I think it's more important.

2121
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:54,160
I think if there were just occasional brushes with other cars, that would be plenty.

2122
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:59,640
And I was thinking, I was thinking of another route and tell me what you think of this,

2123
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,640
but okay.

2124
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:06,880
Here's a, here's a ride that feels, uh, nobody's ever complained about that.

2125
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:13,040
That wasn't exciting or that was slow, even though it's a little ride, Mr. Toad's wild

2126
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,040
ride.

2127
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,040
Yeah, for sure.

2128
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:20,520
That is like, is that not a more intense mad cap experience than Mario Kart?

2129
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:29,600
It for sure is due to tinier vehicle hairpin turns, barely missing stuff the entire way.

2130
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,240
And I'm not saying use that ride track, but is there, is there a way that's a little more

2131
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:40,240
lo-fi and where you are whipping around or it's somewhere between that and a wild mouse

2132
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:46,800
where it could be almost the same plot of land, but you pack more in.

2133
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,880
And I like the idea of right.

2134
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:53,360
Vehicles being smaller because Mario carts are smaller.

2135
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:58,360
You think about like little Mario and little toad in their car that matches them.

2136
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:01,240
Is it not those go-karts are small.

2137
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,560
That's the fun of being in a go-kart.

2138
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:07,120
You feel speed more because they're close to the ground.

2139
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:08,120
They're little.

2140
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:09,120
Yeah.

2141
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:13,960
And so being in a big weighty car kind of makes that impossible unless you're doing,

2142
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:18,740
unless you're doing radiator Springs and it's incredible massive technology that's letting

2143
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,480
you go super fast.

2144
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:26,840
I started dreaming of a, a Mr. Toad that is in a building the size of transformers and

2145
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:33,040
imagine what you could pack into that and half of it, it could be like the mummy where

2146
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:37,100
you know, like there's, there's little scenes you go in, but then you launch and a bunch

2147
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:38,240
of really fast stuff.

2148
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:42,160
I know we're not describing a launch mechanism, but like, doesn't that sound okay?

2149
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:44,720
I got a, I got a truly, this is okay.

2150
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:45,720
This is good.

2151
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,720
This is very, very good.

2152
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,760
I think you, if you like, if you did a ride like that, but say it was Mr. Toad, but there

2153
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,680
were eight different ways you start the ride.

2154
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:56,880
So like, you know, there's eight cars and there's four people per car and basically

2155
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,680
how you load the ride is that everybody gets in the car and then all eight cars start out

2156
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,040
the same.

2157
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:07,320
So it's basically, it's closer to, you know, practical sets and stuff, but then the cars

2158
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:12,720
like a Mr. Toad were eight cars going separate ways and going in and out and weaving in and

2159
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:18,560
out of each other, even in not something that has like the most epic scale would still feel

2160
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,720
like Mario Kart.

2161
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:25,160
Well, yeah, and you could even have like, you don't actually need eight different paths.

2162
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:28,040
You could have like two or three different paths and cheat it.

2163
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,040
In my version, you need eight.

2164
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,040
Well, your blue sky version, you would get eight different traps.

2165
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,520
Because you would feel like there's a, I guess you could do four at once or whatever, but

2166
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,200
then the ride capacities, I'm trying to think practically here as well.

2167
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:37,200
Well, sure.

2168
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,120
But I also, I know we're blue sky-ing, but eight altogether.

2169
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:41,920
That's like, you've never seen a ride like that.

2170
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:42,920
That's crazy.

2171
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:44,200
Well, that's why we're breaking new ground here.

2172
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,200
I know.

2173
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:48,560
That's what you should do, but imagine like the, all right, like the thick, just like

2174
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:54,240
in terms of how thick every turn and room has to be to have the room for eight entire

2175
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,240
tracks.

2176
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:56,240
We can try six.

2177
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,800
We can like, we can blue sky this, but like, imagine you're going, everyone has their own

2178
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,920
kind of separate thing and like you go, you go in one room alone sort of, and all of a

2179
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:06,620
sudden like Bowser, a big like, you know, practical Bowser, you almost hit him.

2180
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:07,620
He zooms right.

2181
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:12,520
You go left and all of a sudden you're like head on with a different car full of humans.

2182
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:17,040
You go, you split off there, you go in a little different room and you like, you again, another

2183
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:21,680
show scene with like a different, like a Koopa Troopa or Princess Peach or something back

2184
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:25,800
out and then the end is like maybe a little faster kind of stretch somewhere.

2185
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:26,800
Yeah.

2186
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:32,440
I think what you are, what you're each describing, like Scott, you were talking about like classical

2187
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:39,600
themed entertainment tricks and design and like stuff where it's like, um, you, that,

2188
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:44,800
that makes stuff like Mr. Toad, which decades and decades old, like still hold up and feel

2189
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:45,960
like you're out of control.

2190
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:50,360
And Mike, you're talking about like little variations, little randomized things like

2191
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:53,840
those randomized songs from guardians of the galaxy.

2192
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:54,840
Right.

2193
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,120
And you get into the different little carts and they're a little, and yeah, you feel like

2194
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:01,800
it's, it feels a little bit more authentic to the experience.

2195
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:07,680
You feel like, I don't know, you're getting a cohesive experience one way or the other.

2196
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:11,080
I was about to say a different, a totally different idea would even be something like

2197
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:16,940
flight of passage where you build little cars and then stick the cars in front of like a

2198
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:17,940
crazy screen.

2199
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:22,600
So you're going to do the VR experience except that maybe like it's like flight of passage

2200
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,760
where all you can see is screen.

2201
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:28,360
Like I almost kind of wish it was just that if we're going to the video game, let's do

2202
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:35,360
the craziest version of the video game we can do like some high budget digital flight

2203
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,880
of passage where you've got a steering wheel and there's some interactivity.

2204
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,880
Right.

2205
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:44,280
And maybe it's just shooting shells and you don't steer as much.

2206
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:46,040
I found the steering really stupid.

2207
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:47,640
Yeah, it's not, it's nothing.

2208
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,720
Because you don't steer it.

2209
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,120
It just says like, oh, steer right.

2210
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:51,760
And then you're all supposed to go right.

2211
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,240
And I think you get points for doing that, but the car doesn't react to the steering.

2212
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,240
Yeah.

2213
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,760
It would be impossible to do that with a car full of people.

2214
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:01,960
So it's like, it's like, it's kind of like the Millennium Falcon thing where it's like,

2215
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,920
it's an overthink here.

2216
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:08,440
This is an overthink to get everybody to do something to make it feel like the experience.

2217
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:13,000
It's like, if you're not going to be able to steer the car, I don't want to pretend

2218
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,680
to steer the car.

2219
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:19,360
That's I understand like the having that there so you can aim the shells sort of works more.

2220
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:24,520
Get like, uh, you know, make it rise the resistance, make there, there's a character on board

2221
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:31,120
doing the, if you were on with a little, with a, with a towed head or any other character,

2222
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:32,840
I, that's pretty fun.

2223
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:36,880
They're driving and you're out of control because they're bad drivers.

2224
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,600
You know, you don't, you're missing a couple of things here.

2225
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,080
You're missing, you got no drift.

2226
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,080
There's no drift.

2227
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,840
That's a huge part of Mario Kart.

2228
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:43,840
Drift is fun.

2229
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:44,840
Yeah.

2230
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:49,200
Apparently if all four of you work together, you'll get the points and you'll drift.

2231
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:55,000
And I think what the car itself will drift or it's just like tells you you're drifting

2232
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,880
tells you where you get the coins worth it.

2233
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,920
Is it double dash?

2234
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:03,520
Is that the one where you kind of work with a there's two, two people in the car or it's

2235
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,520
you and a computer character.

2236
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,520
You have a computer.

2237
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,520
Yeah.

2238
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:07,520
And that's the one.

2239
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,520
Yeah.

2240
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:12,160
What they were trying to cause they, I like that they picked little elements from different

2241
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:13,160
games.

2242
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,160
There's secret stuff too.

2243
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:15,160
This is what I'm saying.

2244
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:19,480
Like I will be going on this and there's like secret boxes and blocks to hit, I guess on

2245
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:20,480
the ride.

2246
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:25,240
And there's a bunch of hidden little things that do seem fun to try to explore.

2247
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:30,680
But if it's like dad should be going on this, I'm talking about a random dad, not me, but

2248
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:33,920
like a random dad should be going on this first time.

2249
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:38,360
Any dad should be going on the first time and going, Oh, pretty, that was cool versus

2250
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:40,080
like so, so yeah.

2251
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,360
I know it sounds crazy after all this complaining.

2252
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:47,640
I did say that I got off like, Hey, that was fun.

2253
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:53,320
I do think you will feel it's just, I think it's just thinking about what could have been.

2254
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:57,080
I think completely there is a better Mario Kart attraction.

2255
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:01,160
And I also, I do agree that maybe there's, although I think you're, you're damned if

2256
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:05,680
you do it down, if you don't, because if they did a Mario dark ride, everybody would be

2257
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:07,720
saying why isn't it Mario Kart?

2258
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:10,200
I think the ride had to be Mario Kart.

2259
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:11,200
Right?

2260
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,200
Oh, probably.

2261
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:16,480
I mean, yes, it could be a Mario dark ride where like a chunk of it is Mario Kart.

2262
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:20,400
Like, I mean, I think ultimately, yeah.

2263
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,880
When it was being built to be like, Oh, it should have been Mario Kart.

2264
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:23,920
That makes the most sense.

2265
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,040
And then if it was awesome, people would not have said that.

2266
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:29,800
But yeah, I mean, I get why the first one is Mario Kart.

2267
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,760
It just, it's, it makes the most sense.

2268
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,840
And it sounds like you're in a ride vehicle.

2269
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:34,840
Yeah.

2270
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:36,880
You're not a plumber walking on foot.

2271
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:37,880
Yes.

2272
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:38,880
Yeah.

2273
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:42,000
Mario doesn't have a, well, if you were, you know, what I'd like to be in is like the, you

2274
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,120
know, the big boot or whatever.

2275
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,120
Oh yes.

2276
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:49,480
Was that when he hops around in, in Mario three, one of our sagas weren't, didn't you get in

2277
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:50,480
a big boot?

2278
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,480
Oh, that's right.

2279
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:52,480
Yeah, I believe I did.

2280
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,480
Very satisfying.

2281
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:54,480
Yeah.

2282
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:55,480
I look back on it fondly.

2283
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,480
You were in a big boot.

2284
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,760
It was, it was wonderful as all our meals.

2285
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:09,760
I think, but, but Mario is like intrinsically, you can design a rock because you just go

2286
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:15,160
through a pipe or is it super Mario galaxy where you go to different little planets.

2287
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,160
Yeah.

2288
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:18,920
And you go and like, you get stuck in their orbit and you shoot around like you're in

2289
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:19,920
an Apollo mission.

2290
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:20,920
You're trying to get home.

2291
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:23,520
It feels like a designer stream.

2292
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:24,900
It's like, okay, guess what?

2293
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:28,960
You can either go to another planet or a down a pipe and you can go anywhere.

2294
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,080
Well and you could go to new Donk city.

2295
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:32,080
Sure.

2296
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:36,480
New Donk city from, from Odyssey, Super Mario Odyssey, which is so fun.

2297
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,960
What happens in new Donk city?

2298
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:39,160
Oh, you're just going back.

2299
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:43,480
It's like, it's kind of a very like high risey kind of city and you know, you swinging around

2300
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:45,120
on like poles and stuff.

2301
01:45:45,120 --> 01:45:48,240
Like a Coruscant kind of thing.

2302
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,960
It's a little more old school than a Coruscant.

2303
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:50,960
Oh, okay.

2304
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:51,960
Oh, I see.

2305
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:52,960
It's like New York city.

2306
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:53,960
Oh, I remember.

2307
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:56,120
New Donk city is a lot like New Donk city rules.

2308
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,560
But you can bother people.

2309
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,560
There's like regular, yeah, there's like a human.

2310
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,560
Yeah.

2311
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:01,560
Yeah.

2312
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:02,560
And you're doing a bunch of different stuff.

2313
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,560
Mario Odyssey.

2314
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:04,560
Well, you guys should pull it.

2315
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:07,120
Get, I mean, I guess you could just borrow my switch at one point, but you really should

2316
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:08,120
play Mario Odyssey.

2317
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:09,120
Yeah.

2318
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:10,120
Yes.

2319
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:11,120
With Cappy.

2320
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,120
Oh, right.

2321
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:15,080
I mean, he has different outfits and you can mix and match his outfits, little pants and

2322
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,080
his shirt.

2323
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,080
Oh, just pinstripe suit.

2324
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:18,080
Okay.

2325
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,080
That's really good.

2326
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:20,080
Look at Mario.

2327
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,160
Just look up Mario Odyssey outfits.

2328
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:25,520
You can put him in like a full tux, like a full like white tux with a big top hat.

2329
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:29,720
I think I've been over your old apartment and you're like, Oh, I've shown you his outfits.

2330
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,040
You got to look at some of these outfits.

2331
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,840
He gets in like little trunks and stuff.

2332
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:33,840
Oh my God.

2333
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:34,840
Santa?

2334
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:35,840
Yeah.

2335
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:36,840
Oh, it's so good.

2336
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:37,840
He's got an ax in his head.

2337
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:38,840
He's a zombie.

2338
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,840
And Cappy is like a ball gown.

2339
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:41,840
Yes.

2340
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,020
You can put him a ball gown, which is really fun.

2341
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:47,000
And then you collect all these outfits as you go and you sort of dress him.

2342
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,680
That's a big part of Zelda too.

2343
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:52,240
What's fun is like in the last one is that Link gets a lot of different outfits, but

2344
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:58,040
those are more practical because like there's big like wintery lands and you give him an

2345
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:59,760
outfit that keeps him warm.

2346
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:03,240
You can't like Jason, when he stripped him naked, that would not be good in the winter

2347
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,240
land.

2348
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:09,320
And when Jason lit the horse on fire when I had first got the switch many years ago.

2349
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:13,960
But does Mario Odyssey give you the option for him to take all his clothes off and put

2350
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,160
them on Sonic?

2351
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:16,160
No.

2352
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:17,880
So the answer is yes, we will not rest.

2353
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:18,880
I know we will.

2354
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:21,240
And we will keep dreaming of better Mario ride.

2355
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:25,360
You do also, what you're saying about pipes and stuff, Jason, is like maybe they're, I

2356
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:30,240
don't mean, you don't want to just do, I don't like, I don't want another, I don't want a

2357
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:38,760
Mario forbidden journey, but you know, flying behind him when he's got a cape or the mushroom

2358
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:44,440
or the, I'm sorry, the raccoon suit or like, or then now you're, and then suddenly you're

2359
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,440
underwater.

2360
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,440
The Tanooki suit.

2361
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:48,760
The Eastern New York with Jimmy Fallon does.

2362
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:49,960
You fly with him.

2363
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:51,720
You go underwater.

2364
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:54,040
You go through a big pipe.

2365
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:55,040
You know what?

2366
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,040
Oh my God.

2367
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,960
This is a horrifying thing I'm about to say.

2368
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:58,960
Go ahead.

2369
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:04,560
When in the end of the ride, when the, when the, the tonight rider shoots the tube and

2370
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:10,160
you go from the moon down back to New York city through the tube, that is more like Rainbow

2371
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:13,640
Road than the Rainbow Road part of Mario Kart.

2372
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:14,640
You think.

2373
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:18,400
I have more of my skin is crawling that I am saying this.

2374
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,400
Is it not a more satisfying?

2375
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:23,560
Jimmy Fallon is more Mario than Mario.

2376
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:28,860
You think Jimmy Fallon and the Tonight Show band and the audience should get the universal

2377
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:29,860
cup.

2378
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:30,860
Oh, we didn't even talk about it.

2379
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:34,940
Which I really like is that you're racing in the universal cup, which is really great.

2380
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:38,280
And they use the universal music at the end, a little part of the stain.

2381
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:39,280
The glow.

2382
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,280
The glow.

2383
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,280
So that's really fun.

2384
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:42,280
I think that's pretty funny.

2385
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:44,800
I just say it's a cute kid story really quick.

2386
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:50,200
The last time we went to universal together, we went on the star way, which he likes in

2387
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,920
general because he yells steep the whole time.

2388
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:57,720
Starway is one of his favorite things, but they play music throughout and he doesn't

2389
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:58,720
know most of it.

2390
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:02,240
He doesn't know staying alive, but the universal fanfare plays.

2391
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,400
And then he starts yelling something and we're like, what is he yelling?

2392
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:08,720
How does he know that it's at the beginning of the Thomas, the tank engine DVDs.

2393
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:11,440
So he's yelling Thomas DVD.

2394
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,640
Thomas DVD.

2395
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:20,320
He's so happy that we're, we're on a steep thing that's playing the Thomas DVD music.

2396
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:24,800
I like, uh, that's, this is some of this good dad stuff for your life.

2397
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:29,360
Oh, I'm seeing, I've been on the star way a million times why it might even have lost

2398
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:36,800
its luster through a child's eyes who thinks that a DVD is starting a 15 year old DVD and

2399
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:42,920
then he'll get to see a minions preview and an ad for a vacation to a hard rock resort

2400
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:45,440
in the Bahamas where Barney is.

2401
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,480
Oh, I watched all the VHS.

2402
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:51,440
I will watch every trailer again and again when I was rewatching the movie.

2403
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,840
That's like, see, that's what they're hoping for.

2404
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:57,700
They're hoping kids go on that star way and they pointed all the newly painted sound stages

2405
01:49:57,700 --> 01:50:01,560
at the peacock dots and it's peacock peacock dots.

2406
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:03,120
Oh man.

2407
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:04,120
Yeah.

2408
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:08,080
That's like, if I got to go on a ride that was just a new line cinema logo or some, like

2409
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:13,640
I got to like a part of the start of some video or TV, like that was associated.

2410
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:18,520
I met, I got face to face with the DreamWorks Fisher boy.

2411
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,960
I got to cast a line with the famous boy.

2412
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,320
Maybe that'll be in the Texas park.

2413
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,800
I better do the Fisher boy.

2414
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,560
Anybody's listening who's working on it.

2415
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:32,880
You know, if you cannot build DreamWorks land without a, an intimate moment with the DreamWorks

2416
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:38,000
Fisher boy, I don't think I realized for a long time that that was a boy sitting on the

2417
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
moon fishing.

2418
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,240
I thought it was like some creature monster.

2419
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:42,240
Yeah.

2420
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,240
It was like a, Oh, his outline.

2421
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:48,560
He's a little boy, a little boy down into some sort of liquid.

2422
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:49,880
No, he is.

2423
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:57,400
He's sitting on the, on the end of a crescent moon, which size wise makes him, uh, you know,

2424
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,680
like a, he's like a several miles high.

2425
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:05,720
I mean, the joke, you're, you are right, Jason, that if he was real, the DreamWorks boy would

2426
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:08,280
crush our town and everyone we know.

2427
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:09,280
Yeah.

2428
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,280
People just horrified.

2429
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:13,280
Oh no, it's a quarter.

2430
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:14,280
What's up?

2431
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:15,280
What?

2432
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:16,280
What is that?

2433
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:18,760
Something's coming down from the moon.

2434
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,720
He's got a giant line.

2435
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,760
He's fishing for us.

2436
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:23,760
He's fishing humans.

2437
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,920
It would make more sense as the DreamWorks logo.

2438
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:30,880
Because at least you have Ron Howard behind the scenes and he was Andy Griffith show,

2439
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:31,880
little boy.

2440
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:32,880
That's true.

2441
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,320
They were always walking down the fishing hole, started every episode.

2442
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:39,960
There was a, yeah, the credits credits.

2443
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:40,960
Here's an idea.

2444
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:41,960
There were no credits.

2445
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:42,960
They're starting.

2446
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:43,960
Yeah.

2447
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:44,960
The credits.

2448
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:45,960
Yeah.

2449
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:46,960
Start of every episode.

2450
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:47,960
Yeah.

2451
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:48,960
Yeah.

2452
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:49,960
Your idea for free, like everybody's monetizing their in-house IP.

2453
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:50,960
DreamWorks is not doing anything with the boy.

2454
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:55,040
Horror movie with the boy where he, he comes down from the moon and we see what the fuck

2455
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:56,040
happens.

2456
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:57,040
Yeah.

2457
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:58,040
All right.

2458
01:51:58,040 --> 01:51:59,040
Well, let's get on that too.

2459
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,040
A lot of great ideas today.

2460
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:01,040
Oh, sure.

2461
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:04,120
I'm sure there's gotta be Blumhouse offices on the back lot.

2462
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:05,640
We know there's Amblin office.

2463
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:09,000
There's this giant Amblin like compound back there.

2464
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,720
Oh, what if the, wait a minute.

2465
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:12,440
This is all Spielberg.

2466
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:15,520
DreamWorks fishing boy does battle with ET.

2467
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:16,520
ET?

2468
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:17,520
With Elliot?

2469
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:18,520
Oh yeah.

2470
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:19,520
Elliot fights the moon.

2471
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:20,520
They fight Elliot.

2472
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:21,800
They fight past the moon and the boy gets mad.

2473
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:24,640
Hey, I'm the only boy around these parts.

2474
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:28,600
And ET's healing touch has to help Elliot win.

2475
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,040
You know what?

2476
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:33,560
Fishing boy versus bike boy, no matter who wins.

2477
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:34,560
The audience wins.

2478
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,040
The moviegoer public wins.

2479
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,040
America's hearts win.

2480
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,440
Speaking of boy, I just want to show you the Johnny Pops boy right there.

2481
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,440
Do you see him in the top right corner?

2482
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:43,440
Yeah.

2483
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:45,240
It looks suspiciously like me.

2484
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,240
So surprising.

2485
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:47,240
I haven't seen it.

2486
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:48,240
Another food mask.

2487
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:51,240
Oh, he's exactly like Jason.

2488
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:52,240
Oh, jeepers.

2489
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:53,240
Jeez Louise.

2490
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:55,040
He's on every pop.

2491
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,080
Jeez Johnny Wevin.

2492
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:58,080
You've been eating your own pops.

2493
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:00,080
You know what I was thinking about recently?

2494
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:04,280
I feel like I cannot remember ever eating an official bomb pop.

2495
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,280
What?

2496
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,000
I've had bomb pop flavored things.

2497
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,080
Well, it was chocolate boy.

2498
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:13,280
You never had like just a standard bomb pop with the white, red and blue?

2499
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:18,440
We were like popsicle or icy kind of, what are the sleeves called that you push?

2500
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:19,440
Oh, oh, oh.

2501
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:20,440
Yeah.

2502
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:22,840
Why can't I think of the name of the official, you know?

2503
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,240
Otter Pops is the official brand.

2504
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:25,360
Otter Pops is the brand one.

2505
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,360
Yeah.

2506
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:27,360
But I don't know what you would call them without.

2507
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,360
You guys are on your own here.

2508
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:29,360
You've never eaten an Otter Pop?

2509
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,360
I don't know if I can start this.

2510
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,360
I think I know.

2511
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,360
You know those like little like plastic sleeves.

2512
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:33,360
Yeah, I know what Otter Pop is.

2513
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:34,360
I don't know what the bomb.

2514
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:35,360
Well, bomb pops are different.

2515
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,360
Bomb pops are just the red, white and blue.

2516
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:37,360
It's the red, white and blue.

2517
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:38,360
It looks like a rocket ship.

2518
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:39,360
Looks like a little missile.

2519
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,360
I've had heart seltzer as bomb pop.

2520
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,360
Jason never had a bomb pop.

2521
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:45,360
You've had a bomb pop.

2522
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:46,360
I don't think I've had a bomb pop.

2523
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:47,360
Red, white and blue popsicle?

2524
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:53,360
Not at a bomb pop.

2525
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:54,360
I'm not even like saying you need to do it.

2526
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:55,360
I'm just surprised as a kid you wouldn't have had one of them.

2527
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:56,360
I don't know.

2528
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:57,360
Missed that one.

2529
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:58,360
Huh.

2530
01:53:58,360 --> 01:53:59,360
You've had a dreamsicle though.

2531
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:00,360
Oh, all the time.

2532
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:01,360
It's got dreamsicle?

2533
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:02,360
I've been on a dreamsicle drive.

2534
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:03,360
Well, of course.

2535
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,360
But you've eaten a dreamsicle?

2536
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,360
I believe so.

2537
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,360
You're not sure though.

2538
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:07,360
It's been a long time.

2539
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:08,360
Really?

2540
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:09,360
I'm not you.

2541
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:10,360
I don't have.

2542
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:11,360
I don't have a weekly dreamsicle shipment.

2543
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:12,360
I don't drink alcoholic dreamsicles as my go-to beverage.

2544
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:13,360
But this is not yet.

2545
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:14,360
I don't have a weekly dreamsicle shipment.

2546
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,360
I don't drink alcoholic dreamsicles as my go-to beverage.

2547
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:17,880
But this is not yet.

2548
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:18,880
This is not.

2549
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,160
I'm asking last week, did you have a dreamsicle?

2550
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:23,240
I'm saying the first 20 years of your life, did you have a dreamsicle?

2551
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,800
I said I think I did.

2552
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,360
Is this not sufficient for you?

2553
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,360
It's not.

2554
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,360
It's weird.

2555
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,360
I need to have concrete dreamsicle memories.

2556
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,360
Yeah.

2557
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:31,360
Well, but for sure.

2558
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:32,360
To escape this episode.

2559
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:34,360
Did you have a Flintstones push-up for sure when you were a kid?

2560
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,360
Yes, all the time.

2561
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:36,360
Oh, yeah.

2562
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:39,080
What about the Mickey Donald ones that were shaped like their bodies?

2563
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:40,080
I don't know.

2564
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:41,080
Jason, you know what I'm talking about?

2565
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:42,080
I know what you're talking about.

2566
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:45,280
I don't think I gravitated towards them, but I do kind of remember eating the shit.

2567
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,320
I think I remember eating the bodies.

2568
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:48,880
Eating Mickey's head, yeah.

2569
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:49,880
Okay.

2570
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,160
Well, that's sort of a memory.

2571
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:54,120
You see these articles like, do you remember this?

2572
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:57,560
If you're a 90s kid, you're like, you're not sure enough about it.

2573
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:58,560
I'm a 90s kid.

2574
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,560
Remember it or don't.

2575
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:00,640
Don't ask the question.

2576
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:01,880
I am upset with the articles.

2577
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:04,080
I am yelling, yes, of course I remember.

2578
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:07,160
And I'm saying not only do I remember being a 90s kid, I also know what kids are up to

2579
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:08,160
now too.

2580
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,400
I'm relevant in all decades.

2581
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:13,560
I remember that and I know exactly what 2020s teens are up to.

2582
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:15,440
I'm at the hot topic.

2583
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:19,000
I'm handing out bomb pops to them.

2584
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:24,680
I'm telling them about my idea for Mario and Sonic to switch clothes in front of each other.

2585
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:27,800
I'm irrelevant.

2586
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:31,840
Look guys, here's the, I'm going to make another comparison.

2587
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:40,080
I think that just in similar, in recent theme park dynamics, I think however you feel, even

2588
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:44,920
if we come around on it, if we like, I did like it the first time we might ebb and flow

2589
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:51,600
on this ride, but I think ultimately it is the Millennium Falcon Smuggler's Run of Mario,

2590
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:53,080
of Super Nintendo World.

2591
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:59,560
It is the, it's all right, but I hope that the big one is really great.

2592
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:06,800
And the big one, unfortunately for us here in Hollywood is the Donkey Kong coaster.

2593
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,840
And we don't know if we're going to get it.

2594
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:11,720
We don't know where it's going to go.

2595
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:17,000
We don't know if they'll get the clearance to demolish Transformers forever and put the

2596
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Donkey Kong coaster in there.

2597
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Demolish the office building.

2598
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Demolish the skyscraper.

2599
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,400
Build it on top of the Transformers building.

2600
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:24,400
That sounds great.

2601
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,400
Just go vertical.

2602
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:26,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2603
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,400
Okay.

2604
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:28,400
Love that.

2605
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,400
Yeah.

2606
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:30,400
Make it higher.

2607
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:31,400
But I mean, am I right though?

2608
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:36,760
Like I think now all hopes are on, like I think we still need our e-ticket Nintendo attraction

2609
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:40,600
and it's a bummer because I'm not sure we're going to get it here.

2610
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:41,680
They are getting it in Japan.

2611
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:42,680
We know they are.

2612
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:46,000
They're just building it right away at Epic Universe with it.

2613
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,720
And we'll do it there, but I hope we get it here too.

2614
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:49,720
Yeah, I know.

2615
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:52,560
I think I get a feeling that we'll have it.

2616
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,480
I just don't, it probably won't be before it opens in Epic Universe, I'm guessing, but

2617
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,480
who knows?

2618
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:58,960
I hope I'm wrong about that.

2619
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:07,400
But yes, now it does feel like, yeah, it feels like we want for the definitive ride.

2620
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,120
It doesn't feel like this is it.

2621
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:12,320
And I'm wondering what people will say after they ride.

2622
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:16,120
I know a lot of people have done it already, but I wonder if this is, I feel like it's

2623
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:20,160
going to, I don't feel like we're being, this is not going to be unpopular, I don't think.

2624
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:23,800
I think most people probably will feel similarly, but maybe I'm wrong.

2625
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:24,800
I think so.

2626
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:32,160
I think they tried to have too much game, too many game elements and like, man, we tease

2627
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:37,880
sometimes about how much people talk about story, but like, I was kind of missing, like,

2628
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:41,480
ah, kind of could have used more of a A to B story on this one.

2629
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:42,480
Sure.

2630
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:43,480
Yeah.

2631
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,480
I think William Pilken's better.

2632
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:45,480
Ah, yeah.

2633
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:46,480
Yeah.

2634
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:48,760
Well, you get the buttons.

2635
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:50,720
You get tactiles and say, I know.

2636
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,960
And they give you, you really feel that.

2637
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:55,280
You're in the actual cockpit.

2638
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:56,680
It's exactly the same.

2639
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:59,800
The video, there's the ride itself leaves stuff to be desired.

2640
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:04,200
And I, you know, my, my complaints about the actual, like who's doing what and it's a little

2641
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:09,920
too busy and there needs to be a different ride, like a level basically.

2642
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,480
But you get that sweet coaxing.

2643
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:14,240
You get the coaxium and, uh, yeah.

2644
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:17,760
It has to stay as cold as a bomb pop.

2645
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:18,760
Yes.

2646
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:19,760
Ooh.

2647
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,920
Which is very, a Johnny pop, which has to be extra cold.

2648
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:23,240
Cause they're expensive.

2649
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:25,720
They have to be, they have to be kept.

2650
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:28,480
I have to bring a cooler to the sprouts.

2651
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:29,960
You need a cooler hallway.

2652
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:37,840
I need a cool hold what hallway from the sprouts to, uh, our house and underground tunnel,

2653
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:41,120
underground, cool hallway pops.

2654
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:44,480
But until you have that, uh, uh, yeah, Hey, we're open.

2655
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,480
I don't know.

2656
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:49,560
Uh, curious what everybody thinks is this controversial or not.

2657
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:53,400
Um, but for now you survived podcast, the ride.

2658
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:59,520
The only reason I'm going to stop you is because I think you said contra, controversial because

2659
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,520
of universal purpose.

2660
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:06,720
No, I said, it's a contra very calculated.

2661
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:11,400
If if it's a universal hot take, then it's, uh, I think it should potentially controversial

2662
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:12,400
going forward.

2663
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:16,720
We should be saying controversial before, like give that as a disclaimer before that

2664
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,040
I liked the tiramisu.

2665
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:19,760
Is that controversial?

2666
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,320
That old improv habits.

2667
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,320
No mistakes.

2668
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:23,320
Only gifts.

2669
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:24,320
Yeah.

2670
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:25,320
That's right.

2671
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,320
Especially not for me.

2672
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:27,320
It was not a mistake.

2673
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,320
It was very much done.

2674
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:29,320
It was on purpose.

2675
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:30,320
Um, so yeah, I don't know.

2676
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:32,200
Uh, we'll, we'll see what people think.

2677
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:35,080
And you know, I mean, mainly I'm feeling like we're a little harsh there.

2678
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:36,720
You think Comcast can take the hit?

2679
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:37,720
Yeah.

2680
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:38,720
I think they can.

2681
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:39,720
Jason thinks they can.

2682
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:40,720
I want to apologize.

2683
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:41,720
What they charge for cable and internet.

2684
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:44,720
Well that's look, Jason speaks for himself.

2685
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:46,200
I want to like to apologize to Comcast.

2686
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:48,160
All the good people at Comcast.

2687
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:52,440
You already did for saying that they cheaped out on that kitchen and shared with band express.

2688
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:53,440
Yeah.

2689
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:55,200
I made a lot of errors and I apologize.

2690
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:57,360
I actually know what I don't apologize to the people of Comcast.

2691
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:02,040
I'm apologizing to the company, to the entity, the corporate, this corporation is a person

2692
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:03,040
that's got more rights than us.

2693
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:05,360
We're so sorry to Comcast.

2694
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:12,320
Um, Hey, for three bonus episodes every month, uh, including one that we just did about the

2695
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:20,960
beloved, but unarchived local show, King Koopa's cool cartoons, uh, and other bullshit like

2696
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:21,960
that.
