1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Forever, dog.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,460
Warning, the following podcast is the origin of the podcast The Ride hosts.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,560
It may contain hamburger factories, substantial boats, and t-shirts that would make the big

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
Johnson people embarrassed.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,080
Come learn about Mike Scott and Jason's very regular childhoods.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,040
It's the parks that made us on today's podcast, The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,280
Welcome to podcast The Ride, where today we stop thinking about the theme parks in our

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,040
heads and focus a little more on the theme parks in our hearts.

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm Scott Gardner, driven by Mike Carlson.

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
I'm acting.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,960
I didn't know what that, I thought that was legitimately choking on food or?

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
Choking on my own emotions.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
I see, choking on emotions.

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Beautiful.

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Yes, that's good.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,320
That's what I want today is choking on emotions.

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,120
Let's all be doing that, Jason Sheridan.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,080
Yeah, let's get this actor some more jobs.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Let's get this man booked.

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Well, please.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
I say booked.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,720
Jason, I beg for work every week here.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,440
We beg for work on the show at this point.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
It's pathetic.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
So yeah, please, if you didn't hear that.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,480
We don't do it every week and I don't think you should start, but as much as you feel

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
like you need to.

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Yeah, that's true.

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
It's happened a few times.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,700
That's not so much our hearts.

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,840
That's more our guts, the rumbling, the stomach acid churning in our guts.

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,040
Needing hunger and eating treats.

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,280
I think more just anxiety pangs a bile.

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,560
If we're talking like, if you want like the lone gunman from X-Files on your show, three

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,640
guys who are a little quirky, a little strange.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,640
If you've ever seen the X-Files, there were the three kind of guys that were like Mulder

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,080
would go to like for research and they were kind of like conspiracy theory guys and they

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,120
would give them information, but they were a little odd and they had their own spin-off

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,520
that didn't, I guess, do well.

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,040
This is the three of us could do that on some show, I think.

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Sorry, you're pitching us as people who had their own show that failed.

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, no, no, I'm saying in the future we could be on a show, we could have a spin-off

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
and then it would fail.

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,760
But you're okay with the failure of the eventual show as long as we get the rates for recurring

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,600
on a more popular show.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Prime Time Fox, a full season of that?

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,400
Prime Time Fox one season in 1999 or 2000, whatever that was.

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,880
Were they on more than one season of X-Files or there was only one season?

49
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
More than one season of X-Files.

50
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,400
Okay, well so the lone gunmen are doing fine then, I would assume.

51
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,040
I don't know, but I'm just saying we're available in the same sort of like, oh these three quirky

52
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,400
guys for a show.

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,000
If your show needs three quirky guys, here we are.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,200
If your show is looking to hire three whites at once, just a big glut, let's really up

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
the white numbers.

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Maybe that's part of it.

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,600
I don't know how, but maybe that's part of it.

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,320
It's mocking the idea of that.

59
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
It's an ironic view.

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
That's right.

61
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
So here we are.

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Less than that.

63
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,360
The new lone gunmen ready to be inserted in your TV show.

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,560
And today you'll see the soul in the heart of us.

65
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,000
We'll see where we came from.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The origin story.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's right.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, that's the idea.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,480
What we're doing here today is Mike and Jason and I are all going to talk about a park

71
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,440
or a themed attraction that meant a lot to us growing up.

72
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,400
That's like way deep in the psyche.

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,560
And you might say, well, you do that all the time, but today this is not, we're not talking

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,600
no corporate Disney universal, the man, man.

75
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
That's not what it is.

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:03,500
We're talking about places that were local, that were homespun, and where even though

77
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:11,440
we maybe recognize the flaws and the chinsiness, it's always going to be in there.

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
It's part of us.

79
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,100
It affected us.

80
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,600
Part of our origin story, as Jason said.

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Yeah.

82
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,360
So we're excited about this.

83
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,400
There were many places even I think we could have picked, multiple places, but we've chosen

84
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
one.

85
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,720
So there's sequel opportunity for this episode too.

86
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

87
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,300
Well especially because I think we all, being that we all fetishized some place that wasn't

88
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,120
even meant to be enjoyed.

89
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,880
The fries electronics that was based around Alice in Wonderland.

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,640
That's a viable, but God knows I've talked enough about fries, but we probably all have,

91
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,360
there was a post office and the roof was interesting and that was the thing that had a lot of impact.

92
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh yeah.

93
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,440
I think I've said this before on the Woodfield Mall episode or maybe before, there was a

94
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,600
shoe store that had a little circle that you could sit in.

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,360
I forget even how to describe it, but there was a little play thing in the shoe store

96
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,960
and I was just like, this is the greatest place I've ever been.

97
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm trying to picture.

98
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,000
And that's probably a chain and I can't think of the name of it and people probably know

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
exactly what it is.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There's a slide inside as well, but to get in the store, if you were just a kid sized,

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,040
there was like a hole kind of that you could walk through and you could chill out in this

102
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
sort of hole.

103
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,040
You had a special entrance, a special entrance for kids in this mall.

104
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,160
Basically, yeah.

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Like the Imaginarium, that's what I said, the Imaginarium was a store with a little

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
door.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,720
I miss doggy doors for children.

109
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,400
I don't think I've been anywhere with my son with a tiny door meant for him and that

110
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,800
I couldn't fit into that.

111
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,400
I'd be humiliated if I tried to go into and we need more of those.

112
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
We should.

113
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,280
Somebody really should make, I mean, there's been so much talk of like Wonka attractions

114
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
over the years.

115
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,160
Somebody should make that like door, the tiny door at the end of the weird room when they're

116
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,320
about to go into the factory, something like that.

117
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,040
Obviously, that's not the way it's portrayed is impossible, but there's a version of it

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,960
only could fit in a certain door.

119
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,040
Make all those blustery dads and moms have to get on their hands and knees.

120
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,480
Make the mom and dads get hurt.

121
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,120
Make them scrape their knees.

122
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,800
Wear down their already worn down limbs.

123
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,960
Everyone's wearing suits and dresses because I guess it's England in this, 1960s in this

124
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
scenario.

125
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,440
They were all fancy.

126
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,200
That was like Disneyland in the 50s and 60s where you dressed up.

127
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,920
I guess that's a momentous day and they probably knew that Willy Wonka dresses up as well,

128
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,080
so they had to match.

129
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,840
There is a class element, I feel like, to Willy Wonka because Charlie and his grandfather

130
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,760
probably have the least amount of money of all of them too.

131
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,600
That's probably part of it, but also people dressed up back in the day.

132
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,520
Grandpa is wearing a suit, but it's probably like a less nice suit than the others.

133
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,200
Oh yeah, those snooty other people, they're on to him.

134
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,880
Remember it probably stinks.

135
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,640
He's sleeping with the other grandparents.

136
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,360
He's got his own elderly stink that's amassed the stink of the other elders.

137
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,120
Then they make nothing but cabbage stew in there, so probably every article of clothing

138
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,200
has kind of a cabbage reek.

139
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,800
He could have taken his annual shower though before.

140
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,880
I don't know.

141
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,120
Was that the situation?

142
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
There was one shower?

143
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Maybe.

144
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
I think it was a bath.

145
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,840
I think they were heating up a bath.

146
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,920
So that makes sense.

147
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,840
They're also using it for also cooking up cabbage in there to make stew.

148
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,720
They're getting the bath water to eventually eat.

149
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,640
Multi-purpose cauldron, yeah.

150
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,560
Will they show the grandpa bath in the Chamolais, whatever, the new Wonka?

151
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Chalamet.

152
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Chalamet, what's his name?

153
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Excuse me, I apologize.

154
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I like Chamolais.

155
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,000
Chamolais, funnier.

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,080
Will they show it in the new Wonka, the grandpa bath?

157
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
Sure hope so.

158
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,440
I'd like to see every detail, and with crazy CGI.

159
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,720
Yeah, CGI grandpa in water.

160
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,840
So anyway, childhood parks.

161
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,320
We're talking, yes.

162
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:08,600
So yeah, the places that felt like ours, where maybe you could go, you could talk to other

163
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,600
kids about have you been to Disneyland, but anybody could go to Disneyland.

164
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:20,040
These places felt like, almost to me, maybe I'll never meet anyone who also knew these

165
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
places.

166
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,120
Unless in your case, it was like, oh, all the kids in your area are talking about whatever

167
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
your thing is.

168
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,640
I think my case, some of the kids were talking about it.

169
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,760
I think it's pretty well attended.

170
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,960
It's been around for a long time.

171
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,680
So I wouldn't be shocked if people in the area at least went once.

172
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,360
But it definitely, it was not getting Disney levels of attendance.

173
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,760
But it is still open and it's been open since 81.

174
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,720
Mine is, I guess, should we roll into mine?

175
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,680
Yeah, well, we didn't talk about the order.

176
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,920
I was going to say, I mean, let's roll into yours.

177
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,640
I was going to say, does it make sense to go for the person to go last who thinks that

178
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,080
theirs is the worst?

179
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Yes.

180
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,040
Do you think that's yours?

181
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
No.

182
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Okay.

183
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
I don't think so.

184
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Jason?

185
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
No.

186
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Okay.

187
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Maybe it's me then.

188
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Yeah.

189
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,880
Having just been and revisited, I would say it's seen better days.

190
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,080
I haven't just been, but mine still seems kind of charming.

191
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Yeah.

192
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,440
I think Mike should start because a thing of mine I didn't realize until I was a little

193
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,400
deep into it.

194
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,240
It shares some things with what little I know of Mike's.

195
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Okay.

196
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,880
But mine also has gotten increasingly more elaborate where I learned things today when

197
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,160
I was working on stuff where I was like, well, I didn't know that.

198
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,960
And like, oh, this is a very funny folly for a thing to a car.

199
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Follies to come.

200
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Follies to come.

201
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Follies.

202
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Novelty garden architecture.

203
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
I was trying to find follies for mine.

204
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Roller coaster construction mishaps.

205
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,280
I was trying to find follies for mine.

206
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,240
I don't think I found any major follies that have been documented.

207
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,160
Well, then by all means, let's dive into yours, Mike.

208
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,480
I also think that something we should, let's compare, contrast these.

209
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,200
We'll all lay our specific parks and places out and based on those, we'll determine who

210
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,480
had the best childhood.

211
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,840
I think it'll be a winner.

212
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,680
I think it'll be clear.

213
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,120
So yeah, I guess let's start.

214
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,040
Brian, I have a video that I sent.

215
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,200
It's a pirate video.

216
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,560
I think we should probably start with that.

217
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,080
This is a newer commercial just to give you a little taste.

218
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,760
Discover a buried treasure filled with summertime fun at Pirate's Cove Children's Theme Park

219
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,320
in Elk Grove Village.

220
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
What theme park?

221
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Pirate's Cove?

222
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Children's theme park.

223
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Children's theme park.

224
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Come on, children's theme park.

225
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Come on, children's theme park.

226
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Come on đấy.

227
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Two to nine to explore.

228
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:54,560
So sail over to Pirate's Cove Children's Theme Park between June and August and take

229
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,880
me word, you'll be hooked.

230
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Yo ho ho.

231
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,400
So that's Pirate's Cove.

232
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,060
The graphic design has been updated.

233
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,680
It doesn't maybe look like it's been updated.

234
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,000
Home of the slowest moving kids in the whole state.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Pirate's Cove.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So I went there.

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
I don't know the first how young I was.

238
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
I was probably five or whatever.

239
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,880
And I've brought up this place a couple times and I think I've brought up a few times, not

240
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,840
five timers, but it's a couple times.

241
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,080
There was a UFO ride back in the day where you would go inside and there was a video

242
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,720
that would play that would show you launching into space.

243
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
And I thought it was 100% real.

244
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Oh cool.

245
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
And it flipped.

246
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,360
It made me nuts.

247
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,040
I thought we were going into space and I was so scared.

248
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,000
What's happening actually on the row?

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,280
What kind of ride are we talking?

250
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,360
We're talking a little UFO shaped place.

251
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,220
You walk inside, you sit down and they hit play on a VCR.

252
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,000
So not even, does the room not move?

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,360
Oh, this is not even a ride.

254
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,320
This is just a video screen that shows you like, hey, now here we go.

255
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
And then there's like a shot of the UFO that you're supposedly in.

256
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,040
It's probably like night, which doesn't make sense either because it's daytime when you're

257
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,800
in there and you're, but your kid brain doesn't, maybe doesn't put it together.

258
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,840
And then the UFO launches off into space.

259
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,000
And if you're little enough, you believe it or dumb enough, I guess you believe it that

260
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
you're going into space.

261
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,040
I wish I had that still.

262
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,800
Well, how great would it be every day that you think things like that or that you take

263
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,800
everything on faith at a theme park.

264
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,120
Yeah, I love that.

265
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
It would love to be tricked.

266
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,440
I love to get, yeah.

267
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,720
In wrestling, they say worked.

268
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I love to get worked.

269
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,080
I love to get tricked.

270
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,360
I like it when I think something might be real, but it's not.

271
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
That's fun.

272
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,600
Now, is it also maybe scary?

273
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,560
Maybe would also turn your day into a terrifying nightmare of like, oh my, like if you go to

274
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,840
Disney, you're like, I was on a runaway train and then there was any rocket ship going into

275
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,640
the middle of the space.

276
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,760
Like maybe it would be a little too intense, depending on your level to go into a mountain.

277
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,080
And there was a monster in the mountain several times and he swiped it.

278
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Yes.

279
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,280
On a woman in a puppy coat started screaming at me and she told me she was going to like

280
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,520
take me and help put me in a puppy processing plant or something like there is a little

281
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
too much.

282
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,200
I think that the face character should be saying something like there is a dirty old

283
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,240
house where the dead do not rest.

284
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,560
Almost a thousand haunted house telling them telling me that they're going to kill me and

285
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,680
countless ghosts.

286
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,280
I saw many, but by their math, there's a lot more I haven't seen.

287
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,160
One of them came home with me.

288
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,200
So that's why I'm just calling you right now.

289
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm quarantining.

290
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,160
I assume it's the same rules as COVID.

291
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,120
I feel like by two weeks that ghost is going to be gone.

292
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I just want to be safe.

293
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
I don't want you to get haunted.

294
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,500
I want you and you and be careful.

295
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,260
I saw my dad give his credit card.

296
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,580
He paid for us to go in this place.

297
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,460
This nightmare world.

298
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,460
We chose this.

299
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,820
We gave our hard earned money away.

300
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,180
So yes, exactly.

301
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,580
This is the this is I thought I was going into a real pirate ship.

302
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,220
I thought I thought a lot of it was real.

303
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,180
Obviously, as a lot of kids little kids do.

304
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,540
So now you may wonder why was there a UFO in the middle of Pirates Cove?

305
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,060
I don't know the answer to it.

306
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,060
I don't know the answer to this question.

307
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,980
I could not find even documentation that the UFO was there.

308
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,980
I know it was there unless somebody is going to tell me this is some weird like there was

309
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,220
a one off UFO attraction in a parking lot, someone which I do not believe it was at Pirates

310
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
Cove.

311
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,220
Yeah, there's two reasons, I think.

312
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,780
One, you can't copyright pirates or aliens.

313
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
That's true.

314
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,340
And two, yeah, just get in there.

315
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
Kids like it, probably.

316
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,820
Yes, of course.

317
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,020
Kids like aliens, kids like pirates.

318
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,140
So let's put up a slide, Pirate Slide one real quick, just to give you kind of an overview

319
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,820
of what the park looks like.

320
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,780
This is, again, a newer map in a newer version of it.

321
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,460
I was very happy.

322
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,300
So yeah, this is if you're yeah, we're on YouTube.

323
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,460
If you're just listening and you want to if you're dying to see what this park looks like.

324
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,740
Now a lot of it hasn't changed.

325
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,820
I would say that the big showpiece is that pirate ship right there, which is number five.

326
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,820
Pete's pirate ship.

327
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,300
Pete is the pirate.

328
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,900
OK, this is the IP of the Elk Grove Village Park District is Pete the pirate.

329
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,700
You heard I assume you heard him in the commercial there.

330
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,820
That's a performer playing Pete.

331
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:28,180
And this was like a really impressive ship to a kid because it had like stocks.

332
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,620
It had like a little jail in like the bottom floor of it.

333
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,820
But you could go on the top and they had the whatever the big wheel and you could

334
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,100
spin the big wheel around and going on it as a kid.

335
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,140
That was kind that was the whole thing.

336
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,460
That was the attraction to me is going to get to hang out on the ship.

337
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,980
And they had like I'm trying to think how to describe it.

338
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,340
It looks like it's gone.

339
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,380
But you used to be able to hold on to like these big yellow plastic pieces that were

340
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,220
on zip lines and like fly down into a bunch of sand.

341
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,980
Wow. Does that make you remember like something like not one of those where you'd hold on

342
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,740
like kind of with your two hands, but one there was like you would sit on this yellow

343
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,740
like seat and you would like hug this like yellow piece of plastic and then they would

344
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,900
shoot you down into the sand.

345
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,180
And that was so much fun.

346
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:23,220
And going to this thing, yeah, as a kid felt you knew it wasn't Disney, but it was it

347
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,980
was pretty fun and felt kind of special.

348
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,700
And I'm impressed that it's actually still there.

349
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,740
This was born built in 1981.

350
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,700
I saw some figure of like seven hundred fifty thousand dollars to build this, which

351
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,260
look, if you look at the video, it seems a little high.

352
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,660
No offense to Pirates Cove, but it seems a little high because like they had that I

353
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,820
believe they had that little train ride that we saw in there and they had the ship and

354
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,540
they had like a carousel of some kind.

355
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,060
But this isn't we're not there's not like any ticket to be found here, which is OK.

356
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,140
Maybe there was like a bunch of chemicals in the ground or bodies.

357
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,060
They were raising a bunch of corpses and that added to the expense.

358
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,100
Can we go to Pirate Slide six?

359
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,420
Now, these are these are walk around costume characters that I don't recall seeing.

360
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,940
Oh, wow. But these are fun.

361
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,220
These are fun as hell.

362
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,580
Pirate. And that's Pete with a giant head and a giant smile.

363
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,620
Like imagine like imagine Mickey Mouse at Disneyland, but he had like a big set of

364
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:28,100
teeth like imagine Mickey just like this, like big like Ren and Stimpy style human

365
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:33,420
teeth and the bottom row of teeth as big as big.

366
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,580
That's really the unsettling part here.

367
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,580
Imagine all like remember Sonic's teeth.

368
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,220
We all remember Sonic's teeth from the first version of the Sonic the Hedgehog trailer.

369
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,860
Oh, sure. Yeah.

370
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,140
Imagine those teeth on any of the costume characters at Disney or Universal like Woody

371
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,900
Woodpecker with big teeth or Frankenstein with big teeth.

372
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,940
And yeah, you're kind of in the ballpark of what this Pete the Pirate looks like.

373
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Yeah, he looks a little like a minor league baseball team.

374
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,020
Yes, that is going to do a foot race with other minor league baseball mascots.

375
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,460
And whether they're a pirate or a watermelon, they're all smiling.

376
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,340
Yes, they're all smiling.

377
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,180
What lucky team has a watermelon for a man?

378
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,060
Got to be got to be a watermelon.

379
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,020
I mean, everyone sends me I've gotten it delights me to no end when someone tells me,

380
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,300
hey, a minor league baseball team has a hot dog mascot now or like a scrapple mascot

381
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,100
now. And I'm like, well, I guess I got to buy more hats.

382
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Is there a scrapple mascot?

383
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,900
There is a scrapple one, I believe.

384
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,620
There's a pork roll one, I think.

385
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,580
Oh, my God. We got to look into that.

386
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,420
Yeah. A big piece of scrapple, though, is either just going to look like a brick.

387
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,660
It's just a slice. Yeah.

388
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,940
Is it called Scrappy?

389
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,020
I don't know. I don't know if they've assigned names to the character.

390
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,380
Like, well, we you need to you can't just wet our whistle a little bit.

391
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,580
We need the full meal here.

392
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,700
This may be a topic before the boys of summer are gone that we look at minor league baseball

393
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,140
That's fine. Yeah, I'm comfortable with that.

394
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,620
Before the boys of summer.

395
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,180
Oh, yeah. The boys of summer.

396
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,100
The term refers to baseball when baseball's over.

397
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:13,180
The song Boys of Summer is about baseball players calling it a season, basically.

398
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,420
Well, I love you even after the boys of summer are gone.

399
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,900
I didn't know this, honestly.

400
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,620
I think that's what I always heard.

401
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,260
Really? Did you know this? No.

402
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,860
About the boys of summer? I didn't.

403
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,340
I haven't I've tried to not think about the boys of summer as much as possible.

404
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:33,820
Well, I take a wild stab based on the general music tenor of the show that you both are fond of the song.

405
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,140
The boys of summer.

406
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,700
Both for both the Atari version.

407
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,740
I was just in a you guys I was in a casino just yesterday.

408
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,740
And I went I went well, you did a mic point.

409
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,340
The point that you do when an extremely obvious and omnipresent song comes on.

410
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,700
I think it was I think it was that it was playing in the bathroom.

411
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,860
But then when I came out into like the hallway of the conference,

412
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,540
so they're playing like Turn Down for What or something.

413
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,540
And I was like, well, they got multiple tracks.

414
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,260
They got multiple music setups.

415
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,140
Because Tari's, of course, the only difference is they changed the sticker.

416
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,220
That's right. That's a black flag sticker.

417
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,500
Isn't that interesting? What are you talking about?

418
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,740
There's a line I saw like a deadhead sticker on a cat a lack in the boys of summer.

419
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,340
And then they change in the Atari's version to I saw a black flag sticker on a cat a lack.

420
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,140
Yeah. But then it's that's the only lyrical change in those two versions.

421
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,900
Is there anywhere in this business pirate park I can drown myself?

422
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,580
Oh, yeah. Buccaneer Bay Boots.

423
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,380
I saw it. There are a number eight.

424
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,900
Do I have a lot of boat hit me in the head?

425
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,700
I don't actually have a photo of that because it's not that interesting.

426
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,860
I think they're like little kid paddle boats.

427
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,460
And I can't remember if they had that when I was younger.

428
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,700
I was always a little bit, I guess, scared of those little boats, but they're they're very shallow.

429
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:04,420
So let's see, let's go to slide three.

430
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,780
OK, we don't know. Hold on. Hold on a second.

431
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,780
Let me wait a reveal. I'm realizing it's a reveal.

432
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,300
Oh, OK. OK.

433
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,380
So when I was like nine or 10, let's say, I remember them announcing a big expansion.

434
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:22,260
For this place, this pirate's cove, there was a big thing coming next summer or whatever.

435
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,460
And I was pretty psyched. And it was a new theme.

436
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:33,540
It was Camelot. Oh, and my kid brain was like when I saw a photo of this, I went, holy crap.

437
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:38,660
This looks amazing. This is like some crazy like Disney style castle.

438
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:44,260
Now, I haven't thought about this in 30 years or whatever, or 20, however old I am.

439
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,300
And I found a picture of what Camelot looks like.

440
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,940
OK, all right. And here it is.

441
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,460
OK, OK. Remember, I built this up very big in my mind.

442
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,140
Place of your dreams. This is slide three.

443
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,740
OK. Oh, no.

444
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,740
It's like a giant like plastic like what you'd have in your backyard, just very big.

445
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,140
Yeah, it is not bad. But I went, whoa, that's it.

446
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,700
My memory of it was that was going to be a big castle like the ship was a big ship.

447
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,100
That's not the case. I mean, it looks fine.

448
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,740
This is a smallish theme park.

449
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,180
And you were imagine when like looking at that artwork of Galaxy's Edge before it opened,

450
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,540
like the ornate painting that was up outside of the site.

451
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:32,420
Yes. You thought that Camelot would be a 20 acre endeavor.

452
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,580
Right. The castle would tower high into the sky.

453
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,420
Right. I think it's like it looks like it's maybe 25 by 25.

454
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,780
And there is a big dragon slide, which is awesome.

455
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,060
And there's a little photo of it here. And we'll put some more photos online.

456
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,300
In the map, it looks like the dragon had an eye patch.

457
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,620
Does that square with your memory?

458
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,740
I don't remember the dragon. I'll say this about it.

459
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,420
I believe when Camelot was installed, it was the last year we went.

460
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,540
OK, that I was too old for it after this. So I don't remember a lot of Camelot.

461
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,700
Camelot was not in my like prime going days.

462
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,740
This was sort of I would love to know exactly.

463
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,220
But like no one no one was documenting this.

464
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,060
No one was documenting my life this hard.

465
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,500
Right. Because in the in the commercial and the audio of the commercial, it said ages two to nine.

466
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,100
Yes. And that is a certain certain kind of park.

467
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,980
Yes. Where it's like, oh, you're too old for this.

468
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,580
There's no role like the other place that I went to a lot with Santa's Village,

469
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,900
that at least had a roller coaster or two.

470
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,260
There were at least some like that had a like a tilt to whirl.

471
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,540
Yeah. Which is something.

472
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,780
Everyone can enjoy. But this is a little kid park.

473
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,700
So, yeah, so I did not get to I don't have many memories of Camelot

474
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,180
other than just seeing like an ad for Camelot.

475
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,500
So is a parent at Pirates Cove struggling?

476
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,740
Is there is it just like, well, it's something for them to do.

477
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,660
I there's I don't think you can get a drink if that's what you're asking.

478
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,780
I wasn't. But I guess that's a that's a fair question being that like

479
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,700
now I'll say that I have not had a drink with my son at Chuck E.

480
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,540
Cheese, despite having recently taken him to a far away Chuck E.

481
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,780
Cheese for him to see a full munch.

482
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,300
Right. I did want to introduce him to the band, which I did one by one.

483
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,140
That was a short trip, though.

484
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,460
Yeah. If he was having a full birthday there,

485
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,420
yeah, I would maybe maybe dad has a beer.

486
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,860
Yeah. Yeah. This was it was also 10 a.m.

487
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,260
And I'm not that bad yet.

488
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,300
Yeah. Yeah. Plus you want to be clear headed for the show for the Rock and Roll show.

489
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,060
Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't.

490
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,820
Chuck E. Cheese do Boys of Summer.

491
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,780
Can you do a quick Google?

492
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,580
Oh, I love that. Let me say especially early 90s.

493
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,500
Chuck, that seems very possible.

494
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,460
Yeah, I think so.

495
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,780
Where they do the song Sincerely, but then like, gee, Jasper, I love baseball.

496
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,980
See then the baseball players are going away.

497
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Didn't you know what that's the song was about?

498
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,380
It's November way past summer.

499
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,820
So you know what that means?

500
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,260
The boys of summer.

501
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,660
It makes me hate that in the song.

502
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:14,820
The boys of summer and slightly after and slightly before baseball ends in October.

503
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,020
Baseball goes forever.

504
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,940
It's not just summer.

505
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,860
Boys of summer by a long shot.

506
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,780
I got to look up that to see.

507
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,940
Well, fall balls got a very different feel to middle of fall ball.

508
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,860
Fall ball. You never fall ball.

509
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,420
I've never heard of fall ball playoffs in the series.

510
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,460
Let's see. So there's a better let me get a better picture of Pirate Slide five.

511
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,180
This is a better picture of the pirate ship because this is the main attraction here.

512
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,680
OK, yeah.

513
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:44,100
And it's it's pretty it's in my again, in my mind, it looked like the Black Pearl.

514
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,860
This isn't quite that, but you can see there's like levels to it.

515
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,780
There's cannons like you can pull like as a kid, you can pretend you're pulling the cat.

516
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,380
They don't let you climb like the top to get in the observation tower or anything.

517
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,660
Obviously, that would be too dangerous.

518
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
But this felt like stepping.

519
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,660
This felt like the closest thing to home, maybe other than a Chuck E. Cheese,

520
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,300
where you could get in some sort of like sort of imagine your place.

521
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,460
Sure. You could get in some sort of immersive place.

522
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,580
I can't recall anything else like this other than like miniature golf and you walk through

523
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,100
a castle, but then the rest is right. It was not as themed.

524
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,340
I would have I would have loved this for sure.

525
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,860
Yeah, a lot of this sort of stuff near me, it was either indoor family fun centers with

526
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:29,780
a small arcade, maybe a pizza kitchen and like laser tag, or it was a pool and one

527
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,020
water slide next to I-95.

528
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,460
You're like, is this the best place for this? Is this the best place?

529
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,380
Like, I don't think I have no memory.

530
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,900
I have memories of driving by the water slide by I-95.

531
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,740
And I know some kids who had like summer birthdays would do birthdays there.

532
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,900
I have no recollection of ever going there.

533
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,820
But this is slip one slip and you're on the road.

534
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,700
You're in the freeway.

535
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,220
This is so much more like lush green.

536
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,900
You know, it's going to say the grounds.

537
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,420
That's the adult in me now.

538
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Like, oh, it's very well manicured grounds.

539
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,060
Let's go to Pirate's Light 7.

540
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:12,020
I never saw anything really here or did anything, but this is the Pirate's Wharf fun stage,

541
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,700
which I found referred to just as the fun stage before.

542
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,100
So it seems like they can put shows up.

543
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,980
It feels like a local like concert band could do a performance here as well.

544
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,540
This is a confusing scene.

545
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,540
I feel like I'm seeing not just Peter Pan and Captain Hook, but also Maleficent, perhaps.

546
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,340
Maleficent.

547
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,020
I feel like there's an Aladdin in there.

548
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:41,860
I feel like a Tangled or Rapunzel and maybe a Snow White on the left.

549
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,340
Yeah.

550
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,420
This is, boy, this is an all-star.

551
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,500
The greatest crossover event ever.

552
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,380
Are these teenagers or children or college students?

553
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,860
Unclear.

554
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,460
Maybe 11-year-olds.

555
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,100
I mean, they look older, but the back.

556
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,260
But the backdrop is like a little bit of Pirates.

557
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,780
I don't know, like a little town in the Pirates, whatever IP version.

558
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,660
Tortuga.

559
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,260
This is Tortuga.

560
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,460
There's an academy.

561
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,580
There's a door that says academy.

562
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,540
There's a door that says marketing.

563
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,940
And then there's a door, two doors that are open.

564
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,980
Don't actually have doors.

565
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,900
They're just holes in the wall called Blackbeard's Bank.

566
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,180
So Blackbeard has a bank in this stage.

567
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,140
So you could put on any sort of show about Blackbeard and his bank and his various,

568
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,260
I don't know, financial holdings.

569
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,220
The FDIC refuses to insure my holdings.

570
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:30,740
Yeah.

571
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,900
Sure to chain up those pens.

572
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,700
Less GB.

573
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,740
Losing them.

574
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,340
Well, you've got safe deposit boxes, which is just McGruff.

575
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,660
Well, you've got safe deposit boxes.

576
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,340
What would McGruff say, but just with Yarg Mady at the beginning?

577
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,980
Be careful of counterfeit banks, R. Mady.

578
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,420
Yo hoi, ya landlubbers.

579
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,060
Be careful of counterfeit bike helmets.

580
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,900
Yarg, counterfeit doubloons.

581
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,500
Infest pirate chests wherever.

582
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,860
Also, you may be tempted, but don't pee in a pirate's chest, Yarg.

583
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,380
Yeah.

584
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,540
So yeah, I guess they probably put on little shows here.

585
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,820
And could we do a show on the Blackbeard's bank stage?

586
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,620
I bet we could.

587
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,140
I bet podcasts the right could.

588
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,700
I'm saying-

589
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,540
We'd be doing them a huge favor.

590
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,100
I think so.

591
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,020
And when I say show, I don't mean the live podcast.

592
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,820
I mean a live pirate show that I wrote for us.

593
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,320
Oh, okay.

594
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,380
Where Jason plays Blackbeard.

595
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,260
Yarg.

596
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,660
Yeah.

597
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,980
So and then Scott, of course, plays Peter Pan.

598
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
And I play a different Peter Pan.

599
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,820
I'd rather play Don Henley.

600
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,580
I play an older Pan, and Scott plays young Pan.

601
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,100
Yarg, I need some ID from one of you.

602
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,500
The big reveal at the end is that Jason is also Pan.

603
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
Blackbeard is a secret Pan.

604
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,340
Yarg.

605
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,740
He opens a magical chest that turns him into Pan.

606
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,820
I was just playing dress up.

607
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,940
I'm going to have the Disney lawyers secretly bust the show.

608
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,060
All right, well.

609
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,660
They'll all be disguised.

610
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,860
You'll think that they're pirate extras,

611
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,100
but then rip off their pirate clothing

612
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,420
and they're actually there to sue you for intellectual property.

613
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,940
Plain clothes lawyers like the officers sniffing drugs at the theme parks.

614
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,180
So the one thing, I mean, look, this is,

615
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,900
I was trying to find some controversy, not much controversy.

616
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,820
I found an ad for this in a Chicago Northwest Suburbs magazine,

617
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,660
which I'll show, I'll put pictures on Twitter.

618
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,620
We don't need to look at them now.

619
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,660
The one thing I realized is I'm looking through this,

620
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,180
and I don't remember if I brought this up before,

621
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,820
is that the Elk Grove Village Park District

622
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,940
seems like it's more fun than most park districts for some reason.

623
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,940
And it, there are like party rentals, places you can go.

624
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,660
And I remember that one time there was a birthday party in Elk Grove Village

625
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,340
and they had, I swear to God, an animatronic.

626
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,220
I cannot find any documentation of this.

627
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,140
I cannot find proof that it exists, but I'm almost positive that's where it was.

628
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,460
It was inside somewhere right next to Pirate's Cove,

629
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,740
because I remember being like, we're right next to Pirate's Cove in a birthday.

630
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,740
Now here's the closest thing I could find,

631
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,660
is that inside the park district, there is a birthday rental room.

632
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,620
And this is slide eight, Pirate's Slide Eight.

633
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,220
And this place is called, and let me just make sure I'm getting it right,

634
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,340
Jumps and Jiggles.

635
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:32,100
Now I don't know if Jumps and Jiggles is where I saw this animatronic,

636
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,540
but I believe it is.

637
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,500
I believe that at a certain point, Jumps and Jiggles had an animatronic.

638
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:42,340
And I cannot prove it yet, but if anyone out there knows anything about the Elk Grove Village

639
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,260
park district and Jumps and Jiggles and the history of it, let me know.

640
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,580
– An animatronic of what, you think?

641
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,940
– I don't remember.

642
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:57,140
I remember a very distinct sitting in a show, like a curtain rising up, and there being a robot.

643
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,940
– Based on the photo, it's kind of a circus situation.

644
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,780
There's some trapeze monkeys.

645
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,460
So it could have been a monkey, there's a bear on a bike.

646
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,980
– It could have been any of these things.

647
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:18,100
– It's got the high tubes where you're like, I don't know, 12 feet, 15 feet off the ground.

648
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,500
And one of them leads to a little fake helicopter, which is really fun.

649
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,460
– That looks new.

650
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,380
That looks like maybe that wasn't there when I was younger.

651
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,660
I'll tell you this, I love a nice high tube as a kid.

652
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:34,260
Holy crap, was I excited when you saw third story tube like this.

653
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,060
– Yeah, and I would always –

654
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,940
– The higher, the better.

655
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,300
– I feel like stand-ups or something.

656
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,820
People have stories like, ew, and then you're stuck in the tube with a stinky kid or someone's shit.

657
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,100
– Which stand-up has the axe?

658
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,900
– I don't know.

659
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
First off, I knew you were going to ask that.

660
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,020
But I feel like everyone has horror stories in the tube,

661
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,500
and I only have fond memories of a high tube.

662
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,540
– I don't care.

663
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,700
Kids could have farted on me all day in that tube.

664
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,620
I love those tubes so much.

665
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,580
I never noticed any.

666
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,860
Maybe I did notice a smell, but I was having too much fun.

667
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,660
– Your stand-up act is when you get in the tube with a smelly kid and it's great.

668
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,220
– And it's great.

669
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,180
– And it's great.

670
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,300
– Look, you got to accept that a high tube is going to be a little musty in one way or another.

671
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,820
– I don't remember a single moment when I was unhappy to be in a tube.

672
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,100
– You don't see them a lot these days, I don't think.

673
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,860
Like, Cheez-E-Cheese definitely –

674
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,460
– They got rid of most of their tubes, I believe.

675
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,100
– Yeah, but maybe independent play centers still have their – what are we calling them?

676
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,660
High tubes?

677
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,380
– High tubes.

678
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,500
Especially high tubes.

679
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,580
Ones that seemed like really high up.

680
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,140
Even though I was afraid of heights, my feet were not dangling.

681
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,060
My legs were not dangling in these scenarios.

682
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,940
So it just felt like you were going up in a cool little structure,

683
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,980
especially when you were a little kid.

684
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,140
– It looks like it gives a kid a chance to pretend that they're John McClane.

685
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,940
– Yes.

686
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:54,020
– What other scenario would you have where you're having to sneak through vents and be stealthy?

687
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,900
– That's true.

688
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:01,620
You're not called upon as a kid to save a Christmas party from terrorists very often.

689
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,180
– Exactly.

690
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,780
So, a little – I mean, look, was I allowed to watch Die Hard until I was 17?

691
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,580
No, I wasn't allowed.

692
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,100
– Yeah, I don't think I watched it until I was 25.

693
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,740
– Yeah, yeah.

694
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,860
I'm still catching up on all the R-rated movies I wasn't allowed to watch.

695
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,740
But, yes, high tubes here.

696
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,020
So I'm putting that out.

697
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,220
If there was an animatronic in Elk Grove Village, I want to know about it.

698
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,020
Send me letters.

699
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,300
Don't email me.

700
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,020
Send me a letter.

701
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,460
Explaining this.

702
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,540
– Also, Jumps and Jiggles, I just want to say, is my favorite Brian Setzer orchestra song.

703
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,700
– Yeah, that one's really hopping.

704
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,740
– Yeah, it really sings.

705
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,980
– I would say that's a cool one, Daddy-O.

706
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,180
I would say.

707
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,740
– Jumps, jiggles, jumps, jiggles.

708
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,540
– But I was trying to find, like, oh, controversies.

709
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,140
Did something dumb happen here?

710
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,580
And I really – there was an issue, I think, where some of the water had too much chlorine

711
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,780
and people got it in their eyes and they had to shut down for a little bit.

712
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,300
And I think there were some financial issues maybe at a certain point.

713
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,860
But it was all owned by the city.

714
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,700
So I think as long as they're charging money and recoup.

715
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,420
– That's interesting.

716
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,700
Yeah, my childhood miniature golf course is now owned by the city, which feels weird.

717
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,820
You're in an arcade that's owned by the city.

718
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,860
You're playing a giant Monopoly game that the city owns.

719
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,540
There's something strange about it.

720
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,220
I guess nothing wrong with it.

721
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,720
– Yeah.

722
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,520
– I don't know.

723
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:24,120
Is it a socialist's dream to have the state owning the themed entertainment?

724
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,680
I don't know.

725
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,040
What is DeSantis?

726
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,600
DeSantis doesn't want to own Disney, does he?

727
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,320
– This is poor business.

728
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,120
– He shouldn't, yeah.

729
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:35,640
– We have to cut the – why are we paying for the back and forth basketball hoops?

730
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,560
– I think, look, there's a lot of things wrong in the country.

731
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:45,320
But if a senator or a congressperson would slip in some, like, state-owned or country-owned theme

732
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,400
parks into bills, I wouldn't be mad.

733
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,480
– Just a little bit of funding for high tubes.

734
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,280
– Oh, gosh.

735
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,000
– Oh, yeah.

736
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,520
– High tubes everywhere.

737
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,440
High tubes at the bank, high tubes at –

738
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,560
– Viable transportation option, possibly.

739
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,760
Take a high tube to work.

740
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,680
– At the bank – I keep saying the bank.

741
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,840
At the post office, which is government-controlled.

742
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,200
– You're thinking of Blackbeard's Bank.

743
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,680
– I am.

744
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,520
I have Blackbeard's Bank on the brain.

745
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,280
– We'll all be thinking of Blackbeard's Bank.

746
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,360
– There's a bill in the California Senate to establish a Blackbeard's Bank.

747
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,040
Public banking and Blackbeard's Bank.

748
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,840
– That's what I'm thinking of.

749
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,360
– We're going to let the pirates take over the banks?

750
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,320
We thought the current financial institutions were corrupt.

751
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:23,960
– Uh-huh.

752
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,520
Yeah, no.

753
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,440
That's going to be a talking point in November.

754
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,400
So, anyway, this is it.

755
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,240
Yeah, this is Pirates Cove.

756
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,680
This is Jump and Jiggles.

757
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,640
– I have a question.

758
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,400
How maybe, Eith, if we're digging to the core here, how do you think that this –

759
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:39,480
– Oh, yeah, yeah.

760
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,720
– How do you think that Pirates Cove or Jumps and Jiggles affected you

761
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,360
in a way that maybe even Disney parks did not?

762
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,560
Is there any way that we should all think about this for all of them?

763
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,000
This specific place made you, made any of us the strange adults that we are today?

764
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,840
– That is a good question.

765
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,120
Here's what I'll say about Pirates Cove, and I guess then Chuck E. Cheese,

766
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,680
is that there was something to the fact that going anywhere that was far

767
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,600
felt like we were going to the moon, felt like we were going somewhere impossible

768
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,680
because we didn't travel a lot and we went to Disney World.

769
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,040
But that felt like an ordeal.

770
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,800
I got sick going on there.

771
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,560
It felt like we were going, we were no, or not no, well, we were, what's his name?

772
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,640
The other guy from the Bible going through the desert.

773
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,120
– Moses?

774
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,320
– Moses, thank you.

775
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,600
Gosh, Moses to the – it felt like an ordeal to go anywhere, like a stressful thing.

776
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:37,240
So getting to go somewhere themed that felt nearby, I think, made – that brought,

777
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,880
I guess what I'm saying is it felt like you went through such a crazy ordeal to go to Disney World.

778
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,200
That almost felt like a different universe.

779
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:52,280
So seeing the stuff in your universe locally was, I'm sure, part of making me weird and obsessed

780
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,800
with this stuff because it was –

781
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,080
– Having an outlet for it.

782
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,760
– Getting to go home.

783
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,800
After being on a pirate ship, after seeing Blackbeard's Bank and going home that night,

784
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,960
it brought it closer to the real world for me.

785
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,600
– Yeah.

786
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,080
– If that makes sense.

787
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,520
– You're like, what a day.

788
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,880
You're lying in your little bed.

789
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,600
– Yes.

790
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,360
– And you're like, wow, that was really fun.

791
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,600
– It was important to note that the bed was little.

792
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,240
– Yeah.

793
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,040
– It was a little –

794
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,320
– You're lying in your little bed.

795
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,960
– Little.

796
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,400
– Your little boy bed.

797
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,360
– Well, because Mike has always been six feet tall, so he, you know, stretched out of the double bed.

798
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,520
– That's right.

799
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,520
I was like that rock in that picture when he's like 16 and he looks like he's a 40-year-old man.

800
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,000
– Yes.

801
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,600
– So, yeah, Pirates Cove.

802
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,880
– I would love to see Pirates Cove.

803
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,440
I wish there was a Pirates Cove to take my kid out to.

804
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,520
– There are multiple Pirates Cove around, but I think it's generic enough.

805
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,600
– We could all start our own.

806
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,280
– That we could – each of us have our own.

807
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,200
Each of us do our own Pirates Cove.

808
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,200
– I could at least just put the sign that says Blackbeard's Bank on my kid's room.

809
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,680
– Yeah.

810
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,960
– You'd probably think that was cool.

811
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,280
– Yeah.

812
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,120
– And then charge him to get in.

813
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,080
– Wow.

814
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,520
Jason, let's delve in.

815
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,080
– Sure.

816
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,400
Great.

817
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:02,680
My park is called Playland, located on the beautiful Ocean City, New Jersey boardwalk.

818
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,520
Would you, Brian, please bring up that aerial shot of this park?

819
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,600
So this is just kind of establishing shot of part of the park.

820
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,880
As you can see, you got a Ferris wheel.

821
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,360
You have the type of ride that Dr. Doom is.

822
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,400
– Oh, yeah.

823
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,440
– That's our – yeah.

824
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:22,940
– Uh-huh.

825
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,440
– Yeah.

826
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,440
My favorite thing in this picture, if you look in the lower left-hand corner –

827
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:28,840
– I see it.

828
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,280
– You see a Tilt-A-Whirl.

829
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,960
– Oh, I thought you meant the Dairy Queen.

830
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,440
– The Dairy Queen.

831
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,760
– Yeah, that sort of caught my eye, too.

832
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,280
– So Dairy Queen comes into play later, but there is a Tilt-A-Whirl,

833
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,000
and that was my go-to every time I went to this park.

834
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,720
Slightly past that, a little deeper, you see a roller coaster track,

835
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,200
and that was called the Flitzer.

836
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,080
– The Flitzer?

837
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,360
– The Flitzer, yes.

838
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:54,680
– Wow.

839
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,240
With a Z?

840
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,920
– Yeah, with a Z.

841
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:05,480
So that opened in 1994 and closed in 2015, and I know this because, one,

842
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,520
I was very sad when it closed because I still stop at this park every summer

843
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,200
when I'm back at the Jersey Shore seeing family, but I also found out that local

844
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,880
roller coasters are pretty well cataloged on Coasterpedia.

845
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,680
– Really?

846
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,920
– Yeah, because of another coaster that comes into play.

847
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,240
– Wow.

848
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:31,960
– So I went to Playland pretty much from when I was born to present day,

849
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,400
and I should mention a connection to Mike's Park.

850
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,240
Brian, will you pull up that image that has the pirate ship in it?

851
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:52,360
This park was renamed at some point in the later 90s to Playland's Castaway Cove.

852
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:52,680
– Wow.

853
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,320
– Wow.

854
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,120
– Look at that.

855
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,360
– Yeah.

856
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,480
– Pirates all around.

857
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,320
– So it's a pirate ship, and this was very hard to locate.

858
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,840
I found it kind of on a half-functional website.

859
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,240
These characters that you see in the sign and on the pirate ship

860
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,760
are apparently named Captain Sebastian and his pirate chief.

861
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,440
– Wow, so this is not Blackbeard, even though he has a black beard.

862
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,920
– No, it's Captain Sebastian.

863
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,280
– Captain Sebastian.

864
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,080
– Captain Sebastian.

865
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,360
– We don't know where he binks.

866
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,440
– Anyway –

867
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,400
– Maybe it was on bank.

868
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,840
– Here's a more recent photo of this facade.

869
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:34,520
Brian, could you bring up that one that is charred, I'll say?

870
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,400
– Oh, no.

871
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,320
– Yeah, and so I couldn't remember if I told this story on the podcast before,

872
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,480
or if I told it to you guys just when we were sitting around.

873
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,880
So you'll forgive me for forgetting,

874
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:59,480
but there was a fire in January 2021, and this facade –

875
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
no, that's the shooting gallery, we'll get to that.

876
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,000
The front of it was pretty badly damaged.

877
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,000
And so this all was happening, like I was watching the news updates.

878
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,040
So here's the fire.

879
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,920
– Oh, my God.

880
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:20,120
– This was a four alarm fire that happened in January 2021,

881
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,360
and this was happening in the morning as we were about to record

882
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,240
the Fortune Teller episode with Avery Monson.

883
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,040
And I'm wiping tears out of my eyes.

884
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,440
– That's why you kept audibly vomiting.

885
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,400
That's why you kept saying, Captain Sebastian?

886
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,840
– Well, because everything was burned.

887
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,400
Brian, if you could bring up that aftermath picture

888
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,800
of everything kind of charred and burnt.

889
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,520
– Oh, no.

890
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,360
Oh, that's what we were just seeing.

891
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,320
That's where the Pyre, where Sebastian stood.

892
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,000
– That seems targeted, doesn't it?

893
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,920
– Well, the –

894
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,040
– Rival pirate?

895
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,240
– What's the law enforcement division?

896
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,960
That's the Bureau of Narcotics and Firearms and stuff.

897
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,360
They investigate it, because I guess they investigate arsons

898
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,360
above a certain level, and they found it was faulty equipment

899
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,120
like in the office space, like in the back.

900
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,480
– In the pirate ship?

901
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,760
– No, in the –

902
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,480
– Oh, I wonder it.

903
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,040
– The hangar.

904
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,720
That whole hangar.

905
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,480
– It was just, it's old and crappy.

906
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,240
And maybe buildings that weren't meant to have a lot of electricity.

907
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,760
This probably should have been torn to the ground.

908
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,640
– Right.

909
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,760
– Scott, that's a great point.

910
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,880
Brian, I'm sorry to just throw this at you.

911
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,880
If you could bring up the black and white photo.

912
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,320
So I borrowed an e-book of one of those images of America

913
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,000
with the sepia cover, as you'll always see.

914
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,600
So this is Playland back when it was apparently called

915
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,960
Bingham's Kitty Ride.

916
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,280
– Bingham? Who's Bingham?

917
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,640
– I don't know who Bingham was.

918
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,440
This was news to me that it was called Bingham's Kitty Ride.

919
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,000
– Just a nice guy who wanted a lot of kitties around.

920
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:04,360
– The hangar was originally used in the 1939 New York World's Fair,

921
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,360
and then packed up and put here as the boardwalk was developing.

922
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,240
And that's a thing you should know about boardwalks.

923
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,000
Fires happen a lot.

924
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,120
And you'd think, oh, a cigarette on the wooden planks.

925
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,000
Usually, no.

926
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,760
It's electrical issues from 80 to 100-year-old buildings.

927
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,640
– So you're saying there was no foul play at all.

928
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,360
You're absolving any sort of…

929
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,520
– Well, yeah, because most of the actual rides were untouched.

930
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:38,520
So what was taken by the fire was the arcade and the Dairy Queen

931
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,080
and my beloved Hamburger Construction Company,

932
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,680
which occupied one of those places.

933
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,480
– Oh, did this…

934
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,880
We talked about this recently, the Hamburger Construction Company.

935
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,200
– Yes.

936
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:46,520
– Yeah.

937
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,840
What's the deal again?

938
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,960
Was there anything important about it or just the fact that that was the name?

939
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,760
– Yeah, I mean, the food was always great,

940
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,840
and the mascot was a little guy climbing a ladder onto a big hamburger.

941
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,200
– So it was like a one-inch man who would complete a hamburger for you?

942
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,560
– Yeah.

943
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,400
– Was he going to sleep in it?

944
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,040
– Oh, yeah.

945
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,920
Where did he sleep?

946
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,160
– Which does sound nice, sleeping in a big hamburger.

947
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,600
– In between two big patties?

948
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,640
– I mean, assuming it was cool or room temperature.

949
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,200
– Oh, yeah.

950
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,120
– If it was sizzling hot, I might not want to be in there.

951
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,840
– The place was definitely not room temperature, certainly not air-conditioned,

952
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,120
mostly some fans.

953
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:30,440
And shocking no one, the poor beleaguered man about my parents' age

954
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,680
opted to just retire and not open the restaurant because they're still rebuilding.

955
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,320
– I see.

956
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:35,720
– Okay.

957
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,240
– So the arcade isn't back yet?

958
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,680
– The arcade's not back yet.

959
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,360
No, it's just kind of pylons and stuff.

960
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,640
But they are rebuilding it and they're rebuilding the pirate ship.

961
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,480
– Did anything – wait, you said those buildings were gone,

962
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,320
but did rides make it?

963
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,680
There are things that didn't explode?

964
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,640
– Oh, yeah.

965
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:58,120
Well, Brian, if you could bring up the blurry image of a shooting gallery with a gorilla in it.

966
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,280
So this was a shooting gallery.

967
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,800
Again, as far back as I can remember, this was there.

968
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,960
And I believe the creatures in it were from an old haunted house attraction,

969
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,280
that when they closed it, they repurposed them for a shooting gallery.

970
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,240
And there's not a lot of pictures of the shooting gallery online.

971
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:25,160
I pulled this from a very blurry YouTube video that I did not want to play

972
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:30,600
because it's mostly the skeleton coming out of the coffin on the right, screaming.

973
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,240
– Sounds scary.

974
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:31,640
– Oh.

975
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,200
– Yeah.

976
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:32,840
So there's a gorilla –

977
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,280
– Thanks for not showing a clip.

978
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,120
– There's a Frankenstein.

979
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,520
There's a skeleton playing a piano.

980
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,280
And you shoot them with the shooting gallery guns from Disneyland.

981
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,320
– Right.

982
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,080
And then it would just do something fun, I assume.

983
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,280
You wouldn't kill them.

984
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,480
– Yeah.

985
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,560
They would just move or scream.

986
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,320
A lot of screaming, a lot of shaking.

987
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,680
– It would be funny if it was just a –

988
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:52,920
– That sort of thing.

989
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,960
– You hit the ape and it was just a realistic version of like, oh,

990
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,120
and you kind of grabbed the hole and was just writhing in pain.

991
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,880
– You shot smart ape.

992
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,440
– Right.

993
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,480
Smart ape speak can somewhat convey feelings.

994
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,520
– Look what you've done to me, Jason.

995
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,960
– Why do you use your quarters to cause me pain?

996
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,120
– I hope it's just like his bow tie spins or something.

997
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,400
– You are same as Trump sons who shoot wild game for fun.

998
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,840
– Jimmy John's founder and you have lots in common.

999
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:36,440
– So could we pull up the image of the facade that looks like it's a slide,

1000
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,880
it's kind of curved.

1001
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,240
So when around the time that this was happening,

1002
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,120
that the fire was happening and the demolition of the ruins was happening,

1003
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,480
I was looking for pictures of the facade that were decent.

1004
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,200
And I found one from the 70s in the Library of Congress website.

1005
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,840
And I had never seen this facade before.

1006
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,600
This is what it looked like in the 70s.

1007
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,720
They're advertising a ride called the King's Tomb.

1008
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,640
And then there's the Hamburger Construction Company,

1009
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,560
which they kept this sign for decades.

1010
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,040
– I see what sticks out to me right now is of course the Taylor pork roll.

1011
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,320
– Taylor pork, that's right.

1012
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,240
– You just wanted to see the words Taylor pork roll on a nice TV.

1013
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,200
That's what this is all about.

1014
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,320
– Oh, me too, yeah.

1015
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,200
– Well, there's that.

1016
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,000
And then you can see the tiny man climbing onto the hamburger.

1017
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,600
– Oh, yeah, the tiny man.

1018
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,240
I like that.

1019
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,200
I like the Dairy Queen.

1020
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,480
I like the little Dairy Queen booth.

1021
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,080
I'm a big Dairy Queen fan.

1022
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,760
Do you know the Dairy Queen is still there, Jason?

1023
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,920
– No, that was in the fire.

1024
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,720
– No, that was in the fire.

1025
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,440
– That was in the fire too.

1026
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,720
So is that something rebuilt?

1027
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,720
– There's a smaller Dairy Queen further in the park.

1028
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,400
– Because here's, I think I brought this up on the show, but not for a while.

1029
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,320
I swear it has been a while since I brought this up.

1030
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:54,360
A Dairy Queen, they have certain items on the menu that are not, if say you open up

1031
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,280
a new Dairy Queen, you are not given access to all the different items you could possibly

1032
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,080
have at a Dairy Queen.

1033
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,520
But if you've had a Dairy Queen open for 30 years, you can still have, say, a cherry

1034
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,960
dipped cone because it's been grandfathered in at your location.

1035
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,280
And they will still send you the ingredients to make these old Dairy Queen treats.

1036
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,360
– That a new franchise would maybe not be allowed.

1037
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:16,920
– Exactly.

1038
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,000
You go to the Dairy Queen in the Burbank Mall and you can get maybe a chocolate dipped cone,

1039
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,720
but you can't get butterscotch and you can't get cherry.

1040
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:29,400
If you go to the Schomburg Dairy Queen, which I went to my whole life, you can get cherry

1041
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,880
and butterscotch because it's been open for so long.

1042
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,560
– Clearly this should have been the park that made you.

1043
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,760
– The Dairy Queen, yes.

1044
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,880
You could get a nerd's blizzard at the Dairy Queen.

1045
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,440
You could get a cherry dipped cone, which I recently got going back a couple years ago.

1046
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,040
But I wanted to know, this looks like an old Dairy Queen.

1047
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,440
And if they rebuild the Dairy Queen, will they still be allowed to serve the cherry dipped cone?

1048
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,040
– Oh, how do the grandfathered in limitations work?

1049
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:02,440
I would argue that it was an act of God, the fire, or whatever you want to look.

1050
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,600
The Dairy Queen didn't do it to themselves.

1051
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,080
– I agree.

1052
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:05,880
– And why would they?

1053
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,240
Because they would lose access to all of the grandfathered in recipes.

1054
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,240
– I would say this should be based on location, not physical walls.

1055
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,200
– I will argue this to the bastards who run Dairy Queen.

1056
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,240
– I'm in full agreement.

1057
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,120
I think this is great.

1058
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,640
I hope the people at Dairy Queen are as reasonable as you are.

1059
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,600
– Yeah, well, and there is a second Dairy Queen location within the park.

1060
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,000
So that to me says continuity of service, even during the rebuilding.

1061
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,200
– You can't have different things at the different Dairy Queens.

1062
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,000
That's bedlam.

1063
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,560
– I agree.

1064
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,120
So Jason, when you go back and Dairy Queen's back there,

1065
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,360
you got to tell me what kind of dipped cones you can get.

1066
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,240
– I'll keep an eye out.

1067
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,760
– Did you have cherry dipped as a kid?

1068
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,440
– Well, no, because we didn't really go to the Dairy Queen.

1069
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,480
We went to the local chain, the Coors soft serve.

1070
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,680
– You were anti-Dairy Queen?

1071
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,360
– No, we had plenty of Dairy Queens in our hometown,

1072
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,920
but in Jersey on the boardwalk, you went to Coors

1073
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,000
because they had the richer frozen custard.

1074
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,640
– Okay.

1075
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,560
Did you ever go to Dairy Queen on the boardwalk?

1076
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,760
– I must have, like occasionally.

1077
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,680
– Did you ever have a cherry dipped cone at Dairy Queen?

1078
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,560
– No, I've never had that.

1079
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,280
– Dairy Queen not that well represented out here.

1080
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,960
– There's more now.

1081
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,680
I would say they were not around when I was a kid whatsoever.

1082
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,760
– Well, a lot of the Dairy Queens out here flipped to foster freezes.

1083
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,120
– That makes me sad.

1084
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,320
– Those were like franchises that broke off from Dairy Queen.

1085
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,720
– Makes me upset.

1086
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,600
– Makes you sick.

1087
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,960
– I mean, hold on, I'm going to act again.

1088
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,480
I'm sad.

1089
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,160
– The sad noises are pretty good.

1090
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:35,560
– Thank you.

1091
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,600
– That's pretty accurate.

1092
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,800
– Either me or us.

1093
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,120
– Yeah.

1094
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:38,360
– Yeah.

1095
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,400
– Get to that because you know if that's the starting point

1096
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,000
and we know that the spin-off requires the most emotional range

1097
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,280
as with Better Call Saul, if that's where you're starting,

1098
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,040
think how deep you can dig.

1099
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,200
– 100% that's how deep I can dig.

1100
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,240
You've seen it here.

1101
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,560
And imagine the type of conversation you have with me on set.

1102
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,880
So, cherry dipped cones, you ever had one?

1103
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,320
You ever had one?

1104
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,920
Did you know that you can get your grandfathered in

1105
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,000
if you want to go to Dairy Queen?

1106
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,920
– How old was the Dairy Queen around where you grew up?

1107
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,720
Because if it was like 90s, then you probably wouldn't have had

1108
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,760
some of the things with it.

1109
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,880
But the further back it goes, I'm trying to think like

1110
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,480
Francis Ford Coppola, what did you have on your Dairy Queen growing up?

1111
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,200
– Hey, look at me.

1112
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,320
Don't look away.

1113
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,160
Was there an old Dairy Queen in your town?

1114
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,640
– Make eye contact with me because I believe you're lying.

1115
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,520
– Yeah.

1116
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,000
– So Francis Ford Coppola has made a return to television specifically

1117
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,280
and he's hired the three of us.

1118
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,000
– Well, it could be in a movie too.

1119
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,160
– And we're talking his ear off about Dairy Queen.

1120
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,360
– It could be in Tetros.

1121
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,960
– Tetro 2 is the lone gunman.

1122
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,400
– Lust, caution, the return.

1123
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,080
– Bram Stoker's Dracula 2 starring the three of us.

1124
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,080
What? What's so funny about that?

1125
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,840
I think it works.

1126
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,600
80-year-old Francis Ford Coppola decides to make Bram Stoker's Dracula 2.

1127
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,000
– So think about that, that it's not some new,

1128
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,080
it's a sequel specifically to Bram Stoker's Dracula

1129
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,360
that he comes back for.

1130
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:58,760
– That's right.

1131
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,800
– It's not a new Dracula.

1132
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,440
– Yeah.

1133
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,240
– Not a new one, no.

1134
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,960
It's the same one.

1135
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:08,200
Jason plays Peter Pan in that for some reason.

1136
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:08,840
I don't know why.

1137
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,320
– We filmed entirely at the Elk Grove Pirates.

1138
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,200
– That's right.

1139
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,720
It's a low budget.

1140
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,560
– So what else about Playland?

1141
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,160
I remember when we went to Playland,

1142
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,760
I was messaging a little with friend of the show,

1143
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,280
Sean Rice, who we met and hung out with a little

1144
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,120
when we were down in Florida a few years ago.

1145
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:33,160
Because he, as always, messaged when I mentioned Ocean City on the show,

1146
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,000
because his family went there growing up too.

1147
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,360
And I said, do you have any memories of Playland or weird stuff?

1148
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,040
I'm forgetting about Playland maybe.

1149
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,800
And he goes, well, we were a Wonderland family,

1150
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,040
so it was kind of an adventure if it was an excursion if we went to Playland.

1151
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,720
Wonderland is the competing park at the other end of the Ocean City boardwalk.

1152
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,160
Rides were a little bigger, catered to a little bit of the older kids.

1153
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,080
And one reason why we did not go there,

1154
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,000
every now and then we went there,

1155
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,640
but their tickets expired at the end of the season.

1156
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,120
– Oh.

1157
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,600
– Playland tickets are good forever.

1158
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,640
So we probably are still, if we go and do a couple rides,

1159
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,320
are probably still using tickets from the early 2000s or the 1990s.

1160
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,960
– So you bought them in bulk at a deal, at a discount.

1161
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,320
– Well, what happens, both parks do the same thing.

1162
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,320
Off season, the tickets are half price.

1163
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:29,240
And Playland also did a thing where on July 4th, all rides were half price.

1164
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,920
So if the Tilted Whirl normally cost four tickets, it cost two tickets.

1165
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,440
So that night we went crazy.

1166
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,360
So the play was to buy your tickets before the season,

1167
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,320
but if you bought Wonderland tickets,

1168
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,240
you had to use them before Labor Day or use them before mid-September.

1169
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,760
– Can you further define going crazy in this scenario?

1170
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,840
– We might do five or six rides in a night instead of three or four.

1171
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,160
– Oh, baby.

1172
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:53,960
– Holy shit.

1173
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,240
– You psychos.

1174
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,440
– You wrote it so many times that this happened on the Tilted Whirl.

1175
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,000
– That's right.

1176
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,320
– Well, first of all, two things.

1177
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,800
So in an off season, they would sell Playland tickets for half price,

1178
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,080
but you could use them if you held onto them till the next summer.

1179
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,880
That's what you're saying?

1180
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,480
– Yes, you could use them every summer.

1181
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,840
– So it's as if Disney gave, like Disney did some sort of a three-day deal

1182
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,320
that they do out here, but you could hold it forever.

1183
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,840
So you could stock up.

1184
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,160
– Which my family has done.

1185
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,160
– I 100% believe it.

1186
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,760
– Like 10 or 15 years ago, my dad bought a four-day park hopper,

1187
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,480
and he's like, yeah, we'll probably back next year or the year after.

1188
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,840
We'll use the other two days then.

1189
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,000
– But that's not, you can't do that anymore.

1190
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,880
– Not really.

1191
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,520
– Disney stopped letting you do that.

1192
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,560
So that's out.

1193
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,760
But the Playland hack still exists.

1194
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,840
– The Playland hack still exists.

1195
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:51,800
– Yeah, so I would always do the Tiddler Whirl and the Flitzer,

1196
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,680
and then ride three or four were like wild cards,

1197
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,760
which probably my most unpleasant ride experience happened there too.

1198
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,360
You know that ride where it looks like the arms of an octopus,

1199
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,400
and you're kind of going up and down, but you're also spinning?

1200
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,640
My dad and I rode one of those one night,

1201
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,560
and it went to the point where you're like,

1202
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,440
wow, they're giving us a lot of time on this ride.

1203
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,760
It went past that point to like,

1204
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,960
we're starting to feel queasy, we'd like to get off this ride,

1205
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:29,880
and it's still going, and we're like, please stop, please.

1206
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,680
And it just kept going forever.

1207
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:38,440
And the teenager finally ended the ride, acted like nothing was wrong,

1208
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,880
but we were just dizzy for a while.

1209
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,760
– Yeah.

1210
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,400
– And you never, you didn't question him?

1211
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,760
You didn't push him up against the record?

1212
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,960
– What was that? What was that all about, buddy?

1213
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,360
– No, I think we gave him some dirty looks,

1214
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,160
or like, yeah, but it was very strange.

1215
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,080
– Do you think in hindsight was it five minutes?

1216
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,000
Because those rides, what, last two minutes?

1217
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,320
– Yeah, it was probably between five and eight minutes.

1218
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,760
– Eight minutes is a long time.

1219
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,000
– Yeah.

1220
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,720
– It's been around.

1221
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,440
– Yeah.

1222
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,240
– Can I say the Tilt-A-Whirl,

1223
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,440
if you had asked me before, I guess non-Disney rides,

1224
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,440
Tilt-A-Whirl all day long was my favorite ride.

1225
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,040
I loved the Tilt-A-Whirl.

1226
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,880
I remember, I haven't pushed it in a while.

1227
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,800
I pushed that we should do a Tilt-A-Whirl episode.

1228
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,680
– Yeah.

1229
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,560
– I was so excited.

1230
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:19,880
– Okay.

1231
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,600
– Oh, I could gamble.

1232
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,160
– I was so excited.

1233
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,200
I haven't been on a Tilt-A-Whirl in over a decade also.

1234
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,960
Where is the nearest Tilt-A-Whirl from here?

1235
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,440
– From here, that's a good question.

1236
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:28,680
– I don't think.

1237
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,640
– There's maybe something, because I remember this came up.

1238
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,360
I couldn't even really say what a Tilt-A-Whirl was.

1239
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,400
– Or a Gravitron.

1240
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,800
– That's the one where the floor drops out?

1241
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,440
– Yes.

1242
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:38,920
– Yeah.

1243
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,320
– Okay.

1244
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:39,800
– Yeah.

1245
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,360
– Not really, other than maybe carnivals or something.

1246
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,840
– Is there like an electric daisy carnival we could all go to

1247
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,960
and get on a Tilt-A-Whirl and only do rides and not do the music that we paid for?

1248
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,800
– There's both a county fair and a state fair going on now.

1249
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,880
– Oh yeah, that's probably a good place.

1250
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:04,040
– Okay, so that was one of my discoveries about, so the Flitzer,

1251
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,280
I was saying, that closed in 2015.

1252
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,520
And another coaster called the Python also closed in 2015.

1253
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,800
That was the first upside-down coaster I ever rode.

1254
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,840
And I only rode it once because it was rough as shit and I hated it.

1255
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,480
The Python is now located, they sold them both.

1256
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:32,840
The Python is now located at a park called C.J. Barrymore's Family Entertainment Center in Clinton.

1257
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,760
– Michigan.

1258
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,600
– C.J. Barrymore? Who's that?

1259
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,720
– I don't know.

1260
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,080
– A very vain man, I think.

1261
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:39,640
– I am.

1262
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,520
– Poor woman.

1263
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,920
– Somebody who really wants their name out there.

1264
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,000
– I'm looking up C.J. Barrymore.

1265
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,040
– The Flitzer was sold to an amusement company and now travels around to carnivals.

1266
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,360
So it's still out there.

1267
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:58,360
If I can find a carnival with the Flitzer, I can relive my childhood.

1268
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,640
– Still called the Flitzer?

1269
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,120
– It is still called the Flitzer.

1270
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,760
– Wow.

1271
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,720
– What's flitzing?

1272
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,880
– It's unclear.

1273
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,680
It's kind of futurey, it sounds fast.

1274
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,080
But if I could just briefly talk about what replaced those two.

1275
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,720
It's a large coaster called the Gale Force.

1276
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,720
And if we could get that image that says Gale Force on it.

1277
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,160
Yeah, here we go.

1278
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,360
So this is a small compact coaster.

1279
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:33,320
It fits in the space of two smaller family entertainment coasters previously fit in.

1280
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,560
This is an SNS coaster, which is a major coaster manufacturer.

1281
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,760
Manufacture stuff for Six Flags parks.

1282
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,280
I think some joker the ride.

1283
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,880
Playland announced that this was coming in 2016.

1284
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,800
And the other rides closed in 2015.

1285
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,680
It did not make the 2016 opening day.

1286
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,600
In 2017, it was operating sporadically.

1287
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,360
But everyone said it was very pleasant and very rough.

1288
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,800
So they're like, okay, we got some new vehicles for it.

1289
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,320
That'll make it smoother.

1290
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,080
And then in between the, during the off season,

1291
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,200
they just decided to retrack the whole ride.

1292
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:25,880
They judged it to be not not ideal suitable for a human.

1293
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,120
Yes.

1294
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,880
So eventually 2018 comes around.

1295
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,760
It starts operating normally.

1296
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,440
And then in 2019, when they were running some tests on it,

1297
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,400
two crash test dummies flew out of it into the nearby hotel.

1298
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:48,040
Into the balcony or the window onto the roof damaging some shingles.

1299
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,560
Sweet.

1300
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,640
Like the stunt tronic at Spider-Man.

1301
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,800
So another thing to notice about Gale Force, why it might not,

1302
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,280
anytime I walk by, it doesn't seem to be running,

1303
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,680
is it costs $10 to ride this single ride or worse, 14 tickets.

1304
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,880
So you're better off just spending the $10.

1305
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,360
And this promotional image, Gale Force,

1306
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,480
not what you want to hear when you're at the beach.

1307
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,840
And these storm clouds look like these sort of storm clouds

1308
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:23,880
that roll in before a summer thunderstorm that makes everyone flee from the boardwalk.

1309
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,680
The promo image of Gale Force here is something where it's like,

1310
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,920
this ride would not be operating in these weather conditions.

1311
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,320
Yes.

1312
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,000
This would be extremely unsafe.

1313
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,880
This is not fun.

1314
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,400
This is not a fun storm either.

1315
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,920
This is a realistic storm.

1316
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:35,320
Yeah.

1317
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,040
Also a bold choice to call something Gale Force

1318
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,600
that was opening five years after Hurricane Sandy ravaged the shores of New Jersey.

1319
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,200
I thought, look, if I was going to punch up this art, I'd say, okay, regular day,

1320
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,000
but then like a cartoon cloud making like the blow,

1321
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,280
like he's blowing like a little bit and then he's got a little brain.

1322
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,960
And his name is Gale Force.

1323
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,320
And his name is Gale Force.

1324
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,160
And now we've got original IP on there too.

1325
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,080
Not John Force, Gale Force.

1326
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,520
Oh yeah, I love John Force.

1327
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,600
Just speaking of names real quick,

1328
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,760
I was just trying to figure out what CJ Barrymore is.

1329
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,240
Yes.

1330
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,760
And all I found, it says who owns CJ Barrymore,

1331
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,560
and all I see here is a guy named Rick Iceberg.

1332
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,480
So is there no CJ Barrymore?

1333
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,960
That's what I'm trying to name of Rick Iceberg.

1334
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,320
Rick Iceberg might be CJ Barrymore.

1335
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:21,960
Whoa.

1336
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,040
Does anyone want to guess what they renamed Python to at CJ Barrymore?

1337
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,240
Python 3.

1338
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:27,740
Nope.

1339
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,320
Iceberg the Rife.

1340
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,320
It's listed now as just Loop Coaster.

1341
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,320
Loop Roller Coaster.

1342
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:35,960
Boring.

1343
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,920
That's boring.

1344
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:37,480
Not creative.

1345
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:37,880
Yeah.

1346
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,280
Stinks.

1347
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,360
Yeah, no made up words like flitzing.

1348
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,240
That's what I want.

1349
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,140
Yeah.

1350
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,440
Well, what do you think, if you're summing it all up,

1351
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,280
what did Playland give you that the corporate parks could not?

1352
01:02:54,840 --> 01:03:03,240
Well, I think due to my parents' rational and cost effective method of like,

1353
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:08,520
all right, three rides tonight, please, three rides,

1354
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,600
and also we want to go home, it's late.

1355
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:11,800
We need to go.

1356
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,680
We can't go to the other one.

1357
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,640
The passes will run out.

1358
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,040
Yeah.

1359
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:14,840
Never wonderland.

1360
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,760
We're not a wonderland family.

1361
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,640
You hear me?

1362
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,280
It was that.

1363
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,480
And then also one summer, Playland just doubled in size

1364
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:29,320
because they took over the empty lot next store,

1365
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,360
next to this historic hotel, the Flanders Hotel.

1366
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,560
Used to have these massive, I'll just show you guys this picture

1367
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,600
because I don't want to make our poor engineer bring up any more.

1368
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:43,640
But this used to have three saltwater pools outside.

1369
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,280
Oh, there it is.

1370
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,760
Three saltwater pools.

1371
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,640
Hotel Flanders.

1372
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,120
There it is in full bad res.

1373
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:50,620
Yes.

1374
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,400
That empty lot to the right used to be, is where Playland is now.

1375
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,800
That looks like the Grand Budapest Hotel or something.

1376
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,120
It is very much a grand old hotel.

1377
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,240
And it's got a very detailed history on its website,

1378
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,440
most of which is like, and then in this year,

1379
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,000
the Flanders fell on even harder times

1380
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,480
because it dates back to 1916.

1381
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,080
So it's seen some things, it's seen some wars,

1382
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,280
but yeah, this is back in the day where the amusement was,

1383
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:27,320
you're on a boardwalk by the ocean and look at this public amusement,

1384
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,240
three saltwater pools.

1385
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,640
But those closed in the late 70s.

1386
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:32,600
It's how they all started.

1387
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,320
We wouldn't have any of these places if it wasn't just, hey,

1388
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,520
want to go to a pool?

1389
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,000
Right.

1390
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,400
Yeah.

1391
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,520
And there was a previous Playland on the Ocean City Boardwalk,

1392
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,440
which I think was just indoor roller skating and live music.

1393
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,160
And that, of course, burned down in a fire in the 30s.

1394
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,640
All these fires.

1395
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,840
There's a lot of fires in the history of New Jersey amusements.

1396
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,720
And New York too.

1397
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,240
Some of them were shady.

1398
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,840
Some of them were definitely shady.

1399
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,320
Yeah.

1400
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,880
The Coney Island, there were so many amusements lost to time due to fires.

1401
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,200
OK.

1402
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,960
We did the fire Final Four.

1403
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,280
Yes.

1404
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,560
Let's rank all of the...

1405
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,280
Theme park fires.

1406
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,560
Yeah, one of the best theme park fires.

1407
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,080
We should probably, ones with a low or zero body count would be nice.

1408
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:11,960
Yeah, those are out.

1409
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,680
Yeah.

1410
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,080
Anything that didn't kill anybody we'll rank.

1411
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:15,560
Well, now that...

1412
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,320
What if it killed people in the 20s?

1413
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,720
Then nobody, we wouldn't know them.

1414
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,280
The statue.

1415
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,400
It's not sad anymore.

1416
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,240
100 years or over is our statute of limitation.

1417
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:30,840
There was a fire at a gift shop called Fisherman's Wharf when I was very young,

1418
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,880
like six or seven.

1419
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,440
And we heard about it on the news.

1420
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,120
And I was like, is that the Fisherman's Wharf we go to?

1421
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:45,080
Which was just a shop that sold seashells and maritime souvenirs and Simpsons toys.

1422
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,440
The first generation of brightly colored Simpsons toys.

1423
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,520
It was my favorite place on the boardwalk.

1424
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,720
And then it just burned down.

1425
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,600
Oh, it was the one?

1426
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,080
It was yours?

1427
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:53,640
That was the one.

1428
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,120
Oh, yeah.

1429
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:54,520
Oh, no.

1430
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,040
File play or not?

1431
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:57,640
Unclear.

1432
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:58,840
OK.

1433
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,720
Unclear.

1434
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:00,440
I'm not sure on that one.

1435
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:04,040
If we crack one of these cases open, we may be in trouble though.

1436
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,080
That one seemed old in 1991.

1437
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,320
I know.

1438
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:12,120
But I'm just saying if we uncover some sort of mob thing going on that set a fire,

1439
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,640
then we're going to have to really be careful is what I'm saying.

1440
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,360
Yeah, yeah.

1441
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,600
Some podcasters are on to us.

1442
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,400
Yeah.

1443
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,760
I mean, it doesn't help that in a lot of these short towns,

1444
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,000
three or four families run most things.

1445
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,840
Gillian's Wonderland is run by the Gillian's family.

1446
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,600
One of the Gillians was the mayor for a number of years.

1447
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,920
Was Rick Iceberg ever a mayor?

1448
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,520
Like he was far away.

1449
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,360
Wait, here we are making fun of him.

1450
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,320
And now it like the icebergs rule the town.

1451
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah, we got to be careful.

1452
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,200
Yeah, we're going to get some scary packages and then send mail for us to Forever Dog.

1453
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:48,520
Chill.

1454
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,200
Or our chili packages.

1455
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,880
That's not fair to a dog.

1456
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,440
And whatever.

1457
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,320
I'm not taking the hit.

1458
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,280
I see package.

1459
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,160
Iceberg will put it.

1460
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,760
Find me iceberg iceberg.

1461
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,240
I'll take your head off and he'll put it in a big cube.

1462
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:00,840
You don't want that.

1463
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:06,440
So you're so the big the big take away this park taught you thriftiness.

1464
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,160
Yeah, it taught you how to save a couple bucks.

1465
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,680
But also like they did rotate rides a good amount.

1466
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,520
So I knew like, OK, there's some stuff that never goes away

1467
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,280
and some stuff that does change.

1468
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,240
And then occasionally there's like a whole other section of park

1469
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:28,840
because like the park practically doubled over the course of like one year.

1470
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,240
I think the the playland people bought.

1471
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:31,640
Oh, wow.

1472
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,280
There he is.

1473
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,240
Oh, Rick Iceberg.

1474
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,280
Oh, my God.

1475
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,080
We found Rick.

1476
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,800
This is Rick Iceberg's LinkedIn.

1477
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,800
This has been sprung on us.

1478
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,680
Yeah, Michigan.

1479
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,720
He's in Michigan.

1480
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:42,360
Oh, my God.

1481
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,760
OK, what do we what do we learn from that?

1482
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,960
President is the president.

1483
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,160
He's the president of C.J. Barrymore.

1484
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,200
Clinton Township.

1485
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,920
That might be there might be some power there.

1486
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,320
I don't know.

1487
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,200
And I'm president.

1488
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,640
We're going to have to dig in here.

1489
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,600
Rick Iceberg.

1490
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,120
Do we have a new guy?

1491
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,800
Do we say join to connect?

1492
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:02,440
This might be the our method of finding a lot of people we want to talk to might be LinkedIn.

1493
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,280
Yeah, more than it's Twitter.

1494
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,080
Oh, 100 percent.

1495
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,920
Yeah, we should we should really get on LinkedIn.

1496
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,160
How much I am on?

1497
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,880
I've got a burner on LinkedIn that I use to look up.

1498
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,520
What's the name?

1499
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,480
C.J. Barrymore.

1500
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,800
I don't remember what the actual name is.

1501
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,920
Is it a fake name?

1502
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,720
It's a fake name.

1503
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,280
Yeah.

1504
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:18,840
Oh, wow.

1505
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,200
You know what it is.

1506
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,760
I think I don't know if it comes up right.

1507
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,560
What do you think?

1508
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:24,040
I don't know.

1509
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,160
No, I'm not going to tell you.

1510
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:25,960
No, I'm not going to tell you.

1511
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:26,840
You know what it is, though.

1512
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,920
I use it to poke around on theme park people.

1513
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,440
Oh, wow.

1514
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:30,940
OK.

1515
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,120
J. Mysterioso.

1516
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,240
The guy with the big mustache.

1517
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,680
As the avatar or as the icon or whatever it is.

1518
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,800
How much power do the auto workers unions have in Clinton Township, Michigan?

1519
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,440
No, I don't know.

1520
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:48,360
We have to find that out before we make one more joke about Rick Iceberg.

1521
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:48,860
That's right.

1522
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,720
Well, moving on to me.

1523
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,760
Do I close it out?

1524
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,260
Yes, please.

1525
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,440
All right.

1526
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:02,360
Well, I would like to talk about the Balboa Fun Zone, which is part of the Balboa Peninsula

1527
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,480
in beautiful Newport Beach, California.

1528
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,600
We landed on this as an episode topic.

1529
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,080
We're going to talk about these core childhood parks.

1530
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,960
It happened to line up perfectly with that I was going there in a couple days,

1531
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,920
that my parents had rented a little house on Balboa Island.

1532
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:27,480
It's like a place where you rent little German cottages, and then there's the one nice street

1533
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,720
with the little bit of shopping and the fun desserts.

1534
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,920
So we did a little three generations trip where we took the boy down.

1535
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,240
And it was just a wonderful nice time.

1536
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:46,040
But it lined up nicely to where I could look at this place that I went all the time as a kid

1537
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,320
with fresh eyes.

1538
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,640
So it worked out perfect.

1539
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:57,080
Basically, so Newport Beach, it's like half an hour from Disneyland probably.

1540
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,760
My dad spent a lot of summers there.

1541
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,040
We would go down to visit my grandma who lived there.

1542
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:11,320
The area is maybe mainly known pop culturally as the basis for where Arrested Development

1543
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,600
spends a lot of its time.

1544
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,520
The Banana Stand is based on this area.

1545
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:23,640
The main drag of what's confusing is like there's Balboa Island, but then you go to the Peninsula.

1546
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:28,840
But anyway, this frozen banana stands around and there's that deal where two of them claim

1547
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:34,680
to be the original and there are only five doors from each other and they're mad at each other.

1548
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,920
What's the general feeling on frozen bananas?

1549
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,120
Because I wouldn't be fighting to claim them.

1550
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,760
I'm not a fan really.

1551
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,600
Like I'm once in a blue moon.

1552
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,800
You know me and bananas.

1553
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,720
It's a little bit of a little allergy.

1554
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,800
Oh yeah, what am I saying?

1555
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,800
Maybe the frozen though somehow knocks out the bad elements.

1556
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,760
Frozen does probably help knock the bad elements out.

1557
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,320
If it's got the chocolate outside of it, it's better.

1558
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,440
Just frozen by itself is not always the best.

1559
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,480
Sometimes you have frozen bananas, you're making a smoothie or something if you want to eat it.

1560
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,440
It's like kind of, I don't know, I don't love it.

1561
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:16,840
But if you got some chocolate a little bit on the outside, it's a good flavor.

1562
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,800
But I think it depends.

1563
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,080
They dip them right there.

1564
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:26,120
These things called Balboa bars that are really fantastic that are kind of like hand dipped

1565
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,440
Klondike bars.

1566
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,000
Oh yeah.

1567
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,880
You pick it and while the chocolate is hardening and you can do some other stuff.

1568
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:35,960
My kid loved it.

1569
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,600
I loved it.

1570
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,200
It might be up there.

1571
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:45,960
My dessert zone might be like it's the white, it's like vanilla with chocolate casing.

1572
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,000
They'll do that at California Adventure.

1573
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,800
They will make a version of that where they dip and they'll put some sprinkles or nonsense on it.

1574
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,760
Clarabels.

1575
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,560
Oh really?

1576
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:55,960
Clarabels.

1577
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:56,440
That's up at the front of the park.

1578
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,000
Named after the cow character.

1579
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,560
I think so.

1580
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,280
Yeah, you're talking about the one next to Starbucks, right?

1581
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:02,520
Yeah.

1582
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:02,760
Yeah.

1583
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,400
Yeah.

1584
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:03,640
Yeah.

1585
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,200
That's the one where you can get the Mickey Sunday in his pants.

1586
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:07,720
Sometimes.

1587
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:08,840
It comes in his little legs.

1588
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,280
It comes in his pants.

1589
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:10,520
Yeah.

1590
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,520
It comes in his pants.

1591
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,240
It's not what I-

1592
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:13,960
It comes in his pants.

1593
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,280
No.

1594
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,640
No, no, no.

1595
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:17,960
You said it.

1596
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,800
But that was when they first opened.

1597
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,720
They were like hand dipped ice cream bars and then pick what you wanted to roll it.

1598
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,040
Chocolate chips, sprinkles.

1599
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,160
I think those are still there.

1600
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:29,720
They're still there.

1601
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:35,400
This little main drag, whatever you call it in Balboa, it's like a, it's a real

1602
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:41,800
like stroll down memory lane for me because there's the two dessert places and then right

1603
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:47,480
between them is a very compact little church where we would go on vacations.

1604
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:55,080
I remember it really specifically from when the sermon was, the only one I remember was

1605
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,920
when the sermon was all about dogma.

1606
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,720
When the priest was-

1607
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,360
The movie dogma.

1608
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,400
Yeah, yeah.

1609
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,400
There is a film coming out.

1610
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,600
I don't remember the details of, there is a character who is,

1611
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,960
like what's Chris Rock in it?

1612
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,480
Oh, he was the 13th disciple.

1613
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,840
That's mainly, I think it was the, that's what they're trying to shock you with.

1614
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:17,240
They claim that there is a 13th apostle.

1615
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:17,960
Apostle.

1616
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,760
And he is quite profane.

1617
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,920
It's the only sermon I remember.

1618
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,760
Wow, that's so funny.

1619
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,360
The movie wasn't that popular.

1620
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:33,720
No, it's weird that they, that it even got on the radar of we're going to be mad.

1621
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,840
I remember a sermon about that and a sermon about powder.

1622
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,040
Really?

1623
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:39,480
Powder.

1624
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,240
It's my primary, I'd kind of just be like snoozing in church a little and then like-

1625
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:43,560
What was powder?

1626
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,840
A pop culture reference.

1627
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,800
That's the movie about-

1628
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,520
I know what it is.

1629
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:46,840
Yeah, yeah.

1630
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,560
Why powder?

1631
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,840
What was about powder that-

1632
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,720
I don't remember.

1633
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,640
Yeah, why was it anti-religious?

1634
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,120
Maybe.

1635
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,600
Does he have powers?

1636
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,320
Does he have like-

1637
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:55,720
He has powers.

1638
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,400
Why is it like a black magic thing?

1639
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:03,640
And if you get remotely imaginative, the Catholic league would be after your ass.

1640
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,120
They would just get so furious.

1641
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:11,800
They imply that a special boy named powder has powers akin to Jesus Christ.

1642
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,880
Were they mad about phenomenon?

1643
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,240
Like the John Travolta?

1644
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,560
I don't remember a sermon about phenomenon, but that might have been an off summer.

1645
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,080
I might not have been in Balboa.

1646
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,160
Michael was the Travolta angel movie.

1647
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,600
Oh, they loved Michael.

1648
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,200
No, Michael's a nice one though.

1649
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,040
That's a religious thing.

1650
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,560
That's an affirming movie.

1651
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,040
But maybe they didn't like phenomenon.

1652
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,440
Am I conflating phenomenon and Michael?

1653
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,160
I believe you are.

1654
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,760
Everyone does all the time.

1655
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:41,480
They're essentially the same vibe and obviously the same primary cast.

1656
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,640
It's an Armageddon deep impact kind of thing.

1657
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:44,840
Except the same star.

1658
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,960
Except the same person, yeah.

1659
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,520
And then powder was different.

1660
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,160
Though powder, I do get kind of confused with phenomenon.

1661
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:51,800
Yes.

1662
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,080
Because they were both like people that had like a problem that killed them?

1663
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:56,680
Maybe.

1664
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,960
I've only seen phenomenon.

1665
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:58,760
I've not seen powder.

1666
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,800
Kind of like Jesus.

1667
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,840
Kind of like K-Pax.

1668
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:01,880
I know.

1669
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:06,680
Now, I never confuse K-Pax with these other ones.

1670
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,200
There's only one K-Pax.

1671
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,400
So which is the twin?

1672
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:13,800
Is it Michael and phenomenon or phenomenon and powder?

1673
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:14,920
What's the what?

1674
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,120
Which is the what's the what?

1675
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,640
Which are the twin mood?

1676
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,600
It's like two sets.

1677
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,520
Phenomenon and powder are similar.

1678
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,880
Michael is angel.

1679
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,320
Yeah, thematically similar.

1680
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,000
And Michael.

1681
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,840
And phenomenon.

1682
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,200
And Michael are Travolta.

1683
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,000
Travolta.

1684
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,520
They're just Travolta feel-good.

1685
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,120
Where they're playing Motown songs and he's dancing around in a big coat.

1686
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,480
Elton John.

1687
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:43,000
Eric Clapton, I think, if I could change the world was on the soundtrack to phenomenon, I believe.

1688
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,600
I believe we've talked about phenomenon before and I believe I explained that my sister and I,

1689
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,400
when we came home from seeing it, we got a string and we tied it to her Barney doll's hand.

1690
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,360
And we started making Barney do phenomenon moves.

1691
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,280
Let's make Barney play phenomenon.

1692
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,400
We knew it was funny.

1693
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,080
We weren't like like we love phenomenon.

1694
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,080
We were just like, hey, mom, look what Barney's doing.

1695
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,800
And he's like making a spoon move or something.

1696
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,160
Barney's phenomenon now.

1697
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,360
Barney is phenomenon.

1698
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,880
Okay, just don't play powder.

1699
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,520
We there's no no playing powder in this house.

1700
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,960
No, no, we did not play powder.

1701
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,280
Wow.

1702
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:16,780
Wow.

1703
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:23,000
Well, you know, if they were opinionated about pop culture back then, I think that culture has

1704
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,120
remained in this area because here's okay.

1705
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:32,440
When I say that I got to experience this area with fresh eyes, I kind of wish that I didn't

1706
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,920
have fresh eyes because there are some things that I could not unsee.

1707
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:43,240
This area, if you don't know all of Orange County where Disneyland is, it's a very conservative

1708
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:47,800
area, so I shouldn't have been surprised, but it's also just I remember it from my child and

1709
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,880
it's probably louder and prouder now.

1710
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:57,800
Things you might see are a there was a private dock that had a mast, then they're flying flags,

1711
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:04,040
and one of the flags is a thin blue line flag, and another flag is a don't tread on me flag,

1712
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:10,760
which if you're in the area, not just of boat ownership, but of dock ownership,

1713
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,440
I think that's the that's precisely where you are not being tread on.

1714
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,160
No treading is occurring.

1715
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,080
It's all they're not creative signs either.

1716
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,640
At least give us some fresh signs, I feel like.

1717
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,760
Well, which we'll get into.

1718
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,360
Oh, thank God.

1719
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:29,160
Well, less flags and more shirts, which we'll find in the theme park.

1720
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,320
Oh, well, yeah.

1721
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:33,480
I'm very excited about some of these finds.

1722
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:41,560
Also, one thing that really caught my eye was a very ornate, like a nice,

1723
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:48,920
life-size sculpted statue of Ronald Reagan in a private backyard.

1724
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,120
What?

1725
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,240
We could see because it's overlooking the marina or whatever.

1726
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,760
So just among the plants.

1727
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,680
Well, it's a half Reagan.

1728
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,320
That's how you save money if you want one in your home, I guess.

1729
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,600
A bust, technically.

1730
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,560
But is it a bust?

1731
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,480
Because a bust is almost like shoulder.

1732
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,400
This was it was all the way waist down.

1733
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,240
So you had like full suit jacket.

1734
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,120
You had all of his buttons.

1735
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:10,620
Interesting.

1736
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,840
And he's waving.

1737
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:16,040
But like having I know they all love Reagan,

1738
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:22,040
but enough to where you're going to pay for a Reagan statue to where you live.

1739
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:26,200
You need to live with a half rate with a slice down the middle.

1740
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,080
Ronald Reagan, like a magician cut him in half.

1741
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:29,580
Yes.

1742
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,360
Like the cleanest cut, a perfect magician's cut.

1743
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,400
I'm trying to think about this.

1744
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:39,480
OK, do those type of conservatives love Reagan as much as I love like Michelangelo

1745
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,440
from the Ninja Turtles?

1746
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,000
I'm trying to think because I have, you know,

1747
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,520
quarter scale toys of characters I love.

1748
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:53,240
You know, so I'm trying to think, would I have a Michelangelo cut off at the waist full?

1749
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,840
Like it looks sounds like this is one to one.

1750
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,600
Like is it was it bigger than like Reagan would be or is it about like a human size?

1751
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,480
I think the size.

1752
01:18:59,480 --> 01:18:59,800
Yes.

1753
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,400
So it's like one to one, basically.

1754
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:04,680
Would I pay for that in my backyard?

1755
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,400
A giant?

1756
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:05,880
Oh, yeah.

1757
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,200
Yeah, I don't even like Michelangelo's.

1758
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:08,760
If I would get.

1759
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:09,720
What would you get?

1760
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:10,360
Michelangelo.

1761
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,160
Oh, he was your guy.

1762
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,000
Who was your guy of Turtles?

1763
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,360
I think it was either Leonardo or Donatello.

1764
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:16,860
OK.

1765
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:22,200
So yeah, so I'm thinking I guess in their fantasy world,

1766
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,800
Reagan is as cool as Michelangelo, which, by the way, not true.

1767
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,440
Bullshit.

1768
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,080
No, obviously not.

1769
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,720
Not nearly as cool as Michelangelo.

1770
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,480
So I guess I could see it.

1771
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,720
I guess I understand it from that perspective.

1772
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,600
If you think of yes, to a conservative in the 80s,

1773
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,280
Reagan is your Michelangelo.

1774
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,160
Yes, exactly.

1775
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,160
He's as cool as a Ninja Turtle.

1776
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,480
But how deep do they go?

1777
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,800
Are they watching Bedtime for Bonzo?

1778
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,520
Are they watching?

1779
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,440
Yeah, what movies of Reagan's do they like?

1780
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,600
His many shitty movies.

1781
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,680
That's a question is if you have.

1782
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,400
Because I do sense that people have to pretend to like The

1783
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,720
Apprentice if they love Trump.

1784
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,920
They have to retroactively like, oh, yeah, that was great.

1785
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,560
You're fired.

1786
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,280
That's funny.

1787
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:02,840
We love it.

1788
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,640
Yeah.

1789
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:07,720
But do you have to, oh, yeah, whatever boring Newt Rockne movie

1790
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,440
that Reagan.

1791
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,640
I bet some people do.

1792
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,960
I bet they like Andy was the finest act of the most wonderful films.

1793
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,560
More film opinions.

1794
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,320
I stopped and ate at a charming little hot dog restaurant.

1795
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:25,480
I had a very good Chicago dog there and not a lot of seating.

1796
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:31,720
So I was on like a little very narrow bench that was kind of like there were literally

1797
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:36,520
there were women at a counter inside literally talking over me.

1798
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:41,400
So I'm like under them and I'm hearing their whole conversation and I could not help but

1799
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:47,640
start to write down details because the conversation was these two women in their 5060s

1800
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:53,000
bemoaning how they just can't talk to their daughters anymore because it always becomes

1801
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:53,480
a fight.

1802
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,160
It always gets political.

1803
01:20:55,160 --> 01:21:00,600
And even when I lay out very clearly that look, the voting machines don't give you

1804
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,640
a receipt anymore.

1805
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,720
They don't even print out.

1806
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,200
Anymore.

1807
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:08,760
You know, yeah, the voting machine receipts sure proves that there wasn't mouth.

1808
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,680
If they show you a receipt, they can't have cheated.

1809
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:11,480
They there's proof.

1810
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,800
I have proof that my vote went in because they gave me a little CVS slip.

1811
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,360
Oh, wow.

1812
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:20,840
So yeah, you're talking people are just like literally the fight is happening because like

1813
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:24,600
somebody like mom, the election wasn't stolen and then it's over.

1814
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,040
Then the fight is the fight starts.

1815
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,240
You know, we start talking about if the if the election was stolen or not and then it

1816
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,520
becomes political.

1817
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:36,200
Mom, you used to vote in a thing where you pushed a bunch of levers down and you pushed

1818
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:40,040
a big lever to open the curtain to lead the voting booth.

1819
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,880
What receipt was generated?

1820
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,280
Did you have to you had to make the curtain go like you're operating a curtain at a play?

1821
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,200
Did you got did you not have that?

1822
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,240
Nothing that crazy.

1823
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:51,160
No, it's in the movie.

1824
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,680
If you've seen the movie Pecker.

1825
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:53,960
No.

1826
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:58,680
OK, there's a point where it is not powder.

1827
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:03,960
There's a point where Pecker and Christina Ricci, I think, are fooling around in a voting

1828
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,600
booth.

1829
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,720
Everyone's fantasy.

1830
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,840
And it's the ones with all these little levers in it where you click down the candidate you

1831
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:18,600
won and then the final big red lever registers your vote and opens the voting booth.

1832
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,360
Oh, it's one swoop.

1833
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,840
Yeah, that locks it in.

1834
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:23,720
Wow.

1835
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:24,520
That's exciting.

1836
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,080
I think voting numbers would go up if they.

1837
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,160
That would be fun stuff like that back.

1838
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,440
All my schools were like, you know, polling places.

1839
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:36,840
And so then if they were still around before after the election, they would take us in

1840
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,520
and they're like, here's how you vote.

1841
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,240
Oh, cool.

1842
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,600
This giant contraption.

1843
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,880
Oh, big old levers.

1844
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,680
Bring those back.

1845
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,320
I don't care who gets elected in the next presidential election.

1846
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,200
I don't care.

1847
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:48,920
It doesn't matter.

1848
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:49,320
Yeah, no.

1849
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,640
All I care about is big levers coming back.

1850
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,140
Yes.

1851
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:56,760
Anyway, then the conversation went in the direction you would think it would.

1852
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:01,720
And then it got into, you know, and it's even it's even happening at Disney.

1853
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:02,440
And I perk up.

1854
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,560
Oh, here we go.

1855
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,920
She says, well, you know, Susan, you know, she's worked there forever and she just quit

1856
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,440
because they're doing the woke agenda.

1857
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:14,920
They're going back into the old movies and they're putting in LGBT stuff.

1858
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:15,400
What?

1859
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,120
And that's not right.

1860
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,720
The movies from 50 years ago.

1861
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,600
And that's not right.

1862
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,720
That's changing history.

1863
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:20,840
Yeah.

1864
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,000
What does she they're talking about?

1865
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,640
They're making this.

1866
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,040
They're making the seven dwarfs kiss.

1867
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,720
The dwarfs are all kissing now.

1868
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,160
And I just I don't think that's right.

1869
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,080
Regardless of how you feel about it, it doesn't add to the plot.

1870
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,960
We don't need to see them just kiss for seven straight minutes.

1871
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,080
You know, say the kissing.

1872
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,040
No, no, no, no, no.

1873
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,680
Because I was like, for a second, I go, maybe he's maybe he's doing a bit.

1874
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,280
Maybe that is what the women were saying.

1875
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,280
I don't we're out to lunch here.

1876
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,440
So how did we can go pretty far?

1877
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,120
Mickey doesn't even do the magic anymore.

1878
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:52,040
The sorcerer comes in and he just gets on his lap and they make out.

1879
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,800
And I just don't think that's right.

1880
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,000
These fucking rubes.

1881
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,920
Who would have thought decades long diets of tab and lucky strikes and lead paint chips

1882
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:06,280
would just be rotting their brains in senior in their golden years?

1883
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,280
This is how they're spending their golden years.

1884
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:13,240
They're having like being not being mad at their daughters and be and quit

1885
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:18,200
and quitting companies that are due because of what they think they're doing that they aren't.

1886
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,840
I you know, I would at least give them credit if they were.

1887
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,880
I wouldn't give them any credit, but it would be something if they were like

1888
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:28,520
America Chavez and Doctor Strange 2 has two moms and you'd be like, well, that is true.

1889
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,560
They at least they're wrong, but they're saying true things.

1890
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,760
They don't have any facts.

1891
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,880
They have no facts.

1892
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,720
They're out to lunch.

1893
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,760
No, now it's Bambi.

1894
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:40,520
They went back in and gave Bambi to moms and it's just confusing.

1895
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,520
One of them dies, but the other is still around.

1896
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,240
So it reduces the lowers the stakes.

1897
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,760
It's just a worse movie.

1898
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:47,260
Yeah.

1899
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,600
So funny.

1900
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,800
So Sue's their friend, their friend quit Disney because of things that aren't

1901
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:57,880
happening and then but you know what it worked out for Susan because have you heard of the Genesis

1902
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:58,680
project?

1903
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,440
Oh, no, it's the Genesis project.

1904
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,840
Well, it's in Kentucky and it's very it's great.

1905
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:03,880
They have a Noah's Ark.

1906
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,400
They made a Noah's Ark.

1907
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,360
Let's go.

1908
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:11,320
Yes, they started talking about if you remember our episode about the Ark encounter where they

1909
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:15,880
made a life like Noah's Ark with dinosaurs in it because it had to be to the letter of the Bible

1910
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:20,920
and they have a creation museum and it's so we so I'm overhearing conversation about their

1911
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,480
friend who left Disney to go work for Ken Ham.

1912
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:23,980
Wow.

1913
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:24,760
Is that his name?

1914
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,260
Yeah.

1915
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:25,760
Yeah.

1916
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,800
Iceberg and Ham.

1917
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,520
I'm not saying they're too similar.

1918
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,480
I'm just saying they're fun names.

1919
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:37,560
That's the X versus sever 2022 podcasting 2022 Iceberg versus Ham.

1920
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,560
Somebody went to work for Ham, which who?

1921
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:41,800
Yeah.

1922
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:42,200
Yeah.

1923
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,960
A Disney to Ham defector.

1924
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,800
I don't know if they happen often.

1925
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,640
I was very scared when she brought up the Genesis project.

1926
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:50,920
What is this?

1927
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,520
Oh, yeah, that could have been anything.

1928
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,640
What have you heard of?

1929
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,400
Do you know about monkeypox that's going around?

1930
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,840
Well, the Genesis project invented that.

1931
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:03,560
They released it to control the population and just kind of like narrow it down to who we.

1932
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,560
It could also have been just like some shell company that Trump invented or something that

1933
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:13,080
people have been pouring money into just to line his pockets for five years and they have no clue.

1934
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:16,200
Well, the Genesis project, they're doing a lot of good.

1935
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,560
They're eliminating Professor X and his pesky X-Men.

1936
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,520
All these humans.

1937
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,880
They're working on some excellent lasers.

1938
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,040
So anyway, this is just all like.

1939
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,920
These are the costumed characters of the place you went.

1940
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:31,160
Yes.

1941
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,600
These are the fun ghost characters.

1942
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,120
The ghost town alive.

1943
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:37,880
Yeah, the fun local flavor.

1944
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:43,080
If you read just about people with horrible conspiracy theories and they're acting stupidly,

1945
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,080
this is where you go to experience it.

1946
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:45,720
Live it.

1947
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,600
And risk your own life because I started thinking like,

1948
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,640
oh, I'm literally like these women are talking over me.

1949
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:58,200
So if I maybe this wall will protect me, but if they feel the way I think they do about the COVID

1950
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:58,760
vaccines.

1951
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,960
Oh yeah, you should not put in there.

1952
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,360
Which by the way, the last I'll get to the rides, I swear.

1953
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,080
But the last time I was down there about six months ago with Aaron,

1954
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:09,320
we went to just this nice little coffee place and then there was a big gathering of like 70

1955
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,760
somethings and the conversation went where you thought it would.

1956
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,840
And then this conference, this following conversation happened.

1957
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,200
This guy like kind of holds court and he's like, you know, let me just ask,

1958
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,800
how many people do you know who died of COVID-19?

1959
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,120
And maybe one or two people raised their hands that happened.

1960
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,720
People lost some friends and he goes, okay, okay.

1961
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,640
Okay, now how many people do you know who died from the COVID vaccine?

1962
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:34,840
And no one, even in this group, no one raised their hand.

1963
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:39,480
And you could tell that this was a big deflation of the moment that he wanted

1964
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:43,000
because he's because no hands go up and then he goes, okay, we'll go because I know three.

1965
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,280
Three.

1966
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:45,880
You know, three people.

1967
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:48,120
Who died of the vaccine.

1968
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,000
Yes. Yeah.

1969
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,160
And it's only been, they've only been around for.

1970
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,280
Right. It's recent.

1971
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,960
Yeah. Yeah. A couple months at that point.

1972
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:54,200
Yeah.

1973
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,560
That was, so this conversation happened in like the same half mile.

1974
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:58,920
That makes sense.

1975
01:27:58,920 --> 01:27:59,640
That's the other one I described.

1976
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,440
That makes sense.

1977
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:03,160
So it's a scene. It's a scene down there.

1978
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:07,720
But all of this, I would not allow it to tarnish the nice childhood memories that I have because

1979
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:11,880
I love going here with my dad and my sister and it was fun to do it with my son.

1980
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,880
So I'm looking forward to, all right, here we go.

1981
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,080
We are heading to the fun zone.

1982
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:19,960
Once you get past the Reagan statues and the Genesis project conversations,

1983
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,600
then you get a really fun thing because you get on a little ferry.

1984
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,440
You get a ride before you get there.

1985
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:29,800
And there's this odd little, it's these flat platforms that hold three cars and a bunch of

1986
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:33,720
pedestrians and you drive your car onto the platform and then it takes you across this

1987
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,040
little body of water, which is just a fun.

1988
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:41,240
I think these are pretty rare, like little independently indie fairies.

1989
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,040
I like to check out the indie fairy scene.

1990
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:44,760
That's good. Yeah.

1991
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:51,000
It did give me some bad memories because they price the ferry based on your age.

1992
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,400
And they're so adults are one age, but kids five to 11 or another.

1993
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:59,640
And I was down there a lot in the summer where I believe I turned 13.

1994
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:08,040
And so whenever the guy running the like counting the coins when you paid for the ferry,

1995
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,280
who was probably himself 16.

1996
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:10,920
Sure.

1997
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,760
So he's going around and he looks at my dad.

1998
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:15,080
Okay. So one adult and one kid.

1999
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,920
And I, it gave me the most anxiety, like more.

2000
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,080
I thought about this for more.

2001
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,960
I got more stressed about this than anything in my adult life.

2002
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,480
It then worried about having a kid.

2003
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:31,400
I was just like gripped with anxiety about is that how young I look,

2004
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:36,840
how please make my dad pay 25 more cents on this ferry to make you seem cooler.

2005
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,080
Yeah.

2006
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:43,880
Yeah. I'm curious to see how you'll handle the like, well, if you, if you were to have

2007
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:49,800
a second child, I definitely have memories of my parents going, if anyone asks your brother is three.

2008
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:51,880
Oh, yes.

2009
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:52,360
Yeah.

2010
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:56,440
The little vacation lies because it could save you a lot of money.

2011
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:03,000
I mean, at Disney, it's the difference between nowadays, $150 and $0.

2012
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,720
Huge. Yeah.

2013
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:08,840
It just got me into a Minions Rise of Groove with the free.

2014
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,560
Oh yeah.

2015
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:15,080
I tried to take him to a movie and I was like, this might work if the Minions are on the screen

2016
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,360
as soon as we walk in.

2017
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:19,800
And instead it was a bunch of little guys with spikes who were mad.

2018
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:25,960
And my son got the most upset and like quivering lip I've ever seen.

2019
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,320
And we left instantly.

2020
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:31,240
So I ended up being free for everybody, but I'm glad we didn't pay $10.

2021
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:32,280
Yeah.

2022
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,600
To be scared of whatever opens the Minions movie.

2023
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,560
I'll never find out.

2024
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:45,320
Okay. Anyway, so once you arrive, it's a nice dramatic entrance with a big Ferris wheel

2025
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:46,920
right next to the harbor.

2026
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:48,280
And this is just very nice.

2027
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:56,360
I think a Ferris wheel next to a body of water like Playland had is just always great.

2028
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,720
You get legit views.

2029
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:02,920
They call it the world's longest Ferris wheel, I assume, because maybe they let you be on it

2030
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:06,840
for longer because there aren't a lot of people down there as much.

2031
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:07,800
There's not a demand.

2032
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,760
These days, yeah.

2033
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:16,280
Childish Gambino music video, 3005, filmed entirely on this Ferris wheel,

2034
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:21,320
as well as Nick Viall's first one-on-one date in season 21 of The Bachelor.

2035
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:29,320
So in the film Dirty John, also the mini-series Dirty John, which is set in this area in general.

2036
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,760
So Ferris wheel still there, still thriving.

2037
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:38,840
But then I keep making my way through the Balboa fun zone, and I think the fun has decreased.

2038
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:42,440
There's almost nothing to do anymore, which is a bummer.

2039
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:46,920
It's like, I think it's been COVID hit, and that's the bummer about it.

2040
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:49,720
And developers have always been after it.

2041
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,120
We had to turn this into condos or something boring.

2042
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,800
And I really hope it doesn't happen.

2043
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,080
But it already, there were bumper cars and there aren't bumper cars.

2044
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:00,440
There was a carousel that is now tables and chairs.

2045
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,000
So where it was, you could get a little afternoon of rides out of it.

2046
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,160
There's almost nothing now.

2047
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:12,440
What you can run into, as I referenced, are some fun shirts.

2048
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,680
And I think there are some slides labeled shirt.

2049
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,600
Let's talk about these really quick.

2050
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,640
So here's one.

2051
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:20,120
We're right.

2052
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,800
So zoom out of this a little.

2053
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,000
I'm going to have to tilt our heads.

2054
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:27,640
Here's one that says, don't be a salty bitch.

2055
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,960
And it is the logo.

2056
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,680
It's the famous girl from the Morton Salt logo.

2057
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,760
So this is fun, right?

2058
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:43,960
It flips the famous Morton Salt girl on her head.

2059
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,120
It really defies all the feelings.

2060
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:49,560
The associations we have about the Morton Salt girl.

2061
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,920
And then there's one more.

2062
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,440
This one didn't even strike me as crazy.

2063
01:32:54,440 --> 01:33:01,160
It's right-wingy, but it didn't really hit me as bizarre until Erin pointed out.

2064
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,240
So this shirt has a big gun on it.

2065
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:11,720
And it says, since we're redefining everything, this is a cordless hole puncher.

2066
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:13,720
OK.

2067
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,880
Now, I got a few notes.

2068
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:16,460
Yeah.

2069
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,240
What is a cordless hole puncher?

2070
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,400
Well, yeah, this was Erin's thought.

2071
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,720
Yeah, you know how hole punchers are all electric?

2072
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:32,600
First of all, we're all using them because we all need paper to have holes that we can

2073
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,040
put it into binders.

2074
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:38,440
We're never not punching holes into things, whether it be a single or a three hole.

2075
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,760
Hole punching, our whole lives.

2076
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:41,480
We love it, yeah.

2077
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:45,560
But the cords, we get tangled in the cords.

2078
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:46,680
So many cords.

2079
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:47,160
Yeah.

2080
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:52,440
Think about all the hole punchers you've ever used and the forest of cords that you end up

2081
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:53,080
tangled up in.

2082
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:53,480
Yeah, of course.

2083
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,640
But a gun solves that.

2084
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:01,800
A gun, first of all, eliminates the need for a cord when you're punching holes, but it

2085
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:05,080
also lets you punch holes into undesirables.

2086
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,040
It punches fatal holes.

2087
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:09,320
Yeah, what are you talking about?

2088
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,040
Cordless.

2089
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:16,440
If you took cordless out, I guess this is a hole puncher is a little flat.

2090
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:17,240
Yeah.

2091
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,360
This is a hole puncher.

2092
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,080
Cordless just isn't right.

2093
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,720
They're not electric mechanisms.

2094
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:28,440
And I looked up there are electric hole punchers, but they don't have their battery operated

2095
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:29,320
typically.

2096
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:34,920
Nowadays, I feel like the last corded hole puncher was decommissioned when Ronald Reagan

2097
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:35,880
was in office.

2098
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:43,480
We need to get back to the time of American values of Reagan and of corded hole punchers

2099
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,560
because it makes my shirts make sense.

2100
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,040
The point.

2101
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:52,120
Okay, so the philosophy behind the shirt is idiotic and the attempt at cleverness is idiotic

2102
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:52,840
as well.

2103
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,400
Yeah, just as a piece of writing.

2104
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,200
Yeah, I'm saying all the ways.

2105
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,520
This is four quadrant stupidity.

2106
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:04,040
This hits all the parts of stupid.

2107
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:10,920
You know what I was thinking just now that gender has to be thought about for two seconds

2108
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:11,800
and that's it.

2109
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:16,440
Well, if we're going to do that, then maybe let's change the names of guns.

2110
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,920
Let me get to my computer and type.

2111
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,440
Oh, man.

2112
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,120
You're also like, okay, all right, great.

2113
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:23,640
So guns, we're going to do it.

2114
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,960
We're going to reclassify them as cordless hole punchers.

2115
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:26,680
You got your wish.

2116
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:27,960
No, I want that.

2117
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,240
I want to call them guns.

2118
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:31,320
It was a joke.

2119
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,120
Don't do it.

2120
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,720
But anyway, all this is is is problem because the thing that I really want to talk about,

2121
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:44,680
and this has come up on the show before I've talked about my favorite ride that anchored

2122
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:49,080
this place and the place has never been the same because it does not it for many years

2123
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:52,600
now has not had something called the scary dark ride.

2124
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,680
I think the I'm putting in there falsely.

2125
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,840
It's called scary dark ride.

2126
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:02,040
You would walk up to this facade and you would find a big scary laughing woman.

2127
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:07,160
I think the character is laughing Sal, which might have prompted this discussion before.

2128
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:13,800
Yeah, kind of like missing tooth and stringy wig and she looks crazy.

2129
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:21,880
She's an unbalanced person and she is wearing like a sweater, like a fuchsia sweater.

2130
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:26,200
So, okay, what does that tell me about the scary dark ride that I'm about to go on?

2131
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,840
Well, it doesn't tell you that it like everything we've talked today.

2132
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:31,320
I talked about today is pirate oriented.

2133
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,560
Yes, it's all pyre.

2134
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:38,760
All of our kid things are pirates, but it's more than pirates though.

2135
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,640
It's everything.

2136
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:49,560
This ride is like it's it's pirates mixed with some haunted mansion mixed with seven dwarfs

2137
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,760
like mine kind of stuff.

2138
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:56,840
Isn't there a part in this in the Snow White ride where there's a bunch of eyes in the dark

2139
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,360
looking at you?

2140
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,920
Yeah, the old is the old wood scene.

2141
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:01,720
I believe so.

2142
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:02,600
Yeah, yeah.

2143
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,800
So that's in this too.

2144
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:08,840
And then there's like you pass by a bunch of explosive barrels like Mr. Toad or like

2145
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,280
a couple rides have.

2146
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:15,480
I don't know what how the pirates it's old treasure, but current explosives.

2147
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:19,640
This is the least discernible ride I have ever seen.

2148
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,720
It was so strange.

2149
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:25,880
It's the smallest space that a ride has ever been fit into.

2150
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:30,120
I swear like even a carnival like the traveling dark rides have some space

2151
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,280
and maybe even a second story.

2152
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:32,440
Right.

2153
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:38,120
This was so claustrophobic and just jammed in there to where now it is just an office.

2154
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:43,080
It has just become the corporate office for whoever's running the Balboa fun zone.

2155
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:47,880
You walk up to it now and it's just a gate and there's a door that says business office on it.

2156
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:48,200
Wow.

2157
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:55,960
And it's heartbreaking to me where something so odd like such colorful local flavor used to be.

2158
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,880
And now it's just business office.

2159
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:59,000
It's so boring.

2160
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,640
And it's all so right there in my memory.

2161
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:05,800
You walk up this awkward little flight of stairs and I remember the it's like little

2162
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,840
rounded bricks.

2163
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,280
I know them anywhere.

2164
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:11,240
It's always so eerie to walk up to this flight of stairs.

2165
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,320
I miss this ride so much.

2166
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:20,760
I actually I've discovered that there is a video of it because there's a listener Paul

2167
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,320
Durso.

2168
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:25,400
I think we've all met Paul and he I've talked about scary dark ride before.

2169
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,640
He's like, oh, there is a video of it.

2170
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:32,360
And thank God one person preserved it because otherwise there'd be so many details that

2171
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:36,840
would be gone like before you like you walk into like a crate.

2172
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:40,200
The right vehicle is a crate and it says I don't know.

2173
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,960
They all might say different things, but the one I saw says garlic on it.

2174
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:48,520
So you climb aboard a garlic crate to go to a pirate's mine.

2175
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,560
Sure, sure.

2176
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:51,800
It's so convoluted.

2177
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:56,680
There's like party city decor just like stickers and cutouts on the door.

2178
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:02,600
Then it's the creaky is to just like the the loudest track you've ever heard.

2179
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,240
Right.

2180
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:09,480
And then just occasional strobe lights and scratchy speakers that all just say dead men

2181
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,520
tell no tales.

2182
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:17,000
And other things say cursed be be blooming scala wags.

2183
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,040
And some lines are just inaudible.

2184
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:22,200
You just cannot tell whatsoever.

2185
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,320
This thing is so janky.

2186
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:30,040
But of course, it's a jankiness that I love that I was very fond of.

2187
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:35,160
And I remember because it was this janky even in the early 90s when I would have started

2188
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:35,880
to go on it.

2189
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:40,440
And I remember thinking I knew enough already about Disneyland that like, you know,

2190
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,840
some of these rides are from the 60s, but they still hold up.

2191
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,000
And I thought the same thing about the scary dark ride.

2192
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:50,520
Like presumably this is a 60s relic and it's rusted away and the speakers are bad.

2193
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,160
But you know what?

2194
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:54,280
That's part of the charm and we keep it alive because that's what you do.

2195
01:39:54,680 --> 01:40:00,760
Um, then in my little bit of research for this episode, I learned this ride opened in 1988.

2196
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:07,720
The speaker problems were not from age.

2197
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,640
It was just poor speakers.

2198
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:10,920
It was designed that way.

2199
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:11,480
Yes.

2200
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:11,880
Yeah.

2201
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:12,280
Wow.

2202
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:19,320
So I'm going on this and and the ride then was as old as Rise of the Resistance is now.

2203
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:19,800
Right.

2204
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,160
There was no sign of this.

2205
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:26,600
It was really like, I mean, it's like, I guess somebody like aging a lot from drugs or smoking

2206
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:27,240
or whatever.

2207
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:28,440
Fast, fast aging.

2208
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:28,840
Yes.

2209
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:29,080
Yeah.

2210
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:29,400
Yeah.

2211
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:29,960
Yeah.

2212
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:34,040
Uh, a rapid decline and that's kind of what happened to the scary dark ride.

2213
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,480
Although as Paul noted, somebody in the comments claims that they did the hand painting and it

2214
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:45,240
does have like cool blacklight painting from somebody who claims that they also did that for

2215
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:50,600
the Disneyland, the Fantasyland redoes in 1983 because some of it is

2216
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:51,800
legit.

2217
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:59,080
Like the actual the painting is of quality if the speakers are not and the story is not.

2218
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:06,440
But I just, boy, I love this thing so much and I miss it a lot and it deserves better than being

2219
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,080
an office.

2220
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:12,040
A bunch of things all closed in the fun zone in 2005.

2221
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:18,280
They tried to sell the whole ride to a museum in Temecula and then the deal fell through.

2222
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,920
So as of 2006, it was like, we're good.

2223
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,080
We will give you this ride for free.

2224
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:23,720
Oh man.

2225
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:25,720
And I, God, I wish I knew that.

2226
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:30,200
I mean, I wasn't, I like, yeah, I lived in a garage in 2006.

2227
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:35,560
I shared half of a garage with somebody in college, so I would have had nowhere to put

2228
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,640
the entire scary dark ride.

2229
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:44,200
But oh my God, today I would absolutely go through the hassle of the truck rental of moving the,

2230
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:48,440
I'm sure very heavy garlic crate ride vehicles.

2231
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,880
God, if I could have the entire, if anyone somehow knows what happened to the scary dark ride,

2232
01:41:53,880 --> 01:42:00,280
I would so happily fully recreate this in my garage, never have it for parking or recording

2233
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:00,840
ever again.

2234
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,360
My garage might be bigger than where the ride used to be.

2235
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,160
Oh wow.

2236
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:05,480
Yeah.

2237
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:06,760
So it would be a downsize.

2238
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:12,760
Well, you could pay for the public storage facility that would inevitably get broken into like

2239
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,960
everyone I know is rented public storage.

2240
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:20,920
It's like, Hey, you know that stuff you were storing, if it's gone.

2241
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:25,560
But if you kept it all powered up and then the burglar was encountered a strobe light

2242
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:29,320
skeleton saying, Oh yeah, boom and scale away.

2243
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:30,920
They're going to be out of there in two seconds.

2244
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:31,080
Yeah.

2245
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,360
It's its own security system.

2246
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,040
Learn the folly of their ways.

2247
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:34,200
Yeah.

2248
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:34,680
Yeah.

2249
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:36,360
This might scare them to death.

2250
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:37,080
I hope it would.

2251
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:42,600
So it sounds like it's the most depressing trip you could take now going down to

2252
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,680
admittedly.

2253
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:45,000
Yes.

2254
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,920
The fun zone was not the high.

2255
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:53,320
I mean what it became, but well, if here, if I could say what actually, if the, how

2256
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:56,680
this place impacted me, it's, it's on, it's on two levels.

2257
01:42:56,680 --> 01:43:02,680
One I'm like, how did this affect me in a way that the pilot pirates didn't or because you

2258
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:07,320
can never have ownership of those, but you can have ownership over weird bullshit.

2259
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:08,840
That's only in one place.

2260
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:13,160
And when I add up all the things that light me up, talking to people or on the show,

2261
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:16,280
it's always, do you know, there's like a big sad bear that's outside of the Rocky

2262
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:20,520
mountain chocolate factory or there's themes in the fries and this one's like a spaceship

2263
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,640
or there's a car wash.

2264
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:23,160
It's like an old river boat.

2265
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:23,800
For sure.

2266
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:26,680
That all came out of the scary.

2267
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:28,840
I don't want to talk about the haunted mansion.

2268
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:29,800
Everyone knows the haunted mansion.

2269
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,960
I want to talk about the pirates.

2270
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:37,240
Mine ride in a garlic crate that makes no sense and it's bad and scary.

2271
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:37,560
Yeah.

2272
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,920
Where my friend smoked weed one time and I still feel bad about it.

2273
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,920
We shouldn't have befouled this place.

2274
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:44,280
I'm still mad.

2275
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:45,720
It's not somebody I see anymore.

2276
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:49,800
And I wonder if that's personally why maybe he lost me smoking weed on the

2277
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:50,200
interest.

2278
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,320
Very dark red.

2279
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:54,760
You know, I would love, is there, is there any sort of research done on people's brain?

2280
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:59,320
Cause also in addition to just what you're describing, there is a type of person and

2281
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:04,120
I believe all three of us are this type of person that likes having a little thing that

2282
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:05,240
not everybody knows.

2283
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,080
What is that design?

2284
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:08,760
What is that called?

2285
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:12,840
There's something about our brains that like, oh, by the way, did you know?

2286
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:18,920
And I feel like it's maybe 20% of the population has some version of this.

2287
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:22,040
And it's the, it's the fandom I can relate to the most.

2288
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:25,480
That's sort of how, I mean, the fact that when we started talking about theme parks,

2289
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:28,760
the first time that the word screamscape came up the first time, like, okay, well,

2290
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,120
this guy knows his shit.

2291
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:30,520
Yes.

2292
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:31,240
Screamscape.

2293
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:32,520
It's dug deeper.

2294
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:39,640
Spent a good amount of time for screamscape for this episode because smaller parks are

2295
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,800
one of, they are pretty good at calling.

2296
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:45,400
I called it as a joke, screamscape a rag many years ago on this podcast.

2297
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,440
That was a joke, by the way.

2298
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:49,720
I just want to apologize to screamscape in case they thought that was serious.

2299
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:55,080
That was a joke, not just because it was a funny like reference to call them a rag,

2300
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:59,640
but also in that time we've seen just how bad theme park sites can be.

2301
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:00,360
Oh boy.

2302
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:00,840
Yeah.

2303
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,120
I might've met some of those ladies might be writing for Inside the Magic.

2304
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:05,160
It was not a real day.

2305
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:07,480
LGBT content going into.

2306
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,360
I mean, those ladies are doing the same thing.

2307
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:14,440
You know, they're, they're living their own Marvel universe and they're all in MCU with

2308
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:18,600
alternate reality, the multigirl multiverse they're in right now.

2309
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:22,920
Especially, I mean, a lot of conservatives, but especially Q people, it's like, yeah,

2310
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:27,400
they get to like live in a VR simulation of life at all times.

2311
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:28,120
Yeah.

2312
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:33,560
But if I could, if I could also be sincere, what I really love about this area is it was

2313
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:38,760
like the launching point for some very nice bonding and bike rides with my dad and something

2314
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:43,320
that I hadn't gotten to do since the one, two punch of pandemic and child.

2315
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:49,400
And it was so that like, yes, lots of like the, the places run down and bizarre conversations

2316
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:54,920
you're over hearing and, and confusingly written t-shirts, but riding bikes with my

2317
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:57,240
dad in that area, nothing replaces that.

2318
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:57,720
Sure.

2319
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:01,960
So that's what, that's what made me in this zone.

2320
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,640
And it's all, all priceless.

2321
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:05,000
And it was so nice to do it again.

2322
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:05,640
Yeah, that's great.

2323
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:09,320
I would have, I mean, I wish pirates cover here to get to do it again.

2324
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:14,360
I mean, maybe I'll do it at a certain point if I go back, but it is, it is, it would be

2325
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:20,760
fun to go do some of this stuff again to feel it, to feel the memories is what you're saying.

2326
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:24,520
Well, now that we've introduced everybody to these places, then they'll all be cheering

2327
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:25,080
us on.

2328
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:25,560
That's true.

2329
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:25,960
Yes.

2330
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:30,520
When we end up back there, when you're walking or when you're, when you commandeer Black

2331
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:33,160
Beards Bank and take it over.

2332
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:38,280
When I put a watch in a safe deposit box at Black Beards Bank, people will be very excited.

2333
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:38,520
Sure.

2334
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:42,760
And when Jason, next time Jason saves coupons at Playland.

2335
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:47,240
I am either adjacent or in Playland as this episode is coming out.

2336
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,000
Oh, no kidding.

2337
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:49,400
Yeah.

2338
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:50,840
Somebody might look up and see you.

2339
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:51,960
You get to see the magic.

2340
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:52,760
It's possible.

2341
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:53,080
Yeah.

2342
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:53,400
Wow.

2343
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,880
I've gone back, there were two summers I didn't go back.

2344
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:59,240
One because of a shitty job I had where they're like, well, we really need people.

2345
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:02,040
We can't let people take long vacations this summer.

2346
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:08,600
And then 2020, I did have tickets to go to New Jersey and it just, yeah, didn't happen.

2347
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:11,400
Well, it's going to be a great homecoming.

2348
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:14,040
I hope this was a good audio homecoming.

2349
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:14,360
Yeah.

2350
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:20,120
And tell us your version of this, the parks that made you, because maybe they're episodes

2351
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:25,240
or maybe we just laugh at a picture of something cruddy, but feel free to reply with those.

2352
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:28,760
But for now, you survived Podcast the Ride.

2353
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:34,600
And yeah, I don't know, fun little trip, I feel.

2354
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:35,080
Yeah, great.

2355
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:38,760
I just realized I'm parked on the street and you can't park after the time that it is.

2356
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:43,800
No, it doesn't know at six that you can park whenever.

2357
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:44,520
Isn't that right?

2358
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,960
I think it's no parking after six.

2359
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:46,360
Oh, shit.

2360
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:47,240
Well, let's get the fuck out.

2361
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,560

2365
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,320
Are you actually leaving too?

2366
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,360
Let's take a quick look.

2367
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:04,920
Dear nobody, there's no way.

2368
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,600
One of our cars are towed, Scott.

2369
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,640
I already finished that.

2370
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:09,880
That makes me want to, I'm going to take my sweet time.

2371
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:11,000
I want to thank Brian.

2372
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,760
Thank you, Brian, for being great with this.

2373
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:13,480
I have to go.

2374
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:15,640
Now you're saying we shouldn't be thanking Brian.

2375
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,560
Thank you, thank you, Brian.

2376
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:18,920
I also have to pee.

2377
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:19,480
Thank you, Sean Rice.

2378
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:21,800
You're going to end this nice moment with Brian.

2379
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,000
You're being selfish about your own car.

2380
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,680
I'm thankful for Brian.

2381
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:27,720
I thank him.

2382
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:29,320
Why didn't you go when I went?

2383
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:31,000
Because I'm more professional.

2384
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:31,720
Oh, fine.

2385
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,520
