1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I am, well, I mean, I'm Scott Gardner, but today I'd prefer to be referred to as Scott

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
1, spelled without the O, let's say SCTT-1, and I'm joined by...

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Mike Carlson, but for today, I'll be M, let's take the I out, MKE, which is,

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
is that an airport abbreviation as well?

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
MKE, like Minneapolis is something, Milwaukee, I think, the Milwaukee airport.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
MKE-, let's say, who?

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can be one, we can all be one.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's not diminish ourselves.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's true.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, you know what? No, no, no, here's what it is.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Here's what it is. I hate to waste everyone's time.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
MKE-L, Mike L.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, yeah.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Wonderful.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I got it.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Wonderful.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
All right.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And also here today is...

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to go a similar route, and this is J-N-J-A-S-N.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Wait, wait, wait, can I plus it up with J-8?

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
J-8-son.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, perfect.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, okay, yeah, let's do it.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Plus it up with confusion.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Today we are talking about...

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm so happy to be talking about the adorable purple robot who lived at CommuniCorps, specifically CommuniCorps East.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You may know him just from merchandise, from a recent retro poster that was put out.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You might know him from the opening day special of Epcot Center.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Or you've never known the name of this character, or you've been wondering when the hell are they going to do Smart One?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
There's any amount of answers here.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But I feel like we've done a lot of dives into Snark with lots of bizarre European parks and collapsing malls and whatnot.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And I'm just excited to gush for a while about our cute little buddy.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes, he is adorable.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think there was one opening joke a couple of years ago at this point in the podcast about how we wanted him as our best friend, something along those lines.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I should check that.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hardly a joke. Just a statement.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hardly a joke.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah. Just something we believe.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes. He is a character that I'm sure I saw as a child, but it feels like I knew him my whole life.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I feel like I might have as well, but it's very hazy, of course.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In my case, early 90s fuzz. I don't know what was going on with him.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He wasn't around much longer after that.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Because if you don't know the full...

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I mean, you probably do if you're on the second gate, but this communicor became interventions and then things modernized and got all VR lawnmower man everywhere.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And we didn't have the simple charm of the early 80s robot community.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The magic of that robot that looked like he was built...

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I mean, he looks good, I will say that, but he looks like he was built for Lost in Space or some 60s.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The 60s robot tradition was lost along the way at a certain point, which is a real shame.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm very fond of this area of robot, obviously.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I mean, I think Rex ties into it a little bit, although Rex is a little more wiry.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And I do like my little simple stout robots.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:15,000
As I've said before, my wedding cake toppers were R2-D2 and Ernie, who is the little stout robot from Expo 86, World Fair type thing.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You know, Tom Servo is kind of in this family as well.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's not that I prefer Tom Servo to Crow or anything.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I maybe like them both equally, but just Servo is another example of a little simple and stout.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Classic robot. I mean, like, would you put Rosie from the Jetsons in this category?

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I guess a little bit.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, just not stout enough.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Maybe she's not short enough, I guess. If she was shorter, I suppose she'd fit this.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Short is maybe what I mean. Yeah, yeah. I like Rosie.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
She's adult sized. She's sassy, though.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes. Which is fun.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think I prefer as little personality as possible.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I like, you know, in the way that smart one is just kind of I'm smart one, like as little going on.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's not complicate it. I guess that negates Tom Servo, who's got a lot of that, dude.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Do you like lost in space robots?

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I do. I'm not like I do not have that memorized thing. I've seen very little.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I honestly I have not seen a ton of lost in space either. I am a big fan of Dr. Smith, though.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There are many super cuts of like great Dr. Smith lines and he's very theatrical and I enjoy him as an actor.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He was a voice in Bugs Life, I believe one of his last roles that act.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, that's right.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He did a lot of voices, too. Yeah.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Mm hmm.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I like that design.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sure there's others in this family, sort of like simplified, like as little going on in the face as possible.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That helps.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, you know, we'll get to it. But there's a robot that is this is going to be a little bit of a backdoor pilot for a different robot.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And I'll say I'll say the name now, but we'll get to it might be a little later.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Very famous robot that has a similar kind of blank face.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Very famous.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, I have his credits here.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's pretty famous. He's more successful than like the his Adam Baldwin kind of brother, Pulsar.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, who's ever heard of Pulsar, Jason?

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Huh?

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I haven't even heard of Pulsar. I missed Pulsar.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You know Pulsar.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Do I?

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Do I?

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You know, the the I'll give you a hint.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
John Taffer.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, is he using a robot to clean up kitchens across America and bars?

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No, he Pulsar was a robot that he opened a nightclub with.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, yeah.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is the dancing robot from pulsations from pulsations.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Pulsar seems a lot like Seiko.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Pulsar seems like a variant of Seiko.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That is a brother of Seiko.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Made by the same company.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, wow.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah. Pulsar is not as famous.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Seiko. Seiko has been on the Goldbergs.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Seiko would introduce James Brown on tour.

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Seiko is on Family Guy still.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, I'm comfortable jumping around.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I mean, we're because I can tell you how I came to Seiko in our our recent research because okay, so we're you know, we're all picturing this this cute purple robot and I prepare to do my research and I'm thinking, oh, the first thing that I'll do is go watch that opening special of Epcot Center where with Drew Barrymore and Danny Kay.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And that's where there's a little scene where Drew Barrymore introduces Danny Kay to smart one.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And then I get to that scene and it's a little bit of a surprise.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And then I get to that scene and it's not smart one.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's an incorrect memory on my I assume there's a robot in that part.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So that's got to be smart one right now.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Guy rolls up way taller.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Big weird kind of bug eyes and introduces himself as Seiko.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So I don't know what happened.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I guess I just assumed if it's Epcot Center, I'm not sure.

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I guess I just assumed if it's Epcot Center, I'm not sure.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I guess I just assumed if it's Epcot Center, I'm not sure.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So I don't know what happened.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I guess I just assumed if it's Epcot and it's a robot, it's got a smart one.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And smart one's in it later.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Right. Very surprised by this whole Seiko thing.

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, they give Seiko like kind of a hosting spot.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And Seiko is not like a Disney robot.

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Seiko was just a very, very famous robot.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Extremely one of the biggest stars of the 80s.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
A puzzle made robot. Yes.

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
When you think of 80s. Amazing filmography.

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I mean, that's certainly true.

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yes. Yeah.

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But did you guys heard of Seiko Tilt?

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's really the limit.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Because I can say I didn't know Seiko.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Seiko and we know.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
OK, so I guess we're just going to get the Seiko stuff out of the way now.

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Funny enough, I'm looking through YouTube and I see the same clip you're talking about,

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
which I didn't even really remember.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And I go, oh, there's that robot.

147
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is exactly the same time as it breaks on Twitter that a movie Seiko is in,

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Rocky IV, Rocky buys Paulie a robot for his birthday.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And then later in the movie, people theorize that Paulie changes the gender of the robot

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
in order to comfortably have sex with it.

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
There's only two weird scenes with this robot in Rocky IV.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I have not seen Rocky IV all the way through, so I'm extremely confused.

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I guess I knew there was a robot.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Boy, is it baffling his presence in the movie.

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There's so much in Rocky IV you would love.

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm surprised that's not one of your top.

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I should. I'll do it tonight.

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think Rocky IV would probably be your favorite of all the Rockies.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, yeah, definitely true.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If it's got some bizarre plot elements that doesn't match up with the rest,

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
a la Star Trek IV and the whales, then certainly it will be my favorite easily.

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So word has come on Twitter that Sylvester Stallone is doing a director's cut of Rocky IV

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
where he's going to cut out the scenes with Seiko, which is madness.

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And this happens exactly at the same time as I'm looking at this YouTube video.

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I go, what the hell?

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And like Seiko meets Smart One in that video.

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They have a photo of it. They meet each other.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And it literally happened within a minute of me seeing this news.

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I woke up from a nap that I took right before we started recording

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and still in a dreamlike haze checked Twitter and the first thing I saw was Seiko.

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I thought I was imagining it.

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Like, why would it after years of dormancy, I mean, besides being very, very famous,

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
why suddenly is this hour is Seiko news breaking?

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I know it's crazy.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And there was an exchange.

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Did you see the Twitter exchange, Mike, with Stallone?

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Did he respond on Twitter? I saw him on Instagram.

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I think there was some Instagram.

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Was it Instagram where someone said, please don't cut the robot?

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And he says, I don't like the robot anymore.

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I did see that. Yeah, that was Instagram.

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's one. And the other one is, wow, a director's cut.

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Does it does it expand on the relationship between Polly and his robot?

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Sly Stallone official comment.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The robot is going to the junkyard forever. No more robot.

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No, come on.

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
God, this is this is wild.

188
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Nothing this year has made me mad until this moment.

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Finally, boy, seriously, fuck 2020.

190
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, I was fine with everything that happened this year, except for this robot news.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's all been great.

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So are we going to get, you know, OK, after years and years, the people being

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
oddly, brutally furious at George Lucas, people seemingly calling for the literal death of George Lucas

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
because he changed some things in his movies.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And do I like the changes? No.

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But I think it got a little extreme, didn't it?

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think our our people versus George Lucas, I think we got a little too angry about like,

198
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
what is this going to happen now to Stallone?

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Not that it should. Nobody should be mad that mad about any of it.

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But he should at least get a little taste of Lucas rage.

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, I think maybe the audience isn't quite as strong as far as Seiko love is concerned.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But he's very, very famous, though.

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He is very famous. But I mean, there's a lot of people that are very famous that you go,

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
well, do they really have any fans?

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You know, I mean, not Seiko. I'm just saying we don't know the size of the audience.

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I hope you're right. I hope Stallone is about to get an onslaught of shit.

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I mean, he's going to get it from us for sure.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm just saying I don't know.

209
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Is it days of our lives that Seiko was a cast member of?

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Seiko was a cast member on Days of Our Lives. Seiko is in SAG.

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Seiko is in SAG. Seiko was in a Carly Simon music video.

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes. Yeah, this all spun out for me.

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah, Carly Simon gives him a big kiss on the lips.

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes. Carly Simon really like kind of gets pretty wild on it.

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
She's kind of draping off, like sort of hanging backwards.

216
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's sort of like the sex scene in Showgirls, besides the sex scene.

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You know what I mean?

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't care for that stuff in Showgirls, but I love it here.

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There's no actual copulation, so that helps.

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's be clear also, the European vacation is over and Mike is back to square one.

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've reverted.

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Look, that happens. That happens. People regress all the time, you know?

223
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You get all these ideas on a vacation, we're going to come back and wear this kind of hat,

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and you know, it'd be wine tasting, and fancy meats delivered, and then you don't do it.

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But yeah, I got home and there was an episode of the syndicated show VIP on, and I said, no, no more.

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He started singing, give me that old time religion.

227
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah, and I'm back to square one.

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Cover up, ladies.

229
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So the thing I was most excited about though when I did my little research jag, of course, is the Seiko's musical career.

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, yeah. Wait, I didn't quite hear. I didn't save the... Oh, yeah, yeah, go for it.

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Seiko has two songs. I found one of them, and we'll save the second one, I guess.

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Much like ALF not so long ago, European music, correct?

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes. This is called Monomi Seiko.

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
With Seiko et Chloe.

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Seiko et Chloe.

236
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I couldn't love this more.

237
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We're just going to play like a minute of it, I think.

238
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I should have... I should have fast forwarded, honestly.

239
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Man, they're just giving pop singles away around this time.

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah.

241
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So that's about being friends with Seiko. My friend Seiko.

242
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
There's a cute girl in a yellow top leaning against him on the cover as his duet partner.

243
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And there's another song he has too, but I can't find it, according to this one video.

244
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
East Side, perhaps.

245
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah. I'll look. I'll look.

246
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah, I'm pretty excited. Look, I hate to get a Smart One episode going and then immediately put the spotlight on another robot, but your research takes you where it takes you.

247
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And look, I like Smart One. Smart One's cuter. I like Smart One more physically, visually, but the career just isn't as robust.

248
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can't not play also this. You mentioned one of his achievements, but I have to play this little moment.

249
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It is our belief that we will bring this sound back to our galaxy and enter into many, many years of friendship with your population.

250
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The only and ultimate form of intelligent communication is soul. And the master of soul is James Graff.

251
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He's just nodding his head. He's like he slides around and kind of like on wheels, I suppose.

252
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He looks kind of like a big vacuum cleaner. I mean, like, you know, I just I just revisited Get On Up with the horrible Chadwick Boseman news.

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And it's a fine film, but you sort of lose that like in his breakdown period, the shit like this was happening.

254
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Like, I guess it wouldn't fit with the tone of the movie, but it is funny to think, you know, things going on tour with robots and stuff.

255
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I mean, if we obviously we wrote that movie, it would be like Seiko would have been like a co-star, I think.

256
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, an equal partner like Seiko and Seiko sing with.

257
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, Chloe. Chloe. Yeah. Yeah. That's its own, you know, that's just on us.

258
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, but that's a different movie with Chloe and Seiko.

259
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's a different movie. So and then as I was starting to say, so the full story about the Seiko's less successful brother, of which there are multiple,

260
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Pulsar was used. There was a nightclub outside of Philadelphia that there was very expensive.

261
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They were opening it up. John Taffer, of course, from Bar Rescue.

262
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This is part of his myth making. His myth making is that he ran Barney's Beanery and then he.

263
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, that's oh, I'm so upset by that news.

264
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And then he ran the tiny little Troubadour. Those were like his early bar management jobs.

265
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But by that, is that do you mean the club, the Troubadour or something else called the tiny little Troubadour?

266
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The Troubadour is how they always used to refer to it on the radio.

267
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't know if you've I guess only I have heard that.

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But the Troubadour, I forget the guy's name. Yeah, it's a very famous venue in L.A.

269
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I've never heard the tiny little Troubadour before.

270
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I feel like that's what K-Rock always called it.

271
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Maybe I just listen to a lot of L.A. radio when I first moved here, drove around doing P.A. work.

272
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But so then Taffer, like as he gets more successful, like he's hired on to help open this pulsations nightclub.

273
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So for the opening, they had a UFO come down from the ceiling, a hatch open up on the bottom and fog come out.

274
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And coming through this was this robot named Pulsar.

275
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And the crowd went wild. Pulsar cost four hundred thousand dollars.

276
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And Pulsar was not the only Seiko, you know, kind of robot.

277
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Six legs Great Adventure had a similar robot named Sci-Fi that you could see in the park made by the same people as made Seiko and Pulsar, I believe.

278
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Wow. This robot did.

279
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
There was a Simon type of game that you could play on his chest.

280
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's what that said. Yes.

281
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Well, that's fun. Well, you can still buy a robot like this, the new version of Seiko.

282
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Did anyone find this? No, no, no.

283
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Here it is. Three hundred and forty five thousand dollars.

284
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He's got like a weirder new face with a little too.

285
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I think, Scott, you probably not like this because it's a little too human or humanoid.

286
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I mean, this he's this face is scarier to me.

287
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Definitely. Yeah. Yeah.

288
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's a little more war of the worlds.

289
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a little more alien, I guess.

290
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But they're not really calling him Seiko, but they're saying this is the robot that was in the Screen Actors Guild.

291
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So they're like saying this is like the new version of Seiko, but for whatever reason, they're not saying Seiko.

292
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What's also weird is that you can buy the Robbie the robot from Lost in Space for thirty two thousand, much cheaper.

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Maybe it doesn't move at all, I guess, though.

294
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's probably when you buy this is it's not just alive.

295
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's not just running around your house like helping myself to your food.

296
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I think the Seiko one is supposedly kind of alive, but I don't think this Robbie the robot from Lost in Space is that the lost in space robot.

297
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Mm hmm.

298
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We know that's forbidden planet.

299
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, this is for a bit of a way.

300
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That's Robbie the robot, which is different.

301
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Damn it. I'm confused now.

302
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah, there's a lot of space robot looks like this.

303
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You're right. I'm sorry.

304
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Danger. Yeah, the danger.

305
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I made that same mistake.

306
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah, it's tough to keep them straight.

307
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I also got confused because the robot we're supposed to be talking in his early version was named Robbie.

308
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes.

309
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What?

310
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What?

311
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes.

312
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
My original name was Robbie.

313
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So I'm confused.

314
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm confusing all my robots today.

315
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We got to start giving out like follow along textbooks for these episodes with visuals.

316
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I mean, how does anyone just drive or only hear this and keep any of it straight?

317
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't know.

318
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
They just wait for like us to talk about like what meets Jason has in the house.

319
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I think just like they zone out until it's all just fighting time until they said they said that.

320
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
They said they said the name Jim Sarno.

321
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm back on board.

322
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm back.

323
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I no longer confused.

324
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Sarno stands.

325
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah.

326
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Well, I hear I mean, if we if you want to transition back from Seiko into smart one, I mean, maybe the best way to do that is with so.

327
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So the aforementioned Epcot special that I mentioned, I sit through the Seiko scene.

328
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What do you mean?

329
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Where's smart one?

330
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And in fact, you have to go halfway through the episode to a different scene in order for the two of them to meet.

331
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And here's this little moment.

332
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Hey, Judy.

333
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I mean, that is that is like stranger danger.

334
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Seiko is.

335
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah, I'm a little uncomfortable with the hitting on and it's a little forward, don't you think?

336
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's a little pick up artisty, but I will say it is interesting that there is some gender fluidity involved in the story of smart one and Seiko.

337
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh, one of them.

338
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes.

339
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
They both are portrayed with pretty different voices.

340
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Just kind of kind of switched.

341
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It happens way later and in right in the film Rocky for Seiko for now, for now, because he's like, starts the film male and then transitions.

342
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Right.

343
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yeah, interesting.

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Well, which I guess there is there is that question with smart one is what is the gender like clearly portrayed as female in this special and the lips are sort of more female and lipsticky.

345
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But then there's a lot of literature that says he kind of kind of unclear.

346
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I think it's unclear.

347
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I don't think we're ever going to really solve this.

348
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I guess maybe I mean, I would like to think that they had some real clear idea of what they were doing.

349
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But of course, the answer is probably, oh, yeah, we forgot.

350
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
We forgot.

351
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
We forgot to clarify that.

352
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I realize there's also there's there's a little bit of fluidity going on also with Ernie, the expo robot, who was my wedding cake topper and who I believe was the bride, despite being male in the in the World's Fair, say in the expo setting, which is kind of a nice thing about all of these robot that with their featurelessness that, you know, they you can quantify them however you wish to.

353
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The robots can be any gender they want.

354
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
There's no that's what I declare.

355
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Which voice is that?

356
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I have a news.

357
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Oh, no.

358
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
One of our other I have a news declared that toxic masculinity was dead.

359
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So I felt like he was the one to deliver the news that the robots any gender that they want.

360
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That's fair. One of our other profiles and courage.

361
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
We really got to figure out a name for these these character profiles.

362
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Oh, yeah. When we when we focus on a rat in the rather than an attraction, a character.

363
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yes. Yeah. Right.

364
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah. Well, wait, don't we on the isn't the literature technically on the page around that it is character meet and greets.

365
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I don't know if anyone ever think that's right.

366
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah. Yeah.

367
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
We there's no need for us.

368
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
We never ended up using any of these sub labels, but I like it.

369
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
We're doing a character meeting today.

370
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah.

371
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

372
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Showed up unexpectedly.

373
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah. Like, you know, Tigger showing up in a booming that's like everyone.

374
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yeah.

375
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Or like there's footage, pretty good footage of people walking around communicator and, you know, the Epcot Minnie Mouse with the crazy silvery outfit is in it.

376
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And once or twice she like they're filming and she like photo bombs.

377
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
She like jumps into frame and starts waving to the videographer.

378
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's very nice.

379
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's wonderful.

380
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Is there enough meat on the bone to do an episode about the characters in their space costume?

381
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You know, there is.

382
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, man.

383
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I would like to find the topic that there isn't an episode about that's actually maybe, you know, we do that so much.

384
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, is there an episode of this?

385
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Blah, blah, blah.

386
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The answer is always yes.

387
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Let's find one.

388
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We all agree.

389
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
There's not anything more than like two minutes to talk about.

390
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Not right now, but I'm saying.

391
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yeah.

392
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yeah.

393
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm like, eventually get there of like the three of us don't want to talk about this more than two minutes.

394
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I am I am days away from starting.

395
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I have a couple of Disney Hotel or Disney establishment matchbook collection.

396
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And I feel like that's the next stage of quarantine.

397
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Oh, you're you have one already.

398
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I have a couple.

399
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Well, Jane got me like some Caribbean Beach matchbooks with like a vintage hat she found.

400
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You're going to expand this.

401
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, because they look really good.

402
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I W Retro WDW, I think, has like a big like scan of all of them.

403
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So you're going to become a matchbook collector.

404
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I might I might become a matchbook collector next to the coffee and the baseball caps and the comic books and just saying there will be a full episode about the matchbooks, the hotel soaps.

405
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I mean, you know.

406
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Wow.

407
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Great.

408
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I mean, this is like I'm trying to think of a better old school collecting you could get into here like stamp collecting, I guess, would be like a like a funnier old school.

409
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I tried that as a kid.

410
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It didn't really stick.

411
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Really?

412
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
How many stamps did you have?

413
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I just whatever was around the Elvis stamps were really big room.

414
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The Elvis stamps came out.

415
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Sure.

416
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I feel like they really advertise those.

417
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Interesting.

418
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We all have to be collecting stamps right now.

419
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It's our civic.

420
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's the only way to defeat tyranny is to buy some stamps.

421
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
That's true.

422
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah, that is.

423
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I think it'll that'll do.

424
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That'll work.

425
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Just fine.

426
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm sure.

427
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I got the Bugs Bunny ones.

428
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah, you got to get the Bugs Bunny ones.

429
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
How about did Ernie and Bert Bert collected bottle caps?

430
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Am I correct?

431
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I believe that's good.

432
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Were you ever a bottle cap collector?

433
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I don't think so.

434
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah, that seems that seems.

435
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
What's the point of that?

436
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It seems fine.

437
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's not a design if you like designs and stuff.

438
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Huh?

439
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Well, I support your matchbook collecting.

440
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Thank you.

441
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Keep us posted.

442
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Let us know in the episode.

443
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Just feel free to jump in at any time and say, I got a got a Polynesian now.

444
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I got mannequins.

445
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I got mannequins.

446
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
My other mannequins matches.

447
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I've seen some scans of like different Pleasure Island ones.

448
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I you know, look, I and everyone's going to be like Carlson's like, oh, he thinks it's

449
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
funny to collect all that stuff.

450
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Meanwhile, he just got a notification that his super shredder neck action figure has

451
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
been delivered at the door and he's so excited.

452
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
He just got it on his phone.

453
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Do you need to pause and go get it?

454
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Feel free.

455
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm an adult unless you guys want to see it because we've seen pictures of it.

456
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's very impressive.

457
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
No, I can I can wait.

458
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I mean, I guess the listener doesn't want to hear us go, whoa, wow.

459
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Oh, he's got the helmet.

460
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Probably don't want to see.

461
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
He's got an ooze.

462
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
He's got a little ooze thing.

463
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
He holds it out.

464
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh, good.

465
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Let's do well here with collections.

466
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Let's get back on topic and you can pull yours out, Mike.

467
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I think you did on a episode that will come out later, but I got my smart one right here.

468
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't know.

469
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You have it.

470
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I didn't realize you had it.

471
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I did end up getting it.

472
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That helped me think we should probably do an episode all about him.

473
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
We're both holding up our smart ones.

474
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You recently got him.

475
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I did recently.

476
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I I've never done a full batch of Park stars.

477
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I've recently piecemealed them and I I got three that are kind of to my specific error.

478
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
They're all very 80s, 90s.

479
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
This one, the funmeister, the pleasure island emblem and sunny eclipse.

480
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Oh, yeah, he's great.

481
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
This is my robot butler here to rise.

482
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's robot butler.

483
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Good to see him.

484
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
These are these we have talked about Park stars.

485
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
These are the closest really like we have to in in Park character toys.

486
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I am a little happy and concerned because this company Super 7 has gotten the Disney license and they do really good work and they've already released the you know, if you see those like retro figures that are three inches, there's like, you know, like how G.I.

487
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Joe is like three inch scale, like really small figures and they never would get the likeness essentially to those kind of old school figures.

488
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
There's a whole line of those of like Jaws back to the future that are very like not detailed, but they're retro.

489
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
This company Super 7 makes those and they made a line of Haunted Mansion ones, which those are cool.

490
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm into those.

491
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But they also make a line of figures called the Ultimates, which are seven inch elaborate the figures and they've just released.

492
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
They're doing three.

493
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
They're doing Sorcerer's Apprentice Mickey.

494
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
They're doing Pinocchio and they're doing Prince John from Robin Hood and they look amazing.

495
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Line up.

496
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I think they I here's my feeling is they were like, let's pick two mainstream and like a Hipper choice.

497
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That's my guess.

498
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And you're you're you're using the word hip hip for Prince John.

499
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yes.

500
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Because he loves the thumb sucking.

501
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I heard from Robin.

502
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You're right to point out the absurdity, but I think the Oliver and Company Robin Hood properties are very popular with your box lunch hot topics.

503
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So you're seeing so you're seeing that being catered to this.

504
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So I'm saying that I think we might be perchance on the precipice of getting elaborate in park character toys.

505
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
New finally.

506
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yeah, much better.

507
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You see this one is he got.

508
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Wait, can you suck his thumb?

509
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yes.

510
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Look at you see that one hand there that has the little thumb out.

511
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Oh, that's a thumb extender.

512
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh, great.

513
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You got two different cause.

514
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Yes.

515
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Anyway, I think there might be a scenario in a few years when we're getting like a sunny eclipse toy.

516
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That's the dream.

517
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So I hope so.

518
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You know what else also got me thinking about smart one and want to address him finally is there was just another one of those van Eten auctions and I didn't end up doing it.

519
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But there was one of the things they had for sick because I just I just I get emails with the digital version of the catalog.

520
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I just search for Epcot Star tours.

521
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I mean, mainly those two.

522
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And I this time around, they had an original smart one wind up boy.

523
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Well, it was going for I don't know what it ended up going for, but the starting was like 150 and it's smaller than the park star, I believe.

524
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So yeah, I think I saw that didn't didn't do it.

525
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Consider it.

526
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
There's a lot of them on eBay.

527
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
They aren't so rare.

528
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I might I might still at some point.

529
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But of course, now I'm wondering a little more if there's Seiko March.

530
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
They started to be bailing on but it's you're not going to give away, though.

532
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
No, no, not bailing.

533
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
No.

534
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But while we have him out, I mean, let's just talk about him.

535
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
What do we like about it or her?

536
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yes, smart one is purple.

537
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And there's some pictures, especially that make the purple like shy like shine.

538
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I don't know how to even describe it.

539
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Shiny purple that is so cool.

540
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So right up our alley of like as kids being like future, the future is shiny and purple.

541
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And that's what everything's going to be.

542
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah, it's a really appealing purple specifically.

543
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's it's that Disney plastic shot.

544
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It reminds me of like it's like a freshly polished Dumbo the elephant in the morning or like the cars in the cars.

545
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Right.

546
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
They get they get those they get their plastics looking so nice and and the smart one in person must have been a sight to behold.

547
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And yeah, the toy doesn't quite I mean, the toy is just painted.

548
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
They have a similar paint scheme for all the toys.

549
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The toy doesn't quite capture that shininess.

550
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Not quite actual robot had.

551
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But I think it gets the cuteness.

552
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I mean, I think smart one translates really well to the simplified Parkstar format with its the little little glasses,

553
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:23,000
looking eyes, the the little pronged eyeballs that sort of look like the parts of a cassette tape that spin.

554
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yeah.

555
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And and then that and then that little mouth, that little light up mouth that's a little more like yeah,

556
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
it does feel a little more lipsticky in the real one.

557
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But I like this, this simple little mouse here.

558
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Just amazing.

559
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You know, maybe this is what what you were saying.

560
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You like shorter robots.

561
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Maybe when you look at smart one, you you think of all else, you know, let me speak for myself.

562
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I think of, oh, this would be a great sidekick for me.

563
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'd love to have this guy or this girl tagging along on adventures.

564
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah, sure.

565
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
There's a sidekick.

566
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There's like a very friendly.

567
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I don't know.

568
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I don't know what it is exactly.

569
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
But screen in the belly.

570
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Like, I feel like screen robot as a kid when like a robot would have a face that was a screen or a belly as a screen.

571
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You're like, oh, that's helpful, too.

572
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
We could use that like, you know, as we're on adventures.

573
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yes. Yeah.

574
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That'll come in handy.

575
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And I don't know if I don't think smart one had any other mouth modes.

576
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But you know, if you went on a smart one adventure, that if things got lightly perilous, that then the mouth would turn into a little like stressed squiggle or just an open.

577
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh, you know, to indicate fear or discomfort.

578
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That'd be cute.

579
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
That would give you a little relief in a stressful situation.

580
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It would be very cute.

581
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yeah, I think.

582
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah, I guess it's just the everything is like circles and ovals on smart one, which is.

583
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh, yes. Those little like those shoulder circle parts are wonderful.

584
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

585
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Even like even the arms like are kind of like blown up balloons like are there like.

586
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah, like balloon animal shape even.

587
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah, that's a very good photo.

588
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What you just pulled up.

589
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:23,000
This was a magazine ad by Sperry, the computer company that was a sponsor of Epcot and that I think specifically sponsored smart one.

590
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah, look at I mean, look at that old photo like how many of those little star lights there are a little flares that the silver hands are looking shiny and wonderful.

591
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Yeah.

592
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Those are like half circles.

593
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The hands are like half circle or a severe cut in half.

594
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah, good hand.

595
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And I like I always like the old ads where it's like Sperry, the official computers of Disney World Eastern Airlines, the official airline of this.

596
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Like these companies that don't exist anymore.

597
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Like I was reading a little about Sperry and there were just the divisions were just sold off for part like Unisys has a bunch of it.

598
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And then like I forget who else it says, Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Raytheon, like they all have bits and pieces of this company now.

599
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But for all intents and purposes, it no longer exists.

600
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Theranos, the official blood testing company of the Walt Disney World Resort.

601
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm sure these companies were just as insidious, but I feel like I'd be so queasy if it was like Tesla takes over the old world of motion building or something.

602
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I guess I kind of look on Apple favorably, but then they do something crazy every now and then.

603
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
There's always if you dig a little bit, there's always a little.

604
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah.

605
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
All these companies gave them money, right?

606
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That's obviously how a sponsorship works.

607
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh, yeah.

608
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Well, Sperry, I think also was their internal computer system and seemed to from one of these, maybe even the ad you just showed us, Mike, I think was responsible for the scheduling program for original Epcot Center employees.

609
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I mean, that's something to get into on a future communicator or like the backstage magic episode of like, yeah, a big part of communicator was like all of the computer.

610
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You can see the computers that run Epcot Center and partially Disney World at large.

611
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Right.

612
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Which are it's just those like big old banks like hallway after hallway of them.

613
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah, just like file cabinet looking super computers.

614
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah.

615
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So, yeah, smart one.

616
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
He also like the design.

617
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
There's some other obviously characters we've come across in our our research that don't feel iconic.

618
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:56,000
He feels iconic to me, but I don't think he looms large in people's memories other than like the hard cores.

619
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I think it's just him.

620
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I think like the way he looks and because I don't like the actual little smart one show doesn't seem isn't super notable.

621
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
No, I mean, it's interesting, but it's not.

622
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I think maybe some of the lack of remembrance might be it's not like there was then you go see the smart one show that's really mind blowing.

623
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And, you know, he like his backpack lights up and he rockets around the room.

624
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It's nothing like that.

625
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So you're going off of pure visuals, which are very strong.

626
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, I mean, he yes, basically his whole thing was voice recognition technology, which was used by people picking up like a rotary phone around him and talking to wait their turn for the other.

627
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Like the other phones to go.

628
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You picked up a phone and got in a virtual line.

629
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It feels like yeah, it feels like, you know, he was destined.

630
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
He or she was destined for greater things, but it didn't happen.

631
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You know, it's like trying to think of a good musical equivalent.

632
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You know, there was somebody in a band and you were like, well, that person is going to break out.

633
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And it just didn't happen that way.

634
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You know, you felt like that person was meant for bigger things.

635
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Well, like, you know, the trapeze, the stunt oriented percussionist in the Halyx story.

636
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Sure. Yeah.

637
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
He assumed that they were going to go solo and there was not an opportunity to.

638
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Right. I mean, like, yeah, like, you know, whatever.

639
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Buffalo Springfield breaks up and, you know, two of the members go, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.

640
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That didn't happen here.

641
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
They take this thing down.

642
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And of course, we know what happened, which is very funny what happened.

643
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But yes, I know it's we got to wait.

644
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
We have to wait. We have to wait.

645
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
If you don't know. Oh, man.

646
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yes. The future of Smart One.

647
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Oh, boy. We'll get to that tease.

648
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah. But yeah, there was like a little like it's a number guessing game that was played with, you know,

649
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,000
like up above Smart One is a miniature version of a basketball scoreboard.

650
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But I forget what you call like when it's the giant.

651
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I the one that's not screens, the dot. Yes.

652
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yeah. Yeah. Like a like a an old school airport, you know, destination.

653
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah. Like I think like the word I have no words like the freeway.

654
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Like in L.A. story when Steve Martin talks to the freeway signs.

655
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
If you had seen that. Yeah.

656
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Yeah. So those are visible for everybody to see.

657
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And there's little there's little guessing games like a smart one trying to guess a number from one through nine

658
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
or trying to guess your your birth month, little simple things.

659
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And I do have the vaguest memory of of doing this.

660
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And I might be conflating this with something else in my childhood.

661
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But I I feel like whether this or anything like it where a computer was supposed to guess something like it would not work.

662
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And then I would blame myself.

663
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I would assume somehow that I did something wrong.

664
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Not the not the system.

665
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Well, it shows you where my head was that as a child.

666
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Let me ask you then, because the thing it reminds me of, I'm wondering if you had positive experiences with the old Copperfield Magic specials

667
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
where they're like, all right, come up to your TV, touch the screen, touch a number, touch a room.

668
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Like we watched some of those recently and that's kind of spooky.

669
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But it is kind of more just a slightly more complicated process of elimination game like smart one is playing.

670
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
They must say that as determined outcome seeming.

671
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yeah, I kind of recalled maybe trying to do that as a kid and it not working.

672
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah. And maybe it was me.

673
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It might have been me because my wife and love those and they seem to work.

674
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I try to win recently and it worked because they're all on they're all on YouTube.

675
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Huh? Well, I watch if you aren't using this quarantine to watch every Copperfield special.

676
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And I don't know what you're doing.

677
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
You're wasting your time.

678
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You could see tricks he was still doing in Vegas as of February 2020.

679
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
There is a special did I bring this up on the previous episode?

680
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:44,000
There's a special where David Copperfield splits down the middle, tears apart a Honus Wagner baseball card and then puts it back together

681
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and does it in front of the cards owner, Wayne Gretzky.

682
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And the and the cards co-owner who bought it with Wayne Gretzky was the guy Bruce McNall that like coin thief.

683
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Whoa, you didn't bring that up.

684
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I had so much Bruce McNall stuff.

685
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:08,000
But yeah, they co bought the most expensive baseball card in the world, which David Copperfield tore up and put back together.

686
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Wow. Wow. What a time.

687
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Bruce McNall. Yeah.

688
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Yeah. I hope he comes up with.

689
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
There's another hour. Yeah, he is not the topic that we can't do an hour episode on at least.

690
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
My favorite new characters of the year.

691
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Smart One and Bruce McNall and Mr. Kato.

692
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
There's been so many. We virtually met so many wonderful new friends this year.

693
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yes, that's true.

694
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So, yeah, it's like. Yeah, I'm trying to because like, obviously Figment is the star of this era when it comes to Epcot characters.

695
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Which is funny that they're both purple, so they feel affiliated.

696
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
There's certainly merchandise where they're hanging out together and they're friends, not rivals.

697
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Right. And then like, yeah, what other fame like a robot butler?

698
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
What other character?

699
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Kind of in there, but not doesn't feel like a candidate to be the icon of the park in the way that the other ones do.

700
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Could be.

701
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I feel like I've seen Buzzy from Cranium Command kind of as the third.

702
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
If we're doing the Epcot Big Five, I guess we've just named four.

703
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Who's in there is the three headed troll.

704
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Kitche Cabaret guys, the Kitche Cabaret characters run a lot of merch.

705
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's true.

706
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Yeah. I mean, Dream Finder, I guess in there, too, with Figment early.

707
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah.

708
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
But I mean, part of the marketing.

709
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
One. Yeah.

710
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Well, sure.

711
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Part of the marketing of Epcot in the early years, though, was it's for adults.

712
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
There's not a lot of characters running around.

713
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
There's one Mickey and Minnie.

714
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But if you don't want to see characters, come to Epcot.

715
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Have a beer.

716
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Which I think makes both Figment and Smart One important because they were the kids characters when there were almost none of those.

717
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
If you went looking for cute in 82, you're getting two sources for that.

718
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And both of them are purple.

719
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Mm hmm. Yeah.

720
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And purple. I mean, purple goes a long way, I think, in my kid brain.

721
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Yeah.

722
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Jason, were you into purple as a kid? I know Scott and I were.

723
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I liked it a little, but I was much more of a blue kid.

724
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I had a lot of blue stuff. Still do.

725
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
There were kids that were trying to like push this purple as a girl's color agenda in elementary school.

726
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I remember this. I remember saying my favorite.

727
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You're very mean.

728
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Well, right. But I just I remember like saying my favorite color was purple and I was like, oh, purple is a girl's color.

729
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Like, no, pink is. That's what I would say.

730
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That's how you would reinforce the binary.

731
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Right. I was still on the binary.

732
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't some progressive kid.

733
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I was just I was like, no, I know for sure Barbie is pink.

734
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Barbie's for girls. Barbie, of course, factors into Epcot as well, which we haven't gotten to.

735
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
That's true. Yeah. Why haven't?

736
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Yeah. That one's that one's waiting for sure.

737
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah. Yeah.

738
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah. What I have caught in our future, I think there's a lot to cover.

739
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But oh, I know something we have to have a time.

740
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
There's not that much in terms of appearance to discuss, but we haven't talked about smart ones.

741
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
One. Oh, yeah.

742
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:25,000
When I think that is a lot of the appeals smart was when smart one lifts straight up and down or or down to up that wand, that feels like such pure optimism.

743
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:33,000
That is hope for the future. That's lighting a spark that's leading the way like a like a bandleader that's that's conducting.

744
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And in the recent communicator retro artwork, they put all those newer retro posters they put out that the communicator is represented by smart one holding that wand up and there's a little spark hitting it.

745
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah, you know, yeah, look at that. And with that little that little magic dust trail coming off of it, it's why I don't ism.

746
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:06,000
But I they had that up, I believe, in the Epcot preview center and we were there for all this stuff like they theoretically were going to do to Epcot.

747
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And I was just like, why are they not selling this stuff?

748
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And then I found out there was I don't know how I missed this, but in July they sold like a 200 edition run of this and a few other posters and they sold out very quickly and they were ninety dollars apiece.

749
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So that sucks. And now, of course, they're being flipped on eBay for a lot of money.

750
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I wonder how much they did have those cool shirts with which I bought Epcot forever is the term they've been using.

751
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yes, that's the name of that show.

752
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah, yeah. And good news, I was playing with my baby and he was kind of sparking to those Epcot stripes and colors and the little emblem part in the middle.

753
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I was like, oh, hey, look at this. Maybe it's starting now.

754
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Granted, he's also he's mainly really into the ceiling thing, but still I'll go I'll take over and get it.

755
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Hey, that's pretty good. I mean, yeah, obviously you have to start.

756
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I mean, we've talked about this before. You have to slowly indoctrinate.

757
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
You have to slowly program him. Yeah.

758
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah. Introducing little elements the way you introduce it.

759
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Yeah, a little little little starts and fits. Yeah.

760
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Not going to not going to push it, but not going to push my pro Epcot agenda to it.

761
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
But it'll just naturally be living in it.

762
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Is the right inevitable.

763
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
We do use there is a contemporary hotel.

764
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I have my contemporary hotel toy, which I light up from the inside and we have been using it essentially as a nightlight.

765
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Like the glow of the rules. It's so great.

766
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That's another tease for later.

767
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah. Let's come.

768
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
We're probably not too far. No, no, no.

769
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
What else we got about smart one?

770
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Well, his I mean, do we call this does Jim Sarno is that the creator?

771
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Is that the guy who just sort of built him? I think that's what he was saying.

772
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
He designer designed him after getting kind of a rough sketch idea of what they wanted.

773
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And he was Jim Sarno was an imagineer who I was very interested.

774
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I watched an interview with him. He worked on Teddy Ruxpin.

775
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
He worked on the project to add that scene in hell on Mr. Toad and Disneyland.

776
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah. To add it. Was it not there at one point?

777
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Well, they expanded all the dark rides and I'm pretty sure they added that last section.

778
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Like everything got a new scene or two.

779
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Well, on those dark rides when they did the Tony Baxter fantasy land expansion.

780
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And he worked on the Treasure Island in Las Vegas. Oh, hey.

781
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah. This guy, Jim Sarno, a legend. Wow. What a career.

782
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And yeah, he he initially was calling smart one Robbie Robbie the robot.

783
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I found a video of him like pulling out parts that he got.

784
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yes. Do it center. Yes, I saw that. Yeah, that's pretty delightful.

785
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Like the initial the model of smart one was just all really basic, you know,

786
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
in a PVC kind of stuff and just bought for 15 bucks.

787
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah, Mike, you were right on the money when they're like, yeah, here's a sketch.

788
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Go figure it out. Because he talks about going to a hardware store and just spending a day sanding PVC pipe.

789
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The neck was just a half used tape roll.

790
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Like, it's so crazy to see it like, oh, yeah, that's smart one.

791
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yeah, that's smart one. Yeah, that's the bones of smart one.

792
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah. And he seems it's really kind of sweet.

793
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
He seems like he really, really loves smart one and has a lot of affection for him.

794
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And he's like he even like mentions like maybe smart one will come back.

795
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah, like like I don't know if that's any inside information or if that's just because of those posters.

796
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
He mentions the posters of smart one.

797
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So it seems like Jim is very fond of the little guy.

798
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Well, what could they do with him again?

799
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Because I mean, that forever show seems fun.

800
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But I when you think of like what is the ultimate Epcot experience?

801
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Maybe like a big smart one being piloted around a barge in that show, like a 40 foot smart one.

802
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yeah, I mean, that Epcot forever show is OK, but they haven't put a ton of fun stuff like that in there.

803
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So, I mean, I would like that.

804
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Obviously, the easy like the one that seems like the easiest chance is he goes in the queue for Guardians of the Galaxy cosmic rewind.

805
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Yeah, I mean, and I like that.

806
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I mean, I would like to see him maybe in his own little thing, his own something.

807
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Well, maybe one will inspire the other.

808
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Maybe he shows up as a walk around or a roll around or like he could be just outside by one of the fountains.

809
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And he conducts a little show with the fountain and music or something like something like that.

810
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Oh, that's great. With a little wand with a little one.

811
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
He's making the jets go. Yeah, like he's doing.

812
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I mean, I don't know if that you could tie some bullshit about communicating with nature, water, I don't know something like they don't do any of that.

813
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I think Rex is a DJ. Yeah, he gives a shit.

814
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That really isn't that I mean, they created their whole backstory and everything.

815
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
But ultimately, it's just that wouldn't be fun if he was a DJ.

816
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I think that's the spirit they need to pursue more often.

817
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah. So in some like hub thing, you could put him.

818
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah, doing something fun. I don't know.

819
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I feel like now we know Rex has a love interest in Roxanne, the France only character.

820
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:50,000
But I'd like to think that, you know, if we're painting smart when his female or not, whatever, possibly a pair there.

821
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I like to imagine that that little Seiko scene happened.

822
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
There was a little too aggressive with its hey, beauty.

823
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And that, you know, maybe smart one left that scenario, bumped into a bumbling Rex who is a little more charming and they had more of a natural meat cute.

824
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Oh, I just better in the face of this, you know, this far too aggressive Seiko interaction.

825
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Yeah, they may organically developed early.

826
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
They have more of the same energy, I would say.

827
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So I would see that there in a better match. Yeah.

828
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah, that's nice. That's a nice Disney World fan fiction.

829
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Yeah. Flash fiction.

830
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
People still say that or is that word from 15 years ago?

831
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I don't know. Ask Jason. He's the closest to knowing.

832
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I mean, I think people still ship characters.

833
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't know that the term is bandied about as much.

834
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah, it's like the golden age of like Tumblr and stuff.

835
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Right. I haven't heard that people have been using quarantine to catch up on their shipping.

836
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Because I want to do all the shipping they've been meaning to get to. Yeah.

837
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah. I've been wanting to pair up Seiko and Rocky.

838
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Trump is slow down.

839
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Trump and Louie DeJoy have slowed down shipping actually in an attempt to steal an election.

840
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
It's gross. I don't think we should do it. Yeah.

841
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Want to make shipping less efficient.

842
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:23,000
AOC was really grilling Louie about shipping. Why characters can't be shipped anymore.

843
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Or at least not so fast.

844
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Why can't I ship? Who would AOC want to ship?

845
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Hey, pick two here. Wait, just turn behind you and just point to two of your park stars.

846
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
And you're like blind and then we have to ship them.

847
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Oh, OK. OK. I have all the robots actually down here with me.

848
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I have both star tours. Oh, you want to put them back up so they're in the mix or do we take them out?

849
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Yeah. Yeah. Let me put them in. All right. They're going to be. Hold on. Let me. OK. OK.

850
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Mm hmm. All right. I got one here. A blind ship. OK.

851
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And I am doing a second one. I knocked one over. That'll be the one.

852
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,000
OK, I have Barker Bird from Tiki Room and I can't think of his name.

853
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
The one from the outside who tries to get you to come in? Yeah, I think so. I got to check his name.

854
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Yeah, the Carnival Barker Bird and Big L.

855
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Maybe we should just ship them as friends. OK. Maybe not. Let's do one more.

856
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
The sizes are. I don't know. I like them. Wait. OK. No, no, no.

857
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
We should do try to. We have to take what we're given. No, no, no. Let's let's do it.

858
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
How do they work, Jason? All right. How do they meet?

859
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I think they meet at like one of those like you hear like Hanson.

860
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,000
The band Hanson used to run like songwriting camps for songwriters

861
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
and they'd pair up like disparate like they pair up like one of them,

862
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
someone who does like chart like Katy Perry kind of hits and then weird out.

863
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And then they'd have to write a song in a couple of days and record it.

864
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Right. I think they're at like an animatronics like, yeah, we're the musical.

865
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:28,000
We're the musical animatronics. You know, there's been invited to Hanson's animatronics only this year.

866
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Yeah. Songwriting. Yeah. And they got a lot of retired.

867
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
They got a lot of the rock fire people, the showbiz pizza people.

868
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And they got a scary fantasia land, the monkeys and the king that we learned about.

869
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It's international. They all went to Oklahoma to hang out with Hanson.

870
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Yeah. And one day like these Sundays are allowed to just kind of free like write songs.

871
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And some days like, OK, you got an assignment. You got to get Crest in there somehow.

872
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:07,000
You got to think about hope for tomorrow and how Crest toothpaste is going to get us there.

873
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Wow. Which encouraged and so maybe Barker Bird encouraged Big Al to smile.

874
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Got the first real smiles out of him in years.

875
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Yeah, they've been inseparable ever so they and now Big Al sings only happy songs.

876
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm in love with Barker Bird. I mean, that's sweet.

877
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
That's nice. Yeah, that gives me hope for the future.

878
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah. Smiling as big as I'd be smiling with the help of Crest.

879
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I think this will be if we did segments anymore, this should be a regular segment shipping my Park Stars blindly.

880
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Yeah, I'd do this again. Well, we know we'll throw out of ideas.

881
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Then we'll throw the Ninja Turtles in the mix and then it'll be like Leatherhead gets shipped with

882
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,000
let's say shredder. Yeah.

883
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And see, this is so much healthier.

884
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I mean, this is like, you know, people say like Twitter has only gotten worse as the Tumblr generation has migrated as the website fell apart.

885
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And they just pop in and go like, sorry, Karl Marx, you're canceled. Martin Scorsese, get out of here.

886
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It was so much better when they would just be like, yeah,

887
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Krang from Ninja Turtles is in love with Princess Bubblegum. Got it. Got it.

888
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So do we need to take Tumblr back over? Yeah, we. Yeah.

889
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
We need a healthier outlet.

890
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Guess what? The mid to late 30s generation are going to hide for a while on Tumblr.

891
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
We've just had so many recessions, international catastrophe.

892
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:54,000
We just need to relax for a while and get like Big Al and Barker Bird stuff, you know, rest our brains.

893
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And it's not weird stuff. It's just romance. It's G with mild PG elements.

894
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Holding hands. Yeah. Very wholesome. Like the Duffy gang. Not a sex thing. Pure love.

895
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Perfect love.

896
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
To quote the message. Well, are we are we getting to smart ones?

897
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.

898
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's what I call smart ones party down arc because he very much is a is a bit of a star and then ends up in a in a fine industry like a fine,

899
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
you know, in no judgment on people who, you know, bartend.

900
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I would like I would like anyone listening that doesn't know where we're going with this.

901
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Think in your head, where do we think smart one ended up after they took the robot out of communicator?

902
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:58,000
All right, you got it. And now we're going to tell you smart one ended up in a steakhouse in the contemporary resort as a greeter slash to drink holder.

903
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I don't know how much tray holder. Yeah, I think it was.

904
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I think it was just I don't think they'd actually the robot actually brought anyone drinks.

905
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I think it was just a cute little thing at the at the front.

906
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:20,000
But I have to feel like it. I had to think when that hotel was like the big convention spot, there was some surly guy like hammered guy like, God damn it.

907
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
God damn it. You stupid robot. I asked for a gimlet, not a Tom Collins.

908
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Which I would think, yes, that smart one got yelled at by a lot of drunk people.

909
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:40,000
No problem, sir. And like, that's a really sad, a sad situation.

910
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Don't be optimistic about the future.

911
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
What was the name? Didn't they change it to like X?

912
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The name was X one eight four six.

913
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
No longer smart one. Now, X one eight four six.

914
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And that is because that was the extension.

915
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:08,000
If you dialed the number of the concourse steakhouse at the contemporary resort, if you picked up the phone in your room that I actually kind of like that.

916
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I didn't know what enemy it could. I think it's that it's kind of cute.

917
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But they strip smart one of an identity.

918
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Yeah. I mean, yes, yes.

919
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:33,000
But, you know, I just I just think how much I would have liked to encounter this at the time, because this was in 94 that this was put in and around 2000 due to technical malfunctions.

920
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
This was stopped. I don't know how much that was even started.

921
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I'm not convinced they they did this. There's a lot of documentation.

922
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
There's no video. Did you find any video?

923
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
No, no. Most of the proof of that this happened is from like an internal Disney newsletter.

924
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
But that gives you one great bit of info, which is that.

925
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:01,000
All right. So the primary function of the robot is to greet guests within the concourse steakhouse and help celebrate special occasions like birthdays or anniversaries, just like Chuck E.

926
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Cheese X one eight four six can serve drinks or food and entertain guests who might be waiting for a table.

927
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
He may occasionally pass out samples of monorail ale.

928
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I know about monorail ale.

929
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,000
First of all, I love some. I'm looking at a picture of him holding five drinks.

930
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I mean, that sounds great.

931
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I mean, how happy I would be if I could if we could escape this dark timeline, I could go sit in the concourse steakhouse, have a passable steak and have my favorite little robot roll up to me and ask monorail ale, sir.

932
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I mean, it's a dream. Yes, of course.

933
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And you'd be like, and then you'd be like, you'd call the robot smart one and it would be like, I do not remember that name.

934
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And then you like try to jog its memory and it would be like, there would be like you'd see something in the eye.

935
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
And then it would be the last time you tried to guess a number.

936
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And then like it would be like you could see you did it and then like it realized that it had a life before this.

937
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:19,000
What did you say? Get me out of here, Scott, please.

938
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I remember now you are only hope.

939
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:32,000
So then I've got a I mean, I'm looking at a picture of the concourse steakhouse and there's a potted plant, which is not that different than the size of smart one.

940
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So maybe either I lift up the potted plant.

941
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Maybe I like quickly go change clothes, pretend that I am a mover or something like, oh, yeah, just move in this plant.

942
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I got to put on a voice that'll help with the run.

943
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:52,000
And and I am like, here you go. Just scoot as I scoot and then just like get it onto the elevator.

944
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Put him in a maybe I have to get a new suitcase for it.

945
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And now I have to carry like a one ton item to the Orlando airport.

946
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
But yeah, this works. I think I could break them.

947
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I get to live with them. Yeah.

948
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Oh, what a dream. What a dream scenario.

949
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:18,000
He serves a drink and then you steal the robot and then I steal from Disney.

950
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yeah, not here. We can't talk here.

951
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Get me out of here. Get me to the McDonald's.

952
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Get me to the odd property McDonald's.

953
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
They don't have microphones there.

954
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
This is not safe. They'll try to repurpose you as a grimace robot.

955
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
G.R.M.A.C.

956
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Pretend you're a robotic brother.

957
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I five. I like the five is the yeah.

958
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Yeah. This feels like they always everyone always flirts with this idea.

959
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,000
But we never truly get a robot giving you drinks or an alien in the canteen.

960
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
A serving you and Galaxy's Edge.

961
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's always a concept I think we hear about in blue sky phases and you see it here and there.

962
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
But it never sustains. It never lasts.

963
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I want an alien or a robot to wait on me at a restaurant or a bar.

964
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
But yeah, is it possible? Maybe it is not possible.

965
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I think they always crunch numbers and go, look, it's too expensive for this robot.

966
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And like, does a server really need to wear this stupid makeup? Come on.

967
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah, we make this. It's a hard job to begin with.

968
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:42,000
There wasn't nobody. No robot served you at that Cheers bar with the robotic likenesses of Norm and Cliff where they sued.

969
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Wait, you know the story, right?

970
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Oh, vaguely. Yeah, very faintly.

971
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Yeah, there were there were robots of the Cheers characters that this one Cheers bar and they were pretty grotesque.

972
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I believe I think they were like those scary puppets from D.C.

973
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Follies. It was, you know, they're kind of like squishy and terrifying.

974
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:09,000
But they did kind of resemble Ratzenberger and went enough that they sued successfully.

975
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And this concept did not get any further.

976
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I don't think there was also a robot Woody serving anybody.

977
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I don't think or and all alternately, Diane.

978
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Yeah, Rebecca.

979
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:32,000
There's a bar in Vegas, I think by Planet Hollywood that is a robot mixing your cocktail, but they're just arms.

980
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
There's no cute face. There's no personality as far as I can tell.

981
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
So it's like that's I like it, but it's not it is giving me that personality.

982
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Also, I'm sure everybody told you Mike to go to the robot restaurant in Japan.

983
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
We fucked up and we missed the show.

984
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Well, I mean, that seems interesting that robot restaurant, but it isn't it's it's a lot more complicated.

985
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I feel than what I want when I hear robot restaurant.

986
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I just want a robot to roll up to me with a drink.

987
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I want exactly what this was promising with smart one.

988
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Right. Yes.

989
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yes, I've seen video of it. It is.

990
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It seems crazy. Yeah.

991
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:19,000
So who will crack a sustainable idea with a robot?

992
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Maybe there is one operating now. We don't know.

993
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
If you're a listener and you know, let us know.

994
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Let me say this as well.

995
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It's 2020 service industry restaurants.

996
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
It's a bad time.

997
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
We're all afraid of this disease and we're trying to reopen restaurants.

998
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
But there's there's bad people out there being very rude to the staff and it doesn't feel safe.

999
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
And you know what would make it safe?

1000
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Robot. I don't want to go over placing anybody's jobs, obviously.

1001
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
The robots. Here's what should happen.

1002
01:08:50,000 --> 01:09:00,000
The robots should be doing the work while the wait staff stays employed to stay home and are given the tips that are handed to the robot.

1003
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
But that's sorry robots. I don't know.

1004
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I don't know. That's going to be a problem because are these robots sentient?

1005
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I guess they would have to be to some extent to do this.

1006
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Then that's cruel as well.

1007
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
But they don't need money.

1008
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
They like to be appreciated, though.

1009
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Well, well, so you say thanks.

1010
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And someday when it's safer, you give them a kiss like Carly Simon.

1011
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I mean, I think you need to ask the people who ended up owning SmartOne, the Florida Robotics Club,

1012
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
it is full of a picture.

1013
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
It was smart when in the back of a truck.

1014
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Yeah. Oh, man.

1015
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:54,000
That was the conclusion I read is once they took him out of the steakhouse, he was either given, sold or exchanged for services to the Florida Robotics Club.

1016
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So they have him.

1017
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Supposedly. I know kind of where the trail went dry and I didn't see much about the Florida.

1018
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Who knows if that Florida?

1019
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I don't know if it's the Florida Robotics Club or a Florida Robotics Club.

1020
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Why don't we know?

1021
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Why is that that guy on Disney Plus is running around finding broken helmets and shit?

1022
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
The prop culture.

1023
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Why? He did a whole season and didn't even consider trying to find SmartOne.

1024
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
You're on you're on notice host of prop culture.

1025
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Turn it turn in your pork pie hats.

1026
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You're on death's duty.

1027
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I'm tearing the stripes off of your Smash Mouth Steve Harwell-esque shirts.

1028
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
You don't deserve to wear the until you find SmartOne.

1029
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:55,000
He he might I mean, look, he might know where everything is, you know, just not telling.

1030
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
He knows where all the bodies are buried.

1031
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Oh, that's how he so he got the show greenlit is bribery.

1032
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Like if you want the SmartOne return, you know what?

1033
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
If you want the shrinking machine, you'll do as I say.

1034
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Give me a show on your new streaming platform.

1035
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I'll say that's your edge Crescent Lake.

1036
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
You know what's good for you.

1037
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
You'll give me a streaming show.

1038
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:24,000
They try to make that show, though, seem like he's like, oh, I'm just the guy who's here and I'm going to try to find all this fun stuff.

1039
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Meanwhile, he's like an archivist.

1040
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
He works for the company.

1041
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
He knows where everything is.

1042
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Yeah, they're doing a whole dog and pony show.

1043
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
He's making all this stuff.

1044
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
He's just like scattering all these things across the globe.

1045
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Yeah, like surely.

1046
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Let's get a Jason Sheridan in there who truly knows where none of this stuff is and make him find it with no help.

1047
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I'll do it.

1048
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
That's a show.

1049
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
That's a show.

1050
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Not this guy who knows where it is.

1051
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And he goes, well, we hope we can find something today.

1052
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
And it's like, oh, look, it's Mary Poppins and Burt's wardrobe.

1053
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I didn't know that, except he did know that he knew exactly where it was.

1054
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
He has access to the archives.

1055
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:09,000
No, I'm doing the full Da Vinci code national treasure, like ripping down.

1056
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Yes, you have to do posters scanning.

1057
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
You have to scale the wall at the Disney Archive.

1058
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
You have to get in there past guards.

1059
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
You have to put on a disguise.

1060
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
That's the show.

1061
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
That's a good show for realistic masks.

1062
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Yes, like mission.

1063
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
You have to do a whole mission impossible style mission.

1064
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Yeah, climbing up sides of buildings.

1065
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And that's what you want.

1066
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:37,000
As we learned on the Ace Ventura episode, this is what Jason wants to scale the side of a building.

1067
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Oh, right.

1068
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Sure.

1069
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And go down again.

1070
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
So he loves heights.

1071
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
He's the height miser.

1072
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I love it on the height miser.

1073
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:53,000
He's grabbing Walt's like little just throw in the little seven dwarf Oscars at the screens in the Monorail hallway at Imagineering.

1074
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It's like, what's behind here?

1075
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Yeah, like imagine the imagine the Disney building in Burbank over here.

1076
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
But it's the Dubai scene in Mission Impossible 4 where he's on the top of the building.

1077
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Jason with a cord.

1078
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:18,000
He's running along the building with a cord to jump through a different window to get to, let's say, the the bed from Bedknobs and Broodstinks.

1079
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
The missing knob.

1080
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
We have three of the four, but it won't be complete.

1081
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
This is a fucking show.

1082
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Man.

1083
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Yeah, there's no action on prop culture.

1084
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
No action whatsoever.

1085
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
No action.

1086
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I think I think what's happening is that, OK, so if you've been to Burbank, if there's the animation building that's Sorcerer's Hat and there's a tip.

1087
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And I think up in that tip, what I'm worried is happening is that Smart One is has been captured and locked away by Seiko.

1088
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Oh, finally.

1089
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
You are mine, cutie.

1090
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Oh, my God.

1091
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
After decades.

1092
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Now that you are not working for that hotel bar anymore, you can be mine.

1093
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,000
But when Jason kicks in the star on the side of the search, there's that.

1094
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Seiko, freeze.

1095
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Don't move a muscle.

1096
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
You said I couldn't find anything.

1097
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Good news.

1098
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I found Black Widow's gun.

1099
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
See, then Seiko is like, what are you doing in here?

1100
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Bob Iger.

1101
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
And then Jason pulls the mask off.

1102
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And he's Jason.

1103
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
He was dressed as Bob Iger the whole time.

1104
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Oh, no.

1105
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
A different Ithaca grad.

1106
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I was.

1107
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I was fooled because I could feel the Ithaca on you.

1108
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And it was confusing.

1109
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Ithaca energy.

1110
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Ithaca vibes.

1111
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Robots can read this.

1112
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Of course, who else would know all of the subs made for late night stoner

1113
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
consumption?

1114
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,000
All of the town specific calzones at that DP Doze.

1115
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Oh, subs.

1116
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Oh, yeah.

1117
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It took me a second too, but yes, I like that joke.

1118
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
The chain restaurants only located next to college campuses.

1119
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Wings with a Z. DP Doze calzones.

1120
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Can we get Bob Iger on the show if we promise that we won't ask him anything

1121
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
hard and that it'll just be Jason reminiscing about some reminiscing about

1122
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
shops?

1123
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Has he done what?

1124
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Let's look into what interviews he's done.

1125
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Yeah, like, promise him there's this is all softball.

1126
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
He did Bill Simmons.

1127
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I know I'm aware.

1128
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
We're on that level.

1129
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're right there.

1130
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Things just got busy.

1131
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
What would that pandemic?

1132
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah, but once it winds down, it's time for time for sub shop memories with.

1133
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Oh, my God.

1134
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Not a single not a single Disney question.

1135
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
You and I never comes out.

1136
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
You and I barely talk.

1137
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
You and I barely talk.

1138
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Jason just asks.

1139
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Just reminisces.

1140
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I'm aware of that.

1141
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And they describe what their experiences were.

1142
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
We describe our experiences.

1143
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,000
We have to give them a little bit of time to talk about something going well in the

1144
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Disney outlook in China.

1145
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
We do have to give them 15 minutes for that.

1146
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Sure.

1147
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Look in there.

1148
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
We're like, come on.

1149
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
All right.

1150
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So we'll cut it.

1151
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
We'll cut it.

1152
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It's like the Lanzaluzios.

1153
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Yeah.

1154
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Even if he tries to cram some of that stuff.

1155
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah, 15 minutes about the success in China and then like, OK, great.

1156
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
So let's talk about.

1157
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
All right.

1158
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Let's get back to Rogan's corner.

1159
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
The combination laundromat liquor store, sub shop pizza restaurant.

1160
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And then we bring in Mitch because there's a legend of an interview.

1161
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Do we talk about this on the show?

1162
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I don't know.

1163
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I don't know.

1164
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I don't know.

1165
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I don't know.

1166
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I don't know.

1167
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
So did you say that on the interview?

1168
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Did we talk about this on the show?

1169
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1170
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Yes, you saw it or I who saw it?

1171
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
One of us saw it.

1172
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Bob Iger talked about what he was watching.

1173
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
And this is a couple of years ago.

1174
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
We think that Mitch I feel like I heard Bob Iger say that he watched his love and like

1175
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
love and that's what be aware of the work of Mike Mitchell.

1176
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Yeah.

1177
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Yeah.

1178
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
So Mitch will be on this episode too, because he'll know Randy from love.

1179
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Yeah.

1180
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I like ask about Star Wars and how they suck and we don't want that cutting into the sub

1181
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
time.

1182
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Do you really?

1183
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Mitch wouldn't just be nice, you think?

1184
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Mitch going at like when he met JJ Abrams.

1185
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Yes, bro.

1186
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Yeah.

1187
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Yeah.

1188
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You would just be like, Oh, hello, sir.

1189
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Nice to meet you.

1190
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Well, all right.

1191
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
So some talk with Jason Bob coming soon.

1192
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Mm hmm.

1193
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Um, it's also smart ones rescue from the claws of Seiko coming soon.

1194
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Thanks to Jason swinging in on a rope.

1195
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And that's our smart one episode.

1196
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
We really did it.

1197
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
We like to bring it back.

1198
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Smart one encourages people to use their imagination.

1199
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Maybe.

1200
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I don't know.

1201
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Look, I still don't really know what smart ones personality is.

1202
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I just makes me happy to look at a ton of meat on the bone.

1203
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Friendly.

1204
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Really?

1205
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
We got 80 minutes.

1206
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Yeah.

1207
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Minutes out of it.

1208
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Yeah.

1209
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Yeah.

1210
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And now I'm just going to.

1211
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I don't think I said you survived.

1212
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I guess.

1213
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I guess.

1214
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
You survived it.

1215
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And now I'm going to survive the rest of the day by just imagining that I'm sitting at

1216
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
the what's it called?

1217
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:55,000
The concourse steakhouse and that X one eight four six is bringing me round after round.

1218
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Refresh your Chardonnay, sir.

1219
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
It's well, it's 1994.

1220
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
So can I try one of those Zima's everybody's talking about?

1221
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Very good choice, sir.

1222
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Very popular right now.

1223
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I have a special bottle tucked away from the Fes Parker winery.

1224
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Oh, very good.

1225
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Here's a here's a little tip then.

1226
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And you can save that and not pass it off.

1227
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I will give it to a human because I know tips in your case.

1228
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Get yourself a nice wand.

1229
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
All right.

1230
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I will, sir.

1231
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Boy, 1995 is going to be all right.

1232
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:43,000
All right, folks, thanks for listening.

1233
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Goodbye.

1234
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Bye.
