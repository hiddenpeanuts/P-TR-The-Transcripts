1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,620
Forever.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,300
Dog.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,520
Warning, the following podcast may include a horrifying citrus sausage, Jason lazily performing

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,680
a lazy Bob Hope routine, and Nixon, Nixon, Nixon.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,860
Please stand clear of the doors.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,900
It's the Monorail on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,108
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast

8
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:48,428
hosted by three guys who are exactly like the three caballeros,

9
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:50,808
except all whiter than Donald.

10
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:54,528
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

11
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,648
What's up, fellas?

12
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:57,448
Hey, hello, I'm Michael, yes.

13
00:00:58,248 --> 00:01:01,748
Those three caballeros, I love them, they're great.

14
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:04,948
Yeah, I do too, and I don't have a problem with them

15
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:06,628
being on that ride that they're on.

16
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:07,568
Oh yeah, no problem.

17
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:09,808
Some people get mad about just any characters

18
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:12,068
being added to anything just to be difficult,

19
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:16,588
but it's still, hey, as long as that ride is slow and creepy

20
00:01:16,588 --> 00:01:18,968
and has zero weight whatsoever,

21
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,428
I'm happy with the Mexico boat ride.

22
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:22,268
Oh yeah, that's great.

23
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:26,688
I also would just say, not Donald, but the other two are cool.

24
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:29,528
They are cool, yeah, it's just dawning on me now

25
00:01:29,528 --> 00:01:31,808
that Donald is their Caucasian friend.

26
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:34,288
Yes, so yeah, unlike the three of us,

27
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:36,208
Jose, what's the other one's name?

28
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:39,308
I'm blanking on the other caballero's name.

29
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,648
It ends with an O, I don't know what it is besides that.

30
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:44,968
I'm looking it up now.

31
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:47,448
People are screaming at their phones.

32
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:50,088
Yeah, come on, guys.

33
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:54,248
I can picture them better than some family members,

34
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:59,508
and yeah, I'm blanking on Jose and...

35
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:01,588
Is it Panchito?

36
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,948
Panchito, there you go.

37
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:06,608
Look, anybody can think of some information

38
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:08,448
and immediately Google it and get it themselves,

39
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:12,348
but only in this source can information be delayed

40
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:15,028
by 10 seconds while other people look it up

41
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:17,528
while manipulating other machines that they're operating.

42
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:20,988
I'm sweating a little bit now.

43
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:22,848
I'm trying to get it under the wire there.

44
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:24,268
Would you have known Jose though?

45
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:25,448
Did you guys know Jose?

46
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:26,728
I also don't know which is which.

47
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,728
Oh, this is, hold on.

48
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:30,948
Oh, I'm sweating again.

49
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:32,748
Oh no, oh shit.

50
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:34,768
We don't need to tell people which is which.

51
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:37,328
I do not remember their last names though.

52
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,448
I'm not sure they had, they're all Caballero,

53
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:42,088
and Donald adopted the last name Caballero

54
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:44,828
just for that series.

55
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:48,368
Jose is the one with the hat, the straw hat.

56
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:49,128
Gotcha.

57
00:02:49,228 --> 00:02:50,088
Not the sombrero.

58
00:02:50,168 --> 00:02:50,688
Which color?

59
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:53,028
He's this guy.

60
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:54,268
Jose is green.

61
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:56,108
He's green, yeah, I guess that would have been easier.

62
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:56,648
Got it.

63
00:02:56,888 --> 00:03:00,568
Then showing me something that the viewers,

64
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:01,948
the listeners can't...

65
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:02,928
Oh man, I'm covered in flaps.

66
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:04,688
Oh no, okay, okay, well here,

67
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:06,608
let's get off the Caballeros then

68
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:07,348
and let's change topic.

69
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,568
And I wanted to address something

70
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:10,588
that has just happened kind of freshly

71
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:12,808
as we record this episode.

72
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,708
We're recording this pretty quickly

73
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:18,988
after the passing of former president George H.W. Bush.

74
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:22,128
He has just passed away, and you know what?

75
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:24,908
Especially in today's divided times,

76
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:27,008
there is always a rush with these politicians,

77
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:28,668
whether it's Bush, whether it's McCain,

78
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:32,048
to cast the final judgment on them

79
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:35,528
and to vilify them if you disagree with them

80
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:40,048
or to wash over their sins if you are a fan of them.

81
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:41,688
But I'm not here to do any of that.

82
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,828
We are theme park journalists,

83
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,188
and I think what we should do in light of his passing

84
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:47,128
is talk about his robot.

85
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,268
The George Bush robot has been operating

86
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:54,848
at Disney World in the Hall of Presidents since 1989,

87
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:59,588
free of incident, free of oil leakage

88
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:01,008
that shot into the audience.

89
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:03,148
His head never snapped off.

90
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:06,588
As far as his clothes didn't slowly drift off

91
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:10,388
during a performance, that robot has been solid and sturdy

92
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:13,368
for three decades running, and I think it's only right

93
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:16,028
in light of the passing of his likeness,

94
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,208
the real human George H.W. Bush,

95
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:20,808
that we declare George Bush

96
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:22,648
to be the animatronic of the month.

97
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:23,968
Oh. Oh, okay.

98
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:25,248
That...

99
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,508
Yes, that's what that was.

100
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:29,588
Okay, I wasn't sure where it was going.

101
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:32,388
No, it was, no, I just want to, you know,

102
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:35,468
I just can't think of a better way to honor the passing

103
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:38,428
of a career politician and a, you know,

104
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:42,248
a grandfather, a public servant for many years

105
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,648
than to say his robot was cool.

106
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:45,948
Right, so yeah, you're saying

107
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:47,528
this has nothing to do with politics.

108
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:50,368
Absolutely, and that's like the benefit of our area

109
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:51,428
and the podcasts that we're doing.

110
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:53,888
We don't have to make this rash decision

111
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:55,888
mere hours after he died.

112
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,568
History will determine that,

113
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,248
but I will say that robot is great,

114
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:04,288
and I think, you know, he performs a thankless task

115
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:05,688
because he was the final president

116
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:08,348
who did not speak in his actual voice.

117
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:08,708
Right.

118
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,208
From Bill Clinton on, the real president

119
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,728
has gotten to do the voice,

120
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:17,288
and George Bush, all he gets to do is blink and nod

121
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:20,548
and look around and sort of gesture slightly

122
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:23,768
when each president is mentioned, and you know,

123
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:26,348
so it's, you know, I just want to thank him

124
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:28,448
for his years of mute service.

125
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,048
I think he's done a great job.

126
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:33,848
At worst, benign, the animatronic George Bush.

127
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:37,008
He did not oversee the hall

128
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:39,108
of the Central Intelligence Agency,

129
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:42,488
which flooded the Magic Kingdom with crack cocaine

130
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:46,288
in the 80s, unlike possibly his living counterpart.

131
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:49,368
He didn't arrange an animatronic war on drugs

132
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:53,508
and try to buy crack in front of the Hall of Presidents.

133
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:57,708
Yes, they did not set up a 19-year-old.

134
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:00,148
Besides the Hall of Presidents.

135
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:01,748
The robot did not do that.

136
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:03,128
The robot did not do that.

137
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,788
He didn't set up a 19-year-old robot

138
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:06,808
and send them to jail.

139
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:10,248
This is good, because then when Trump passes away,

140
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,608
we have to honor the Trump robot,

141
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,808
because the Trump robot did not do anything.

142
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:14,428
No.

143
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,308
He represents something, yes,

144
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:17,988
but he didn't do anything. He does that weird finger gesture

145
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:19,148
that we talk about. He does the finger thing.

146
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:21,388
But he was programmed to do so,

147
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:23,348
and again, fully operational.

148
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,888
I think really the only one,

149
00:06:26,188 --> 00:06:28,428
according to a America's Funniest Home Videos clip

150
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:29,888
that I'm very fond of,

151
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:34,028
there was one time when Lincoln was giving a speech

152
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,048
and then he slowly started tipping at the knees

153
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,648
and falls backwards.

154
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:41,368
So, and if that, such an incident happened

155
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,228
to any other presidents, I don't know about it,

156
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,248
or it wasn't on film.

157
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:47,088
This might be where we as a country,

158
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,748
people always say coming together

159
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:50,908
and we have to see eye to eye on things.

160
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:53,488
Maybe if we all embrace the robots

161
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:55,008
at the Hall of Presidents,

162
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,208
we all can become a little bit more connected

163
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,088
and a little more understanding of each other.

164
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:00,508
Well, all those presidents,

165
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:04,548
not just on Democratic and Republican lines,

166
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:07,308
but on, you know, Republo-crat,

167
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,588
like whatever, like the Washington Generals,

168
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:12,888
like whatever the weird old political parties were.

169
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:13,828
The Washington Generals, yeah.

170
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:15,528
I think they were all part of the Washington Generals

171
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:18,268
that became the opponents of the Harlem Globetrotters.

172
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:19,028
That's right, yeah.

173
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:21,288
But you know, yeah, people of all kinds of parties,

174
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,368
the Bull Moose, the weird stuff Teddy Roosevelt was part of,

175
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:28,788
they all stand there and they get along.

176
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,668
And they, it's civil.

177
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:34,208
They all, well, I mean, they don't have a discussion.

178
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,668
They all just sort of stand around and blink at each other.

179
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:37,968
But even that, hey, that's something.

180
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:40,928
That's better than most politicians get along these days.

181
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:43,288
We should set up a poll,

182
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:45,588
and maybe we talk to Len Testa about this,

183
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:48,148
because Len from the Disney Dish podcast

184
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,188
is always talking about numbers.

185
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:51,568
He's in charge of the guy that tells you

186
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:53,508
like how long wait times are,

187
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:54,848
like when attendance is gonna be.

188
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:57,048
Yeah, great numbers. Maybe he can exit poll

189
00:07:57,048 --> 00:08:00,288
for popularity outside of the Hall of Presidents

190
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:02,588
to see what the robot's approval ratings are.

191
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:04,188
Because I think they're all gonna be high.

192
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:06,568
I think if we all kind of take this mentality.

193
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:09,808
How low could you possibly go on one of these robots?

194
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,528
What's your expectation of them?

195
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,188
I think people will give the Trump one low

196
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:16,648
because of how bad he is as a person.

197
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,988
But I think Len will have to just say,

198
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:22,048
and specify, we're talking about the robot.

199
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:24,168
Did the robot do a good job?

200
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,348
Did its hands move?

201
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:27,328
Did it look at you,

202
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:29,348
and then it shoot lasers out of its eyes at you?

203
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:30,668
No? Well then, that's good.

204
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:31,408
That was a good robot.

205
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:35,368
Did it emit a piercing scream that deafened your child?

206
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:37,608
If no, then it's a great robot.

207
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:39,448
Did it say, why was I born?

208
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:41,408
And then try to crawl off the stage at you?

209
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:43,368
If it didn't, then it's a good robot,

210
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:44,368
and you should rate it high.

211
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:46,968
So let's see if we can get all these robots

212
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:48,348
to have their approval ratings high.

213
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:50,828
The robot does not stand there and describe things

214
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:52,868
as very legal, very cool.

215
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,108
It would have to be programmed.

216
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:58,908
There would have to be a human behind it to program.

217
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:02,628
And even if it did that, the robot didn't say that.

218
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:04,368
It's not the robot's fault.

219
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:05,088
No.

220
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:09,208
It's just repeating what a deranged madman tweeted.

221
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:11,788
But even he didn't do anything wrong either,

222
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:12,708
as he asserted.

223
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:13,748
Well, that's a different.

224
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:16,228
I was thinking, it seems like something's up

225
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:17,028
with Trump and Russia,

226
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,768
and then he sent that very legal, very cool text.

227
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:20,188
And I'm like, you know what, he's right.

228
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:21,988
I'm letting him off the hook.

229
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:23,148
I think he's, I get it now.

230
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:24,468
I see now.

231
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:24,828
The very cool.

232
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:26,708
I was worried about it not being legal,

233
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,248
but if it's cool.

234
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:29,508
It's cool, man.

235
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:30,188
Yeah.

236
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:34,028
If anything, we probably owe these robots apologies

237
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:39,068
because we have like endowed them with this fake skin,

238
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:43,068
these facsimiles of living villains.

239
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:43,808
I don't know.

240
00:09:44,768 --> 00:09:46,868
History shows most presidents to be villains.

241
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:50,248
An old Big Al country bear animatronic

242
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:53,368
who is now the Donald Trump robot, I'm assuming,

243
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:55,008
because that's how they do it.

244
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,228
They do reuse things.

245
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,308
I believe Big Al, and this could be totally wrong,

246
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:01,768
is the Oogie Boogie on Haunted Mansion now,

247
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:03,028
on the Haunted Mansion holiday.

248
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,088
Oh yeah, that's an interesting theory.

249
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,568
That's a possible, yeah.

250
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:08,008
So they for sure do stuff like that.

251
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,488
I don't know if that's specifically right.

252
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:12,708
So it's a chance that the Trump animatronic

253
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,488
used to be a character you loved,

254
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:17,948
and now it's not his choice, his robot choice,

255
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:20,448
to put the Trump skin in the wig on,

256
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:21,548
and now everyone hates it.

257
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:22,868
That's not fair to the robot.

258
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:25,388
He was, it was potentially the head of like

259
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:27,548
a splash mountain crocodile or something.

260
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:28,708
Sure, or.

261
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,728
Or a goose, I guess.

262
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:31,388
A crocodile would be too long.

263
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:32,408
Yes.

264
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:35,148
You'd be, I'm glad they don't cut all those corners

265
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:36,788
because if they installed a Donald Trump

266
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:40,508
and he had a big long snout like a crocodile,

267
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:42,748
you'd be like, wait a minute, something's up.

268
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:45,248
They just painted a crocodile head flesh color.

269
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:48,648
I would like to see that.

270
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,008
among the Hall of Presidents a crocodile head.

271
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:54,048
For you it appears as a crocodile.

272
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:57,168
That's like taking your, you have a very funny

273
00:10:57,168 --> 00:11:01,148
Hall of Presidents video on, where can you find it?

274
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:02,788
Funny or Die, who knows?

275
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:06,068
I don't, it's on my YouTube,

276
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:08,108
it's called Hall of Inaccurate Presidents.

277
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:08,568
Right.

278
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:12,528
Where it's like not the real names of presidents.

279
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:15,148
Yeah, past George Washington it's all nonsense.

280
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:17,988
Daniel Flintstone and Jonathan T. President.

281
00:11:19,508 --> 00:11:22,768
But the next logical step would be to like just add in

282
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:25,448
like anthropomorphic alligators in a suit.

283
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,328
Yeah, well you know what we're talking about.

284
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:29,708
You have to call this Hall of Presidents

285
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,928
under new management.

286
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:33,088
Oh, that's great.

287
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:35,228
Much as the Enchanted Tiki Room many years ago,

288
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,088
I don't know if all the listeners know this,

289
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:40,328
the Tiki Room's kind of been the same thing since the 60s

290
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:41,528
and never changed in Disneyland,

291
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:44,208
but in Disney World there was this brief bizarre period

292
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:48,988
where Iago and Zazu showed up and like wait a minute,

293
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:51,288
we're changing things up around here.

294
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:55,508
So same thing, Iago and Zazu take over the Hall of Presidents

295
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:57,728
and turn them all into critters.

296
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:01,268
Whenever we do the under new management episode,

297
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:05,128
that will also be the second Howl at the Moon episode

298
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:07,248
because that's the only way to make

299
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:08,888
under new management palatable.

300
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:10,428
You mean we'll have to drink a lot of blue goo?

301
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:13,808
Yeah, we each drink a bucket and then we're like okay,

302
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:16,528
so then Iago, this motherfucker.

303
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:19,688
So he burst into flames.

304
00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:22,368
The only goo is gonna get us through

305
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,128
talking about that attraction.

306
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,588
Well, hey, I like this.

307
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:30,888
Some like, just mixing and matching.

308
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:34,528
Why don't the, like the attractions should all get to trade.

309
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:40,848
I say put FDR and Truman and John Quincy Adams

310
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:43,128
on the riverboat in Splash Mountain

311
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:47,368
and take a goose and who else is on there?

312
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:50,968
I guess like an old country dog

313
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:52,988
and put them in the Hall of Presidents for a little while.

314
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:55,068
Let them take little vacations

315
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:56,708
and visit each other and be pen pals.

316
00:12:56,868 --> 00:12:58,428
I think that's also a great plus up

317
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:01,368
because the Hall of Presidents is kind of a cursed attraction

318
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:03,168
and that they can never tear it down.

319
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:08,328
The outcry would be so obnoxious.

320
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,608
It would seem like a reaction

321
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:11,788
to whoever the sitting president was

322
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:14,368
and it's clear that from now on,

323
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:18,108
the president will always be a divisive figure.

324
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:22,048
So you don't wanna piss off either side by tearing it down.

325
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:24,368
Yeah, yeah, I mean it seems like Carousel of Progress

326
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:26,068
will probably be there for a long time

327
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:28,768
because Walt always wanted it to stay but.

328
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,728
That too, Uncle Orville, pretend he was the president.

329
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:32,648
Oh yeah.

330
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,248
Oh yeah.

331
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:35,908
Put one of the presidents in a bathtub on stage.

332
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:38,128
Orville D. Knapptaker.

333
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:41,268
Well Taft famously couldn't fit.

334
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:42,148
What was it?

335
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:43,228
He was a large man.

336
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:44,128
He was a large boy.

337
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:45,048
What if.

338
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:47,728
That's not the first time a large boy

339
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:49,308
will come up on today's episode

340
00:13:49,308 --> 00:13:50,668
which is about the monorail.

341
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,368
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're getting to it.

342
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:53,308
I had one more pit.

343
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:56,528
I just removed, here, solved the Yeti problem

344
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:59,048
by removing the Yeti, putting him in the Hall of Presidents

345
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,528
and then taking Andrew Jackson

346
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:02,908
and installing him on the Expedition Everest

347
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,128
and have him swipe at you as you go by.

348
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:06,248
Might be too scary.

349
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:07,248
Or maybe a gun with a gun

350
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:08,828
or when he dueled.

351
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:10,048
A big musket, sure.

352
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:10,648
Famously.

353
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:14,788
Yeah, who would've thought that at the top of Everest

354
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,648
is. Andrew Jackson.

355
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:18,768
The ghost, presumably, or a zombie,

356
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:20,628
or an undead Andrew Jackson.

357
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:21,168
Yeah.

358
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:23,508
Which now it sounds like I'm pitching a sequel

359
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:25,588
to Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.

360
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,528
So like a real random movie.

361
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:28,268
So random.

362
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:29,728
So random.

363
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:31,708
This is what's gonna be good when we do all these atrats.

364
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,648
The rides are all great, but let's make them more random.

365
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,368
So yeah, I love random humor.

366
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:41,628
I think we all do, and the best part about it

367
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:42,948
is it's sustaining.

368
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:45,628
It can go for hours.

369
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:47,448
That's true.

370
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:49,128
I mean, commercials are my favorite

371
00:14:49,128 --> 00:14:51,208
of all the random humor I like.

372
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:52,168
Oh, the best.

373
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:53,988
Of all the content I like,

374
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:56,788
commercials are the random content I like.

375
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:57,508
Yeah.

376
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:58,708
That's probably right.

377
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:00,148
Of all the content.

378
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:01,628
Skittles commercials are the best media.

379
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,428
Properties.

380
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:02,628
Yeah.

381
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:08,048
Well, a lot of great ideas here, and once again,

382
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,888
President Bush, the robot, I mean,

383
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:12,408
thank you for your service.

384
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,248
We're giving you animatronic of the month.

385
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:18,048
When December's gone, sorry, it'll be somebody else,

386
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,368
but hey, thanks for everything.

387
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:23,968
Respectful honoring on our part.

388
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:26,688
But hey, we're not here to talk about any of that.

389
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:29,588
We're here to talk about the highway in the sky.

390
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:32,008
We're talking the monorail,

391
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:36,268
which I feel is a perfect topic for this podcast

392
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,908
in that it's kind of a ride

393
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:40,408
and kind of a dull functional thing.

394
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:43,428
It's sort of a mixture of the things

395
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:46,748
that we equally weight on this podcast.

396
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,568
Well, it's definitely functional.

397
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:50,388
I think it's far from dull.

398
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:52,308
Yeah, you're right.

399
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:55,168
That was not a good term, yes.

400
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,368
I understand what you mean.

401
00:15:56,528 --> 00:15:58,628
A practical transportation thing,

402
00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:00,408
although did not start that way.

403
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:03,328
I learned a lot about the monorail researching for this.

404
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:06,828
Yeah, this was very interesting research to get to do.

405
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:12,128
Also, though, before we get into the origins of it,

406
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,608
I mean, it's been a fixture in Disney theme parks

407
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,728
since 1959 in Disneyland,

408
00:16:17,288 --> 00:16:19,728
and I think a beloved part

409
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,448
and a fun part of the kinetic energy of the parks,

410
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,948
but I think we've been thinking about it recently

411
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:28,628
because it's been a weird year for the monorails.

412
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:29,468
Sure, it's a-

413
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:31,828
A couple of odd incidents in Disney World, especially.

414
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:35,028
Class action lawsuit waiting to happen in Florida.

415
00:16:35,268 --> 00:16:35,988
Right.

416
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:41,468
There was a Wikipedia page called Disney World Incidents,

417
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:43,408
and the monorail section is huge.

418
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:46,648
Three incidents in 2018 alone.

419
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:48,588
God, that's what I thought.

420
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:50,688
I knew there's been a lot of weird stuff lately,

421
00:16:50,888 --> 00:16:52,728
and I thought, isn't a lot of it this year?

422
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:53,728
And in fact, it is.

423
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:55,888
Those things, by the way,

424
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:59,328
so there was a monorail red down in Florida

425
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:02,248
was driving for a while with just a door open.

426
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:04,628
Yes, and that video is on YouTube,

427
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:06,288
and will forever be on YouTube

428
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:08,648
because multiple people have duplicated it,

429
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,148
so you'll always be able to find a copy.

430
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:13,608
Disney's gonna have a harder time getting rid of stuff,

431
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:16,048
making stuff go away in the social media age.

432
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:21,528
There was also a giant chunk fell out of one of them.

433
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:24,588
Yeah, I forget at which point in the track,

434
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:27,168
but it almost hit a guest who was walking by.

435
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,208
There was a pedestrian.

436
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:30,408
It wasn't just in one of the swampy parts.

437
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:33,128
Just like a big, weird piece of space junk

438
00:17:33,128 --> 00:17:35,708
fell out of the thing and almost hit a guy,

439
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:37,028
and then they had to stop it,

440
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:38,888
and people were trapped on there for a while

441
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:40,588
while they made sure everything else was okay.

442
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:45,328
And then at the Grand Floridian station,

443
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:48,828
a door just fell off entirely

444
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:51,648
because a scooter hit it.

445
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:53,568
A scooter, yeah, someone's scooter,

446
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:57,748
like they misdirected it,

447
00:17:57,768 --> 00:17:59,768
and it just seemed like it dinged it,

448
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:02,528
but it's almost like if you accidentally banged it,

449
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:05,148
like, you know, shouldered the door a little.

450
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:07,008
It doesn't seem like they were going

451
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:08,968
a million miles per hour and knocked it off.

452
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:10,468
It seems like they dinged it a little,

453
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:12,508
and the whole door fell off,

454
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,208
and then it was just stuck there for hours.

455
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:16,208
It's a very, like, animation.

456
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,528
It's a very, like, Road Runner-y kind of, like,

457
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:20,748
tink, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

458
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:21,928
Everything collapses.

459
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,908
And the incidents where that one

460
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:28,708
and the incident where the monorail became disabled

461
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,728
and the air conditioner failed

462
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:31,668
and they had to go out, open the windows,

463
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:33,468
and a tractor had to come and tow it,

464
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:37,248
both monorail lime, both this year, both monorail lime.

465
00:18:37,468 --> 00:18:38,708
The same monorail.

466
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,508
The same monorail.

467
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,028
Oh, monorail lime.

468
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:41,848
Monorail lime.

469
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:43,288
Get your act together.

470
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:45,468
So all of this is making,

471
00:18:45,528 --> 00:18:47,768
I mean, we could talk about the monorail

472
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:49,768
at any time, and this is a good topic,

473
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:51,488
but I like talking about it at the end of 2018,

474
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:54,668
a decidedly rough year for the monorail.

475
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,188
So, you know, let's talk about its history

476
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:00,028
and the better days of the monorail

477
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:02,328
and then talk a little bit about its future.

478
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:03,568
Sure. Sure.

479
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:07,008
I mean, when it opened at Disneyland

480
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:12,288
was the first daily operational monorail in America.

481
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:12,868
Okay.

482
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:18,528
And did not have an end point,

483
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:20,048
like it just left the station,

484
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:22,208
did a scenic tour, came back to the station.

485
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,868
Oh, the original path was?

486
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:25,108
The very, very original.

487
00:19:25,228 --> 00:19:26,268
Okay, okay, yes.

488
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,288
It was, I believe, 0.8 miles.

489
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:30,388
A pretty quick little trip.

490
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:30,688
Yeah, compared to now.

491
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:33,468
Now, is it the same path that it kind of does

492
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:35,228
before you land in Disneyland,

493
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:38,528
where it's kind of circular, weaving in and out

494
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:41,648
of the Autopia area and going around the Matterhorn?

495
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,688
I think similar-ish,

496
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,848
but a lot of attractions have changed

497
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:48,128
and the track's been changed so many times.

498
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,288
They have to keep moving it to account for stuff.

499
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:54,768
It's been close to 60 years in Disneyland

500
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:58,228
and reading about the different generations of it

501
00:19:58,228 --> 00:20:01,188
in Disneyland, it has changed so many times.

502
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:05,468
There's been four different generations of monorail cars,

503
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:07,668
monorails themselves, in Disneyland.

504
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:10,028
Only two in Florida, which we'll get to.

505
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:12,748
And that's, Florida's coming up on 50 years,

506
00:20:12,788 --> 00:20:15,388
and it's bad, there's only been two generations, clearly.

507
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:16,908
Yeah, I don't think they've updated it since.

508
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:18,708
I saw several numbers, but either,

509
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:20,628
I couldn't tell if it was 1989 or 1991,

510
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:23,348
but either way, hasn't been a new fleet since then.

511
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:24,048
Since then.

512
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:26,488
It's pretty crazy and might kind of illustrate

513
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:28,168
why they're either. Kind of.

514
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,348
There's been rumors of, are they phasing it out?

515
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:31,328
Yeah. It doesn't seem like

516
00:20:31,328 --> 00:20:34,028
they are necessarily, but yeah, I think they need to do.

517
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:36,188
There's been rumors, there's new ones coming,

518
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:37,848
and rumors that they're getting,

519
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:39,308
they're just gonna take it all apart.

520
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:42,848
Yeah, which I think there would be a big public backlash

521
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:44,828
to just getting rid of it.

522
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:46,248
Yeah, yes and no.

523
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,088
I mean, like anything where you're like,

524
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:49,548
oh, people aren't gonna stand for this,

525
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:50,348
but then they'll do it,

526
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:51,708
and then what, people aren't gonna go?

527
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:54,748
Yeah, no, I mean, that would be how it goes down,

528
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:57,828
but it would be extremely, I feel like I associate

529
00:20:57,828 --> 00:21:01,848
the monorail more with Florida than Disneyland.

530
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:04,668
Because, okay, yeah, when it opened in Disneyland,

531
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:05,588
it just did a loop.

532
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:09,288
For, since then, since the 60s, it has two stops,

533
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:11,828
one in the park and one at, well,

534
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:13,288
formerly the Disneyland Hotel,

535
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:15,488
now it's just, it's kinda downtown Disney in general.

536
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:19,308
In Disney World, it is a vital part of the infrastructure

537
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:20,808
and getting from place to place,

538
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:22,628
and especially, probably the easiest way

539
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:25,628
to get from Magic Kingdom Zone to Epcot Zone.

540
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:28,268
Yeah, still, despite the troubles,

541
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:32,408
it's still a more pleasant and usually more reliable

542
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:33,628
than the bus system.

543
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:35,828
Oh, certainly, yeah, yeah, and the buses seem kinda,

544
00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:37,808
unless I'm mistaken, if there hasn't been

545
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:39,288
a new bus set up in a while.

546
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:42,988
The buses are, the last time, it depends, I feel like,

547
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,628
because the last time I was there,

548
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,588
the buses weren't so bad.

549
00:21:46,668 --> 00:21:48,648
Certain buses, they have, like certain places

550
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:49,628
have more buses.

551
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:52,748
So if you're going to Epcot, it's not so bad,

552
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:56,028
but if you're going to, I'm trying to think,

553
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:59,068
Saratoga Springs, one of the weird off-road.

554
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:01,408
Yeah, if you were trying to go from Saratoga Springs

555
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:03,448
to what's, that's on one end of the property,

556
00:22:03,568 --> 00:22:05,868
what's on the other, is Animal Kingdom on the other end?

557
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,708
Like, that's gonna take you.

558
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:11,128
I think that's the furthest, yeah, I remember,

559
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:14,128
I felt like I was driving forever to get to Animal Kingdom

560
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:15,608
from wherever I started.

561
00:22:16,728 --> 00:22:18,348
I should, I don't know the,

562
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:19,948
I couldn't remember the name of this,

563
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:22,528
but it's from this year, but there is a Disney Dish episode,

564
00:22:22,828 --> 00:22:27,008
very interesting, about Florida's transportation systems,

565
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:32,408
because they brought on a former transportation person

566
00:22:32,408 --> 00:22:37,248
from the San Francisco Muni system to consult at Disney,

567
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:40,708
and he was like, here, looking towards the future,

568
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:44,088
you need to start thinking about the transit systems

569
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:48,848
in the Orlando Resort as if you were a massive city,

570
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,828
because you are.

571
00:22:50,108 --> 00:22:50,468
Sure.

572
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:53,588
So that's why, you know, so more buses,

573
00:22:53,648 --> 00:22:56,108
and that's why you see the Skyliner is coming,

574
00:22:56,128 --> 00:23:00,568
the gondola system, which is, I mean, from what I have read,

575
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,028
rather than extending the monorail,

576
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,728
because it would be something like over a million dollars

577
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,048
for every extra mile of monorail track,

578
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:10,608
for like a lot less money,

579
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:12,708
you can get a whole gondola system.

580
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,328
So that's why they're getting that,

581
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:17,348
and for the demand for Star Wars land.

582
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:18,888
I think it's very interesting.

583
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:21,828
They seem to really be stretching out the announcements

584
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:24,528
about the Skyliner system, especially so far,

585
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:26,588
they have not used the phrase air conditioning

586
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:28,448
in reference to those Skyliners.

587
00:23:28,488 --> 00:23:30,028
I don't think there's going to be air conditioning in them.

588
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:30,208
There is.

589
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,328
I think it's just gonna be a little hotboxes

590
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,308
flying through the sky.

591
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:33,708
Yeah.

592
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:35,928
If anybody's listening and doesn't know what these are,

593
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:37,028
yeah, it is this new gondola thing,

594
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:39,568
it's sort of like, I mean, it's reminiscent

595
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:42,148
of the old Skyway that used to be there,

596
00:23:42,148 --> 00:23:43,068
but they're bigger.

597
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:46,628
It actually feels a lot like the Ferris wheel cars,

598
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:48,928
but you sit in them for a while.

599
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:50,348
I'm scared of this thing.

600
00:23:50,468 --> 00:23:50,888
I am too.

601
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:51,668
I'll be honest with you.

602
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:53,828
I'm not dying to get in that thing.

603
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:56,468
And I was talking about the air conditioning thing

604
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,908
with Erin, and she brought up a good point,

605
00:23:58,908 --> 00:24:01,448
which is like, there's families getting on these,

606
00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:04,008
there are babies getting on these things.

607
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:10,008
The smell of hot, ventilated plastic cells

608
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:11,188
could get awful.

609
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:13,268
And then what if it breaks and you're just stuck

610
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:15,588
over some trees in the middle of the swamp

611
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:18,928
in like 90 degree, like, this stuff stops sometimes.

612
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:22,408
Yeah, so I am skeptical, but this is not like

613
00:24:22,408 --> 00:24:24,228
the first of its kind sort of thing,

614
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,308
like the Monorail was.

615
00:24:25,408 --> 00:24:28,448
There are urban gondola systems all over the world.

616
00:24:28,448 --> 00:24:29,848
So it's like been tested.

617
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:30,408
Are there really?

618
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:31,928
Is that like a part of cities?

619
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,808
In Asia, Asia or like mountainous cities.

620
00:24:35,188 --> 00:24:37,868
Like, yeah, these sorts of like suspended gondola systems

621
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:42,228
are like efficient and used by people in like daily activity.

622
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:44,228
I think there's some in Hong Kong.

623
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:47,708
Sounds like a gondola lobby representative over here.

624
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:51,528
And apparently some of them do not have air conditioning

625
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:56,148
in areas like not dissimilar from Orlando's climates.

626
00:24:56,148 --> 00:24:59,508
But that said, you go to Orlando,

627
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,488
everything is air conditioning.

628
00:25:01,628 --> 00:25:04,088
Your brain kind of recalibrates to that.

629
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,828
So then to get into a mode of transit

630
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:09,808
without air conditioning, I don't know.

631
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:12,608
Look, I will try it.

632
00:25:12,628 --> 00:25:15,088
I will do it because we have to do it.

633
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:18,808
We're theme park journalists, but I am weary of it.

634
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:22,228
I don't like the dangling for that long also.

635
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:24,948
Feels like you're gonna be up there for like 45 minutes.

636
00:25:24,968 --> 00:25:27,248
It feels like let's just take the fucking bus

637
00:25:27,248 --> 00:25:29,208
or let's just like, let's walk.

638
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,348
Like it'll be fast.

639
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:31,808
Like, I don't know, maybe it will be fast.

640
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:33,608
Maybe I'm totally wrong.

641
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:37,328
Yeah, but keep in mind, you know, Nemo's on the outside.

642
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:39,528
So that's fun.

643
00:25:39,768 --> 00:25:42,688
There's a painting of a character that you can't see.

644
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:46,348
He's a journey and transits were so smooth.

645
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,888
So what a smooth journey he had.

646
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:54,848
To bring it back to the original Monorail,

647
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,988
has the Anaheim one ever been air conditioned?

648
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:01,228
I think it's always had just windows, right?

649
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,068
Just windows cracked.

650
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,148
Just windows cracked.

651
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,728
It doesn't feel like hot to me.

652
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:05,768
It doesn't.

653
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:08,748
I think it's more because of our kind of temperate climate

654
00:26:08,748 --> 00:26:10,888
in Southern California gets away with it.

655
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:11,968
Maybe, maybe that's right.

656
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,228
But I was a little surprised.

657
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:13,748
I feel like eerie.

658
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:14,388
I don't know.

659
00:26:14,388 --> 00:26:16,308
I'm not uncomfortable in that thing,

660
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,868
but then you're not in it for that long.

661
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:18,408
Right. That's true.

662
00:26:18,428 --> 00:26:19,408
Maybe you'd notice.

663
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:22,348
Neither side of that path is super long.

664
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:24,608
But some of them are,

665
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:27,108
you were on that Monorail and thinking like the clearings

666
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:29,108
on this thing are not a lot.

667
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:29,608
Oh yeah.

668
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:31,448
There's certain points of it where you feel like

669
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:33,948
if you stuck your hand through that open crack

670
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:36,888
that's right there that you could just do.

671
00:26:37,468 --> 00:26:39,008
Yeah, you could like, you know,

672
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:40,488
scrape your arm against the Monorail,

673
00:26:40,608 --> 00:26:42,608
or it's the Matterhorn and it snaps clean off.

674
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,648
Yeah, the clearings are very slight.

675
00:26:44,648 --> 00:26:48,188
Although I've read that they do do landscaping

676
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:51,368
for like trees and brush around the Monorail path.

677
00:26:51,368 --> 00:26:53,688
They like have it calculative.

678
00:26:53,688 --> 00:26:55,588
Like, all right, we have to cut it here.

679
00:26:55,888 --> 00:26:58,148
This is the farthest someone could reach out a window.

680
00:26:58,148 --> 00:26:59,048
Sure. Okay.

681
00:26:59,128 --> 00:27:00,668
To like grab a branch or something.

682
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:01,348
Okay.

683
00:27:01,348 --> 00:27:03,548
Well, it would still just in case

684
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:05,728
nobody stick your arms out of the thing.

685
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:06,128
Yes.

686
00:27:06,188 --> 00:27:09,088
Now that said there may be clearings, you know,

687
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:14,468
pre that may be grandfathered in from like building codes.

688
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:15,708
I could grab something.

689
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:16,988
When the 50s were a little shady.

690
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:17,588
Yeah.

691
00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:18,328
Give it a try.

692
00:27:18,648 --> 00:27:19,808
I could grab something.

693
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:21,648
There's a couple of places in the park,

694
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,388
which I think I can like grab stuff.

695
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,788
And I think I've mentioned this before.

696
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:27,308
The guy grabbed when we were on the Indiana Jones ride,

697
00:27:27,368 --> 00:27:29,168
just a guy in the front grabbed the rope.

698
00:27:29,168 --> 00:27:29,928
Oh my God.

699
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:31,968
And I was like, what, that shouldn't be possible.

700
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,468
I thought they tested for this.

701
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:35,068
So you couldn't know he grabbed it.

702
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,348
He like had a good hold on it.

703
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:38,208
And I was like, you're gonna pull the robot down.

704
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:40,828
If or what if the other way,

705
00:27:40,948 --> 00:27:44,468
what if he actually got hold of it, got out of the car

706
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:46,848
and the next car that showed up, there's Indy

707
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:48,608
and then another guy hanging behind.

708
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,148
That's fun though.

709
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:50,988
And his friend.

710
00:27:52,108 --> 00:27:52,648
And then he joined.

711
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:54,108
He must be from part four.

712
00:27:54,148 --> 00:27:55,048
I don't recognize him.

713
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:56,768
What is that adult Mutt Williams?

714
00:27:57,528 --> 00:27:58,948
It's adult Mutt Williams.

715
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:02,648
And he just drops in that car and gets out of there.

716
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:03,388
Yeah.

717
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:04,208
That would be fun.

718
00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:05,788
See you guys.

719
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:08,228
And they're like, wow, that's the most like active,

720
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:10,048
realistic robot I've ever seen.

721
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:10,688
That would be great.

722
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:12,308
You know what, Ash, wait,

723
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:14,008
we're talking about monorail safety.

724
00:28:14,268 --> 00:28:15,148
I have with me.

725
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:15,508
Oh yeah.

726
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,848
My toy monorail.

727
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:20,468
And I can, hey, I'll let the monorail speak for itself.

728
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,832
Okay, so that's the...

729
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:32,212
Okay, so that's the...

730
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,532
Okay, that is the last one.

731
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:37,272
Those pauses are super long.

732
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:45,552
But, as I do have a toy monorail, I was so happy to bring this back with me from Disney World like a decade ago.

733
00:28:45,852 --> 00:28:50,992
And I love that it is a toy that says dry legally that year.

734
00:28:50,992 --> 00:28:54,932
Sure, it does not have, though, permanents there, sentados.

735
00:28:55,332 --> 00:28:57,312
Yeah, you know, I thought it did.

736
00:28:58,492 --> 00:29:00,852
Yeah, that actually is kind of a...

737
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:06,452
That is such a big part of my vacations as a kid, as we used to say that in the Spanish.

738
00:29:06,772 --> 00:29:07,552
Yeah, me too.

739
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,232
The Jack Wagner narration.

740
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,752
Maybe that's why it stands out.

741
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:18,552
It is like the obvious, like, stuffy old white guy saying a Spanish phrase.

742
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:22,212
He's been replaced a couple times now.

743
00:29:22,232 --> 00:29:24,092
Well, they usually sound...

744
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:27,432
I think they still have the Jack Wagner say, like, part of it.

745
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:32,572
That started to get a little weird reading about, like, and then this person took over, and then this person started doing the spion.

746
00:29:32,572 --> 00:29:34,932
I'm like, all right, this is too deep even for me.

747
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:36,652
I can't track all these voice actors.

748
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:39,752
A lot of things, yeah, I had that in my research too.

749
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:41,092
I also found, like, I don't...

750
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:48,432
Like, my level of caring about the different marks was not what it probably should be as the host of a theme park podcast.

751
00:29:48,432 --> 00:29:53,092
I started going, so what's the difference between Mark IV and Mark V monorail?

752
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:53,912
I don't...

753
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:59,412
Look, if you're listening and you care about this more, well, I mean, I wrote down things about the marks.

754
00:29:59,552 --> 00:30:01,192
I just don't care that much.

755
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:11,592
I think it's hard to distinguish, like, generation by generation, but big picture, I think something interesting begins to appear.

756
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:12,592
Okay, sure.

757
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:16,712
Hey, guys.

758
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:17,392
Michael here.

759
00:30:17,392 --> 00:30:21,632
I just want to tell you a little bit about a company called Away that makes some really great suitcases.

760
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:28,152
Away uses high quality materials while offering a much lower price compared to other brands by cutting out the middleman and selling directly to you.

761
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,992
You can choose from a variety of colors and four sizes.

762
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:33,992
The carry-on, the bigger carry-on, the medium, or the large.

763
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:35,312
That's for extended stays.

764
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:37,492
Some key design features of the suitcases.

765
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:42,052
They're all made with premium German polycarbonate, unrivaled in strength, and impact resistant.

766
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,652
It's also very lightweight, which means that I can carry it.

767
00:30:44,652 --> 00:30:48,972
The interior features a patent-pending compression system, helpful for overpackers.

768
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:52,712
It's got four 360-degree spinner wheels, guaranteeing a smooth ride.

769
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:58,132
It has TSA-approved combination locks built into the tops of all the bags to prevent theft.

770
00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:04,772
It's got a removable, washable laundry bag that keeps dirty clothes separate from clean, which is great because I just usually use a plastic bag.

771
00:31:05,112 --> 00:31:10,832
Both sizes of the carry-on are able to charge all cell phones, tablets, e-readers, and anything else that's powered by a USB cord.

772
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:14,552
A single charge of the Away carry-on will charge your iPhone five times.

773
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:15,892
It's got a lifetime warranty.

774
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:19,252
If anything breaks, they will fix or replace it for you, for life.

775
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,712
It's got a 100-day trial.

776
00:31:20,772 --> 00:31:23,652
You live with it, vibe with it, travel with it, Instagram it.

777
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:26,572
If at any point you decide it's not for you, return it for a full refund.

778
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:27,812
No questions asked.

779
00:31:28,112 --> 00:31:31,012
It's got free shipping on all the way orders within the lower 48 states.

780
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:36,372
All the carry-on sizes are compliant with all major U.S. airlines, while maximizing the amount you can pack.

781
00:31:36,432 --> 00:31:41,212
And if you're in town, please be sure to visit Away at their retail store in New York City.

782
00:31:41,712 --> 00:31:43,292
Now folks, I use my iPhone a ton.

783
00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:48,212
An Apple employee once told me I use it twice the amount of a normal human, so I constantly need to charge.

784
00:31:48,452 --> 00:31:50,552
These suitcases charge for you.

785
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:51,412
It's crazy.

786
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:52,572
You don't need to go to some plug.

787
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:57,672
You don't need to go to some fancy lounge where they have all these plugs and champagne waiting for you.

788
00:31:57,712 --> 00:31:58,012
No.

789
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:01,212
You charge your iPhone right to the suitcase wherever you are.

790
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:01,752
It's great.

791
00:32:02,032 --> 00:32:02,732
So here's the thing.

792
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:04,812
We got a special offer for all your listeners.

793
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:11,872
For $20 off a suitcase, visit away travel dot com slash theme park and use promo code theme park during checkout.

794
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:17,352
That's away travel dot com slash theme park and use promo code theme park during checkout.

795
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:22,392
You will be glad you did, especially if you use your phone a lot like me, Michael.

796
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:30,592
Going back to the very beginning, it was originally called the Disney Owlweg monorail.

797
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:41,752
Owlweg was a company that sort of designed the basics of it and then Disney sort of customized it from there.

798
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:52,472
Well, the story there, if you wonder what that phrase Owlweg is, it is a shortening of the name of a Swedish entrepreneur named Axel Winner Grin.

799
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:55,472
So Owlweg is a weird, almost Disney-esque.

800
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:57,712
There's a lot of those weird Mapo.

801
00:32:58,072 --> 00:32:59,592
There was a...

802
00:32:59,592 --> 00:33:00,872
What is Mapo?

803
00:33:01,232 --> 00:33:05,432
It was part of Imagineering and it's short for Mary Poppins.

804
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:12,152
So some functional engineering wing of Imagineering was called Mapo, which is nonsense, the dis-shortening of Mary Poppins.

805
00:33:12,452 --> 00:33:19,012
It was the actual fabrication division of Imagineering.

806
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,712
Did Mapo work on the Owlweg?

807
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:22,852
No.

808
00:33:22,892 --> 00:33:28,552
No, I think the later ones, the later ones when Disney was designing it.

809
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:33,832
Then eventually when it got to a certain point, they outsourced it a little more.

810
00:33:34,992 --> 00:33:43,592
So Owlweg, there's this weird, there's some conjecture that this is a kind of made-up-because-it's-cute kind of story,

811
00:33:45,012 --> 00:33:53,492
but Walt's fascination with monorails supposedly began when he was in Germany, or he actually, I think he was leaving, or maybe this was Sweden.

812
00:33:53,652 --> 00:34:02,732
He was leaving the set of Third Man on the Mountain, which is the movie that inspired Matterhorn, where he left that, or he was on the set,

813
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:08,152
and he sent home a postcard of the Matterhorn and said, make me this.

814
00:34:08,412 --> 00:34:19,252
So he's riding high with Matterhorn ideas already, and he's leaving with his wife, and he's driving along the countryside and then sees a beam monorail,

815
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:29,052
and is fascinated by it, lights up, and he follows it until he can see the name on it, and the name is Owlweg,

816
00:34:29,332 --> 00:34:35,232
and he writes that down and says, or maybe he just went to the building right then and there.

817
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:42,912
So that's, okay, so the version I read is that they were on a, him and his wife were in Germany on a suspended monorail,

818
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:47,752
one that has the track on the top, and the monorail is suspended, and it was shaking a lot.

819
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:49,012
And making her dizzy.

820
00:34:49,072 --> 00:34:54,192
And making, yes, Lily and Disney dizzy. Lily and Disney. Lily and Disney dizzy.

821
00:34:56,052 --> 00:35:01,072
And she, supposedly she said, this would be nice if it didn't shake so much, and they were driving,

822
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:06,212
and then they saw that, more of a version that you know of, the monorail.

823
00:35:06,352 --> 00:35:10,012
The beamed monorail, which she was not aware of existing in the world.

824
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:16,472
And then supposedly Walt was like, take me to the office, and he spoke with the engineers and people there, and that's when it starts.

825
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:23,732
And yeah, that's the company. But then they were working with the company, and something fell apart, and then they were like, we'll just build it ourselves.

826
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:25,012
So they just, Walt Disney.

827
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:27,172
So they had to have the name.

828
00:35:27,932 --> 00:35:31,412
There was a legal situation that they had to use the name.

829
00:35:31,492 --> 00:35:36,052
The guy's name is also like, Alweg is just the first letter of each of his like.

830
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:43,492
Yeah, Axel Wener, it's A-L, it's the first and then the last, and then it's very confusing where he got to Alweg.

831
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:49,232
By the way, Axel Wenergren popularized the domestic vacuum cleaner.

832
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:57,332
He thought that he was the one who believed that industrial vacuums could be adapted and simplified to work in the home.

833
00:35:57,612 --> 00:36:02,492
So you having a vacuum cleaner in your home is ultimately due to Axel Wenergren.

834
00:36:02,772 --> 00:36:11,312
The other thing about him is that it is rumored that the actress Greta Garbo was working as a spy to spy on him.

835
00:36:11,332 --> 00:36:11,972
Really?

836
00:36:12,112 --> 00:36:18,292
Because he was friends with Herman Goring, who is a major Nazi party official.

837
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:20,912
Oh, I didn't know it was this guy, this monorail man.

838
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,832
Yeah, Greta Garbo is a spy spying on the monorail man, I guess.

839
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:26,592
That's incredible.

840
00:36:26,672 --> 00:36:27,452
Yeah, isn't that crazy?

841
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:32,452
What do you know about our local connection to the man?

842
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:33,112
I don't.

843
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:39,972
Alweg proposed a Los Angeles monorail, a system for Los Angeles in the 60s.

844
00:36:40,112 --> 00:36:46,652
And they were going to take, apparently they were going to take the financial risk for building it.

845
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,132
And then, of course, the project just fell apart.

846
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:59,892
A big proponent of the project, the sci-fi novel author Ray Bradbury, a very friend of Disneyland, Ray Bradbury.

847
00:36:59,972 --> 00:37:06,792
And apparently held on to that grudge because when LA finally did build the Red Line, did build a subway, he was pissed.

848
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:10,492
He's like, 20 years ago, we almost had a monorail.

849
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:18,092
Yeah, he said he wished it, when they asked what he thought, he's like, I want to go, what I think is we should go back in time and take Alweg's offer.

850
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:20,032
And we didn't just have a monorail.

851
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:28,872
And his point was that subways are for kind of like cold, dark places.

852
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:36,752
It's like to provide a little bit of warmth and light in a city like a Moscow or Toronto that's snowy a lot.

853
00:37:36,752 --> 00:37:46,072
So why would you have claustrophobic, no sunlight transit in a always sunny city like LA?

854
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:49,192
So yeah, we should have. That's true.

855
00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:55,912
So Alweg was like a Musk, an Elon Musk of his day, except maybe he built more things.

856
00:37:55,912 --> 00:37:58,572
Yeah, he smoked big old J's too.

857
00:37:59,252 --> 00:38:05,212
Also has ties to a questionable upbringing and political.

858
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:14,412
If you were raised in the mid 20th century, white with money in South Africa, you're going to come out a little weird.

859
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:18,692
Sure. Would Alweg have loved Rick and Morty memes though?

860
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,652
Oh boy. I think yes.

861
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,052
My answer is yes.

862
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:28,212
In his memoirs, he spoke of a fondness for all things dank.

863
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:31,012
Yeah. Alweg loved dank memes.

864
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:41,272
I found that. So the official designator for the Disneyland Monorail, the first daily operating Monorail in the United States and the Western Hemisphere.

865
00:38:41,472 --> 00:38:43,452
Wow. Geez.

866
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:54,472
And you know, I think it was like also clearly important to Walt Disney because if you follow the, you know, clearly what he started getting into beyond from the success of Disneyland and beyond,

867
00:38:54,472 --> 00:39:09,672
he started dreaming of utopias and making life cleaner and society cleaner and transit cleaner and which culminates in the dream of Epcot when it was an actual city and community as opposed to the theme park it became.

868
00:39:09,992 --> 00:39:22,832
So to be able to show off this cutting edge technology, show how clean and efficient it was and say everyone could have this if you talk to your local governments and it didn't really happen.

869
00:39:22,832 --> 00:39:23,272
It didn't.

870
00:39:23,272 --> 00:39:26,552
A couple of places at Monorails but not so much.

871
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:32,252
It kind of lined up with the rise of driving culture and car culture in America.

872
00:39:32,652 --> 00:39:41,052
But even then, and this is a thing I'm very excited to talk about, the grand opening footage of the Disneyland Monorail.

873
00:39:41,892 --> 00:39:45,992
Even back then in 1959, there's footage of gridlock.

874
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:48,532
There's roads of like, you know, cars.

875
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:51,832
How do we alleviate all this gridlock with these cars?

876
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,692
Well, Mr. Disney may have found the solution.

877
00:39:54,852 --> 00:40:10,972
Does that mean that you saw the same video that I did where they illustrate traffic by, they're showing a lot of overhead traffic and then cutting to like sheep all packed together and cows and animals all like screaming.

878
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:16,592
And then cutting back to people honking and then back to animals.

879
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:22,352
They're doing like a like crazy old like manipulative editing style to show like this is you.

880
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,772
You're a cow or a sheep stuck in a herd.

881
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:27,832
I think I saw some of that.

882
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:31,152
I think I just kept seeing so much stock footage of cars.

883
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:33,452
I was like, let's just get to the fucking part.

884
00:40:33,612 --> 00:40:34,552
Oh, you might have skipped it.

885
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:35,792
I jumped to the Nixons.

886
00:40:36,052 --> 00:40:41,192
It became like a weird like exploitative documentary like like propaganda.

887
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:43,412
Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

888
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:45,452
Your sheep, you stuck in your cars.

889
00:40:45,632 --> 00:40:47,512
But with the Monorail, you're free.

890
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:49,112
You're free range now.

891
00:40:49,192 --> 00:40:56,752
That's very funny because then with the other hand, they also had a traction sponsored to you brought to you by the automotive industry.

892
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,692
Sure.

893
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:02,772
So buy it, but also feel bad about it and try to get one of these.

894
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:10,292
And indoctrinating kids via the Autopia to want to drive cars and specifically the loudest, smelliest cars.

895
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:11,612
Yeah, the loudest cars.

896
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:13,532
And you love that smell, right?

897
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:16,332
You've said, Jason, did I say I love it?

898
00:41:16,632 --> 00:41:17,892
I think you liked it, right?

899
00:41:18,132 --> 00:41:20,872
I don't think I mind the smell of gasoline.

900
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:26,032
I think what I'll say on the smell of gasoline, I like the smell when you're pumping gas.

901
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:29,432
OK, it's kind of pleasant, but not the smell of Autopia.

902
00:41:29,512 --> 00:41:30,672
That's very unpleasant.

903
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:34,252
I think Autopia should be first on the chopping block.

904
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:34,472
Sure.

905
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:35,592
I think we've talked about that.

906
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:37,732
But I'm talking about the smell of Autopia.

907
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:38,652
It's bad.

908
00:41:39,272 --> 00:41:39,352
Yeah.

909
00:41:39,352 --> 00:41:41,652
Yeah, it's definitely worse than a regular gas station.

910
00:41:41,652 --> 00:41:42,912
But you said you liked it.

911
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:46,812
Probably just from the association of memory.

912
00:41:47,692 --> 00:41:55,072
I mean, I don't love the smell of chlorine in pools, but it certainly reminds me of leisure and time with my family.

913
00:41:55,752 --> 00:41:57,932
Well, chlorine, it feels very like the theme park.

914
00:41:58,092 --> 00:41:58,432
Yeah.

915
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,532
The ET water smell.

916
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:00,992
Yeah.

917
00:42:01,012 --> 00:42:02,032
So I can deal with it.

918
00:42:02,032 --> 00:42:04,272
It's a much more pleasant smell than the Autopia.

919
00:42:04,632 --> 00:42:05,492
I mean, that's true.

920
00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:07,252
I think this is a classic Carlson.

921
00:42:07,432 --> 00:42:09,952
You notched it, and Jason might have said, I don't mind the smell.

922
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:13,372
And in the intervening months, it became, you know, Jason loves the smell.

923
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:14,292
Maybe.

924
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:16,452
I swear you said I like it, though.

925
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:17,732
I...

926
00:42:17,732 --> 00:42:18,752
Maybe it's possible I'm wrong.

927
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:20,392
I mean, it's possible I did.

928
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:26,172
I don't think I said I liked it in the way that I said I like Jack Jack's cookie num nums.

929
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,932
Well, I didn't say you like it more than a cookie.

930
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:32,312
No, man, you go huff gas and then load up on num nums all day.

931
00:42:32,892 --> 00:42:35,512
You're a freak like Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet.

932
00:42:36,152 --> 00:42:36,652
Oh, yeah.

933
00:42:37,132 --> 00:42:38,212
You just have a little...

934
00:42:38,212 --> 00:42:41,392
Get all dranked up and go num num all day.

935
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:46,552
You have a tank full of fumes from Autopia that you huff.

936
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:47,272
Yeah.

937
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:51,812
The fumes make my head num num, and then I go eat num nums.

938
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:53,672
Fuck Pirates of the Caribbean.

939
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:55,772
Autopia gas smell.

940
00:42:57,012 --> 00:42:58,572
You're out of control, Jason.

941
00:42:58,792 --> 00:42:59,892
You're scaring me.

942
00:43:05,132 --> 00:43:08,512
Folks, Mike here, I'm interrupting for just a quick second to tell you about a clothing

943
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:09,572
company called Everlane.

944
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:12,052
They make clothes that I am wearing right now.

945
00:43:12,412 --> 00:43:15,012
So folks, Everlane only makes premium essentials.

946
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:18,272
They use the finest materials and they don't have those traditional markups.

947
00:43:18,372 --> 00:43:22,492
And they tell you what the real cost of the clothes are so you know you're never overpaying.

948
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:25,632
Now Everlane wants you to know what you're paying for and why.

949
00:43:25,912 --> 00:43:29,252
They are radically transparent about every step in their process, from the materials

950
00:43:29,252 --> 00:43:31,512
they use to the ethical factories they work with.

951
00:43:31,512 --> 00:43:33,412
Because Everlane sells directly to you.

952
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:36,792
Their prices are 30 to 50% lower than traditional retailers.

953
00:43:37,332 --> 00:43:40,292
Everlane's clothes look better, cost less, and last longer.

954
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:43,552
Essentials like their cotton crew tee are exactly what they should be.

955
00:43:43,712 --> 00:43:46,332
Simple, stylish, and made from quality materials.

956
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:47,852
I have a few of them.

957
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,272
I love the crew sweatshirt.

958
00:43:49,472 --> 00:43:51,112
I love the nylon weekender bag.

959
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,812
I just took it for a Thanksgiving trip.

960
00:43:53,032 --> 00:43:54,252
I was really enjoying it.

961
00:43:54,512 --> 00:43:55,952
So folks, this is good stuff.

962
00:43:56,052 --> 00:43:58,832
This is clothes that Michael has used.

963
00:43:59,032 --> 00:44:00,192

I am wearing the clothes, folks.

971
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:20,712
I like them a lot.

972
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:27,852
Let's talk about that opening because I know what you're heading for.

973
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:29,812
I know what happened when the Monorail opens.

974
00:44:29,812 --> 00:44:35,432
The grand opening attended by so many stars of Stage and Scream.

975
00:44:35,652 --> 00:44:40,952
I mean, the broadcast had I figured I kind of reverse engineered that.

976
00:44:41,052 --> 00:44:44,792
I believe it was our art link ladder doing like commentary

977
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:49,172
and then cutting the ribbons while you had Uncle Walt with him,

978
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:54,552
the vice president at the time and local Orange County resident Richard Nixon.

979
00:44:54,552 --> 00:44:56,532
Yeah. Lovely wife, Pat.

980
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,492
And then OK, so here's the setup for this.

981
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:02,952
So Walt does this big spiel about like we're happy to have the vice president here today,

982
00:45:03,072 --> 00:45:03,932
blah, blah, blah.

983
00:45:04,112 --> 00:45:09,872
And he says this is the part because I always knew the thing about the ribbon not cutting right.

984
00:45:10,112 --> 00:45:12,492
Watching the footage, I had never seen this before.

985
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:14,492
And two really weird moments.

986
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:21,972
One, Walt says he's joined by his lovely wife today, Pat, and his daughters.

987
00:45:22,212 --> 00:45:23,852
This is how he says it.

988
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:25,812
Julia and Patricia.

989
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:31,732
Like he says Julia and Patricia in the weirdest as if they're foreign names,

990
00:45:31,932 --> 00:45:35,072
as if he like got tongue tied and tried to catch himself.

991
00:45:35,072 --> 00:45:37,952
He goes, Julia and Petrius.

992
00:45:37,992 --> 00:45:41,252
And I'm like, what the what the hell?

993
00:45:41,492 --> 00:45:43,172
And I had to go back.

994
00:45:43,232 --> 00:45:45,832
And yeah, that's the way it sounded.

995
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:49,472
And then it also gets weird because then he turns and is like,

996
00:45:49,472 --> 00:45:54,812
and now to turn over to the vice president, Mr. Nixon and then Richard Nixon.

997
00:45:54,812 --> 00:45:55,852
Mr. Nixon.

998
00:45:56,412 --> 00:46:01,572
And then something and it's hard to tell from like old kinescope footage or whatever.

999
00:46:02,352 --> 00:46:07,792
One of the I don't know if it's Walt or Nixon says vice president.

1000
00:46:07,872 --> 00:46:08,732
Oh, yes, yes.

1001
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:14,892
And I could not figure out whether Walt's caught himself and he was like,

1002
00:46:14,892 --> 00:46:17,672
oh, I shouldn't call him Mr. Nixon.

1003
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,892
I should call him vice president.

1004
00:46:19,332 --> 00:46:23,932
Or if Richard Nixon, one of the most petty men to ever lived, went,

1005
00:46:24,092 --> 00:46:26,172
actually vice president, it's a voice.

1006
00:46:26,352 --> 00:46:31,092
But he says Julia and Patricia, Mr. Nixon,

1007
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:36,212
vice president, and then Nixon stands steps up and start talking.

1008
00:46:36,452 --> 00:46:38,772
OK, this is very this is very strange.

1009
00:46:38,872 --> 00:46:43,432
Well, and then they forgot that he was the vice president altogether

1010
00:46:43,432 --> 00:46:48,272
because he got on board the monorail and did a pass.

1011
00:46:49,292 --> 00:46:52,952
And in and imagineering the veteran and still with us,

1012
00:46:53,112 --> 00:46:57,212
Bob Gurr, who built the monorail, it was a primary figure in building it,

1013
00:46:57,452 --> 00:46:59,712
was at the helm himself driving it around.

1014
00:47:00,092 --> 00:47:02,232
It was this the original monorail had this big bubble.

1015
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:05,412
So he's standing up and piloting this bubble car around.

1016
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:09,832
He does the pass with Walt and Nixon and his family in the car,

1017
00:47:10,212 --> 00:47:14,672
pulls back around and realizes, oh, we left without the Secret Service.

1018
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:20,832
So I had been driving around an unsecure vice president without realizing it.

1019
00:47:20,832 --> 00:47:24,152
Or as Bob Gurr puts it, I kidnapped the vice president.

1020
00:47:24,672 --> 00:47:27,712
And he says that I suppose I think he tells this to Bob Gurr,

1021
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:32,612
tells the story of like Nixon laughing and Nixon, like calling the Secret

1022
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:37,572
Service incompetent, like Nixon, like making goofing on his secret service

1023
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:40,332
while they're going around like they can't get anything right or whatever.

1024
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:43,832
That's extra funny because you know, all of them were drunk.

1025
00:47:44,712 --> 00:47:47,712
Everyone was just dragged like a fish back then.

1026
00:47:47,712 --> 00:47:51,572
Of course, probably the most notable anecdote from this.

1027
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:56,132
And you can see this right after the weird pronunciations and weird,

1028
00:47:56,192 --> 00:48:02,852
mysterious utterance of vice president is Walt pulls out a giant pair of scissors.

1029
00:48:03,252 --> 00:48:04,792
The girls are going to cut the ribbon.

1030
00:48:05,172 --> 00:48:06,532
The ribbon does not cut.

1031
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:07,972
Everyone is a laugh.

1032
00:48:08,012 --> 00:48:09,852
Walt ends up just ripping it himself.

1033
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:12,052
OK. Ribbons are hard.

1034
00:48:12,232 --> 00:48:12,972
It's like guarantee.

1035
00:48:13,132 --> 00:48:16,432
It's like they're trying to doom anything with a ribbon cutting.

1036
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:20,472
Because it's like the most it looks like the most easy thing to mess up.

1037
00:48:20,492 --> 00:48:23,032
And he and he's like giant scissors, too.

1038
00:48:23,112 --> 00:48:23,732
Yeah. Yeah.

1039
00:48:23,752 --> 00:48:27,132
It's like that's if he just had regular scissors, it would have been fine.

1040
00:48:27,192 --> 00:48:30,352
But he has to go and make a big show of it because it's the Disneyland

1041
00:48:30,352 --> 00:48:32,412
Monorail. And that's, I think, really what screwed him.

1042
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:33,612
Just use regular scissors.

1043
00:48:34,652 --> 00:48:36,412
Uh, yeah.

1044
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:41,392
The oh, but you know, by the way, also Richard Nixon, the the sitting president

1045
00:48:41,392 --> 00:48:44,272
for the opening of the Hall of Presidents, he was the first

1046
00:48:44,452 --> 00:48:49,212
the first in the series of presidents who were like currently president

1047
00:48:49,212 --> 00:48:50,832
to have a robot built of them.

1048
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:53,412
Well, I would have loved that because Walt loved Nixon.

1049
00:48:53,952 --> 00:48:55,572
Walt loved Nixon.

1050
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,472
Nixon and Disney go together so much like.

1051
00:48:58,492 --> 00:48:59,472
Yeah. So many times.

1052
00:48:59,632 --> 00:49:04,192
So we've said another Orange County weirdo of another Orange County weirdo.

1053
00:49:04,312 --> 00:49:07,712
Nixon, as we've said, Nixon gave his I am not a crook speech

1054
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:10,872
in the basement of the Contemporary Hotel in Florida.

1055
00:49:10,872 --> 00:49:12,692
Of course, years after Walt's death.

1056
00:49:13,252 --> 00:49:16,352
It's like there's just constant Nixon in the timeline.

1057
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,792
There's also footage, actually, when I was trying to find footage

1058
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:22,552
of George Bush at Disneyland, there's a YouTube video

1059
00:49:22,552 --> 00:49:26,852
that compiles the sitting president's appearances at at Disneyland

1060
00:49:26,852 --> 00:49:28,012
or at Disney World, rather.

1061
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:30,832
And there is footage way later in the 70s.

1062
00:49:30,832 --> 00:49:34,512
I don't know if pre or during or post presidency of Nixon

1063
00:49:34,512 --> 00:49:39,132
getting out of the monorail and looking real, you know, just like sour

1064
00:49:39,132 --> 00:49:41,332
and then like suddenly lighting up for camera.

1065
00:49:41,392 --> 00:49:42,492
All right. Are we doing this?

1066
00:49:42,492 --> 00:49:46,392
But like right before he turns it on, he looks so dead inside.

1067
00:49:46,992 --> 00:49:47,992
If you can imagine that.

1068
00:49:48,092 --> 00:49:49,372
I can believe it.

1069
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,012
The I want to someday we'll get the iTunes review.

1070
00:49:53,192 --> 00:49:55,832
Enough Nixon bashing already.

1071
00:49:56,612 --> 00:49:58,332
I what did he ever do to you?

1072
00:49:58,332 --> 00:49:59,812
He's a great man.

1073
00:50:00,572 --> 00:50:02,472
We apologize to Nixon.

1074
00:50:02,592 --> 00:50:03,572
No, I'm so I'm not.

1075
00:50:04,152 --> 00:50:06,672
I'm knocking him down one star. Yeah.

1076
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:11,352
The story with Nixon and the original Disneyland

1077
00:50:11,632 --> 00:50:15,512
monorail is interesting to me because it's the day that Nixon rides it

1078
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:19,952
is the day after the first successful test happens, supposedly.

1079
00:50:20,592 --> 00:50:22,372
Wow. Of the monorail in general.

1080
00:50:22,912 --> 00:50:24,132
Yeah, they had like a lot.

1081
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:25,292
I believe I have this right.

1082
00:50:25,432 --> 00:50:29,252
They had many tests leading up to that.

1083
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:30,732
You know, things would fall off.

1084
00:50:30,752 --> 00:50:31,912
Things would catch fire.

1085
00:50:32,552 --> 00:50:33,692
Things would not make it around.

1086
00:50:33,752 --> 00:50:37,332
And I believe the day before Nixon gets on is the first day

1087
00:50:37,332 --> 00:50:41,072
that the thing makes it like it's on its path. Whoa.

1088
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:46,652
That's amazing to change, to change, like to show you how much stuff has changed.

1089
00:50:46,792 --> 00:50:50,512
Obviously, now there's you have to test something 10,000 times.

1090
00:50:50,772 --> 00:50:54,652
Something creates I don't know the number, but like before they put a human being on it.

1091
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:58,812
Now think about a day before is the first time this thing's actually worked

1092
00:50:58,812 --> 00:51:00,032
and not caught fire.

1093
00:51:00,152 --> 00:51:01,772
And you're putting the vice president.

1094
00:51:01,932 --> 00:51:04,312
Vice president is family and the head of your company.

1095
00:51:04,492 --> 00:51:05,832
All on this thing.

1096
00:51:06,252 --> 00:51:07,432
Not the Secret Service.

1097
00:51:07,892 --> 00:51:09,092
Wow. Crazy.

1098
00:51:09,092 --> 00:51:11,092
If some premonition of things to come.

1099
00:51:11,092 --> 00:51:14,452
Disney early adopters at shit falling off monorails.

1100
00:51:14,792 --> 00:51:17,952
Yes. It's been part of the monorail story from the beginning.

1101
00:51:17,972 --> 00:51:20,692
It's a rich tradition of shit falling off of the monorail.

1102
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:24,352
If there's been some weird like electrical fuck up and like a flame

1103
00:51:24,352 --> 00:51:27,912
hit Nixon straight in the face right before they got back.

1104
00:51:28,052 --> 00:51:31,812
And then the doors open and like a ghost rider flaming head,

1105
00:51:31,832 --> 00:51:34,312
Nixon starts wandering around the station.

1106
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:37,372
That's great. Oh, kill me.

1107
00:51:39,312 --> 00:51:41,092
Or like this feels right.

1108
00:51:41,092 --> 00:51:42,092
I like this.

1109
00:51:42,092 --> 00:51:45,552
You cannot kill that which has always been dead.

1110
00:51:46,172 --> 00:51:48,972
I'm more powerful than you could possibly imagine.

1111
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:51,112
He stays ignited.

1112
00:51:51,512 --> 00:51:52,772
Everything else still happens.

1113
00:51:52,972 --> 00:51:55,672
He becomes president in the 60s, but he's got a flame head.

1114
00:51:55,892 --> 00:51:58,472
Yeah, I don't think he resigns if he's got a flame head.

1115
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,332
I think everything goes much better.

1116
00:52:00,432 --> 00:52:02,332
And he does he does his full eight years.

1117
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,992
He does the Frost Nixon interview and he's just like,

1118
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:06,872
how'd you get that cool flame head?

1119
00:52:07,112 --> 00:52:08,052
The notable.

1120
00:52:08,232 --> 00:52:09,932
Yeah, I'm the spirit of vengeance.

1121
00:52:09,932 --> 00:52:14,772
Yeah, the ghost riders, Danny Catch, Johnny Blaze, Richard Nixon.

1122
00:52:14,772 --> 00:52:18,112
Oh, I wish.

1123
00:52:18,132 --> 00:52:19,832
Bob Gurr fucked up.

1124
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:21,932
He didn't cause that flame head to happen.

1125
00:52:22,312 --> 00:52:25,092
I mean, what could have been someone draw that?

1126
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:31,772
The so another from the that opening footage that we're talking about.

1127
00:52:31,992 --> 00:52:36,352
Art Linklater's commentary, he name checks a couple of it's like

1128
00:52:36,352 --> 00:52:39,812
there's lots of luminaries here, specifically Fred McMurray

1129
00:52:39,812 --> 00:52:43,292
was also on that car that from my three sons.

1130
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:45,432
Not always you said the nutty professor, the nutty professor.

1131
00:52:45,612 --> 00:52:46,652
I know he was. Yeah.

1132
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:48,012
Oh, the absent. OK. Yes.

1133
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:51,812
And then Art Linklater, the reason I figured it out, it was Art Linklater.

1134
00:52:51,852 --> 00:52:53,632
He's like, there's my family, Mrs.

1135
00:52:53,772 --> 00:53:00,032
Linklater and my family, including he literally says, including my big son, Robert.

1136
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:07,332
Like I just got so delighted at imagining Art Linklater's large boy,

1137
00:53:07,472 --> 00:53:12,372
his large son Robert, but that's a daddy's little thing.

1138
00:53:12,372 --> 00:53:13,492
My big son.

1139
00:53:13,772 --> 00:53:14,512
Are they in the video?

1140
00:53:14,512 --> 00:53:16,212
I can't remember because I watched a little while.

1141
00:53:16,312 --> 00:53:17,792
Are they is his last name Linklater?

1142
00:53:17,992 --> 00:53:19,652
Isn't this last name Linklater?

1143
00:53:19,752 --> 00:53:23,672
Or do they call it because Richard Linklater is the director?

1144
00:53:24,072 --> 00:53:25,212
I just can't remember.

1145
00:53:25,612 --> 00:53:27,692
But I believe they're spelled the same way.

1146
00:53:27,992 --> 00:53:31,472
Letter, letter, link letter is spelled with Ali TTER.

1147
00:53:31,772 --> 00:53:33,672
So it's letter. So it is link letter.

1148
00:53:33,912 --> 00:53:34,872
Art Linklater.

1149
00:53:35,232 --> 00:53:36,532
Linklater is a director.

1150
00:53:36,552 --> 00:53:39,932
You think of Richard? Yeah. OK. OK. Yeah.

1151
00:53:40,772 --> 00:53:41,652
Great. Clarified.

1152
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:46,952
For any future references to well, when we cover the opening day special

1153
00:53:46,952 --> 00:53:52,352
in, you know, minute by minute for 10 weeks in a row.

1154
00:53:53,552 --> 00:53:56,072
Are we going to get out of Disneyland even in this episode?

1155
00:53:56,072 --> 00:53:56,992
With the monorail?

1156
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,392
I suggest it. Let's gun it. Let's do it.

1157
00:53:59,412 --> 00:54:02,872
The monorail is one of the fastest rides anywhere.

1158
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:06,232
You know, that's a fact that I I remember hearing in one of these.

1159
00:54:06,472 --> 00:54:09,712
I think it was the show Disney World Inside Out, the weekly

1160
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:13,972
Disney World commercial that I watched as a child and was my favorite show

1161
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:15,252
on the Disney Channel.

1162
00:54:15,812 --> 00:54:20,192
Just this is why I was like I'm a I'm a walking example of brainwashing.

1163
00:54:20,272 --> 00:54:22,132
They showed me ads every single week.

1164
00:54:22,152 --> 00:54:23,252
And now I'm like this.

1165
00:54:23,252 --> 00:54:24,592
Now I talk about them.

1166
00:54:24,592 --> 00:54:28,612
I do free promotion for Disney every single week.

1167
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:34,012
But I do remember that they did like a little like before the break,

1168
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:36,832
like what is the fastest ride in Disney World?

1169
00:54:36,832 --> 00:54:40,092
And they're like, you know, tipping it by showing you quick clips of Big Thunder

1170
00:54:40,092 --> 00:54:40,872
and Space Mountain.

1171
00:54:40,892 --> 00:54:42,532
And you're like, oh, for sure, it's Space Mountain.

1172
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,352
But in fact, it's the monorail

1173
00:54:44,352 --> 00:54:47,472
because it is a real piece of trance.

1174
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:50,712
But even then, the monorail only goes like 35, 35.

1175
00:54:51,172 --> 00:54:51,892
Yeah. Yeah.

1176
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:54,112
I don't think that must not be true anymore.

1177
00:54:54,112 --> 00:54:56,452
What would my dreaded launches?

1178
00:54:57,072 --> 00:54:58,652
Oh, yeah. Rock and roller coaster has to go fast.

1179
00:54:58,732 --> 00:54:59,732
That's got to. Yeah. Yeah.

1180
00:54:59,832 --> 00:55:00,572
You would you would think.

1181
00:55:00,732 --> 00:55:02,112
Though I've been doing it, man.

1182
00:55:02,252 --> 00:55:04,992
I've I've now I'm into in credit coaster.

1183
00:55:04,992 --> 00:55:06,012
It's all happening.

1184
00:55:06,192 --> 00:55:09,732
But I got to go to Disney World to actually because there's a lot more launches

1185
00:55:09,732 --> 00:55:12,292
down there. So that'll be my proving ground.

1186
00:55:12,332 --> 00:55:15,612
Well, and there's some very interesting innovations coming down the pipeline

1187
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,372
that may be testing you.

1188
00:55:17,392 --> 00:55:20,192
But we'll get to that on a different episode.

1189
00:55:20,372 --> 00:55:21,412
Oh, yes. Yes.

1190
00:55:22,512 --> 00:55:26,012
So another notable thing about the the monorail in Disneyland,

1191
00:55:26,332 --> 00:55:32,352
the monorail Matterhorn and submarines, the original e-tickets,

1192
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:34,012
the original e-ticket attraction.

1193
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,532
Interesting. Yeah.

1194
00:55:35,612 --> 00:55:38,472
The books literally only went up through D.

1195
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,132
There was no e-ticket.

1196
00:55:40,872 --> 00:55:44,112
So and that they all opened on the same day on the same day.

1197
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:47,592
And imagine Disneyland without all of those things is like,

1198
00:55:47,592 --> 00:55:49,372
imagine there's nothing in any of that.

1199
00:55:49,372 --> 00:55:50,472
It's just like fields.

1200
00:55:50,592 --> 00:55:51,892
It's like daisies or something.

1201
00:55:52,232 --> 00:55:55,912
And then suddenly on the same day, Matterhorn, submarines, Monorail

1202
00:55:55,912 --> 00:55:59,192
and not just those, not just the subs, Matterhorn and Monorail,

1203
00:55:59,772 --> 00:56:02,252
expanded Autopia and a motorboat cruise.

1204
00:56:02,452 --> 00:56:05,052
So five attractions opened in one day.

1205
00:56:05,072 --> 00:56:08,772
Geez. Essentially the equivalent of like more than Cars Land.

1206
00:56:09,052 --> 00:56:10,872
Like opens in one day.

1207
00:56:10,892 --> 00:56:14,512
That's like probably the most like important expansion of.

1208
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:17,792
Yeah, for sure. In a way, because that it also gets you your first

1209
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:21,452
steel rollercoaster, the first rollercoaster in general and

1210
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:22,512
and the first fake rocks.

1211
00:56:22,872 --> 00:56:25,332
Yeah. So this this is a mega event, for sure.

1212
00:56:25,432 --> 00:56:29,012
Well, even going out further,

1213
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:34,652
the first expansion that Disneyland can expand and change.

1214
00:56:34,872 --> 00:56:39,672
And also that it's doing financially well enough to be capable of doing this.

1215
00:56:39,752 --> 00:56:42,712
Good point, because in that first year, yeah, they can't think about

1216
00:56:42,712 --> 00:56:44,792
they're just trying to think about staying afloat.

1217
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:46,612
Yeah. They do like, oh, we're here.

1218
00:56:46,832 --> 00:56:48,492
We're we're doing fine.

1219
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:51,632
And we can even add big, expensive, experimental,

1220
00:56:52,092 --> 00:56:55,252
potentially vice president murdering technology.

1221
00:56:56,752 --> 00:56:59,792
So the second we hear, we'll keep moving to Disney.

1222
00:56:59,832 --> 00:57:01,952
I think we're going to get I feel good about it.

1223
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:06,412
But the so the the first big expansion in the Mark two

1224
00:57:06,412 --> 00:57:09,752
was where it starts going to the Disneyland Hotel.

1225
00:57:10,032 --> 00:57:11,932
They expanded out now it's two point five miles.

1226
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:16,472
And when they do that, it becomes the first monorail to cross a public street.

1227
00:57:17,092 --> 00:57:20,092
Excitement. There's so many firsts in this episode.

1228
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:23,812
Also acting as an actual form of transportation,

1229
00:57:23,812 --> 00:57:27,392
taking you from one location to another location. Yes.

1230
00:57:28,552 --> 00:57:33,712
Now, how often do you guys use the monorail to get in and out very often?

1231
00:57:33,832 --> 00:57:37,852
What's your what's your relationship to the monorail in a functional capacity?

1232
00:57:38,232 --> 00:57:40,292
At Disney? Yeah, Disneyland specifically.

1233
00:57:40,892 --> 00:57:43,952
I feel like I go and I go in phases, monorail phases.

1234
00:57:44,052 --> 00:57:45,892
I feel like I'll use the entrance

1235
00:57:45,892 --> 00:57:49,892
like a couple of times in a few months, and I don't think I've used it

1236
00:57:49,892 --> 00:57:50,952
in about a year and a half.

1237
00:57:51,332 --> 00:57:52,572
I would agree.

1238
00:57:53,872 --> 00:57:55,452
I wish I wish you could do.

1239
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,932
I mean, you used to be able to just buy a ticket and do a round trip

1240
00:57:58,932 --> 00:58:00,392
and not even step foot in the parks.

1241
00:58:00,472 --> 00:58:01,972
I wish you could do that.

1242
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,012
You cannot do that anymore.

1243
00:58:04,032 --> 00:58:06,232
You could just get on the monorail and not go to Disney.

1244
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:10,072
Go down to Anaheim and buy a ticket and just not see it.

1245
00:58:10,092 --> 00:58:11,872
Don't do any rides. Well,

1246
00:58:12,332 --> 00:58:17,292
no, I wish you could just take a Grand Circle tour like you can on the train.

1247
00:58:17,732 --> 00:58:19,032
Let's not buying the ticket.

1248
00:58:19,612 --> 00:58:21,732
But you're saying you would do that, though?

1249
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,832
I would do a round trip on the monorail, leave Tomorrowland,

1250
00:58:24,872 --> 00:58:26,452
come back to Tomorrowland. Yeah.

1251
00:58:26,812 --> 00:58:29,912
You mean you can't do that anymore? You can't do that anymore. OK.

1252
00:58:30,312 --> 00:58:33,252
I feel like I mostly get out when you get to the other side.

1253
00:58:33,352 --> 00:58:35,692
Yes, you have to get out either way.

1254
00:58:36,032 --> 00:58:37,432
I can just go around, right?

1255
00:58:37,812 --> 00:58:40,172
Or no, you can't load it all in Tomorrowland. Is that right?

1256
00:58:40,192 --> 00:58:42,372
What's that? You can get on.

1257
00:58:43,352 --> 00:58:44,452
What's confusing everyone?

1258
00:58:44,552 --> 00:58:48,372
I just want to take the monorail from Tomorrowland, downtown Disney,

1259
00:58:48,752 --> 00:58:51,632
stay on the monorail, go back to you. You have to get off.

1260
00:58:51,752 --> 00:58:53,652
Well, first, here's where the confusion first starts,

1261
00:58:53,692 --> 00:58:57,252
is you were saying you wish they still sold a ticket to let you do that.

1262
00:58:57,272 --> 00:59:00,612
So it seemed like you were lamenting the fact that you wish you could just go

1263
00:59:00,612 --> 00:59:05,652
down and buy a ticket and have a seven minute, 12 minute monorail ride.

1264
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:07,372
I'd probably not go to Disneyland.

1265
00:59:07,512 --> 00:59:09,232
That's what I was communicated to both.

1266
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,532
Which seems possible when you said it, we were laughing about it,

1267
00:59:12,532 --> 00:59:13,832
but it also seemed like that's funny.

1268
00:59:13,872 --> 00:59:15,692
But that is a little extreme. OK.

1269
00:59:15,692 --> 00:59:16,692
You we could see you doing that.

1270
00:59:16,692 --> 00:59:18,852
I could see. Yeah, I could also see me doing that.

1271
00:59:18,852 --> 00:59:25,392
To answer your original question, I feel like I mostly use it to get into the parks.

1272
00:59:25,672 --> 00:59:27,872
If I left the park, like in the afternoon,

1273
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:31,092
like it's less crowded than going down Main Street.

1274
00:59:31,092 --> 00:59:34,332
Or if at the I was there like later in the evening

1275
00:59:34,332 --> 00:59:38,572
and I want to just get the fuck out of like I just want to get out of there.

1276
00:59:38,572 --> 00:59:44,432
If you're leaving from Tomorrowland and you don't and there's like fireworks

1277
00:59:44,432 --> 00:59:49,232
or a parade going on, the only I walk through Main Street to get to the trams.

1278
00:59:49,232 --> 00:59:52,032
Then it can be kind of great, kind of a lifesaver. Yeah.

1279
00:59:52,232 --> 00:59:54,832
But, you know, it can it can be a bummer.

1280
00:59:54,972 --> 00:59:57,812
Get it like to get into the park via the monorail.

1281
00:59:58,232 --> 01:00:01,312
Good news. You can like walk through that turnstile there.

1282
01:00:01,312 --> 01:00:03,832
That is you're technically in satellite Disneyland.

1283
01:00:04,172 --> 01:00:06,772
And as I just learned, you can start getting Max passes.

1284
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:10,392
If you have Max pass that monorail entrance counts.

1285
01:00:10,412 --> 01:00:13,292
So you can be not even in the park and start reserving stuff.

1286
01:00:13,452 --> 01:00:19,392
However, that pathway in is so many weird loops around the Autopia

1287
01:00:19,392 --> 01:00:20,772
and the Matterhorn and all that.

1288
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:24,312
And it could take many, many cars before you can even get on the thing.

1289
01:00:24,552 --> 01:00:26,952
So it's maybe not always the best way to get into Disneyland.

1290
01:00:27,512 --> 01:00:31,332
You could. This is maybe I was this is the most proud I've ever been of Scott

1291
01:00:31,332 --> 01:00:36,272
as he texted and he let us know because I didn't even think about this idea hack wise.

1292
01:00:36,492 --> 01:00:40,192
That you could start getting Max passes, not by going into the two main entrances

1293
01:00:40,192 --> 01:00:41,112
of the Disney parks.

1294
01:00:41,192 --> 01:00:45,632
You can go in the monorail, which then you could also just go through,

1295
01:00:45,752 --> 01:00:49,032
go back out, go over Trader Sam's and have a couple of drinks

1296
01:00:49,032 --> 01:00:51,832
and just get rack Max passes up the whole time.

1297
01:00:51,912 --> 01:00:53,712
This is this is the hack.

1298
01:00:53,932 --> 01:00:57,472
And I'm finally like I'm finally playing the hack game.

1299
01:00:57,472 --> 01:00:58,492
Welcome to the hat culture.

1300
01:00:58,852 --> 01:01:02,352
It's I'm Julian Assange now.

1301
01:01:03,472 --> 01:01:04,512
You want you go.

1302
01:01:04,872 --> 01:01:06,172
All right. Easy, easy on that.

1303
01:01:06,692 --> 01:01:07,952
No, I want to be him.

1304
01:01:07,972 --> 01:01:09,172
That sounds cool.

1305
01:01:09,172 --> 01:01:11,432
You you.

1306
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:15,132
Does that make me like I'm the Assange of theme park hacks?

1307
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:16,732
All right. Good.

1308
01:01:16,732 --> 01:01:18,612
I'm happy with that.

1309
01:01:19,152 --> 01:01:24,092
Well, the other day you were you were checking on our friend Andrew's.

1310
01:01:24,092 --> 01:01:28,272
Oh, yeah. Passes from here, from your apartment, from San Diego, from San Diego.

1311
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:29,152
I was in San Diego.

1312
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:29,912
They're away.

1313
01:01:29,972 --> 01:01:34,052
You're on your app going, I see you're getting on in credit coaster in 12 minutes.

1314
01:01:34,052 --> 01:01:37,572
So what happened was, yeah, this this literally perfectly timed

1315
01:01:37,572 --> 01:01:41,912
because Jason had texted me and he asked me for a photo, which was in my app

1316
01:01:41,912 --> 01:01:43,472
because it was a photo pass.

1317
01:01:43,752 --> 01:01:45,912
So I had gone in the app and I this always happens.

1318
01:01:45,992 --> 01:01:49,892
I forget about this is that if you're linked ticket, what ticket wise to a friend

1319
01:01:49,892 --> 01:01:52,952
or another annual pass, all their stuff will show up.

1320
01:01:52,972 --> 01:01:55,192
So if you say you were with a couple of friends

1321
01:01:55,192 --> 01:01:58,172
and you all have it linked so you can get Max passes at the same time,

1322
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:02,472
you're linked for a year for them or forever unless you break

1323
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:04,752
the annual pass cycle, I think.

1324
01:02:05,172 --> 01:02:09,812
So I went into the app right before he was texting like a photo or two from Disney.

1325
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:12,272
And I was trying to get the phone and went, what the hell?

1326
01:02:12,432 --> 01:02:14,452
I have a fast pass. Oh, wait a minute.

1327
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:17,152
He must be at the park. Andrew was at the park.

1328
01:02:17,412 --> 01:02:22,272
So when he texted, I immediately was like, ha, enjoy your ride on whatever.

1329
01:02:22,752 --> 01:02:26,052
And then Scott thought that was creepy, which I acknowledge it is.

1330
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:27,752
But I had just seen it.

1331
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:28,892
So then he asked.

1332
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,312
He wanted an in credit coaster.

1333
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:33,652
But they didn't have the Max pass. They didn't have one.

1334
01:02:33,772 --> 01:02:34,932
I go, I'm on it.

1335
01:02:35,312 --> 01:02:38,872
So in the app, I was able to get him an in credit

1336
01:02:38,872 --> 01:02:43,592
coaster fast pass Max pass from San Diego remotely, essentially.

1337
01:02:43,772 --> 01:02:46,672
Even though you were not your ticket was not right.

1338
01:02:46,792 --> 01:02:47,712
But his was activated.

1339
01:02:47,732 --> 01:02:50,792
So I could have gotten him Max passes all day.

1340
01:02:50,832 --> 01:02:53,872
He was leaving, unfortunately, and I could not do that.

1341
01:02:53,932 --> 01:02:58,412
But I got I got the thrill from remotely in San Diego.

1342
01:02:58,412 --> 01:03:01,512
Yeah, he's a very kind man who likes to help his friends out.

1343
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:05,892
And I felt like that was like a dad, like letting his kid show,

1344
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:09,292
like his like diving trick over and over like, watch me, dad.

1345
01:03:09,332 --> 01:03:12,052
Watch what I can do. Very good. OK.

1346
01:03:12,552 --> 01:03:16,032
I he was humoring me, but then he enjoyed it.

1347
01:03:16,112 --> 01:03:17,732
And you got him on the coaster.

1348
01:03:18,072 --> 01:03:19,232
I think it's a flex.

1349
01:03:19,892 --> 01:03:21,132
The kids call that flex.

1350
01:03:21,612 --> 01:03:25,912
What does that mean? More cool terms like your pose, like you're like,

1351
01:03:25,912 --> 01:03:28,152
oh, me getting Max pass. Yeah, well, that's true.

1352
01:03:28,152 --> 01:03:29,792
I'm sure that's part of it for me.

1353
01:03:29,812 --> 01:03:31,512
I think we've got an ultimate

1354
01:03:31,512 --> 01:03:34,692
Patreon tier, which maybe we can call the flex tier.

1355
01:03:34,692 --> 01:03:37,812
I don't want to put a price on it, but I think it's premium.

1356
01:03:37,812 --> 01:03:39,572
I think this is like a fifty dollars a month.

1357
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:42,832
But for this and you to kick it off, you would have to go

1358
01:03:42,832 --> 01:03:46,452
to Disneyland with Mike and then get linked with him forever.

1359
01:03:46,472 --> 01:03:50,872
And then Mike from that here on out will program your day

1360
01:03:50,872 --> 01:03:53,092
of Max passes from his apartment.

1361
01:03:53,152 --> 01:03:57,832
They can send me a picture of the ticket and I can I can just link it remotely.

1362
01:03:58,232 --> 01:04:03,312
So then we're opening up potentially a world of pain or pure pleasure for you.

1363
01:04:03,312 --> 01:04:07,732
Yeah. To be able to program our fans days at.

1364
01:04:08,112 --> 01:04:10,212
I feel like you will is the perverse.

1365
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:11,512
I like the idea of it.

1366
01:04:11,712 --> 01:04:14,932
I do like the word that you mean to say is compulsions.

1367
01:04:14,932 --> 01:04:16,492
I think you're opening up a world of.

1368
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:21,472
Yeah, I think you are simultaneously giving Mike a curse with this idea.

1369
01:04:21,532 --> 01:04:27,272
But also he will feel the compulsion to he's like, well, I can.

1370
01:04:28,112 --> 01:04:30,052
I I have the ability to check.

1371
01:04:30,192 --> 01:04:31,012
I guess I should.

1372
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:32,392
You can check it.

1373
01:04:32,612 --> 01:04:36,932
Imagine the honor for the listeners of the show for you to do checking for them.

1374
01:04:37,132 --> 01:04:37,732
For them. Yeah.

1375
01:04:37,892 --> 01:04:39,812
And this is we've talked.

1376
01:04:40,072 --> 01:04:41,712
We've already brought Len up a few times.

1377
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:45,772
This is an idea, actually. Len had is that there would be a service

1378
01:04:45,772 --> 01:04:50,072
that you would pay somebody to remotely check for you all day

1379
01:04:50,072 --> 01:04:51,112
while you were at the park.

1380
01:04:51,412 --> 01:04:55,312
So we're we're now just we're just dipping our toe in the water.

1381
01:04:55,312 --> 01:04:58,412
And the idea of me checking for people you did offer,

1382
01:04:58,412 --> 01:05:01,292
because my mom and stepdad are currently in Orlando.

1383
01:05:01,472 --> 01:05:05,272
They'll be gone by the time this airs, so no one can murder them.

1384
01:05:05,272 --> 01:05:10,572
But no one can try and track down my family and murder them.

1385
01:05:10,872 --> 01:05:12,812
What do you think of our fans?

1386
01:05:13,032 --> 01:05:14,692
Somebody's going to try to kill your parents.

1387
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:16,652
No, it's just like,

1388
01:05:17,272 --> 01:05:19,572
uh, I don't know.

1389
01:05:19,852 --> 01:05:22,012
I don't know that they were OK.

1390
01:05:22,492 --> 01:05:22,872
Holy shit.

1391
01:05:23,412 --> 01:05:25,432
I thought it was a funny line.

1392
01:05:26,412 --> 01:05:26,792
It is.

1393
01:05:26,992 --> 01:05:29,972
World of averages, there's a murder somewhere in our audience space.

1394
01:05:30,412 --> 01:05:32,412
Oh, yeah, sure. That's, you know, who you are.

1395
01:05:32,452 --> 01:05:34,472
Thanks for listening. But don't murder anybody.

1396
01:05:34,512 --> 01:05:36,772
Please don't murder. Stop it. Stop it.

1397
01:05:37,772 --> 01:05:42,052
You you did offer like, well, if they want to give me their Disney IDs,

1398
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:44,812
I could book some of their magic.

1399
01:05:45,432 --> 01:05:47,452
Yeah, I would absolutely do that.

1400
01:05:47,452 --> 01:05:50,472
And the thing was, I was like, oh, we might have to do it

1401
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:53,452
because my mom is not the most tech savvy.

1402
01:05:54,092 --> 01:05:57,792
But honestly, she she has not been in a long time.

1403
01:05:58,032 --> 01:06:01,532
And she got right back into it like she jumped right on.

1404
01:06:01,872 --> 01:06:04,972
She Scott, the thing she's like, well, we've been here two days.

1405
01:06:05,012 --> 01:06:07,152
Here's what we've done. It would have made your head spin.

1406
01:06:07,292 --> 01:06:10,412
Like the number of things that these a couple of 60 year olds

1407
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:12,052
like knocked out in two days.

1408
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:16,532
Although after three days, she's like, my legs are starting to hurt a little.

1409
01:06:16,652 --> 01:06:18,692
And I'm like, well, yeah, you're

1410
01:06:18,692 --> 01:06:20,692
none of us are as young as we used to be.

1411
01:06:21,832 --> 01:06:24,992
And also, but also we're getting up there, dear mother.

1412
01:06:25,032 --> 01:06:26,552
You and your mother are the same age.

1413
01:06:26,552 --> 01:06:28,352
You forgot to mention somehow.

1414
01:06:28,772 --> 01:06:31,732
Rare mother, son born on the same day.

1415
01:06:31,912 --> 01:06:37,152
But also, if you just keep doing it, you work through the pain.

1416
01:06:37,932 --> 01:06:39,792
This baby is having a baby.

1417
01:06:41,432 --> 01:06:47,232
And one of them speaking immediately, oh, my, I'm alive.

1418
01:06:51,032 --> 01:06:54,052
Hey, I have a more dulcet tone than that.

1419
01:06:55,672 --> 01:06:59,592
I can't speak to the accuracy of that.

1420
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:01,012
OK, that's fine.

1421
01:07:01,732 --> 01:07:03,132
Yeah, so we're way off tomorrow.

1422
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:04,652
This is the monorail.

1423
01:07:04,732 --> 01:07:07,012
Yeah, I feel like I'm like Max.

1424
01:07:07,332 --> 01:07:11,252
Yeah, but I think we you as the Assange of this, I think this is

1425
01:07:11,252 --> 01:07:14,492
you'll be the head of Disney leaks.

1426
01:07:14,512 --> 01:07:16,512
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1427
01:07:17,232 --> 01:07:18,872
And you'll program people's.

1428
01:07:19,052 --> 01:07:19,892
So you set the price.

1429
01:07:19,892 --> 01:07:21,052
Maybe this is really premium.

1430
01:07:21,092 --> 01:07:22,752
Maybe this costs three hundred dollars.

1431
01:07:22,812 --> 01:07:26,012
This might be highly to paying Disney the ten dollar max.

1432
01:07:26,172 --> 01:07:30,472
Because if I do what I want to do it right, if the price is sort of low,

1433
01:07:30,652 --> 01:07:34,212
I'm not saying I'm not going to do it, but I would like to give you the full

1434
01:07:34,212 --> 01:07:36,412
premium checking experience.

1435
01:07:36,412 --> 01:07:39,512
And that would take a lot of my time in a day.

1436
01:07:39,572 --> 01:07:40,912
Maybe it's check leaks.

1437
01:07:41,072 --> 01:07:43,072
I think that's the phrase is good.

1438
01:07:43,072 --> 01:07:46,672
The three hundred dollar tier, you get access to the checky leaks network.

1439
01:07:46,952 --> 01:07:48,972
Uh huh. So I'm going to have to

1440
01:07:48,972 --> 01:07:51,332
we'll have to be on like a discord.

1441
01:07:51,452 --> 01:07:54,032
Oh, no, we're giving like another distraction.

1442
01:07:54,732 --> 01:07:58,492
A discord channel where I'll have to be conferencing in

1443
01:07:58,492 --> 01:08:01,192
and sort of seeing what people want, where they're at.

1444
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:03,912
And there will be just to be clear about the terms.

1445
01:08:04,152 --> 01:08:07,312
There is no there's no there's no tier of this podcast

1446
01:08:07,312 --> 01:08:09,752
that would have less Scott Gardner involvement.

1447
01:08:09,892 --> 01:08:15,032
Yes, I would I would ghost any responsibility for checky leaks. Right.

1448
01:08:15,032 --> 01:08:17,352
Is that less?

1449
01:08:17,572 --> 01:08:18,512
Is that possible?

1450
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:23,932
Oh, we're going to roast you.

1451
01:08:25,612 --> 01:08:27,012
We're going to roast it today.

1452
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:32,652
I think we were really just informational for so much of the show.

1453
01:08:32,912 --> 01:08:34,292
And we're going to be hard to get back.

1454
01:08:34,292 --> 01:08:36,232
We just end it sooner than later.

1455
01:08:36,732 --> 01:08:38,552
We'll do the monorail again in four months.

1456
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:39,852
Yeah, too much.

1457
01:08:40,472 --> 01:08:43,752
I specifically when we said all monorails for this episode,

1458
01:08:44,092 --> 01:08:48,452
I tried not because I do it's become a compulsion of mine to go like,

1459
01:08:48,632 --> 01:08:50,212
well, how many episodes could that be?

1460
01:08:50,352 --> 01:08:51,572
Like, could we just do the Disney?

1461
01:08:51,632 --> 01:08:52,792
Could we just do the Disney World?

1462
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:56,692
And I'm realizing it's like, oh, I'm a topic uniter.

1463
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:58,452
You're yes, that's true.

1464
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:01,412
But then I'm like, oh, I'll be topics that will come up.

1465
01:09:01,452 --> 01:09:02,812
And you'll be like, we should do one on this.

1466
01:09:02,832 --> 01:09:04,832
And I'm like, but this is tiny.

1467
01:09:05,232 --> 01:09:07,852
So there's certain tiny ones you like. That's true.

1468
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:08,812
I can be. Yeah.

1469
01:09:08,872 --> 01:09:10,192
You go back and forth on tiny topics.

1470
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,932
I can be slanted in my amount of fractional.

1471
01:09:13,152 --> 01:09:14,652
This is true. We're all I think.

1472
01:09:15,272 --> 01:09:19,532
Yeah, I don't deny that my opinions factor into it.

1473
01:09:19,752 --> 01:09:23,312
And that, yeah, if say doing three parts on Duffy came up,

1474
01:09:23,572 --> 01:09:24,832
I would probably say no.

1475
01:09:25,072 --> 01:09:27,312
But there was one we're talking about doing really.

1476
01:09:27,412 --> 01:09:28,432
I think this could be a full episode.

1477
01:09:28,572 --> 01:09:34,092
And I was like, but wait, you were mad yesterday about doing multiples on

1478
01:09:34,092 --> 01:09:35,472
I know all the pens.

1479
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:38,712
I can't deny I can't deny hypocrisy.

1480
01:09:38,712 --> 01:09:40,772
It all depends. I can't.

1481
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:43,892
So OK, so Michael, credit where it's due.

1482
01:09:44,352 --> 01:09:46,812
We all have insane compulsions.

1483
01:09:46,812 --> 01:09:49,132
It's not just we're all insane.

1484
01:09:49,132 --> 01:09:49,712
Oh, I'm fine.

1485
01:09:49,972 --> 01:09:52,972
Honestly, goofing on me about checking. I love it.

1486
01:09:53,252 --> 01:09:55,272
There's certainly topics where I don't like being goofed.

1487
01:09:55,432 --> 01:09:58,492
But talking about how good I am at finding Max passes,

1488
01:09:58,552 --> 01:10:00,372
you're just getting me going, baby.

1489
01:10:00,652 --> 01:10:03,252
Also, we've all benefited from your checking.

1490
01:10:03,252 --> 01:10:05,372
Of course you have. This is true.

1491
01:10:05,572 --> 01:10:09,412
My checking has brought nothing but joy to everyone around me.

1492
01:10:09,732 --> 01:10:10,912
Well, it's nothing.

1493
01:10:11,132 --> 01:10:12,512
I would double check that with Luthor.

1494
01:10:12,532 --> 01:10:16,892
But I'll call her down here and make her say it into the microphone.

1495
01:10:17,072 --> 01:10:19,492
Honey, nothing. But this is good.

1496
01:10:19,752 --> 01:10:21,412
Tell them how much you like my checking.

1497
01:10:21,752 --> 01:10:26,492
There's two. We we may be going on Tuesday with a friend of ours.

1498
01:10:26,492 --> 01:10:28,832
Yes. And I think it'll be a full day.

1499
01:10:29,172 --> 01:10:33,772
And I am getting ready because what I'm finding is that I'm not invited to this day.

1500
01:10:33,772 --> 01:10:36,992
Jason says yes. And I've never heard of this.

1501
01:10:37,412 --> 01:10:39,632
Oh, yeah. Well, we just talked about it the other day.

1502
01:10:39,852 --> 01:10:43,712
Oh, yeah. Well, well, well, it really is all coming out.

1503
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:47,512
You texted us from Universal the other day with with Bugsie.

1504
01:10:47,712 --> 01:10:50,392
Bugsie. Yeah, that's what actually you made an accident.

1505
01:10:50,552 --> 01:10:55,332
I didn't we we were we were in the area and I didn't realize he had a pass.

1506
01:10:55,932 --> 01:10:58,612
What that was not a concerted visit. All right. Fine.

1507
01:10:58,872 --> 01:11:00,592
We don't all have to go together.

1508
01:11:01,332 --> 01:11:05,392
That's true. Yeah, you guys go on Saturday all the time and I am

1509
01:11:05,392 --> 01:11:06,532
you're left in the lurch.

1510
01:11:06,732 --> 01:11:09,632
Dishing out money for that Saturday, although I probably will

1511
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:12,072
have to take out a bank loan with Star Wars.

1512
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:14,032
So it's just to get any pass.

1513
01:11:14,412 --> 01:11:16,752
Well, we're going to have to pay like the giant ticket fee

1514
01:11:16,752 --> 01:11:19,272
to get for the one like the party.

1515
01:11:19,772 --> 01:11:20,552
That's the problem.

1516
01:11:20,612 --> 01:11:24,212
They should offer a they should they should offer like a Star Wars bank

1517
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:26,352
to bankroll people who think they can't afford it.

1518
01:11:26,352 --> 01:11:29,592
And when like the guy comes out to negotiate the loan, he should be like

1519
01:11:29,772 --> 01:11:31,452
like a big weird swell.

1520
01:11:31,452 --> 01:11:34,432
Let's see how badly do you want to get it?

1521
01:11:34,432 --> 01:11:36,052
It's on car plot. It's on.

1522
01:11:36,352 --> 01:11:39,912
Oh, yeah. So you'll you'll like sign a lease

1523
01:11:39,912 --> 01:11:43,132
that he doesn't give you much time to read on car plot.

1524
01:11:43,312 --> 01:11:44,892
Makes it very good.

1525
01:11:45,412 --> 01:11:46,572
Come on in and enjoy.

1526
01:11:46,672 --> 01:11:50,452
And then you you're like in the tank to owe him like twenty thousand dollars.

1527
01:11:50,652 --> 01:11:54,332
It's like Scientology basically, where they just make you indebted to them.

1528
01:11:54,332 --> 01:11:56,932
You have to work at Star Wars land for the rest of your life.

1529
01:11:56,932 --> 01:12:01,412
Funny enough, on car plot, the Bob Hope of the Doughboy show comes up

1530
01:12:01,412 --> 01:12:05,572
on car plot because we're really really consider him the Bob Hope

1531
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:10,412
in terms of how many appearances on car plot has made on the show.

1532
01:12:10,412 --> 01:12:14,192
That's a really easy,

1533
01:12:14,932 --> 01:12:17,332
teasy sort of episode.

1534
01:12:17,472 --> 01:12:19,432
Yeah, well, it really rolled.

1535
01:12:19,532 --> 01:12:20,312
We got away.

1536
01:12:20,352 --> 01:12:23,452
Not the last Bob Hope mentioned on this episode.

1537
01:12:23,812 --> 01:12:24,692
OK. Oh, yeah.

1538
01:12:24,692 --> 01:12:26,432
If we get well, just do the next one.

1539
01:12:26,432 --> 01:12:27,412
All right. Do it now.

1540
01:12:27,412 --> 01:12:28,572
I don't care about the marks.

1541
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:30,332
What does everyone want to talk about?

1542
01:12:30,332 --> 01:12:31,712
We don't have to talk about everything.

1543
01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:34,932
I like the marks because it reminds me of Iron Man's armor.

1544
01:12:35,592 --> 01:12:38,992
I like it that it's Mark one, Mark two, and that's what Iron Man's armor has.

1545
01:12:39,172 --> 01:12:42,692
You know, Mark one is the silver bulky Iron Man armor.

1546
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:45,232
And then what's the new what's Infinity War's mark?

1547
01:12:45,732 --> 01:12:47,412
It's got to be like a ton.

1548
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:49,532
It's like a hundred or something.

1549
01:12:49,612 --> 01:12:50,592
We'll Google that.

1550
01:12:50,712 --> 01:12:52,432
What's your favorite mark, everybody?

1551
01:12:53,192 --> 01:12:54,332
I like the newest mark.

1552
01:12:54,352 --> 01:12:55,512
I think the newest mark.

1553
01:12:55,512 --> 01:12:56,992
I do, too. Yeah.

1554
01:12:57,092 --> 01:12:58,292
What is that mark seven?

1555
01:12:58,992 --> 01:12:59,852
I think yeah, I think you're right.

1556
01:13:00,352 --> 01:13:01,632
Yeah, I think it's great.

1557
01:13:01,672 --> 01:13:05,692
The current monorails you get on, it's kind of like a sort of a retro vibe.

1558
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:10,472
But without being so retro that it blasts flame in people's faces

1559
01:13:10,472 --> 01:13:12,192
and big chunks fall off. Yeah.

1560
01:13:12,192 --> 01:13:15,112
It looks it kind of looks like the original ones, but like mixed

1561
01:13:15,112 --> 01:13:21,052
with the kind of like molded plastic Star Wars, you feel of of the 80s ones.

1562
01:13:21,212 --> 01:13:23,652
Yeah. And which then they don't have those in Florida.

1563
01:13:24,132 --> 01:13:28,992
So I feel lucky and special here in Disneyland to have this nice mark seven.

1564
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:35,052
So marks one through three, five and seven are just Disneyland marks.

1565
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:36,712
Huh. What would that be?

1566
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,212
Four and six are Disney World.

1567
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:40,532
It makes more sense.

1568
01:13:40,652 --> 01:13:42,472
Numerals makes it even harder to remember.

1569
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:44,012
Yeah. My brain is not.

1570
01:13:44,272 --> 01:13:45,532
I made it numbers in my notes.

1571
01:13:45,612 --> 01:13:50,052
So it makes sense that since the the Disneyland

1572
01:13:50,052 --> 01:13:54,052
Monorail has been operating since 59, they have more generations.

1573
01:13:54,752 --> 01:13:59,872
That said, again, coming up on 50 years in Disney World,

1574
01:14:00,412 --> 01:14:03,492
they should also have more generations of Monorail.

1575
01:14:03,512 --> 01:14:06,112
They are on generation two in Florida.

1576
01:14:06,372 --> 01:14:10,452
So like my fondest Monorail would probably be.

1577
01:14:10,572 --> 01:14:13,892
Oh, God, what is a six marks six?

1578
01:14:14,092 --> 01:14:17,872
Yeah. The current generation is Florida, because that's what I rode in

1579
01:14:17,872 --> 01:14:18,972
when I was a kid.

1580
01:14:19,472 --> 01:14:24,412
But they're the same goddamn Monorails like they've rebuilt one or two,

1581
01:14:24,472 --> 01:14:25,552
but not a lot of them.

1582
01:14:25,552 --> 01:14:29,352
This is what happens when people protest any change at Disney World.

1583
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,732
Keep it like it is. It's perfect now.

1584
01:14:31,732 --> 01:14:33,632
Well, that is what happened with the Monorails.

1585
01:14:33,692 --> 01:14:36,112
And now there's big chunks hitting people in the head.

1586
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:40,372
There's got to be a way to, you know, make that not happen with the old ones, too.

1587
01:14:40,412 --> 01:14:42,252
But I guess if they're just the way they're built,

1588
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:44,632
maybe it's just hard to maintain as they get older.

1589
01:14:44,632 --> 01:14:46,152
Maybe you got to. Mm hmm.

1590
01:14:46,152 --> 01:14:51,152
So, well, it's it's also very expensive to buy a whole fleet of Monorails.

1591
01:14:51,272 --> 01:14:54,352
And there's like five companies in the world that can build it.

1592
01:14:54,372 --> 01:14:57,612
That was the speculation, because I think it was Bob.

1593
01:14:57,752 --> 01:15:01,352
Was it Bob Gurr recently who said, oh, they've ordered a new fleet of Monorails.

1594
01:15:01,952 --> 01:15:06,752
But then the last company that built the Monorails, they they

1595
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:10,912
an order of that size has to be noted in public records

1596
01:15:10,912 --> 01:15:12,992
and had not been noted yet.

1597
01:15:13,232 --> 01:15:15,472
But then people are speculating that like, oh, well,

1598
01:15:15,472 --> 01:15:17,692
maybe this other company is building it.

1599
01:15:17,992 --> 01:15:21,812
Siemens offered to build them a fleet for cheap or free.

1600
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:25,552
But it would have had to been the Disney Siemens Monorail.

1601
01:15:25,952 --> 01:15:26,752
But they didn't want that.

1602
01:15:26,952 --> 01:15:28,812
They didn't want it co-branded.

1603
01:15:29,412 --> 01:15:31,452
Hmm. So is Gurr full of it?

1604
01:15:32,272 --> 01:15:33,432
What? Why is Gurr?

1605
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:35,132
He's like he's flexing.

1606
01:15:35,332 --> 01:15:38,032
He's like acting like he knows stuff and doesn't know it.

1607
01:15:38,112 --> 01:15:39,432
He's just trying to get publicity.

1608
01:15:40,152 --> 01:15:41,292
Bob Gurr publicity.

1609
01:15:41,832 --> 01:15:44,152
The Bob Gurr feud begins.

1610
01:15:44,372 --> 01:15:46,972
Let's let's keep talking about Disney World.

1611
01:15:46,972 --> 01:15:51,072
We're kind of in it. I mean, that's what like I think it's exciting that

1612
01:15:51,072 --> 01:15:54,912
like like what a cool like if Disney World is this like

1613
01:15:54,912 --> 01:15:58,772
gigantic exploded out version of Disneyland in general

1614
01:15:58,772 --> 01:16:02,312
to now have the Monorail that just is like a cute little thing

1615
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:06,992
that makes two stops to have it now be like this primary transportation system.

1616
01:16:06,992 --> 01:16:12,452
And I like I'm so happy as a kid getting on that Monorail every time.

1617
01:16:12,912 --> 01:16:18,092
And the excitement of like the first arrival at Epcot, like getting in that way.

1618
01:16:18,192 --> 01:16:20,192
That's the only way to get to Epcot.

1619
01:16:21,332 --> 01:16:23,072
I feel you got to arrive in style.

1620
01:16:23,532 --> 01:16:25,072
Yeah. And you see. Yes, I agree.

1621
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:28,692
I the I'm trying to think because the Disney World is such a

1622
01:16:28,692 --> 01:16:30,272
it's obviously such a giant place.

1623
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:34,492
But there's something special about it not being in the parks there.

1624
01:16:34,612 --> 01:16:37,372
It's the ride that's outside of the parks.

1625
01:16:37,432 --> 01:16:39,672
So it's your first taste of a ride.

1626
01:16:39,732 --> 01:16:41,772
It looks like yes. Tomorrowland.

1627
01:16:42,012 --> 01:16:45,292
It like there's something like you're getting you're doing a ride

1628
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:48,492
before the rides are here and a free ride. It's free.

1629
01:16:48,492 --> 01:16:52,972
Yeah. But as a kid, I was thinking you can ride it for free.

1630
01:16:53,212 --> 01:16:56,112
Even as a kid, I was like, well, hey, this is like a ride for free.

1631
01:16:56,332 --> 01:17:01,792
I think that's what I that's what I got confused on early

1632
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:06,372
is I didn't contextualize like, yeah, it's the first ride you can go on.

1633
01:17:06,592 --> 01:17:08,512
It's also a free ride.

1634
01:17:08,512 --> 01:17:12,732
You could just ride it all day around this massive property in Disney World.

1635
01:17:12,952 --> 01:17:15,252
That's a feature I miss from Disneyland.

1636
01:17:15,472 --> 01:17:17,372
It doesn't really make sense to do it in Disneyland,

1637
01:17:17,652 --> 01:17:19,532
but I do feel nostalgic for it.

1638
01:17:19,572 --> 01:17:22,992
Unless they were to roll it around all of Anaheim in some fun way.

1639
01:17:23,232 --> 01:17:26,592
Which is if we ever got a different park, like if suddenly

1640
01:17:26,592 --> 01:17:30,492
the Anaheim Stadium becomes a park or they build

1641
01:17:30,492 --> 01:17:33,192
like they build in some weird other zone.

1642
01:17:33,212 --> 01:17:36,352
Maybe we do have monorails crisscross in the Anaheim streets.

1643
01:17:36,572 --> 01:17:37,672
Yeah, that would be cool.

1644
01:17:37,772 --> 01:17:41,112
I mean, I think an interesting thing about the Disneyland one

1645
01:17:41,112 --> 01:17:43,112
is how many times the tracks been moved.

1646
01:17:43,112 --> 01:17:45,952
It had to be moved when they built the show building for Indiana Jones.

1647
01:17:46,172 --> 01:17:47,312
Had to be moved.

1648
01:17:48,232 --> 01:17:51,332
Actually, I don't think it got tweaked too much for California Adventure.

1649
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:54,072
It but stuff got built around it.

1650
01:17:54,172 --> 01:17:58,272
And I do think it's a huge missed opportunity that there's no DCA station

1651
01:17:58,272 --> 01:18:00,932
or a Grand California station. Yeah, true.

1652
01:18:01,372 --> 01:18:02,252
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1653
01:18:02,272 --> 01:18:03,412
It drives right around.

1654
01:18:03,732 --> 01:18:05,652
Like it's it's crazy to me.

1655
01:18:06,032 --> 01:18:09,692
And that that might actually justify some of the Grand California

1656
01:18:09,692 --> 01:18:12,792
pricing nowadays if it was a monorail hotel.

1657
01:18:13,032 --> 01:18:15,972
Yeah, but it's weird because it's like, well, I guess you could go to Disneyland.

1658
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:19,732
But it's like the big thing with Grand California is you walk right into the park.

1659
01:18:20,632 --> 01:18:24,092
Um, yeah. Oh, that for for California Adventure.

1660
01:18:24,292 --> 01:18:26,412
Yes, that is that was sort of the unique feature.

1661
01:18:26,492 --> 01:18:28,152
I guess that was the trade off.

1662
01:18:28,312 --> 01:18:32,312
Yeah. Now you have a quick line straight now, but you could just put

1663
01:18:32,312 --> 01:18:33,572
across the street to Disneyland.

1664
01:18:33,592 --> 01:18:35,072
It would take longer to get there.

1665
01:18:35,172 --> 01:18:37,752
Exactly like it like it would make more sense to have it.

1666
01:18:38,212 --> 01:18:41,572
And it would make more sense geographically to put it in Paradise Pier.

1667
01:18:41,612 --> 01:18:44,452
But it would make more sense since that's a little out of the way

1668
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:46,512
versus Grand Californian.

1669
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:50,732
It would be cool if it went through it and didn't stop.

1670
01:18:50,952 --> 01:18:52,292
I'll say that. Yeah.

1671
01:18:52,472 --> 01:18:53,972
Yeah. Through what? Through the Grand California.

1672
01:18:54,032 --> 01:18:57,312
And if there was like a you could see that atrium, it shoots through.

1673
01:18:57,452 --> 01:18:58,552
It does go through it.

1674
01:18:58,572 --> 01:19:01,992
But like through a literally into the like contemporary like style.

1675
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:03,072
Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah.

1676
01:19:03,392 --> 01:19:06,032
Which which wait, and we haven't talked about that yet.

1677
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,652
That's the big thing.

1678
01:19:07,712 --> 01:19:10,812
Well, the thrill, the joy of the Disney World,

1679
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:13,152
Monorail actually going through a building.

1680
01:19:13,152 --> 01:19:15,252
Yes. Right through that contemporary.

1681
01:19:15,712 --> 01:19:20,252
If you have the toy like I have and I have the toy contemporary as well,

1682
01:19:20,252 --> 01:19:23,832
you can send that Monorail shooting right through that contemporary.

1683
01:19:24,052 --> 01:19:25,512
Just like in real life. Delightful.

1684
01:19:25,532 --> 01:19:26,932
Do you put it around your Christmas tree?

1685
01:19:27,412 --> 01:19:29,832
Uh, I don't. I don't have enough room to.

1686
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:33,952
I was really ambitious when I bought when I came home with the Monorail toy.

1687
01:19:33,972 --> 01:19:35,552
I also bought extra track.

1688
01:19:35,712 --> 01:19:38,392
I'm like, I don't need more track because this is going to really like spread out.

1689
01:19:38,552 --> 01:19:41,152
And I was like living in a house with other roommates.

1690
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:43,252
I don't know where I thought I was going to like to.

1691
01:19:43,252 --> 01:19:46,072
I don't know what space I was going to take over with a giant Monorail track.

1692
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:47,272
Like a goal thing.

1693
01:19:47,272 --> 01:19:50,052
It's like when you buy a shirt that's a little snug and you're like,

1694
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:52,212
I'm going to lose some weight so the shirt fits nicely.

1695
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:54,872
Yours was I'm going to buy extra track. Yeah.

1696
01:19:55,072 --> 01:19:56,432
Do you still have the extra track?

1697
01:19:56,712 --> 01:19:58,312
Yeah, I do. One of these days.

1698
01:19:58,312 --> 01:20:00,212
I'm going to have the densest Monorail network.

1699
01:20:00,432 --> 01:20:03,032
How much feet? How many feet of track do you have, you think?

1700
01:20:03,772 --> 01:20:07,112
Well, the feet number is not going to be impressive because, you know, it's,

1701
01:20:07,112 --> 01:20:09,272
you know, six because it's small.

1702
01:20:09,712 --> 01:20:11,592
But like, I don't know.

1703
01:20:12,352 --> 01:20:13,952
Maybe it's bigger than I don't know.

1704
01:20:14,092 --> 01:20:15,852
I mean, it's not a ton of extra track.

1705
01:20:16,472 --> 01:20:17,452
That's still pretty good.

1706
01:20:17,592 --> 01:20:20,832
I mean, I only ask about the Christmas tree because there's a picture

1707
01:20:20,832 --> 01:20:25,012
going around where someone instead of a train set around the bottom

1708
01:20:25,012 --> 01:20:27,952
of Christmas tree has a Monorail going around, which I've seen before.

1709
01:20:27,952 --> 01:20:30,552
And I think looks very cute at Christmas time. Yeah.

1710
01:20:30,632 --> 01:20:32,712
I would I would like that.

1711
01:20:33,292 --> 01:20:35,372
Yeah, you're right. Goals, Monorail goals.

1712
01:20:35,692 --> 01:20:39,112
And then if you could build it up so it goes through the tree somehow

1713
01:20:39,112 --> 01:20:41,132
around the tree and then down somehow.

1714
01:20:41,412 --> 01:20:43,372
I don't know how you do it, but yeah, that would be cool.

1715
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:46,412
Well, and you know what's something that I actually didn't know about my Monorail

1716
01:20:46,412 --> 01:20:50,412
until today is that, you know, you there's a lid on the top

1717
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:54,492
so you can put the characters inside and there's little like pegs

1718
01:20:54,492 --> 01:20:58,072
you can make and there's like little versions of all of the of Mickey

1719
01:20:58,072 --> 01:21:01,272
and Minnie and Goofy, all the main characters, you could send them

1720
01:21:01,272 --> 01:21:02,232
on a Monorail ride.

1721
01:21:02,512 --> 01:21:06,192
But what I didn't realize is that there's also little doors that open and close

1722
01:21:06,192 --> 01:21:11,212
and they can stay open, which means like the real Disney World Monorail.

1723
01:21:11,312 --> 01:21:12,852
You can drive it around with the doors open.

1724
01:21:12,972 --> 01:21:17,712
So you could buy like a Max from Goofy movie with like holding

1725
01:21:17,712 --> 01:21:21,612
like if they had a modern Max and he had an iPhone.

1726
01:21:21,972 --> 01:21:25,212
Or you could even like make a little iPhone out of cardboard

1727
01:21:25,212 --> 01:21:28,732
or plastic or something and put it in like it'd have to be microscopic.

1728
01:21:29,412 --> 01:21:34,152
Yeah. And like with the door open, record the door falling off.

1729
01:21:34,712 --> 01:21:35,552
Oh, you can. OK.

1730
01:21:35,672 --> 01:21:38,852
So you chose Streetwise Youngster Max.

1731
01:21:38,872 --> 01:21:41,872
Yeah. To be documenting on social media

1732
01:21:41,872 --> 01:21:44,472
the collapse of my Monorail.

1733
01:21:44,832 --> 01:21:49,332
The only young person, modern young person, I feel like Disney has made

1734
01:21:49,332 --> 01:21:54,092
or I guess the kid from Coco is a modern young person, technically.

1735
01:21:54,812 --> 01:21:58,012
Vanellope from Ralph Breaks the Internet.

1736
01:21:58,072 --> 01:22:01,392
I would call Vanellope a fictional character who lives in a magical world.

1737
01:22:02,072 --> 01:22:03,492
So where age doesn't.

1738
01:22:04,312 --> 01:22:05,932
Yeah, but he calls. She's a kid.

1739
01:22:06,052 --> 01:22:07,692
Ralph calls her a kid. That's true.

1740
01:22:07,692 --> 01:22:09,272
But she's a kid forever, presumably.

1741
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:11,992
What about Hipster Mickey, who is always on his phone?

1742
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:15,132
But Hipster Mickey's not going to narc on his own company.

1743
01:22:15,132 --> 01:22:16,972
I don't know. He's got a different tune.

1744
01:22:18,372 --> 01:22:20,152
He's got a different attitude than regular Mickey.

1745
01:22:20,472 --> 01:22:24,352
Do you think he's like the Edward Snowden of Hipster Mickey?

1746
01:22:24,792 --> 01:22:26,492
No. He's like giving out leaks. OK.

1747
01:22:27,312 --> 01:22:28,912
I think he just wanted to get more hits.

1748
01:22:29,472 --> 01:22:32,072
He wanted to get more Instagram views, basically.

1749
01:22:32,172 --> 01:22:34,712
So he's going to put the video up because it's going to get Instagram views.

1750
01:22:34,812 --> 01:22:37,372
Oh, I see. He's just in it for the views and for the social media.

1751
01:22:37,392 --> 01:22:38,932
So he's an influencer. He's a content creator.

1752
01:22:38,952 --> 01:22:41,012
He's absolutely an influencer. Yeah.

1753
01:22:41,532 --> 01:22:43,092
I feel like we are so tangent prone.

1754
01:22:43,172 --> 01:22:46,072
I think it's obvious we were wanting to like escape the Monorail.

1755
01:22:46,112 --> 01:22:50,552
We're talking about any any and everything, but which I'm loving all of it.

1756
01:22:50,652 --> 01:22:53,412
I'm now I'm just like I'm just getting down to like, what are the basics?

1757
01:22:53,912 --> 01:22:55,812
What do I what do I not want to miss?

1758
01:22:56,092 --> 01:22:57,052
Well, we get out of here.

1759
01:22:57,112 --> 01:23:00,292
So the Monorail in Florida, of course, has three different lines.

1760
01:23:00,372 --> 01:23:04,432
There's the express line that goes right to the Magic Kingdom.

1761
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:08,472
There is the right to the Magic Kingdom from the Ticket Transportation Center,

1762
01:23:08,492 --> 01:23:10,292
which used to be a hub.

1763
01:23:10,312 --> 01:23:13,792
I remember when we would stay places, stay at some of the hotels in Disneyland.

1764
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:18,052
You used to have to get to the TTA to transfer for some locations.

1765
01:23:18,052 --> 01:23:20,532
Now there's a lot of the TTA.

1766
01:23:20,572 --> 01:23:22,732
TTA. Oh, I'm sorry.

1767
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:24,452
That's Tomorrowland Transit Authority.

1768
01:23:24,972 --> 01:23:26,292
It wasn't even the right thing.

1769
01:23:26,572 --> 01:23:28,852
T ampersand ticket and transfer.

1770
01:23:29,592 --> 01:23:30,972
Fuck TTC.

1771
01:23:31,212 --> 01:23:33,812
TTA is what the people move around on.

1772
01:23:33,952 --> 01:23:39,312
But the ticket transportation center and TNA is used to hey, save it for universal.

1773
01:23:39,712 --> 01:23:41,792
OK, it's rowdier over there.

1774
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:44,992
So the express line goes right to the Magic Kingdom from there.

1775
01:23:45,012 --> 01:23:48,612
The resort line stops at the Magic Kingdom and the Ticket and Transportation Center.

1776
01:23:48,712 --> 01:23:52,032
But all the hotels along the route, the Polynesian, the contemporary,

1777
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:55,972
the Grand Floridian, Grand Floridian added last to that line.

1778
01:23:56,432 --> 01:24:00,512
And then there's the Epcot line that goes from Ticket and Transportation Center.

1779
01:24:00,592 --> 01:24:05,472
That is the main thing now that you have to transfer there for the Epcot line.

1780
01:24:05,472 --> 01:24:08,012
And that goes straight to beautiful Epcot Center.

1781
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,692
Yeah. But before you land at the station,

1782
01:24:10,692 --> 01:24:15,612
you get to do a big pass, though it doesn't stop inside the Epcot Park.

1783
01:24:15,932 --> 01:24:19,652
You do get to do a big pass and weave in and out and around some stuff.

1784
01:24:19,952 --> 01:24:22,132
And that was open before Epcot opened.

1785
01:24:22,212 --> 01:24:25,832
So the summer before you could take the monorail down there,

1786
01:24:25,952 --> 01:24:29,872
go down to like a preview center and see it all still under construction

1787
01:24:29,872 --> 01:24:31,872
with your own eyes, do a big pass.

1788
01:24:32,672 --> 01:24:35,512
My friend Dennis made a point of doing that as a kid.

1789
01:24:36,212 --> 01:24:39,652
Like, yes, of course, I'm taking out time to go see the like

1790
01:24:39,652 --> 01:24:44,672
almost built Epcot and go like watch a video about what it's going to be like.

1791
01:24:45,132 --> 01:24:48,592
That's like when I there used to be an Islands of Adventure preview center

1792
01:24:48,592 --> 01:24:54,632
in Universal Studios, Florida, and I I went there like, hey, can we go back?

1793
01:24:54,732 --> 01:24:56,012
It's like we were there this morning.

1794
01:24:56,012 --> 01:24:59,012
And I'm like, yeah, but we only come here for a day.

1795
01:24:59,432 --> 01:25:03,532
But we have to see this because when the park opens, they'll close this.

1796
01:25:03,852 --> 01:25:05,332
This is a unique attraction.

1797
01:25:05,952 --> 01:25:07,112
You had that thought as a kid.

1798
01:25:07,292 --> 01:25:11,092
As a kid, I knew this wouldn't be here forever because the park will be here.

1799
01:25:11,092 --> 01:25:14,452
And I wanted to learn more about the park because at the time

1800
01:25:14,452 --> 01:25:19,172
I just kind of like a marathon everything in Florida,

1801
01:25:19,412 --> 01:25:24,852
because outside the magazines like magazine TV specials, you didn't have as much.

1802
01:25:25,012 --> 01:25:29,652
Could we do a full episode about preview centers or does each preview center

1803
01:25:29,652 --> 01:25:32,092
require its own? Well, you know our answer.

1804
01:25:32,092 --> 01:25:35,232
I just check in the boundaries.

1805
01:25:35,232 --> 01:25:39,192
See, I this this I think I'm going to walk the tight rope on

1806
01:25:39,192 --> 01:25:43,152
because I think it would be funny to do a series about preview centers.

1807
01:25:43,352 --> 01:25:46,672
But I don't think they're terribly well documented,

1808
01:25:47,012 --> 01:25:52,532
especially Universal Hard Rock Park, surprisingly well documented.

1809
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:55,912
And another one that's another preview center

1810
01:25:55,912 --> 01:26:00,512
that is well documented is the Paris one, which was taken over by French street

1811
01:26:00,512 --> 01:26:04,512
thugs because it did stay open, but they gutted it and took everything out.

1812
01:26:04,512 --> 01:26:09,392
But it became full of graffiti and people were skating around and living there.

1813
01:26:09,972 --> 01:26:15,672
So the plot of Les Mis happens to the preview center.

1814
01:26:15,932 --> 01:26:19,692
And Disney Army came in and seized the land back.

1815
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:22,972
Let me say another thing about the Epcot one.

1816
01:26:23,192 --> 01:26:23,712
I mean, I'm curious.

1817
01:26:24,132 --> 01:26:27,052
I should throw out to you guys other your other favorite like Monorail.

1818
01:26:27,152 --> 01:26:28,512
Your favorite Monorail stop.

1819
01:26:28,852 --> 01:26:34,412
But for me, obviously, is that Epcot one that that place is such

1820
01:26:34,512 --> 01:26:36,912
eighty six. I love it so much.

1821
01:26:37,412 --> 01:26:42,552
It is so horny thing you ever said on the show is a word about the Monorail.

1822
01:26:42,892 --> 01:26:44,532
Makes a lot of sense.

1823
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:48,432
Texting Aaron to start the work on the such eighty six

1824
01:26:48,432 --> 01:26:54,352
T-shirt done in so that each letter has like the triangles of Spaceship Earth.

1825
01:26:54,812 --> 01:26:57,112
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know. Yes, yes, yes.

1826
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:59,112
No, I'm no. I'm.

1827
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:00,932
Hey, look, I'm I'm into that.

1828
01:27:01,112 --> 01:27:03,352
Yeah, I like clearly on a deeper level show.

1829
01:27:03,372 --> 01:27:05,072
Horny. Or is what I say?

1830
01:27:06,092 --> 01:27:07,192
No, I am. I'm weird.

1831
01:27:07,892 --> 01:27:11,872
Like our our friend Doug Jones and guest on the show put out a new mix

1832
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:15,272
where he had a lot of clips of old commercials for seven up

1833
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:18,152
made by a graphic designer named Robert Abel.

1834
01:27:18,152 --> 01:27:19,832
And we watched it last night.

1835
01:27:19,852 --> 01:27:24,692
And like during some of these, Aaron and I are both like, oh, God.

1836
01:27:24,812 --> 01:27:28,772
Like some of these like some of the neon in this stuff really does.

1837
01:27:29,112 --> 01:27:30,372
Look, I don't know.

1838
01:27:30,632 --> 01:27:32,252
I'm putting myself out there too much.

1839
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:35,732
I get it. No, no, I'm always horny on Mike, my man.

1840
01:27:36,072 --> 01:27:37,092
No worries. I'm on board.

1841
01:27:37,212 --> 01:27:39,612
Yeah. It's num nums. And for me, it's neon.

1842
01:27:40,392 --> 01:27:42,432
We all got our thing.

1843
01:27:42,492 --> 01:27:44,572
I don't want to get too sidetracked, but I don't know when this will come up again.

1844
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:48,072
Doug Jones just texted me out of the blue. Pizza Rizzo is good.

1845
01:27:48,672 --> 01:27:53,612
And I was like, oh, and I'm like, oh, I just thought I was like kind of sparse

1846
01:27:53,612 --> 01:27:55,672
of like, you know, there's tons of Muppet details.

1847
01:27:55,712 --> 01:27:58,632
And he like shows me like pictures of like

1848
01:27:59,112 --> 01:28:02,692
just a very like small, I don't know what you call it,

1849
01:28:03,212 --> 01:28:06,512
like a bulletin board of some kind with like some vague Muppet references.

1850
01:28:06,932 --> 01:28:08,772
And he's like, it's good. And the food is good.

1851
01:28:09,012 --> 01:28:09,932
That's what I was going to ask.

1852
01:28:09,972 --> 01:28:11,892
What's what's my wait? What's what's pizza?

1853
01:28:12,052 --> 01:28:14,712
Rizzo for just for a Disney's Hollywood studios.

1854
01:28:14,732 --> 01:28:16,812
And it's like supposedly a Muppet themed pizzeria.

1855
01:28:16,832 --> 01:28:20,272
But you walk in there and there's barely anything that would let you know

1856
01:28:20,272 --> 01:28:22,492
that it was Muppets starting the Doug fight again.

1857
01:28:22,492 --> 01:28:26,192
And so I'm not even upset about I'm just I just think it's funny

1858
01:28:26,192 --> 01:28:29,132
because I must have said I must have trashed it on an episode.

1859
01:28:29,612 --> 01:28:32,852
And Doug, like that stuck in his head and he was like, I'm going to tell him it's wrong.

1860
01:28:33,192 --> 01:28:38,052
Well, we'll hammer all this out on the great Pizza Rizzo with the Jones,

1861
01:28:38,512 --> 01:28:41,552
a three part series with Doug.

1862
01:28:41,852 --> 01:28:42,612
With Doug, yes.

1863
01:28:42,952 --> 01:28:47,232
There will be an episode for the prosecution, an episode for the defense

1864
01:28:47,232 --> 01:28:50,192
and one that is the arguments, I guess, then closing arguments

1865
01:28:50,192 --> 01:28:51,412
will have to be their own thing.

1866
01:28:52,412 --> 01:28:53,952
And OK, so we're getting into five.

1867
01:28:53,952 --> 01:28:58,092
We'll have to find a judge, though, a partial judge to answer your question.

1868
01:28:58,292 --> 01:29:01,052
I think for me, I agree.

1869
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:03,312
Yeah, getting off that Epcot station is great.

1870
01:29:03,652 --> 01:29:06,472
Of course, the contemporary is great.

1871
01:29:06,652 --> 01:29:11,972
But like the Polynesian walking out of this like kind of cold, futuristic,

1872
01:29:13,292 --> 01:29:16,352
very well air conditioned work used to be seems like it breaks a lot.

1873
01:29:16,472 --> 01:29:18,132
The air conditioning in the monorail,

1874
01:29:19,772 --> 01:29:24,192
the contrast of that from that future mode of transit into this

1875
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:29,792
like a lush tropical paradise, like I always even as a kid, I was like, this is awesome.

1876
01:29:29,852 --> 01:29:32,012
Let's rank. Let's rank the stops.

1877
01:29:32,152 --> 01:29:36,552
Oh, and personal, this is personal, like because I think if you if you're going

1878
01:29:36,552 --> 01:29:40,272
like overall iconic, it's contemporary number one.

1879
01:29:40,272 --> 01:29:44,492
But personally, personally, I also go Polynesian.

1880
01:29:44,532 --> 01:29:46,072
We stayed there a lot as a kid.

1881
01:29:46,252 --> 01:29:50,172
There was something very fun about coming out the doors to the top

1882
01:29:50,172 --> 01:29:51,832
and getting on that monorail.

1883
01:29:51,932 --> 01:29:53,152
It felt like you were leaving.

1884
01:29:53,452 --> 01:29:57,772
Like it felt like a real jarring transition from like a futuristic thing

1885
01:29:57,772 --> 01:30:01,652
to the fun Polynesian vibe to get up cut in the top three.

1886
01:30:01,652 --> 01:30:03,092
And I'll I'll shut up.

1887
01:30:03,552 --> 01:30:05,812
I think Epcot is number three.

1888
01:30:05,932 --> 01:30:08,692
I think it's number three credit to the Magic Kingdom.

1889
01:30:08,792 --> 01:30:13,072
A lot of wrought iron turn of the set, like Victorian architectural style

1890
01:30:13,072 --> 01:30:19,912
to complement the main better than Blade Runner, RoboComp, Boxy Slant.

1891
01:30:20,572 --> 01:30:24,752
I will not have wrought iron defeat Boxy Slant.

1892
01:30:25,372 --> 01:30:26,432
Magic Kingdom is not.

1893
01:30:26,732 --> 01:30:28,872
That's four. Damn right.

1894
01:30:29,052 --> 01:30:30,112
That's four for sure.

1895
01:30:30,112 --> 01:30:31,712
Then it's Floridian.

1896
01:30:31,872 --> 01:30:33,712
Then it's the Ticket and Transportation Center.

1897
01:30:33,832 --> 01:30:34,572
Yeah, TTC.

1898
01:30:35,612 --> 01:30:38,312
TATC. Is that what we were? TATC?

1899
01:30:38,492 --> 01:30:40,092
Yeah, that's it. That's probably it.

1900
01:30:40,092 --> 01:30:45,492
And you have to say it for throwing your wrist back and with your voice going up.

1901
01:30:45,772 --> 01:30:47,972
TATC. That's how we say it.

1902
01:30:48,612 --> 01:30:50,292
Current current Disneyland ones.

1903
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:52,992
I have two way tie for last for me.

1904
01:30:52,992 --> 01:30:56,672
In terms of a static, I mean, yeah, they are so good.

1905
01:30:56,712 --> 01:30:58,352
I agree over Tomorrowland.

1906
01:30:58,592 --> 01:31:03,712
And I guess to bring it back to Disneyland before we then spend 20 minutes

1907
01:31:03,712 --> 01:31:06,692
just clowning on Florida's catastrophes.

1908
01:31:07,852 --> 01:31:12,692
I am so disappointed that I never got to see the Monorail Cafe,

1909
01:31:12,952 --> 01:31:16,352
the restaurant that used to be on the ground floor of the Monorail station.

1910
01:31:16,692 --> 01:31:18,732
The throwback kind of diner.

1911
01:31:19,092 --> 01:31:22,912
The verdict online seems to be the best milkshakes at Anna Hyde.

1912
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:28,912
It was just basically kind of like a 50s style diner with like sandwiches and stuff.

1913
01:31:29,132 --> 01:31:31,252
And that's got that's got some boxy 80s.

1914
01:31:31,312 --> 01:31:33,512
I like the architecture of that.

1915
01:31:34,812 --> 01:31:37,852
This boomerang sort of looky 50s design.

1916
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:42,972
My grandmother had that on it like her like kooky throwback Nickelodeon Nick at night.

1917
01:31:43,132 --> 01:31:47,032
Like the way the 50s equals weird shapes and things wiggling around.

1918
01:31:47,452 --> 01:31:49,812
There is a there's a cool aesthetic to the Monorail Cafe,

1919
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:53,072
but it had to go and then Disney opens.

1920
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,952
But that was that was a thing that was open from like 55 on.

1921
01:31:56,952 --> 01:31:58,652
It was just called the coffee shop.

1922
01:31:58,952 --> 01:32:01,952
And then it became the Monorail Cafe way later into the runs.

1923
01:32:01,952 --> 01:32:04,032
That was that's an it's an old establishment.

1924
01:32:04,032 --> 01:32:06,372
Stuck around for a long time.

1925
01:32:06,392 --> 01:32:09,232
I think the history of the Disneyland Hotel is fascinating

1926
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:12,352
because I was wondering reading this because you always see the signs

1927
01:32:12,352 --> 01:32:14,772
that say like over 30 shops and restaurants.

1928
01:32:14,852 --> 01:32:16,832
And I'm like, where did they put them all?

1929
01:32:17,052 --> 01:32:19,172
And the answer is they essentially built a mall

1930
01:32:19,172 --> 01:32:21,472
that they then bulldozed to build downtown Disney.

1931
01:32:21,952 --> 01:32:22,772
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1932
01:32:22,792 --> 01:32:25,732
There was a lot in there and just like not even like Disney ish,

1933
01:32:25,732 --> 01:32:31,172
just like some dress shop, a watch store, and they weren't magical in any way.

1934
01:32:31,172 --> 01:32:33,372
Yeah, it's just like a boring office building.

1935
01:32:33,612 --> 01:32:37,692
It was like very much like the early days of the contemporary,

1936
01:32:37,972 --> 01:32:41,092
also very interesting in terms of changing taste,

1937
01:32:41,112 --> 01:32:45,552
because there was all sorts of like this is a resort by your resort where

1938
01:32:45,552 --> 01:32:50,312
and here's the counter where you order a box of citrus to ship home to your family.

1939
01:32:50,312 --> 01:32:53,352
That used to be such a novel thing before.

1940
01:32:53,692 --> 01:32:58,092
Refrigeration really was the as good as it is now.

1941
01:32:58,092 --> 01:33:03,272
I was like, oh, yeah, fresh, really fresh citrus at times of year

1942
01:33:03,272 --> 01:33:08,072
where citrus was not in season like that was a great gift for someone to bring back.

1943
01:33:08,092 --> 01:33:12,112
And you are upset that you can no longer go down Anaheim and ship citrus.

1944
01:33:12,472 --> 01:33:14,132
Orlando, I mean. Oh, sorry.

1945
01:33:14,832 --> 01:33:15,772
Are you upset about that?

1946
01:33:16,892 --> 01:33:18,532
I think that would be cool.

1947
01:33:18,632 --> 01:33:20,932
Did you guys get oranges in your stockings growing up?

1948
01:33:21,172 --> 01:33:22,312
We got tangerines.

1949
01:33:22,492 --> 01:33:23,352
Tangerines. Yeah.

1950
01:33:23,512 --> 01:33:25,152
So that's that's a lingering.

1951
01:33:25,192 --> 01:33:28,172
Wait, what tangerines in a stocking?

1952
01:33:28,232 --> 01:33:32,672
Yeah, this is a lingering sort of thing when like citrus that was like a treat.

1953
01:33:33,632 --> 01:33:35,552
I believe citrus season is you get oranges.

1954
01:33:35,772 --> 01:33:39,932
Winter. We yeah, my my grandparents would give us give us stockings with.

1955
01:33:40,032 --> 01:33:41,672
Scott, no citrus in your stocking.

1956
01:33:41,852 --> 01:33:44,532
No, never. What a deprived childhood.

1957
01:33:44,812 --> 01:33:45,932
Yeah, that's it.

1958
01:33:45,952 --> 01:33:48,512
I never left a tangerine for me.

1959
01:33:48,612 --> 01:33:49,532
Well, here's the thing.

1960
01:33:49,532 --> 01:33:51,852
If you forget about it at the bottom of the stocking,

1961
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:54,752
as you're eating your way through the candy, a couple of weeks later,

1962
01:33:54,752 --> 01:33:59,832
it will be a moldy tangerine covered in red stocking for.

1963
01:34:00,172 --> 01:34:02,932
Is that happened multiple times?

1964
01:34:03,132 --> 01:34:05,272
Yeah, of course it happened multiple times to me.

1965
01:34:05,292 --> 01:34:07,632
Come on. Several years you.

1966
01:34:07,672 --> 01:34:09,252
I neglected a tangerine.

1967
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:13,832
You fondly recall why no tangerines, but then you left them die.

1968
01:34:14,172 --> 01:34:18,352
You let them die in your stocking was not a big fruit boy growing up.

1969
01:34:18,492 --> 01:34:19,632
Not a fruit boy.

1970
01:34:19,632 --> 01:34:21,092
Fruit is so sugary.

1971
01:34:21,632 --> 01:34:23,592
I know, but it's not chocolate.

1972
01:34:23,912 --> 01:34:25,312
Sugary. How interesting.

1973
01:34:25,312 --> 01:34:27,032
Favorite fruit hot dogs.

1974
01:34:27,032 --> 01:34:30,032
That's what's crazy.

1975
01:34:30,112 --> 01:34:33,192
My mom, my mom would have us eat it that day.

1976
01:34:33,192 --> 01:34:36,252
She would just take them out then and like, just serve it to us.

1977
01:34:36,572 --> 01:34:39,572
We were mostly sticking to summer sausages.

1978
01:34:40,432 --> 01:34:42,532
Did you get summer sausages in your.

1979
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:43,132
No, we didn't.

1980
01:34:43,212 --> 01:34:47,092
But we sure as hell got and gave a lot of hickory farm samplers.

1981
01:34:47,152 --> 01:34:48,972
Did you guys not?

1982
01:34:49,632 --> 01:34:53,072
That was like, I don't think we ever got or gave from.

1983
01:34:53,212 --> 01:34:54,752
Extended family or coworkers.

1984
01:34:54,752 --> 01:34:58,592
And I'm not trying to act like we're a but we ate like crap, just like you did.

1985
01:34:58,812 --> 01:35:01,152
But I don't think we ever gave or received sausages.

1986
01:35:01,472 --> 01:35:02,692
Chicago is like, are you?

1987
01:35:02,932 --> 01:35:04,172
You just lived it.

1988
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:05,472
That was like water to you.

1989
01:35:05,572 --> 01:35:07,452
Chicago is just like one of the sausage.

1990
01:35:07,692 --> 01:35:09,212
Your house was covered in sausage.

1991
01:35:09,232 --> 01:35:11,332
I don't think we ate a lot of sausages, honestly.

1992
01:35:11,512 --> 01:35:15,932
We had we had hot dogs and as I've said, liver sausage once in a while.

1993
01:35:17,172 --> 01:35:19,592
Jerry, a bunch of tangerines stuffed together in a row

1994
01:35:19,592 --> 01:35:21,272
and then wrapped in sausage casing.

1995
01:35:23,352 --> 01:35:24,392
Oh, wow.

1996
01:35:24,392 --> 01:35:25,312
What is a good tree?

1997
01:35:25,472 --> 01:35:27,012
It's a great thing you made.

1998
01:35:27,572 --> 01:35:29,652
And of course, wrapped in red stocking.

1999
01:35:30,032 --> 01:35:30,592
Yeah.

2000
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:33,672
This is I'm going to have a nightmare about that.

2001
01:35:33,912 --> 01:35:36,232
I'm looking forward to that character in that new adult swim.

2002
01:35:36,512 --> 01:35:37,872
Vernon Chapman and stop.

2003
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:41,012
Lamb skin wrapped tangerines.

2004
01:35:41,892 --> 01:35:45,652
I will have a nightmare tonight where a flaming head.

2005
01:35:45,792 --> 01:35:50,532
Richard Nixon hands me a red fur tangerine sausage.

2006
01:35:53,472 --> 01:35:54,012
Boy.

2007
01:35:53,432 --> 01:35:58,652
I'll skate the most off the rails episode.

2008
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:01,832
Oh, sure. Hey, I got I got one.

2009
01:36:02,072 --> 01:36:06,872
Did you guys ever get a chance to ride in the captain's

2010
01:36:06,872 --> 01:36:08,652
the cone of the Monterey Island, Florida?

2011
01:36:08,872 --> 01:36:12,792
My sister did without us when she was very young.

2012
01:36:13,132 --> 01:36:14,092
Really? We were walking.

2013
01:36:14,332 --> 01:36:15,272
So my family was there.

2014
01:36:15,292 --> 01:36:18,392
And I don't know if it was the captain or was another family

2015
01:36:18,392 --> 01:36:21,812
who was like, we have one more space up here.

2016
01:36:22,732 --> 01:36:24,272
Does your daughter want to ride?

2017
01:36:25,032 --> 01:36:31,272
And I guess my mom was like, OK, my mom's highly paranoid, highly very worried.

2018
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:37,012
So my sister went up with this strange family and we took the loop from maybe

2019
01:36:37,012 --> 01:36:40,992
Magic King, let's say Magic Kingdom to or probably contemporary.

2020
01:36:41,052 --> 01:36:42,012
I think it was just one loop.

2021
01:36:42,272 --> 01:36:44,172
So maybe it was back from it was back from Epcot.

2022
01:36:44,232 --> 01:36:46,152
It was Epcot, Dickin Transportation Center.

2023
01:36:46,652 --> 01:36:49,792
And my mom was the most tense she's ever been.

2024
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:54,312
Just sitting while my sister just sat with a strange family in the captain's area.

2025
01:36:56,152 --> 01:36:57,492
And she was everything was fine.

2026
01:36:57,492 --> 01:37:00,172
Yeah, like she was going to get abducted out of a monorail.

2027
01:37:00,472 --> 01:37:01,272
That's what she thought.

2028
01:37:01,292 --> 01:37:03,852
I mean, it was a family. They people had kids like.

2029
01:37:04,312 --> 01:37:06,272
But yeah, my mom was real stressed out about that.

2030
01:37:06,272 --> 01:37:07,172
And that story often.

2031
01:37:07,232 --> 01:37:09,272
But I didn't get to go. My sister did.

2032
01:37:09,572 --> 01:37:12,192
But I wasn't also something I cared that much about.

2033
01:37:12,912 --> 01:37:15,472
And now I would care about it more than I did probably when I was little.

2034
01:37:15,472 --> 01:37:19,272
Oh, my whole family, the four of us got to go up there once

2035
01:37:19,272 --> 01:37:21,592
and ride it demanded.

2036
01:37:21,872 --> 01:37:26,372
I would like no, we were politely asked, probably because I think it held

2037
01:37:26,372 --> 01:37:28,112
for in addition to the captain.

2038
01:37:28,532 --> 01:37:33,612
Of course, now the monorail in Florida is automated.

2039
01:37:33,692 --> 01:37:37,132
There is still a captain in there just to keep an eye on the controls.

2040
01:37:37,572 --> 01:37:41,572
But they have not allowed people to

2041
01:37:41,572 --> 01:37:44,232
guess to ride in that code since the

2042
01:37:44,272 --> 01:37:47,812
2009 accident where two monorails collided, resulting in one death.

2043
01:37:48,492 --> 01:37:49,572
Yeah, no, you can't go up there.

2044
01:37:49,972 --> 01:37:53,652
It's been a rough year for the monorail, but that was that was that was really bad.

2045
01:37:53,732 --> 01:37:56,192
And then there was also this.

2046
01:37:56,552 --> 01:38:01,432
What this is such an insane thing, because like this is was very unfortunate.

2047
01:38:01,532 --> 01:38:03,092
No way anyone could have predicted.

2048
01:38:03,312 --> 01:38:09,152
But like that was when Starbucks was it 2009 or 2014?

2049
01:38:10,312 --> 01:38:13,532
I whenever that incident happened, resulting in the death

2050
01:38:14,252 --> 01:38:19,332
Starbucks, those Starbucks parks mugs had just come out with a little cartoony

2051
01:38:19,332 --> 01:38:20,932
and the monorail on that.

2052
01:38:21,012 --> 01:38:23,952
They had to scrap all those mugs because it was the purple.

2053
01:38:23,972 --> 01:38:25,092
That was 2014.

2054
01:38:25,292 --> 01:38:26,372
And that was 2014.

2055
01:38:26,372 --> 01:38:30,432
Sorry. Then the automation kicked in in a few years before.

2056
01:38:30,532 --> 01:38:33,532
So there were mugs depicting a murderous monorail.

2057
01:38:33,592 --> 01:38:36,812
Yeah. So now eventually they scrapped all those,

2058
01:38:37,172 --> 01:38:38,932
reissued the mugs with a different color on it.

2059
01:38:38,932 --> 01:38:43,192
And then they just totally got rid of the I think was the purple monorail.

2060
01:38:43,192 --> 01:38:47,992
They just changed the colors entirely so that to not be associated with that.

2061
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,852
Right. It's weird.

2062
01:38:48,852 --> 01:38:52,172
It's also just weird because it's like, I guess it makes sense.

2063
01:38:52,212 --> 01:38:53,912
But it's just like, well, that color is gone.

2064
01:38:53,972 --> 01:38:56,432
So don't don't remember that bad incident.

2065
01:38:56,972 --> 01:38:59,112
Is it really is thinking lime?

2066
01:38:59,432 --> 01:39:02,432
You just ride lime, which lime would go on.

2067
01:39:02,552 --> 01:39:04,792
They've all had problems, it seems like.

2068
01:39:04,792 --> 01:39:08,112
I think people are not going to remember the color stripe.

2069
01:39:08,152 --> 01:39:11,332
I think they're going to remember the general incident.

2070
01:39:12,212 --> 01:39:13,712
Yeah. But who knows?

2071
01:39:13,752 --> 01:39:15,572
What do we do with these things?

2072
01:39:15,892 --> 01:39:17,152
The Disneyland one's fine.

2073
01:39:17,272 --> 01:39:19,572
I think Disney World just needs a new fleet.

2074
01:39:19,752 --> 01:39:20,632
It just needs a new fleet.

2075
01:39:20,732 --> 01:39:23,212
I mean, it was brand new when we were children.

2076
01:39:23,632 --> 01:39:27,032
And it's like this is like the longest fleet, I feel like.

2077
01:39:27,092 --> 01:39:28,272
They've just let this go.

2078
01:39:28,352 --> 01:39:29,472
This happens in Florida.

2079
01:39:29,552 --> 01:39:31,432
They let these things go for so long.

2080
01:39:31,792 --> 01:39:34,952
People notice it a lot less because they only go to the parks

2081
01:39:34,952 --> 01:39:36,752
every couple of years down there.

2082
01:39:37,092 --> 01:39:41,172
Yeah. But to the point where you have cough on the door and it explodes off.

2083
01:39:42,792 --> 01:39:46,872
It's getting down the the like slant of Space Mountain.

2084
01:39:47,612 --> 01:39:50,372
I don't know. Is there somebody can somebody make a cheaper monorail

2085
01:39:50,372 --> 01:39:52,272
so we can get more monorail?

2086
01:39:52,312 --> 01:39:56,152
Because it does feel like it just I wish it went everywhere.

2087
01:39:56,412 --> 01:39:57,692
I always did as a kid.

2088
01:39:57,812 --> 01:39:59,852
I was like when we went to MGM for the first time,

2089
01:39:59,852 --> 01:40:02,732
I remember having the question like, well, why doesn't it go here?

2090
01:40:02,912 --> 01:40:05,652
And then why doesn't it go to like, why shouldn't it go everywhere?

2091
01:40:05,712 --> 01:40:08,612
Why shouldn't it be a harder question for your parents to answer

2092
01:40:08,612 --> 01:40:10,932
than why do bad things happen to good people?

2093
01:40:11,092 --> 01:40:13,412
Is there a God or?

2094
01:40:13,412 --> 01:40:15,292
Why does the monorail not go?

2095
01:40:15,612 --> 01:40:19,292
And of course, there weren't great podcasts like this one to speculate.

2096
01:40:19,612 --> 01:40:23,032
And they didn't have the information that this is an incredibly inefficient,

2097
01:40:24,172 --> 01:40:27,632
overpriced mode of transportation that's not caught on with the public.

2098
01:40:27,752 --> 01:40:28,892
It is efficient.

2099
01:40:29,372 --> 01:40:31,492
Like, OK, fair enough how many people ride it every day.

2100
01:40:31,512 --> 01:40:33,232
I think it's the most fair enough.

2101
01:40:33,292 --> 01:40:35,532
It's not the third most used monorail in the world.

2102
01:40:35,692 --> 01:40:37,612
There are other monorails ahead of it,

2103
01:40:37,972 --> 01:40:40,832
but it is very highly used.

2104
01:40:41,332 --> 01:40:42,552
And honestly, it's amazing.

2105
01:40:42,592 --> 01:40:45,612
It's been used that much and lasted that long.

2106
01:40:45,752 --> 01:40:48,272
But like, yeah, you got to get some more monorails in there.

2107
01:40:48,812 --> 01:40:52,312
If they're they should be working on it right now to have new ones

2108
01:40:52,312 --> 01:40:57,952
ready for the 50th anniversary in 2021, because unlike with Richard Nixon,

2109
01:40:58,272 --> 01:41:01,912
now when new monorails are introduced, they test it.

2110
01:41:01,932 --> 01:41:05,652
They put it on the track and test it without people or at least without guests

2111
01:41:06,172 --> 01:41:07,592
for weeks or months.

2112
01:41:07,732 --> 01:41:11,072
They're not like testing it and then like, all right, good to go the next day.

2113
01:41:11,192 --> 01:41:14,232
So we can't put Pence on a experimental.

2114
01:41:14,232 --> 01:41:15,372
No, we cannot.

2115
01:41:16,072 --> 01:41:17,072
Day one of testing.

2116
01:41:17,352 --> 01:41:19,872
Too bad.

2117
01:41:20,392 --> 01:41:23,992
It'll be it'll be thoroughly tested before Mike Pence goes on the new monorail.

2118
01:41:24,012 --> 01:41:28,192
Yeah. And he certainly would not get in a monorail car with strangers.

2119
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:32,212
If he was stuck in a monorail car with a woman who was not his betrothed.

2120
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:34,312
Only mother, only Michael and mother.

2121
01:41:34,312 --> 01:41:36,512
He would he would knock the door off himself.

2122
01:41:36,512 --> 01:41:38,132
He would kick the door off and jump out.

2123
01:41:38,132 --> 01:41:41,912
He's already covered in flop sweat from the shape of that monitor.

2124
01:41:41,952 --> 01:41:45,192
That the phallic nature of the monorail.

2125
01:41:45,552 --> 01:41:47,792
Disney World is a place of hedonism.

2126
01:41:48,232 --> 01:41:52,712
Oh, and the taxpayers are going to have to foot the bill for him to go down there,

2127
01:41:52,712 --> 01:41:55,692
get on the monorail for a second and immediately leave.

2128
01:41:55,972 --> 01:41:57,592
It looks like an offensive penis.

2129
01:41:57,752 --> 01:42:01,432
Well, can you imagine him in the captain's car going into the contemporary?

2130
01:42:01,592 --> 01:42:02,552
No.

2131
01:42:05,512 --> 01:42:06,392
Oh, my.

2132
01:42:06,672 --> 01:42:08,272
And it's stuck. It's going to.

2133
01:42:08,532 --> 01:42:09,412
I don't know what's happening.

2134
01:42:09,452 --> 01:42:13,272
It's going back and forth, back and forth in and out of the contemporary.

2135
01:42:13,272 --> 01:42:16,112
My God. Man, his brain would explode.

2136
01:42:17,292 --> 01:42:21,012
One of the most famous monorail guesses I alluded to earlier, Bob Hope.

2137
01:42:21,152 --> 01:42:22,892
Did anyone watch that? I feel like we've watched.

2138
01:42:23,032 --> 01:42:26,912
Oh, my God. I've watched that a million times from the grand opening special.

2139
01:42:27,252 --> 01:42:29,892
I'll do a whole show on that grand opening.

2140
01:42:30,172 --> 01:42:31,492
I mean, we'll have to do a commentary.

2141
01:42:31,492 --> 01:42:32,652
I love that.

2142
01:42:32,972 --> 01:42:37,112
As they show the monorail go into the contemporary and who gets off it

2143
01:42:37,112 --> 01:42:40,352
with two very young, attractive looking plaids.

2144
01:42:40,592 --> 01:42:41,652
Bob Hope himself.

2145
01:42:41,932 --> 01:42:43,692
Or is he looking plaid?

2146
01:42:44,832 --> 01:42:47,232
So guys, two very attractive young guys.

2147
01:42:48,032 --> 01:42:50,232
Plads. They call them plaids.

2148
01:42:50,352 --> 01:42:52,872
Really? We've talked about the mic.

2149
01:42:52,952 --> 01:42:54,652
Got a plaid when he was down there.

2150
01:42:54,712 --> 01:42:55,412
Yeah. Yeah.

2151
01:42:56,092 --> 01:42:58,052
I think the combination of words.

2152
01:42:58,352 --> 01:43:00,392
Did you get a right? I think you're right.

2153
01:43:00,392 --> 01:43:03,012
I think you're right about them being called plaids.

2154
01:43:03,212 --> 01:43:07,352
But the words you said in this sentence, I think was what made it seem a little strange.

2155
01:43:07,372 --> 01:43:08,732
Sounds racist or something.

2156
01:43:09,512 --> 01:43:13,712
As a partially Scottish person, I'm offended by the use of the word plaids.

2157
01:43:14,192 --> 01:43:16,612
You know, to me, it sounded like people calling me a dirty plaid.

2158
01:43:16,852 --> 01:43:21,112
To me, it sounded like imagine like a crazy like a bar, a guy in a bar being like,

2159
01:43:21,452 --> 01:43:23,432
look at those attractive plaids over there.

2160
01:43:23,792 --> 01:43:24,732
Like that's too attractive.

2161
01:43:25,252 --> 01:43:26,032
Well, plaids are in general neutral.

2162
01:43:26,132 --> 01:43:27,252
I meant it to mean guides.

2163
01:43:28,352 --> 01:43:29,752
Anyway, back on track.

2164
01:43:30,632 --> 01:43:35,812
So he gets off the monorail and onto a platform that no longer exists,

2165
01:43:35,972 --> 01:43:41,292
clearly built for this and has like stairs and a handrail that he is holding on,

2166
01:43:41,292 --> 01:43:46,592
doing some very lazy jokes into for an audience of the oldest people

2167
01:43:46,592 --> 01:43:49,192
I have ever seen on film, like the cutaways.

2168
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:51,272
Everyone looks a million years old.

2169
01:43:51,292 --> 01:43:52,732
It's shot in such a strange way.

2170
01:43:52,812 --> 01:43:57,112
I can't really tell if they're really reacting to the jokes or that was just shot

2171
01:43:57,112 --> 01:43:59,672
without an audience. Like there's some things weird about that.

2172
01:43:59,832 --> 01:44:03,192
I think there was an audience there, but there's some just the way it's edited.

2173
01:44:03,432 --> 01:44:04,252
It is very odd.

2174
01:44:04,412 --> 01:44:08,152
Well, they also keep doing cutaways to the the balconies,

2175
01:44:08,472 --> 01:44:11,052
the the hallway balconies inside the contemporary.

2176
01:44:11,152 --> 01:44:14,012
And you can kind of see people, but not well.

2177
01:44:14,292 --> 01:44:18,972
So it just looks like it's shots of an empty hotel interior.

2178
01:44:19,072 --> 01:44:22,812
We've all done we've all done live comedy, especially you guys.

2179
01:44:22,912 --> 01:44:23,912
And it does.

2180
01:44:23,912 --> 01:44:26,072
You could probably attest to that.

2181
01:44:26,072 --> 01:44:31,412
So the probably not the greatest acoustic situation to do a comedy show

2182
01:44:31,412 --> 01:44:37,312
in a gigantic atrium where some of your audience is 90 feet above you

2183
01:44:37,312 --> 01:44:40,252
and others are on stairs way below you.

2184
01:44:40,252 --> 01:44:42,972
Not the optimal. No, no, no.

2185
01:44:43,092 --> 01:44:45,032
You see, B3 will be in the center.

2186
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:48,132
The way they edit it, there's way too many applause breaks.

2187
01:44:48,132 --> 01:44:53,092
We were the quality of like, well, he paints at the Mary Blair mural

2188
01:44:53,092 --> 01:44:57,552
and he goes, wow, when John Wayne Doodle, John Wayne Doodle,

2189
01:44:57,852 --> 01:45:00,172
he really and John Wayne Payne's he really paints.

2190
01:45:00,192 --> 01:45:02,752
So like I also want to go back real quick.

2191
01:45:02,832 --> 01:45:07,032
He sends the plaids away and he goes, meet me in Adventureland, girls.

2192
01:45:07,252 --> 01:45:09,872
And you're like, yeah, super creepy.

2193
01:45:10,452 --> 01:45:15,152
I will say he he had a there was a solid joke in there

2194
01:45:15,152 --> 01:45:18,572
because he talks about going up to his room and Donald Duck is there

2195
01:45:18,572 --> 01:45:21,832
in the or sharing a bathtub with Donald Duck.

2196
01:45:21,832 --> 01:45:26,212
And he says, you ever tried bathing with a duck who was playing with a rubber man?

2197
01:45:26,512 --> 01:45:28,692
Which is kind of funny.

2198
01:45:28,752 --> 01:45:29,692
That's pretty funny.

2199
01:45:29,752 --> 01:45:33,592
It's like, oh, yeah, by that, if if Bob had a rubber duck,

2200
01:45:33,672 --> 01:45:35,052
I understand that would have a rough.

2201
01:45:35,192 --> 01:45:39,572
It's an upsetting image similar to the tangerine sausage.

2202
01:45:40,992 --> 01:45:43,752
Did he buy it seems to me like he didn't care about the answer.

2203
01:45:43,832 --> 01:45:48,592
Did he pull each audience member and ask if they had tried to take a bath with the

2204
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:51,332
I know, because many of them had already fallen asleep.

2205
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:57,292
Or we're putting diet during an aspirin under their tongue just in case because that

2206
01:45:57,292 --> 01:46:01,352
yeah, so he there's a little bit of monorail stuff in there.

2207
01:46:01,452 --> 01:46:03,112
It's it's a really weird.

2208
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:04,912
Unless you did you have more sorry, I don't want to cut off.

2209
01:46:04,932 --> 01:46:06,792
You want to tell us the whole routine?

2210
01:46:07,192 --> 01:46:09,232
No, I do. It is funny to me.

2211
01:46:09,232 --> 01:46:11,012
The idea is doing a whole special bit.

2212
01:46:11,012 --> 01:46:12,652
Oh, I guess the right job.

2213
01:46:12,732 --> 01:46:14,432
Hope comedy routine.

2214
01:46:14,572 --> 01:46:16,752
They're just kind of this place is so big.

2215
01:46:16,812 --> 01:46:20,192
By the time you cross the lobby, your luggage stickers have faded.

2216
01:46:21,932 --> 01:46:23,612
It's OK. It's all right.

2217
01:46:23,612 --> 01:46:24,552
I don't know.

2218
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:28,172
You like the rubber duck one, but you don't like the faded.

2219
01:46:28,652 --> 01:46:31,012
I think that's at least a standard old joke.

2220
01:46:31,132 --> 01:46:34,672
I think some of the other ones are just like barely a premise.

2221
01:46:35,172 --> 01:46:37,952
Yeah, I get that. At least it's a simple premise.

2222
01:46:38,172 --> 01:46:39,532
It's clear. It makes sense.

2223
01:46:39,532 --> 01:46:42,012
This is a big place. And oh, my gosh, it takes so long.

2224
01:46:42,172 --> 01:46:43,532
OK, got it done.

2225
01:46:43,812 --> 01:46:46,192
Here's one. He says something about fantasy land.

2226
01:46:46,392 --> 01:46:48,932
He goes fantasy. You do have all the jokes written down.

2227
01:46:48,932 --> 01:46:51,032
I have some. Fantasyland.

2228
01:46:51,032 --> 01:46:53,232
He's not even on the monorail in this.

2229
01:46:53,432 --> 01:46:55,032
This is just contemporary.

2230
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:58,892
Yeah, you know what? You talk about episode division.

2231
01:46:58,972 --> 01:47:01,712
I think this is clearly contemporary material.

2232
01:47:02,532 --> 01:47:04,152
I agree. This is contemporary.

2233
01:47:04,172 --> 01:47:06,692
We'll return. This is the post credits card.

2234
01:47:06,932 --> 01:47:08,532
More of the routine.

2235
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:11,552
Yeah, but it is how exciting for a stand up routine to begin

2236
01:47:11,552 --> 01:47:13,732
with the person being delivered on a monorail.

2237
01:47:13,772 --> 01:47:16,472
Yeah, fantastic. Yeah, that part is great.

2238
01:47:16,472 --> 01:47:19,652
If only all stand up routines began with experimental

2239
01:47:19,652 --> 01:47:23,612
transportation, like landing with a with a jet pack or fantastic.

2240
01:47:23,872 --> 01:47:25,872
Yeah, with a big crazy propeller machine.

2241
01:47:26,312 --> 01:47:27,792
Trump should have when he announced the presidency

2242
01:47:27,792 --> 01:47:30,032
should have gotten off a monorail and gotten on the escalator

2243
01:47:30,032 --> 01:47:32,652
or whatever the hell when he was in his Trump Tower.

2244
01:47:32,912 --> 01:47:36,072
That famous. That was kind of similar in a way to the Pope routine,

2245
01:47:36,232 --> 01:47:38,652
like the strangest entrance you could make to a speech.

2246
01:47:38,692 --> 01:47:39,952
Poorly staged.

2247
01:47:40,632 --> 01:47:42,772
There's no good way to shoot it.

2248
01:47:43,212 --> 01:47:46,192
Yeah. And Bob Hope also did a chunk about

2249
01:47:46,192 --> 01:47:48,152
Mexicans being rapists and thieves.

2250
01:47:48,152 --> 01:47:50,152
Yeah, that was a quick, quick thing.

2251
01:47:50,372 --> 01:47:53,072
They cut that from air, but right there in person.

2252
01:47:53,072 --> 01:47:54,532
It played well live. Mm hmm.

2253
01:47:54,612 --> 01:47:59,932
I'll say that in terms of old entertainers phoning it in,

2254
01:48:00,412 --> 01:48:04,212
I I'm definitely a Dean Martin man myself, like like Dean Martin

2255
01:48:04,212 --> 01:48:07,032
about to fall over half delivering dialogues.

2256
01:48:07,852 --> 01:48:12,032
Delightful. I agree with you that I Dean Martin is better than Bob Hope.

2257
01:48:12,332 --> 01:48:14,232
Yeah. Hmm. I guess so.

2258
01:48:14,272 --> 01:48:16,892
I don't know. We're ranking her old time entertainers.

2259
01:48:16,932 --> 01:48:18,552
Now let's rank. Yeah.

2260
01:48:18,552 --> 01:48:20,632
But where does Joey Bishop fall?

2261
01:48:21,252 --> 01:48:22,812
Low. Oh, low. I think so.

2262
01:48:22,952 --> 01:48:25,472
Yeah. Unfortunately tied with Peter Loughford.

2263
01:48:26,032 --> 01:48:29,612
I was making Lindsay's mom and sister watch videos of Sammy Davis Jr.

2264
01:48:29,812 --> 01:48:32,972
do Mr. Bojangles over the Thanksgiving break. Sure.

2265
01:48:33,292 --> 01:48:34,972
As funny or were they just nice?

2266
01:48:35,072 --> 01:48:37,412
Did you want to like nice move them?

2267
01:48:37,872 --> 01:48:39,992
Oh, they were very confused. Why?

2268
01:48:40,432 --> 01:48:42,452
They were. I was like, well, I just sort of started

2269
01:48:42,452 --> 01:48:44,072
watching these videos the other day and I.

2270
01:48:44,072 --> 01:48:45,732
Wait, we need Thanksgiving entertainment.

2271
01:48:45,992 --> 01:48:48,652
Have I got the thing for you? I will say this.

2272
01:48:49,432 --> 01:48:50,552
They were like kind of non.

2273
01:48:50,692 --> 01:48:52,812
They were not interested in that and the Sammy Davis.

2274
01:48:52,992 --> 01:48:55,152
But then Lindsay was like, well, put on because because they had

2275
01:48:55,152 --> 01:48:59,452
we had done a whole like couple days of mostly them picking movies and watching.

2276
01:48:59,572 --> 01:49:01,772
And they're like, well, because I was like, look, what I like to do

2277
01:49:01,772 --> 01:49:04,332
is just get YouTube up and just roll through videos.

2278
01:49:04,472 --> 01:49:07,912
And after the few Sammy Davis, Lindsay was like, well, show them what you

2279
01:49:07,912 --> 01:49:09,212
usually would do. And I go, all right.

2280
01:49:09,212 --> 01:49:11,192
And then I went right to freak like me.

2281
01:49:12,432 --> 01:49:14,052
The Spider-Man, Letterman performance.

2282
01:49:14,572 --> 01:49:17,592
And they were much more into it than the Sammy Davis Jr.

2283
01:49:18,152 --> 01:49:20,352
They were very key, like they were paying attention.

2284
01:49:21,092 --> 01:49:23,112
Funny. So they wait.

2285
01:49:23,572 --> 01:49:25,532
Also, several Sammy Davis performances.

2286
01:49:25,812 --> 01:49:28,272
There's a couple. I mean, that was one of his signature songs.

2287
01:49:28,832 --> 01:49:30,152
Several of the same song.

2288
01:49:30,372 --> 01:49:32,132
Well, the banter changes.

2289
01:49:32,472 --> 01:49:33,632
Got the banter changes.

2290
01:49:33,952 --> 01:49:34,512
The banter changes.

2291
01:49:34,732 --> 01:49:36,592
It's like the Genie in the Aladdin musical.

2292
01:49:36,852 --> 01:49:37,332
I can't remember.

2293
01:49:37,332 --> 01:49:39,212
This one is facing stage right here.

2294
01:49:39,232 --> 01:49:43,292
Look, it was just like two different performances, I think.

2295
01:49:43,292 --> 01:49:46,112
So we're talking all time.

2296
01:49:46,472 --> 01:49:49,572
Well, Jason's not the only weird maniac on this show.

2297
01:49:49,852 --> 01:49:50,812
That's never we've never.

2298
01:49:51,332 --> 01:49:52,052
We've never.

2299
01:49:52,092 --> 01:49:54,412
We haven't made that the most clear in this.

2300
01:49:54,432 --> 01:49:55,912
There's no disputing that.

2301
01:49:56,432 --> 01:49:56,832
Yeah, yeah.

2302
01:49:57,392 --> 01:49:58,652
I'm over. I'm over here.

2303
01:49:58,652 --> 01:50:01,192
I'm over your orgasming at neon.

2304
01:50:01,432 --> 01:50:03,612
And Mr. Bojangles and Max Pass is my.

2305
01:50:03,892 --> 01:50:06,252
So what else?

2306
01:50:06,252 --> 01:50:06,872
What else?

2307
01:50:06,872 --> 01:50:07,632
To this episode?

2308
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:13,132
I don't. Well, in terms of plot, this might be the easiest plus up.

2309
01:50:13,832 --> 01:50:17,532
Florida, please stop making the monorail a death trap.

2310
01:50:17,532 --> 01:50:20,972
Please, please order new monorails.

2311
01:50:21,172 --> 01:50:23,032
Disneyland. Keep up the good work.

2312
01:50:23,152 --> 01:50:24,152
I feel like we haven't had.

2313
01:50:24,252 --> 01:50:29,412
I mean, yeah, any transportation, buses, cars, planes, monorail,

2314
01:50:29,612 --> 01:50:31,472
anything's going to have incidents.

2315
01:50:31,472 --> 01:50:36,932
And it is like there has surprisingly not been that many deaths

2316
01:50:36,932 --> 01:50:41,952
or major injuries on these things that run every day for decades.

2317
01:50:42,352 --> 01:50:45,532
Mm hmm. I all I want is more and new.

2318
01:50:45,532 --> 01:50:47,412
I want more in Florida.

2319
01:50:47,572 --> 01:50:49,532
I don't think it's ever going to happen now.

2320
01:50:49,972 --> 01:50:52,132
They've obviously gone different ways with the transportation.

2321
01:50:52,172 --> 01:50:53,992
I just want more and new ones.

2322
01:50:54,152 --> 01:50:56,372
I mean, yeah, I don't know.

2323
01:50:56,492 --> 01:50:56,992
There's nothing else.

2324
01:50:57,032 --> 01:50:59,492
But I think in the meantime, let's not.

2325
01:50:59,612 --> 01:51:00,512
Why not?

2326
01:51:00,972 --> 01:51:04,412
Like we could just quietly retire these death machines

2327
01:51:04,412 --> 01:51:09,292
that are currently operating, or we can send them down with a big Viking funeral.

2328
01:51:09,292 --> 01:51:12,292
We can start trying to crank these babies to 80 miles an hour.

2329
01:51:12,752 --> 01:51:14,952
Let's see. Let's see how fast they can go.

2330
01:51:14,992 --> 01:51:16,392
Let's see how crazy we can get.

2331
01:51:16,692 --> 01:51:17,792
Let's start racing them.

2332
01:51:17,792 --> 01:51:19,272
Let's see how many laps you can do.

2333
01:51:19,572 --> 01:51:20,332
Oh, yeah, that's great.

2334
01:51:20,372 --> 01:51:23,432
Monorail races. Yeah, I will.

2335
01:51:23,812 --> 01:51:26,592
I think they should give.

2336
01:51:26,772 --> 01:51:29,512
They should have new monorails for the 50th anniversary.

2337
01:51:29,712 --> 01:51:31,212
Like that's such a given to me.

2338
01:51:31,252 --> 01:51:34,212
And it's crazy to me that that's not like been announced.

2339
01:51:34,512 --> 01:51:35,192
As far as we know, yeah.

2340
01:51:35,352 --> 01:51:40,452
With the old ones, I think they should clear the routes

2341
01:51:40,452 --> 01:51:43,692
and clear the parks before and after hours

2342
01:51:43,692 --> 01:51:47,892
and give them over to the jackass guys and just see what happens.

2343
01:51:47,912 --> 01:51:49,732
The jackass guys just run.

2344
01:51:50,032 --> 01:51:53,712
Just if we're sending them out in a Viking funeral, who better?

2345
01:51:53,992 --> 01:51:55,852
Do you want Steve? Oh, a 50 year old.

2346
01:51:55,852 --> 01:51:57,772
I want Johnny Knoxville to.

2347
01:51:57,812 --> 01:51:58,792
They're all old.

2348
01:51:59,172 --> 01:52:02,952
You want skateboarders to pilot around broken trains?

2349
01:52:03,892 --> 01:52:07,812
I want to get you ram the monorail into the wonders of life building.

2350
01:52:08,412 --> 01:52:11,392
It's barely being used if we're going to start fresh on it.

2351
01:52:11,832 --> 01:52:12,632
Let's set it down.

2352
01:52:12,872 --> 01:52:14,432
They're going to get some stuff.

2353
01:52:14,552 --> 01:52:16,552
Get it to jump off the track.

2354
01:52:16,552 --> 01:52:19,072
Maybe maybe Ollie off of.

2355
01:52:19,192 --> 01:52:22,412
I don't really know skateboarding like bounce off the wonders of life building.

2356
01:52:22,612 --> 01:52:22,912
I don't know.

2357
01:52:22,912 --> 01:52:26,192
Believe me, I, as you know, I love that a lot of Epcot.

2358
01:52:26,272 --> 01:52:30,632
But if you could get the monorail, the monorail to just impale spaceship

2359
01:52:30,632 --> 01:52:32,992
earth worth it. Cool.

2360
01:52:33,132 --> 01:52:35,692
Blow it up. I'm there for that.

2361
01:52:36,812 --> 01:52:41,372
Couldn't we get like the impractical jokers, somebody younger that, you know,

2362
01:52:41,752 --> 01:52:43,292
but they don't put themselves in physical.

2363
01:52:43,312 --> 01:52:44,312
That's true. You're right.

2364
01:52:44,552 --> 01:52:48,072
They can come to jokers X jackass.

2365
01:52:48,272 --> 01:52:49,712
Mm hmm. This is a hit.

2366
01:52:49,752 --> 01:52:52,892
This will run on cable every hour of every day.

2367
01:52:52,892 --> 01:52:57,332
But they're going to compete specifically with monorail related hijinks.

2368
01:52:58,132 --> 01:53:00,292
I don't see why not.

2369
01:53:00,812 --> 01:53:02,892
Jokers is very popular on cable.

2370
01:53:03,212 --> 01:53:04,292
Very popular. Very popular.

2371
01:53:04,292 --> 01:53:06,632
We show on cable, I believe.

2372
01:53:06,672 --> 01:53:10,372
If you put on like, you know, you put on TV land,

2373
01:53:10,532 --> 01:53:15,552
it's just a footage of a mirror playing a play, playing true TV

2374
01:53:15,552 --> 01:53:17,632
speed of impractical jokers.

2375
01:53:17,632 --> 01:53:19,712
Highest very highly rated.

2376
01:53:20,192 --> 01:53:22,312
Sal Q, all the gang.

2377
01:53:22,892 --> 01:53:24,412
We know the names.

2378
01:53:25,112 --> 01:53:26,752
Wig wag. Yeah.

2379
01:53:26,752 --> 01:53:27,552
All of them.

2380
01:53:28,032 --> 01:53:30,872
You know what? I have one more nice little monorail thought,

2381
01:53:30,932 --> 01:53:33,652
which is that do you guys recall if the if all right,

2382
01:53:33,692 --> 01:53:38,312
if there was an origin story of us not becoming the serial killers we are today,

2383
01:53:38,392 --> 01:53:41,972
but showing our cards of insanity,

2384
01:53:42,032 --> 01:53:46,912
do you guys recall the moment where Mike, you got that you got us this hookup

2385
01:53:46,912 --> 01:53:50,552
via somebody who knew you from recognize you from screen junkies to go tour

2386
01:53:51,092 --> 01:53:51,612
engineering.

2387
01:53:51,772 --> 01:53:55,872
Oh, and I didn't know Jason very well then, but you invited all of us

2388
01:53:55,872 --> 01:53:58,972
as the as the Disney, the Disney freaks.

2389
01:53:59,012 --> 01:54:04,192
And we we rounded a corner up until that point.

2390
01:54:04,392 --> 01:54:07,332
The Disney Imagineering building, you know, we were so excited to be there,

2391
01:54:07,332 --> 01:54:09,312
but there wasn't anything like jaw dropping.

2392
01:54:09,552 --> 01:54:11,852
And it's just it's it's an office and it's fine.

2393
01:54:11,852 --> 01:54:16,032
And then at some point you round a corner and the hallway is a monorail.

2394
01:54:16,032 --> 01:54:17,832
You are inside a monorail.

2395
01:54:17,832 --> 01:54:22,792
And we all like, oh, it was the most embarrassing display

2396
01:54:22,792 --> 01:54:24,312
for a bunch of grown men to do.

2397
01:54:24,692 --> 01:54:30,272
And the the the woman who had you gave you the hookup was like,

2398
01:54:30,452 --> 01:54:37,792
oh, she was like weirded out by our collective shrieks at the monorail hallway.

2399
01:54:38,072 --> 01:54:39,752
But hey, I stand by it.

2400
01:54:39,792 --> 01:54:43,752
And I like passing that info to the listener that there's a frigging monorail

2401
01:54:43,752 --> 01:54:47,412
hallway. Yes. Well, she did ask, do you guys want to see the monorail hallway?

2402
01:54:47,452 --> 01:54:48,492
And probably more.

2403
01:54:48,492 --> 01:54:49,792
No, I think that was it. She did.

2404
01:54:49,992 --> 01:54:52,652
No, no, no. That's I think the monorail hallway was just a normal.

2405
01:54:52,812 --> 01:54:54,392
The way we had to go that way anyway.

2406
01:54:54,412 --> 01:54:55,352
I think she's talking.

2407
01:54:55,512 --> 01:54:57,392
I don't think it was announced. That's why we.

2408
01:54:57,492 --> 01:54:58,412
Yeah, yeah. It was not.

2409
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:01,312
You're thinking of there was another hallway that just had pictures

2410
01:55:01,312 --> 01:55:02,912
of imagineers on the wall.

2411
01:55:03,032 --> 01:55:05,772
And she said, well, yeah, you want to go down that hallway.

2412
01:55:05,952 --> 01:55:07,092
It's got some pictures of imagineer.

2413
01:55:07,172 --> 01:55:08,812
And we went, oh, yes, please.

2414
01:55:09,192 --> 01:55:11,792
Yeah. And then she was like, and then we're like, oh, look over there.

2415
01:55:11,932 --> 01:55:13,612
It's it's Tony Baxter on the wall.

2416
01:55:13,612 --> 01:55:16,512
And there's Bob Kerr and there's like Marty Sklar.

2417
01:55:16,512 --> 01:55:17,832
And then she was like, huh?

2418
01:55:18,852 --> 01:55:22,212
I will say, though, when I first walked in the building,

2419
01:55:22,272 --> 01:55:25,232
I was enchanted because like a newsroom,

2420
01:55:25,332 --> 01:55:29,672
they had clocks with all the times of the world, like world like, you know,

2421
01:55:29,732 --> 01:55:33,752
and in newsrooms, it's usually like New York, London, Paris, all that.

2422
01:55:33,972 --> 01:55:39,572
But they had it for Anaheim, Orlando, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo.

2423
01:55:39,852 --> 01:55:41,052
And just delightful.

2424
01:55:41,252 --> 01:55:44,692
I was delighted by these very simple store bought clocks.

2425
01:55:44,692 --> 01:55:47,292
Mm hmm. So you were also delighted by the cafeteria.

2426
01:55:47,532 --> 01:55:49,612
Yep. Which was a normal cafeteria.

2427
01:55:50,072 --> 01:55:51,312
Yeah. Yeah.

2428
01:55:51,312 --> 01:55:53,892
You insisted on getting a sandwich and I had to pull you out of there.

2429
01:55:53,892 --> 01:55:55,152
You didn't let me get it.

2430
01:55:55,212 --> 01:55:56,592
She's like, she's got to get back to work.

2431
01:55:56,612 --> 01:55:58,212
And I'm like, she's still ordering her coffee.

2432
01:55:58,332 --> 01:55:59,692
I never did get the sandwich.

2433
01:55:59,972 --> 01:56:02,132
That's one of the craziest things I've ever seen.

2434
01:56:02,592 --> 01:56:04,032
Were you trying to get that sandwich?

2435
01:56:04,412 --> 01:56:06,012
Yeah, you're no way.

2436
01:56:06,232 --> 01:56:07,832
No, no way.

2437
01:56:07,952 --> 01:56:09,792
I am 100 percent right about this.

2438
01:56:10,312 --> 01:56:12,312
She wasted so much time in the gift shop.

2439
01:56:12,452 --> 01:56:13,412
She was to be nice enough.

2440
01:56:13,412 --> 01:56:16,252
We had spent like an hour and 15 and she was like,

2441
01:56:16,332 --> 01:56:17,952
Oh, can I go get a sandwich?

2442
01:56:18,132 --> 01:56:19,892
And she's like, yeah, sure.

2443
01:56:19,892 --> 01:56:22,912
And then like you're waiting in line and I'm like, no, she has to go to work.

2444
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:24,612
She was still in line for her thing.

2445
01:56:24,732 --> 01:56:26,992
You know what? No, there's no way.

2446
01:56:27,412 --> 01:56:28,912
The punchiest episode.

2447
01:56:28,912 --> 01:56:30,952
There's no way of the podcast.

2448
01:56:31,492 --> 01:56:33,832
And I I hate to say it.

2449
01:56:33,972 --> 01:56:35,812
I'm sorry, I went mic on this one.

2450
01:56:35,812 --> 01:56:38,452
Of course. The rules of society.

2451
01:56:38,472 --> 01:56:41,072
That was my memory. The rules of society.

2452
01:56:42,332 --> 01:56:42,672
Polite society.

2453
01:56:43,292 --> 01:56:46,252
The the look that was my lunch break, too.

2454
01:56:46,272 --> 01:56:47,772
I had to get back to work. I had to eat.

2455
01:56:48,032 --> 01:56:48,912
You were late.

2456
01:56:49,412 --> 01:56:50,592
You were late coming.

2457
01:56:50,852 --> 01:56:52,292
You were late coming there.

2458
01:56:52,612 --> 01:56:54,072
No, I walked. You were late.

2459
01:56:54,152 --> 01:56:56,532
I walked up to the entrance with her.

2460
01:56:56,532 --> 01:56:58,652
We parted. She was coming from the.

2461
01:56:58,932 --> 01:57:03,452
I declare you were late because we were supposed to be there time.

2462
01:57:03,672 --> 01:57:05,452
And Andrew Scott and I were there.

2463
01:57:05,752 --> 01:57:07,612
And she our guide wasn't there yet.

2464
01:57:07,612 --> 01:57:08,772
I walked in the same time.

2465
01:57:08,892 --> 01:57:09,912
Oh, my God.

2466
01:57:10,032 --> 01:57:12,632
Because I was messaging her when everybody was there.

2467
01:57:13,152 --> 01:57:15,152
So I said, well, you know, we must well start.

2468
01:57:15,352 --> 01:57:16,072
Hopefully, Jason gets there.

2469
01:57:16,132 --> 01:57:19,812
And then I remember we saw you park and we saw you walk the wrong way

2470
01:57:19,812 --> 01:57:21,372
down the street a few blocks.

2471
01:57:21,372 --> 01:57:24,552
And we're like, no, he's going the wrong way.

2472
01:57:25,172 --> 01:57:28,512
Well, you know, sometimes the door falls off your vehicle.

2473
01:57:28,692 --> 01:57:30,372
Sometimes you just go the wrong way.

2474
01:57:30,492 --> 01:57:32,672
We all have little oopsies.

2475
01:57:33,432 --> 01:57:37,192
Little oopsies for a monorail or a human being.

2476
01:57:38,052 --> 01:57:43,232
I think if I don't say we survive podcast the riot now, we might not.

2477
01:57:43,292 --> 01:57:44,512
Yeah, we got out. Oh, yeah.

2478
01:57:44,512 --> 01:57:46,172
We better get out. I'm exhausted

2479
01:57:46,172 --> 01:57:49,552
before we end up in fisticuffs.

2480
01:57:50,332 --> 01:57:52,552
But and you the listeners survive as well.

2481
01:57:52,552 --> 01:57:53,872
Thanks so much.

2482
01:57:53,952 --> 01:57:58,072
If you enjoyed this version and this trip on the highway,

2483
01:57:58,332 --> 01:58:02,452
in your ears, that doesn't really line up.

2484
01:58:02,452 --> 01:58:04,292
Hey, let's all here.

2485
01:58:04,292 --> 01:58:05,412
I'll plug the things now.

2486
01:58:06,252 --> 01:58:10,812
Go to go follow Sanch where an Instagram and check out the Patreon

2487
01:58:10,812 --> 01:58:13,812
at Patreon dot com slash podcast The Ride.

2488
01:58:13,892 --> 01:58:17,152
I think we've recently done one about the tortilla factory.

2489
01:58:17,612 --> 01:58:22,372
So yes, if you're still on the edge of your seat from our monorail journey

2490
01:58:22,372 --> 01:58:26,472
and you want to hear about the old mission, you factory like another

2491
01:58:26,472 --> 01:58:30,472
shocking episode to two shocking episodes back to back.

2492
01:58:30,472 --> 01:58:33,452
What is the I guess that it's that there are some shocks in there.

2493
01:58:33,452 --> 01:58:34,452
Sure. Absolutely.

2494
01:58:36,052 --> 01:58:38,972
Yeah. So more shocks await behind the second gate.

2495
01:58:38,992 --> 01:58:40,952
Yeah. And did I miss anything?

2496
01:58:41,112 --> 01:58:42,272
Mm no. I don't know.

2497
01:58:42,352 --> 01:58:46,212
T public shirts, whatever, you know, you got, you know, you guys know.

2498
01:58:46,312 --> 01:58:52,312
And if there's real demand for checky leaks, please let us know.

2499
01:58:52,772 --> 01:58:53,732
I bet there is.

2500
01:58:53,732 --> 01:58:57,192
I bet there's like five listeners that are like, yeah, I would do that.

2501
01:58:57,192 --> 01:58:59,932
Yes. And I like Mr.

2502
01:59:00,152 --> 01:59:02,852
Owlweg, a wealthy Swedish industrialist.

2503
01:59:02,932 --> 01:59:08,332
And I yes, I can pay you five hundred dollars a month to plan my Disney days for me.

2504
01:59:08,472 --> 01:59:11,992
It's like I was a ghost kind of guiding their hands while they're at the park

2505
01:59:11,992 --> 01:59:12,892
and they're on the app.

2506
01:59:12,952 --> 01:59:14,872
So like I would be there with you in spirit.

2507
01:59:14,932 --> 01:59:16,872
So think about that when you're thinking about how much money

2508
01:59:16,872 --> 01:59:17,812
you would pay me to do this.

2509
01:59:17,932 --> 01:59:21,692
Imagine getting on a ride and Mike is kind of massaging your hands

2510
01:59:21,692 --> 01:59:26,132
and just play an unchained melody in your head.

2511
01:59:27,572 --> 01:59:28,492
As it happens.

2512
01:59:28,812 --> 01:59:30,432
Or the yeah, yeah.

2513
01:59:30,652 --> 01:59:32,052
Well, we're done. We're good.

2514
01:59:32,052 --> 01:59:34,132
There was only one set of footprints.

2515
01:59:34,212 --> 01:59:35,752
That's what Mike was carrying.

2516
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:42,412
Mike was signing up, signing me up for the 110 Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin.

2517
01:59:42,412 --> 01:59:46,192
All right. Let's get it.

2518
01:59:46,512 --> 01:59:46,692
Yeah.

2519
01:59:47,752 --> 01:59:53,492
