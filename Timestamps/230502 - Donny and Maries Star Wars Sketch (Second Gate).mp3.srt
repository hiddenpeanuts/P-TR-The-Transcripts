1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
May the third be with you.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's the Star Wars-esque day here on Pod gets the Ride.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The second gate. I of course am Ben Scott Gerdneros.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You got it. Joined by Michael Carl Rissian.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I like that, that's good.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And, okay. Alright, I'm just gonna try it.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And of course, Jace Sheridindoo.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, Mace Windu.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I was like, should it just be Jace Windu?

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But then there's not enough of the real name. I don't think.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't know. Look, these are up for grabs. The Supremacist is new.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We've only ever done the Halloween names. But why not?

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We're sort of making a tradition. I think we've loosely done May the fourth week episodes.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Star Wars names seems like... So if you got a better one, or you give me one down the road, Jason, we'll make sure you're hooked up.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I gotta look at the list of the Podracer names.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you want me to list them? For the first time in my life.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, yeah, go for it.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So Bulba, Juan Sandage, Team Toppa Galeys.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Jason Sandage? I don't know if I like that many better.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, no.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Something was weird about yours. But Jace I thought worked fine.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, there's gotta be... Yeah, whatever. We'll figure it out.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Look, we're workshopping. But I think that's it. Look, I think we can keep doing that every year too.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Assuming that there are any more. They just might have to get a lot more tortured. And we're okay with that.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But I like that we've been doing these little Star Wars things. And I think it's perfect here today because it brought us to the...

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I think maybe one of the key pieces of Star Wars mythos, the 12 minute Donnie and Marie Star Wars sketch.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're so on topic.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Right. This is one of the most famous ones. All seriousness, I feel like this deserves more attention versus the holiday special.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Which definitely has the crown of Star Wars crap of this era.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But this is a stalwart piece of Star Wars crap, certainly. And I was less so... I maybe had seen this once a long time ago.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, but this is... I almost think maybe... There's an argument to be made that this is better Star Wars crap than the holiday special?

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I think, well, there's... You know what? The brevity, I think, helps. I think that it packs it all in.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It feels a little more on brand, oddly.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes, it does.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Despite not having the full actual cast. Only some of the actual cast.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Some of the actual cast.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Which is pretty impressive.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is Lucasfilm approved, I saw.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Wow.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And that's why they were able to get real R2-D2 and C-3PO in there. They don't look cheap.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is completely the suits, yes. For a show that you know would do crappy suits. Of course they would.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But then you see real C-3PO and R2-D2 come out.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You know, to that end, this happened before the holiday special. I think at least a year before. This is in the year of Star Wars.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Right.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Star Wars is at the top of the summer and this is at the end, September of 77. This is way before the Muppet Show with Mark Hamill.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Which is probably the most legitimate end of Star Wars variety.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Which is an area that if you can imagine we're all interested in.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So it's a little low-key important, I think. I think I'm with you on your premise completely, Mike.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, and it is also like I was just looking into it and like George Lucas, like it was a request perhaps.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can't tell if Donnie's making this up or not because Donnie talking about this because like Donnie hosted like a Force Awakens screening when it came back because he's such a big Star Wars fan and he feels like they're a part of it.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Because they were one of the first big places to promote essentially Star Wars.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He claims he was like asked by George Lucas to do it because they had a big like audience of kids.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, that is true.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That he was asked or they were kids.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, no, that they had a very big like young audience. I read a thing about that Donnie Marie show of like when it was confirmed that Donnie was dating someone officially there was like a steep drop off.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, of course.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Of young women watching.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's the famous thing where you pretend like when Homer becomes a star and the B-sharps and his manager tells him he has to pretend he's single because women want to have sex with you.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We want them to think they can and he explains it to Marge and she's upset.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So, and yeah.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Now I feel like now we I feel like the culture is different.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Now I think we stan our relationships.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I think we we make our fan cams and we we celebrate and I mean me I make fan cams of all of my favorite celeb you couples.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Uh huh.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I made so many of Taylor Swift and that guy I need not say.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I won't say his name anymore in fact being that he's out of the picture.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You moved on to Chalamet and Kardashian though.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's your new fan.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Is that one real?

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What? Is it really?

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
A Kardashian. I forget which Kardashian.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Could be any of them.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay. Well we need to figure out who it is because so Scott gets more invested.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is it Kim?

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I know the names of the Kardashians but I'm not sure which ones are dating who.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Meanwhile who's next for Pete Davidson?

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Marie Osmond?

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This guy dates everybody in Hollywood and next Utah.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Could be.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh God.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He's dating the big asteroid worm from Empire Strikes Back.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Typical.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We saw her at the Knicks game with him.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Sorry it's Kylie Jenner and TimothÃ©e Chalamet.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's sure good.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Alright.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well a scoop from our gossip correspondent.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's right.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Cub reporter.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Cub reporter specializing in gossip.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I have on some like email spamming thing.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I got signed up for the Elite Daily newsletter and it's terrible and I have not unsubscribed.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because I like seeing which of my zodiac symbols or which Coachella act or whatever.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think yeah.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It seems like you love it.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Seems like you love it.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You keep giving us this Elite Daily scoop.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Sure.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You parlay this into an Elite Daily shop.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Immediately sued by Elite Daily.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But then offered $50 an article right.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Something could go up to $52.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So we're talking about this is potentially the first Star Wars sketch on television right?

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Couldn't it be?

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And an official one.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't think Saturday Night Live had covered this.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Saturday Night Live is very new at this point.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is probably the first thing ever with song and dance and accurate Star Wars costumes.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So yeah.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Watching it now it's like we've seen this so many times but this was fresh and innovative.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I think that's probably what everyone watching Donnie and Marie every week was thinking.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This show is fresh and innovative.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Should we take a second and explain what I sent you guys a couple days ago about the show itself.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Donnie and Marie.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I think on the Sid and Marty Croft Facebook they explain.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Listeners you're probably checking this already.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're probably already on the Croft group.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well I of course follow Sid Croft on Instagram.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He's like 92 or 93 years old and he does Instagram Lives and he did one with David Copperfield a few days ago.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Insane.

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Blue 32 discussed between them?

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Talked about Blue 32 a little bit.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Wow.

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sid loves Blue 32.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's going to go out there and see the show again.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He was explaining it to David.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
David is kind of goofing on him the whole time a little bit which is kind of funny.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Seems snarky.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:45,000
A little snarky to this guy but obviously David loves him because Sid has all the stories about opening up for Judy Garland and the old days and Judy saw me do my puppets and she loved it.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We opened up at the Sands or whatever in Vegas and David loves those stories of course and then David showed off his puppet collection which is epic.

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's the only way to say it.

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I know.

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I heard about that in Elite Daily.

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
David Copperfield shows Sid Croft epic puppet collection and 100 people were watching this video by the way and I'm one of them.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are one of them.

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It does not at all look like Batman's Batcave of the stuff he's taken from all his adversaries.

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes it does look like.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh yeah the last piece of information from that is that David explained that he just completed on one of his islands the Cave of Wishes.

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Whoa.

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And he doesn't get into what that means.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He just explains that they have 11 islands and that you can go there and we're told of course one of them being Mushikei which we've talked about on the show before but that it is some sort of like attraction that you can experience on one of the 11 islands.

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He doesn't say which island it is but he says we know we've just completed the Cave of Wishes.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm concerned about what some of Sid Croft's wishes might be.

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Is there a cap on the kinds of wishes that can be granted in this cave?

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't know.

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Sid Croft's wishes might just be to have a TV show on the air again.

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah.

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm not sure.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And I'm concerned that.

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
A puffin stuff, a girl one that I can kiss.

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Well yeah.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm concerned that you are going to try to figure out how to get into David Copperfield's Cave of Wishes.

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You should be concerned.

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So anyway if you don't know we've talked about Sid and Marty Croft made a bunch of shows, Brady Bunch Variety Hour, they produced HR Puffin Stuff, all these I would say visually interesting kids shows.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I would say scary.

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I would say most terrifying acid trips of 70s kids television but then also you kind of forget dominated this cheesy 70s variety genre.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
In prime time.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
As well.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Brady Bunch Variety Hour ultimately Pink Lady and Jeff.

175
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I forgot they were also Pink Lady and Jeff.

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
One of the most notorious flops in TV history.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Horrible show.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But the beginning of it, this was before there would be no Brady Bunch Variety Hour without this.

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
David also brought up the theme park, the Sid and Marty Croft theme park as well.

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He's like you know it's CNN now and I see the escalator is still there.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And he's like oh yes I went there once on a tour and they exaggerate.

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They talk about the park on the tour but they exaggerate some of it.

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
David goes what are you talking about, what do you mean exaggerate and he goes I don't remember.

184
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And that was the exchange.

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Fascinating.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't just put this on Instagram.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Get this in a more public forum.

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's right.

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So anyway Sid and Marty Croft both still alive.

190
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Both still yeah.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They both are.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Both of them still alive.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Wow.

194
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So yeah they posted this about Donnie Marie.

195
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
In 1975 ABC executives Michael Eisner and Fred Silverman approached us about making a Friday night prime time show.

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They told us they had two very talented kids and that they wanted to work with but didn't have any idea what to do with them.

197
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So we went off and developed a show concept consisting of ice skaters, musical numbers, comedy skits,

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
celebrity guests and occasional musical adaptations of famous films such as Star Wars.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This concept would eventually become the Donnie and Marie show.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So our guy Michael Eisner yet again appears.

201
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's crazy when we're not even looking for him.

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We're not looking for him.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Just something is strange on television or we see a clip of it way later.

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Boy we got to talk about this and somehow he ends up being involved.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Here's two things I want to say and they're two shots called and I know what the year is almost over essentially.

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You're half over.

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I think shots calling is permanent.

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Shots call is permanent.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It could be for next year.

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I could call a shot for next year.

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You know how in May you're saying the year's pretty much over.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That comment and that comment turn a phrase.

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's true.

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Basically Christmas.

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Two shots called.

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let me see what's more exciting to call.

218
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I have a guess that one of these I'm not going to like.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There's one that you're going to be upset about.

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And I'm going to guess that excitement for both of them is not the first word that comes to anyone's mind.

221
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
For us one of them is exciting and for the other one I think Scott's going to be like he's going to roll his eyes.

222
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And I think maybe we said this already years ago when we did the Sid and Marty Croft episode.

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll start with the one that we're going to agree on I think.

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Main feed Michael Eisner episode.

225
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah.

226
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Just we got to have to find a way to present it where nobody thinks that it's the interview because I don't want to see a wave of people going oh I know it's not.

227
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We're going to put in the title not an interview with him.

228
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'll reveal to you I sent another email to try to get him at our live show and it did not get no one responded.

229
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The one that's coming up.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah.

231
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This week as people are hearing this.

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I just sent a cold email again being like hey we're doing a live show.

233
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Well wait.

234
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
All right.

235
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Spoiler audience.

236
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Not Michael Eisner.

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Wait you sent it really?

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah.

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And just said like will you come be in it?

240
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well I did a whole I explained you know we were the guys that hello.

241
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's our account that has the hello because that's what got a response one time when we got the no to be on the show.

242
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And then I said you know I think I made a big I made it like an emotional plea essentially like I think Michael doesn't understand that the love that Disney fans have for him the nostalgia.

243
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And I think we think it would be really fun for him to experience that live because he doesn't get to do that.

244
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And we want to I didn't say well throw the softest ball questions at him.

245
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But essentially I did.

246
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So I made a little plea there and I was like you know it's a cool place.

247
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I said like it's a cool place too.

248
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh that'll help.

249
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah.

250
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Would you like to leave the biggest compound in the history of Malibu and head down to MacArthur Park.

251
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's right.

252
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We'll hey we'll get somebody to park the car for you.

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah.

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We'll get a buddy.

255
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You don't even have to worry about that.

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well Jason will park Michael Eisner's car for him.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
There is a garage right around the corner and it has the most unhinged handwritten how to pay for parking sign you've ever seen.

258
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
See that Michael.

259
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You gotta see it.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So I'll keep sending emails periodically just you know what.

261
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's how this happens.

262
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You know you got to be a tenacious.

263
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Jason knows he's a cub reporter.

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You gotta be tenacious sometimes.

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Those who dare when you know.

266
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So send it.

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Sometimes.

268
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So yes you're right.

269
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We have to make sure people know this is not an interview with the man.

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This is just we're looking through the whole career.

271
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah.

272
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well if you know and if we do that we can talk about because I was curious if there was any mention of Donnie and Marie in his book work in progress and there is not.

273
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But he does refer to the first thing he ever produced for ABC as an ABC executive which was that he got he flew to Pebble Beach and got Bing Crosby to serve as the host of a special edition of the ABC.

274
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The host of a special about Marine World and then all right what do we need now I need the hottest musical sensation of right now the young rascals and their song Groovin and the special is called feeling groovy at Marine World.

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Wow.

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
First thing Michael Eisner ever produced for television was a theme park special.

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

278
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He like settled in this genre.

279
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's where he started.

280
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Marine.

281
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It had a water skiing elephant in it.

282
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's not on YouTube though so if anybody can find some odd way to I would love to review feeling groovy.

283
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
We're all going to have to we're going to have to have to head to the Paley Center and like we're going to go through the archives.

284
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah.

285
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Be handed the dustiest VHS or beta tape you've ever seen.

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's a three hour episode I think.

287
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's gotta be.

288
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think Marine World is kind of like the Van Nuys bush gardens or two lesser extent.

290
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What is it?

291
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Geauga Lake Geauga Lake where it's just like gone totally gone.

292
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Why does face the earth at this point.

293
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But you know there's people out there it's like that was their Disneyland and now it just belongs to the dustbin of history is Marine World.

294
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
There's one there's a place called Marine World Africa USA that is up north that I would love to cover because the name is so insane.

295
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But then is this me in the Marine World in is this the one that's like now Trump is a Tory Orange County.

296
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah or not even there like Rancho Palos Verdes kind of oh I don't I don't actually know I think or it's near like where Trump owns a bunch of golf land.

297
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah I think it's one of it's just one of those things where it's like it's very recent history but we I don't know like it's like how there used to be a much more elaborate pier theme park in Santa Monica.

298
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh both.

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I think both.

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah.

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The also Marine World has this there's some like there's some special where the Munsters visit to know we got we got Marine World we got separately feeling groovy of Marine World separately Michael Eisner and separately your other idea.

302
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Do you have a guess what it is.

303
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
No.

304
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No I'm worried.

305
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What is it.

306
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's a Sid and Marty Croft thing.

307
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:04,000
In 1962 they were asked by Six Flags to become the creative heads of the amusement park.

308
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't know if we've gone over this before.

309
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No.

310
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And what this meant.

311
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Six Flags was around then.

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes.

313
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
This was shocking to me so I was like Six Flags okay we got to do it.

314
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But what that really meant is moving in their adult puppet show Les PoupÃ©es de Paris the first adults only puppet show featuring naked marionettes.

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh no.

316
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah.

317
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This is why I'm worried about them in the cave.

318
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You should be worried because there's naked marionettes in this and this is what they were doing before.

319
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So this was at many Six Flags across the country this show this naked marionette puppet show.

320
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
In the 60s.

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's what this says.

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So we got we have to do it.

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's like hair.

324
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We have to do Les PoupÃ©es de Paris.

325
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This was the counterculture and Sid and Marty Croft and their naked puppets were at the forefront.

326
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Right.

327
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So we got to do it.

328
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Anytime I hear like adult puppet show look it's very talented puppeteers out there it's very specific field.

329
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But I can't help but thinking about being John Malkovich.

330
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Like John Cusacks like stressed kind of sad puppeteer character.

331
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Sure.

332
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Well there's a lot of adult puppet shows I feel like now.

333
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So maybe you just need to get more acquainted with Terry Fader Jeff Dunham and other other.

334
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Well see we got into this and our text with Eva those are ventriloquists.

335
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh yeah.

336
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You're right.

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I think puppetry and ventriloquism are different.

338
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So like Puppet Up which is the Henson dirty puppet show at Knotts.

339
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's puppets.

340
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That is puppets.

341
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah.

342
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah.

343
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So I think the other voices they're hidden.

344
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
They're hidden.

345
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Also it's got puppet in the name so I think you got to give it the benefit of the doubt.

346
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Right.

347
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And is puppetry of the penis puppets.

348
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's about to say no.

349
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That is puppetry of the penis.

350
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's just using a penis as a puppet.

351
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's putting the penis into different shapes.

352
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes.

353
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
OK.

354
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So we will do puppetry of the penis too on the second gate.

355
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm calling that shot and we will.

356
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

357
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I mean we'll do it.

358
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Sure.

359
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
With our penises.

360
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's going to be a weird one to listen to but we will try our best to describe all of

361
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
the different myriad of shapes that we can tort our penis and testicles into.

362
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Well it's theater of the mind.

363
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Theater of the mind.

364
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
As they call it.

365
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So yeah that makes sense.

366
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So yeah anyway that's up top here just because of.

367
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Six Flags Dirty Puppet Show.

368
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah and looking into Donnie and Marie in general.

369
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Eisner comes up.

370
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Siddharth and Marty Croft in their dirty puppet show at Six Flags comes up and we got to do

371
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
it.

372
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Well this this might explain why they were maybe on some level at odds with this production

373
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
because it's funny that they got their start with these naked puppets seemingly.

374
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah.

375
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But then here they are producing I feel like the epitome of squeaky clean just like the

376
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
most if you were to use a negative word maybe toothless.

377
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Oh kind of you know just like the most like the blandest entertainment I feel like is

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the Stoney, Marisha and the Osmonds in general.

379
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah.

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Who related also really I like I didn't realize got their start in general at Disneyland.

381
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They're just they're brothers in the park harmonizing with the dapper Dan's.

382
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Right.

383
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Unpaid just for fun I guess.

384
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And somebody a Disney entertainment person saw them.

385
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Who are these wholesome fellas?

386
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I think no Donnie at that point.

387
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I think that I think I saw the older brothers.

388
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is exactly the Jackson five scenario.

389
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Right.

390
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
In the younger one younger ones I guess both really shoot past the right main older brother

391
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
lineup.

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But the Jackson's end up like on the full version of the show where we were with the

393
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Star Wars.

394
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
There's a full like hour long.

395
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah.

396
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And then it's yeah I watched two and there's 12 minutes or so of the Star Wars but they

397
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
do bring on the Osmonds sort of as an afterthought the other older brothers and I will say I

398
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
don't know the names of the Osmonds like I know the names of the Jackson's.

399
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I don't I some of them kind of little ugly.

400
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Wow.

401
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What a take.

402
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I just I just yeah the toothless most boring guys doing a disco number and it's just like.

403
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And they're not lookers either.

404
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I don't know because Donnie well that I'm I'm not saying that so much for me so much as

405
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Donnie and Marie always had fan base of like oh they're lookers you know.

406
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You're saying compared to their brother and sister.

407
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Famous.

408
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah.

409
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah.

410
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I mean it makes it look there was an era in entertainment where our singers were all

411
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
like 50 year old just right kind of unremarkable looking men.

412
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Sure.

413
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And I think the Osmonds were I actually I cannot picture these Osmonds you're talking

414
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
about I mercifully did not watch the entire hour but I that just might be the case.

415
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I like that they're just kind of I could see they're just they're just guys.

416
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm a man.

417
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It is very much like that especially when it's like Donnie and Marie and a younger young

418
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Chris Christopherson a young compared to now.

419
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't know that he was ever looked young but he was kind of handsome and had a big

420
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
hair and a big beard and stuff.

421
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You know these four brothers.

422
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He does.

423
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
For sex appeal.

424
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
He does a scan like kind of like a bit with Marie where they're like asking each other

425
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
for autographs and then they do a song and it's a little it's a little like you know

426
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
their foreheads are leaning on against each other which is very funny because they had

427
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
just cut to Chris Christopherson's wife and daughter in the audience.

428
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Oh no.

429
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Your family is what I certainly hope this is just for entertainment.

430
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't get any.

431
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Marie is very young here too.

432
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I believe he was around when it started.

433
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I saw he was 18.

434
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
She was 16.

435
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah.

436
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah.

437
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Chris Christopherson.

438
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yes.

439
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
They said been going for a little while.

440
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I think by the time they did the Star Wars one.

441
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

442
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But early 75 or 76.

443
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I don't believe had moved to Utah yet because at some point the Osmond machine took over

444
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
production and moved it to their facilities in Utah.

445
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yes.

446
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Kind of fascinating.

447
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
They were just they were on the KTLA lot.

448
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah.

449
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Here in L.A. and which I believe is where the Brady Bunch show is also filmed.

450
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And then I feel like it was maybe a twofold decision.

451
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
One was just to be closer to the church and so that the church could like because they're

452
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
the big Mormon family.

453
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And so like if right if we do this in Utah then the church can be closer and make sure

454
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
that they approve of any foreheads that are touching and suggestively during a song.

455
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But also might have been to get rid of those crops.

456
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I think the crops don't make the move.

457
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And that was a way to like well this is done now by Osmond Enterprises.

458
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Who would want to get away from these two guys?

459
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
What could possibly make you not want to.

460
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I mean let's say you know in theory you were a person who's been on this podcast who has

461
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
interacted with the crops.

462
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What would make them want to not be around the crops as much as possible.

463
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Hypotheticals again.

464
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
To me it's all hanging out with the crops is like going to Lidsville.

465
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The famous Lidsville show they did with Charles Nelson Riley where Butch Patrick went to do

466
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
a giant hat and went into a magical land where hats talked.

467
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You know that's what I picture it being like kind of a fun party where everybody hangs out.

468
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You want to come to our house and then you go in there and the window talks to you and

469
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
the church talks to you and like would you like a drink and then the drink talks to you.

470
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Who wouldn't want to hang out with these guys.

471
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Right.

472
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Perfect time for all.

473
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And then like all right so now that we're all here the talking chair and beer there's a lot of nude

474
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
puppets in the basement.

475
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You want to see our nude puppets?

476
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You want to go to the basement and see our nude puppets?

477
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Don't go in the guest room.

478
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Paul Lind is in there.

479
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
He's still paying off his ABC contract.

480
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So.

481
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Well now I'm going.

482
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Paul Lind is alive.

483
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It will go anywhere.

484
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Paul Lind is.

485
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
My guy.

486
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That is I saw the reason why Paul Lind was like a regular on this show was because he still had time left or hours left on his ABC contract.

487
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Paul has a sad story which bumps me out.

488
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But here sometimes you watch Paul performing and you can kind of see him not want to be performing and I feel like that's what is the case on the Donnie and Marie Star Wars sketch.

489
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Like he doesn't really have it in here.

490
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
There's a little bit.

491
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Well just like the fire might be out.

492
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
He's still great.

493
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
He still does his job but he seems a little tired.

494
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah.

495
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And maybe the spark is kind of gone.

496
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Scott he gets to do a little more in an earlier sketch in the episode where he is working at the Hollywood unemployment office and Farrah Fawcett comes in.

497
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Marie playing Farrah Fawcett.

498
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yes.

499
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh OK not Farrah Fawcett.

500
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And the game is she is an airhead.

501
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh boy.

502
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yes.

503
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That's kind of it right.

504
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That's the whole thing.

505
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
There's a line in this.

506
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yes.

507
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
This dumb airhead.

508
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
They kind of there's a Red Fox sketch earlier too about playing pool.

509
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And this had to you got to you probably fell out of your chair because there's a couple of Music Man references in this.

510
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah.

511
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah.

512
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
There's a river.

513
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
She goes something about River City and playing pool as if it's the got trouble song.

514
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Which is I believe incorrect.

515
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I think they were playing a different kind of pool.

516
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
They might have been playing snooker in Music Man.

517
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh OK.

518
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Different different thing.

519
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Real quick just to set up all the players involved here.

520
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
One another one of our guys is involved and we're talking of course about the Lanch.

521
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yep.

522
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yep.

523
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
When it gets to those credits I was immediately like all right what writers we got here.

524
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yep.

525
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Who's writing for the court knowing what was around the corner.

526
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
There's so many podcasts the ride guys involved here and yeah of course it's the Lanch.

527
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah.

528
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It's always Bruce the Lanch.

529
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yeah.

530
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If you have a question about a hokey piece of sing and dance and comedy.

531
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Yes.

532
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Writer of course of the full Star Wars holiday special and then he seemingly cut his teeth

533
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
writing for this.

534
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah.

535
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
He spoke of the Utah move and how it really defanged the show and the show got much worse.

536
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And I believe this this sequence is right before the Utah move.

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Uh huh.

538
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's a little bit.

539
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,400
It's maybe the premiere of season three but it was a little bit into season three that

540
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,120
they make the move so that they can run every sketch passed them because the Mormons were

541
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,200
so invested in the Osmonds as like there these are the main ambassadors to America of the

542
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,040
church.

543
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,640
So they would you know they'd like cancel songs that Bruce talks about that how there

544
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,240
was some like could have been a hit song presented for Marie and then they're like no this is

545
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,240
about a divorce.

546
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
No.

547
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Why?

548
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
What do you mean?

549
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
How?

550
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,200
And then he pitches why doesn't she do don't let the sun go down on me and then delights

551
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,320
in the fact that he instead got Marie Osmond to sing a song with the type with the words

552
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,600
go down on me.

553
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Right.

554
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Bruce yes.

555
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Bruce got his wins.

556
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Yeah.

557
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Yeah.

558
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Subversive.

559
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Yeah.

560
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,080
He did his little twists and turns.

561
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,200
But yes he's he's here too.

562
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,640
He's here too.

563
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,480
Paul Linde is here too.

564
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,880
This is really the fact that I didn't watch the entire thing.

565
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,800
This might speak to that compared to you guys my Paul Linde tolerance might be somewhat

566
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
lower.

567
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Really?

568
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
You're not a Paul guy.

569
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
I cannot say that I am a Paul Linde guy.

570
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,560
Did you like Uncle Arthur on Bewitched?

571
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,640
Did you watch Bewitched?

572
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,280
I cannot tell you that I have strong vibrant memories of this is one I know I'm disappointing

573
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
you might.

574
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,760
Herman Munster's doctor on the Munsters?

575
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,680
I didn't know he was Herman Munster's doctor.

576
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Yes he was.

577
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
He gets to see very well.

578
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,120
How about Bye Bye Birdie when he's singing about kids today?

579
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Oh he's kids.

580
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
He's heads.

581
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Okay.

582
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Yeah.

583
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
He was on Broadway too.

584
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
That's a good song.

585
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,040
Yeah and he gets to sing here as well.

586
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,840
I am not the Paul Linde expert that Mike is but I could tell that there were some moments

587
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:07,400
in this some segments in this that were a thing I like from old TV shows people kind

588
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,360
of barely getting the lines laughing through sketches.

589
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,760
Which is funny because I love that.

590
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,960
I love like Bob Newhart and Dean Martin doing that or Red Fox popping into the Osmond show

591
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:28,200
but like in modern sketch comedy I hate people breaking or getting stuff fucked up.

592
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
But I love it.

593
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,420
You and Lauren have a lot in common.

594
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,420
Me and Lauren.

595
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,420
Yeah.

596
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:37,040
Okay let's get do by the when you get the draft on you don't start improvising you got

597
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,960
I think Marie at some point they're doing this pool sketch.

598
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,880
Have you given that lesson to you?

599
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,200
You were doing a little like that's that's the thing that that's the thing that personally

600
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,960
bothers me.

601
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,720
Red Fox and Marie just says during one of the she's like oh that was my line.

602
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,000
Yes during one of they just let's in there.

603
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,440
Well this is one of that like I'm always curious because I okay this is something I think about

604
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,720
the hokey end of Disney variety specials especially because like all the Disney world specials

605
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,840
and anything that Disney's producing in the 70s and early 80s are like Donnie and Marie.

606
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,960
It is still like this thing as like it's the ice angels and then it's always like whatever

607
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,360
we can think of to have like a hundred people in red white blue uniforms and like big puffy

608
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,920
skirts and like I'm always watching stuff like this and thinking this is the late 70s

609
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,520
early 80s is when like all my favorite music comes from this is like such a countercultural

610
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:41,400
time punk is happening and then yeah this and I was like September 77 when this is

611
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:48,080
ever 23rd 77 when this airs like what else is going on the next day the very next night

612
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,880
after this airs is the season three premiere of Saturday Night Live like the much cooler

613
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,720
end of like the show that is blowing up this kind of thing Steve Martin hosts musical guest

614
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Jackson Brown first appearance of wild and crazy guys like the molten core of when SNL

615
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:14,040
was cool and countercultural is happening literally a day after like hey Princess Leia

616
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:21,880
we gotta go back gotta get you back on the jet plane and then and then the other pop

617
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,120
cultural like contrast that I like a lot the literal day the day that this airs is

618
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:34,680
the day of the release of Steely Dan's Asia possibly my favorite album in the world a

619
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:43,200
timeless piece of music to me I feel at least one of my top ten for sure like you could for

620
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:51,320
the first time hear Deacon Blues this this day yeah and then go home and watch this some a song

621
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:59,320
where they go chew baka baka baka yeah I've said this on the Oscar like there's this 70s 80s period

622
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,800
were of like changing tastes where there was still old stuff happening simultaneously like

623
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:12,040
on TV is fascinating because like Liberace being on the Oscars in the 80s feels weird to me yeah

624
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,600
but isn't it like wait no that was earlier 80s I was like is he singing songs about Oliver Stone

625
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,640
movies not quite that but fire and on Golden Pond yeah the movies are a little more like those

626
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,360
fitted but this is post like Scorsese like movies have gotten prettier and crazier with that so

627
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,320
Liberace this is what this is the culture they were countered to yeah yeah yeah and you forget

628
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:41,880
these things were like right next door to each other around yeah and and by the way anybody any

629
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,680
Steely Dan fam listening this that what I just said is not the only crossover between Donnie

630
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,400
and Marie and the Dan check this out

631
00:33:51,400 --> 00:34:19,840
like I bought that Warren and the brightest orange laser suits you can imagine

632
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,640
and then I'm just gonna leave it playing through the introduction of the guests

633
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:53,720
did

634
00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:00,800
did Donald Fagan feel like throwing himself off a balcony when he saw it if he saw this or was

635
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,080
he just happy to get a check yeah it depends on how many zeros were at the end of that check

636
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:12,920
yes I bet they found a way to make it not very many that is true yeah I don't look I have no

637
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,640
room to talk on this we just watched a movie called the Siegfeld Follies this is not a movie

638
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:25,320
about the Siegfeld Follies this was made in 1945 and it's all the MGM contract stars making a

639
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,960
movie in the style of Siegfeld Follies so unconnected sketches and elaborates musical

640
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,840
presented a premise as if I understand what Siegfeld Follies is you got to go all the way

641
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:42,720
back to the early 1900s and they were the first Broadway shows okay and got to go back you've

642
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,880
got to go back all right I will this is like showgirl Lucy Lucy is in this and so is William

643
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,000
Frawley doing a sketch with Fanny Brice who I didn't know was still alive sign me up Fanny

644
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,800
Brice and Hume Cronin my man sign me up Hume Cronin I'm the fucking there you're there more

645
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:09,560
of Mike's guy Lucy does show up in this clip at the end if you know what I'm talking about

646
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:21,640
so yes so so they do a full show it sets up this 12-minute show stopping number at the end the

647
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:29,760
first Star Wars parody of all time yeah just four months after the release of New Hope yes still

648
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,300
fresh in people's minds and they do and and speaking of I guess the right guys they do the

649
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:41,900
of course famous opening crawl there's some jokes in there about the Empire like being a threat to

650
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:47,780
cleanliness thrift and good dental hygiene and there's a little polite way patriotism patriotism

651
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:54,700
real beliefs right you get patriotism's now the person who does this crawl narration also does

652
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:00,540
Darth Vader's voice not James Earl Jones it's one of the Scott's specifically even guys thorough

653
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,300
Ravens are all Ravens I was delighted I by the time we made it to this and like well we got an

654
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:13,900
episode here right yet another incredible iteration of my favorite voice of all time the most insane

655
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:20,300
engaging deep voice open the fantasy the way he's been he's in this and he gets to be Darth Vader

656
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:26,260
yeah it makes all the sense in the world the tiger is Darth Vader yeah yeah right and he does a good

657
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:31,220
job like a first animal like is that that's not him no yeah it's a bit of a it's a softer Vader yes

658
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:37,420
you know I'm the power of my force you could tell he doesn't have that I'm not sure that he saw

659
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,420
Star Wars I think I like about anything like this we're like you can tell people are some people

660
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,740
involved are getting caught up really quick with like yeah it's kind of no it's like a it's a Buck

661
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:53,260
Rogers flash Gordon and this guy's like a pilot and this guy's rad and so so what they would they

662
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:59,060
would say my force so definitely yeah everybody would for sure like well not if I can get you first

663
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:05,460
with my force perfect yes you sound like Lucas you could have ridden the thing yeah Vader at the end

664
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:11,740
of the sketch kind of does like a poochie like I have to go now my planet needs like he kind of

665
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:17,080
kind of gets just walks off he got just leaves the whole thing doesn't make too much sense no it

666
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:24,960
doesn't it is an original Star Wars story before Mandalorian this is a for TV only right really the

667
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,600
first non cinematic Star Wars story so slow so let's let's set the story right so Donnie and

668
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,240
Marie come out and they are dressed they are they are Luke and Leia and again well after some footage

669
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:41,600
of just kind of realistic clinical solar flare yes and there's gonna be more realistic footage to

670
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:47,240
come as well that don't blend that does not blend in well for the universe of Star Wars but

671
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,840
they come on this is just gonna give you a vibe of like what we're talking about entertainment wise

672
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:37,760
so there you go that's that's the vibe of this this whole yeah Darth is gonna get us watch out

673
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:45,680
for Darth again one of those my foot the Darth and his force lost in space all the Star Wars

674
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,280
characters always saying they're lost in space that other reference we know we gotta go on a

675
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:59,320
Star Trek to prevent more Star Wars a vague understanding of what the movie is about is

676
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:04,840
really really good I wonder if Bruce had seen them Bruce maybe it's in the movie maybe he's

677
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:10,240
the expert I imagine that in this writers room he's the youngest gun that's probably right that's

678
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:19,720
probably right oh sure you're one of their kids how many of the rowdy of the writers coughed to

679
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:26,120
death during the production of this number Pauline kind of had the vibe right for an imperial officer

680
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,520
for a second he had the hands behind that he was looking stern he had his hands behind his back

681
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,960
yeah I think he could have been in the movies I actually think you are right that he could have

682
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,840
played an imperial officer yeah why not he looks like the one that gets choked out by

683
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:49,000
Vader for sure the officer yeah yeah but yeah yeah so so that happens they come on this is

684
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
insane but I'm letting it pass but you just you two just both said yes Pauline could have been in

685
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,880
Star Wars moving on bigger career he got pigeonholed is the guy who like shakes his waggles his head and

686
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,280
I think he got stuck doing that but he wasn't you where's the proof that he's has other moves in my

687
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,720
heart the proof is in I be at our movies he's done it in Star Wars it's not fair even get he was

688
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:19,520
typecast I'm saying more that a lot of those imperial officers are choked out after two or

689
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,800
three lines and just kind of come on and say something sort of dry or sort of stern besides

690
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:39,600
grandma Tarkin wait I get choked out in this while I'm in sign me up my safe word is force

691
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:53,440
so so yeah so they come on they do Barry Manilow song writers to the stars I like I like that song

692
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,760
actually yeah not this version necessarily yeah but a lot of the songs are just they do in the

693
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,000
shower just the songs this has at least a few words changed yeah to be Star Wars with some of

694
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
it it's just like there's doing this song well cuz later stormtroopers come out dancing which I

695
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:19,480
loved I love the dancing yeah sure I mean they're and then they get ready they do the song the

696
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,920
temptation song get ready yes so they come out and this is also the precursor people try to

697
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,400
claim online that this is this gave Lucas the idea to make Luke and Leia brother and sister

698
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,440
eventually in the third movie because of course Luke and Leia in the first movie like Leia kisses

699
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,800
Luke or no that she kisses him in the second and Empire Strikes Back but it seemed like they were

700
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,640
at Dustin for some sort of romance in the first movie maybe mm-hmm but George denies this George

701
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:52,400
denies that the Donnie Murray special gave him the idea to make Luke and Leia brother and sister

702
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,880
wonder if any variety shows impacted how they handled the the Disney ones where there's like

703
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,680
seeds of romance here and there between different characters and then in the end they are confused

704
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,800
and don't know what the fuck to do about any of it I wonder how that make a bad idea that's a good

705
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,000
point I see a little bit of a spark here well actually shit run I don't know Chewie's dead

706
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,520
no he's not they should there any variety shows where they just came out and announced things

707
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:27,160
that could happen and then none of them did happen it's the episode 9 was inspired by like

708
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:38,200
a music festival where the stage collapsed yeah hey that's great in the weirdest places I like

709
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:50,760
when in night in 1977 the real suits of C3PO and R2D2 walk out to no applause no applause no

710
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,960
should we anyone excited about this now what are they what are these tin cans red Fox also

711
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,160
when he appears doesn't really get an applause break I guess cuz he was in a sketch earlier

712
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:09,360
but also I did read that Donnie and Marie a lot of those musical numbers are lip-synced live well

713
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:14,440
that's this there's an odd thing where it's like I can't tell if it's all being done live

714
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,480
because some like Anthony Daniels is doing C3PO he seems like they almost like dubbed his lines

715
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,680
in yeah there's a weird quality of quality to it and the same thing with red Fox red Fox is and

716
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:30,080
like what's the do you catch what is fake Obi-Wan Kenobi name that's impossible trying to find what

717
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,440
was or trying to hear it and it's really hard it's muffled it's either okie-pinnockie or something

718
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,440
like that okie-finnockie which is a real place or river maybe it's that yeah but he appears sort

719
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,080
of is just an image above them he's not actually live on stage and that feels completely disjointed

720
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:52,200
disconnected from what they're doing well in that in the real and in the years moment I just played

721
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:59,520
when Donnie says hi welcome to our show that's lip-synced the dialogue is so they might be like

722
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,880
a Disney ride pre-show ride video where they just would always screw up the audio and they'd have

723
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:12,600
to go in and dub it oh sure that red Fox does get a laugh for the line this year Sanford he says

724
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:19,200
he's from the planet Sanford but he says this year Sanford has no son yes well you left out

725
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:26,400
the part where there's like four lines between those things and it's the longest walk I know

726
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,800
you're going you said Sanford where to say son say son say son and he said well then moons it no

727
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,040
come on get to it say son yeah I don't know if this was a valanche maybe this is an early

728
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,680
valanche he hadn't figured out how to cut two of the sentences before he got to the punchline

729
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,640
maybe yeah he's just learning the rhythm at this point because he's so he's young here he will by

730
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:55,000
the time Crystal steps up to the Oscar stage Bruce will get there much like a young Luke looking at

731
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,880
the suns and dreaming of his fate that was Bruce valanche picturing the Oscar do do do do do do do

732
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:16,360
we sing Billy Crystal's head just feel it to Billy Crystal heads this one is this show is like

733
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:22,640
Bruce valanche is running through the swamps of Dagobah and he's flipping over stuff oh yeah the

734
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,640
Yoda and his backpack is just like a distant Osmond like uncle or father going like I don't

735
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,160
think we should do that the church won't like it do we really want to have Suzanne Summers on

736
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,880
her mere appearance is scandalous yes I'm Tago bond you're just telling him he's not ready yet

737
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:51,600
to go right for the Oscars jokes are not ready not prepared you are double entendre is offensive

738
00:46:51,840 --> 00:47:01,040
but Billy needs me he's out there I know he is the his his moment of getting electrified by the

739
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:07,720
Emperor you know and saying father father help me is when the David Letterman Uma Oprah moment

740
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:13,000
does land which I think I don't know I think that word plan that makes sense they're both

741
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,720
famous people everyone knew that was called out as anything we have all watched just he just

742
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,560
garbage piles of worse comedy than Uma Oprah since it happened yes insane that people were

743
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:31,280
mad about yes I'm not saying that moment is elevated we've yes we've consumed so much

744
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:38,920
worse since like I'm begging for Uma Oprah yeah I also feel like Letterman himself has made that

745
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,280
whole thing like he's he's kind of cast a shadow on it because he also yeah somebody he or somebody

746
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,400
else who were like he got asked back to hosts and he's the one who wants to push the narrative

747
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,200
that he did such a bad job and everyone hated him and then he didn't go back blah blah blah so

748
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:00,960
I think part of it is also him bragging rights yeah and make yeah he seems cooler than it so

749
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,120
yeah you got Chris Christopherson is Han Solo who I don't know he's not I'm not thrilled with him

750
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:12,920
his performance here yeah I guess yeah but then now this this is one though not that he's good in

751
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,160
this but like this one this is one where I'm like I feel like there's a world where Chris Christopherson

752
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,920
was Han Solo just in terms of like he's cool yeah yeah just like his prominence I shouldn't

753
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,960
say not throw them he just doesn't have anything that fun to do yeah he doesn't really do anything

754
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,280
but like in a long shot you put him in the Han Solo shirt and vest he's a cool-looking guy like

755
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,840
Chris lean against that doorframe yeah that works that's enough that communicates the idea cool guy

756
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:44,880
yeah does he do he does a song right yes and I can't I don't know the name of it I found the

757
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,400
names of all the songs well doesn't he do here let me just let me fish around I might not be there

758
00:48:49,400 --> 00:49:12,000
exactly Chewbacca is with him now oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah I have that ring done and this oh

759
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:23,880
here's the part that's it they don't say boom shakalaka they say chewbacca so that's one of

760
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,560
the changes you didn't you didn't have the most important piece of that where r2d2 realizes he

761
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:36,640
can't get up the ramp and so just goes off camera and then they they come back anyway a moment later

762
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,600
because there's a joke about like this is the same planet it's like yeah but the landing was

763
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:48,600
perfect yeah what is he don't know yeah they say bye and wave and then each day they leave him there

764
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:56,080
yeah they leave us random on this island which is mainly made up of sparkly stairs yeah say island

765
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:04,600
or planet planet planet yeah Peter Mayhew is in the Chewbacca outfit Peter Mayhew was there doing

766
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:12,280
this playing Chewbacca crazy and so also again what you're this this is the first that Anthony

767
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,280
Daniels and Peter Mayhew played the characters again after the movie right unless there's

768
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,840
something I don't know about but this is but before Empire Strikes Back yeah this is the real

769
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:27,600
sequel to Star Wars Anthony Daniels in his book finally remembers his appearance on the show except

770
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,760
that he thought the lines he was given to say his C3PO were so dreadful that he decided to cut most

771
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,520
of them from the script so he refused to say some of the lines I guess that's what he's claiming

772
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:45,120
here and then they get they get that back and like oh so mr. robot man doesn't like guard jokes

773
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:52,840
well let's see where this flash in the pan goes we're gonna prey on that for sure I mean what could

774
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:58,280
he see he's a sinner in the Lord's eyes for impersonating a human shape and C3PO is an

775
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,720
abomination shall not be in the likeness a robot shall not be in the likeness of a man no art those

776
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:13,420
are 2d2 he's fine they were disgusted they saw him drinking a cup of hot tea what would be a

777
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:18,400
valanche joke for the road like a danger Will Robinson or something like what would be the

778
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:26,080
valanche loose robot joke in 1977 I mean danger Will Robinson is the only robot that was famous

779
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:32,760
up until then right yeah I don't know like you deserve a gold medal for that landing um please

780
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:42,680
don't melt me into the gold but that's pretty good Bruce is throwing that one out yeah all right

781
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:49,000
next let me talk about the Paul in number real quick here Jason did you recognize this song that

782
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Paul sings a few a few of them I did not or I could not place that's okay I just it's a it's

783
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,720
from on a clear day it's from the musical and it's called I don't know the musical okay it's

784
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,480
a song called come back to me I didn't know it either I had to search the lyrics to find it and

785
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,260
they cut to Paul and and he's in I guess a control tower of some kind he's wearing an

786
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:19,860
Imperial officer outfit he's got the ice princesses walking around in like vague stormtrooper looking

787
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:25,180
outfits and he's just looking at the like looking at the screen and it's just a picture of a real

788
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:31,500
like rocket a modern-day rocket old grainy footage yeah and he sings this song

789
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,140
yeah

790
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,560
don't want your notes

791
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,560
of course, what a force can you be?

792
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
come back to me

793
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,960
come back to me

794
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,480
come back to me

795
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,840
he seems crazy in this so I this is what j i like if you just dial it a little bit in one way

796
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,560
I feel like he does seem like an unhinged imperial officer

797
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,280
which yes, yeah, so

798
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,520
He could be a first order. He could be yeah, he could be any any of these characters. I feel like

799
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,880
Uh with the right direction an irving kirchner

800
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,360
You know has the delicate hand to take paul linds performance and make it fit into the universe

801
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,400
Now you picked him and not george. Are you saying george is unable to direct actors? We know that

802
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:54,080
Are there moments like with I don't know, uh, hayden christensen where you feel like maybe you didn't know the right thing to say faster more intense

803
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
faster more intense

804
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,320
I think that's george's famous direction really let them know that you don't like sand

805
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,240
Yeah, just make sure you communicate that you don't like them. Great job paul. Great job paul faster more intense

806
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,080
Uh, so I guess paul is watching as an imperial officer. This is supposed to be the heroes in that rocket

807
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,000
And that's the best they could do it took me a couple watches to figure that out

808
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,160
That I believe he's watching. Yeah, this is just occurring to me as you're saying. Yeah, he's watching

809
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,640
han luke or in leia in in chewy in the rocket

810
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,480
That the spaceship they just got into it took me forever to figure that out

811
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:28,800
I go

812
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,560
Why is he watching? Why does he want him to come back and come back to me doesn't really make sense

813
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,480
But I guess the idea is oh they've gotten away from imperial officer paul linds. Yeah, that's the idea there

814
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,480
This is all very thin soup the mechanics of this. I completely agree

815
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,160
But paul lind gets to sing a song from a musical and he really he really does belt it out

816
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,480
Yeah, uh there

817
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,480
and then yeah, and then he's just sort of

818
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:59,520
Uh with a bunch of the ice princesses who have like helmets and ski goggles on I love these costumes are great

819
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,680
These like more shapely

820
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:08,560
Female designed stormtrooper. These are good. This is this is an innovative part of the shapelier stormtroopers

821
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,400
Yes

822
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,080
The lady stormtroopers have almost like a heart on their

823
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,720
Chest kind of

824
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,280
Uh, I don't know if that's what it is. I don't think it looks like almost like an upside down star trek symbol

825
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,540
Um, they have shoulder pads their wardrobe these these utah osmond oriented

826
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,340
Hired costume designers. They're sad. I think they figured it out. Yeah, and they're sassier stormtroopers

827
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,360
Um, and then paul and is very upset

828
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,080
Um and darth vader comes in

829
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,880
And yells, I guess we could play a little bit of this. Let's let's hear

830
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,520
thurl's darth

831
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,120
Just a little

832
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:03,440
No planet all no planet all no planet all it is I darth I'm just going to use some of my force

833
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,640
I like this guy. He's a little I don't know. He's he's sillier. He's cookier

834
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,000
That no planet all on that's a very like

835
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,280
Jokey delivery no planet all no planet all no planet all

836
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,120
Oh

837
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:24,560
This guy they're the best I also I learned a thing about him. I didn't know also that he was the

838
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:31,680
Uh for decades. He was the voice of this thing called the pageant of the masters, which is in laguna beach

839
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,400
they have it every summer and

840
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:40,560
It is a laguna beach in orange county where disneyland is um, and you might know from arrested development

841
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,520
There's this there's this thing it's in an episode of the show where people get together and

842
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,800
Recreate paintings. Oh, yeah using sets and makeup and costume

843
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:56,480
And that is a real thing that happens in this outdoor amphitheater in orange county and apparently for many decades

844
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,600
The live narrator of it was thurl ray of its trust

845
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:05,920
Um, and I got interested in this thing because the venue where they have that is where erin and I got married

846
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:06,880
Oh really?

847
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,440
Holy shit in the grounds of not in the it was not an amphitheater and we did not invite you didn't

848
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:17,040
3000 people but and you didn't recreate a painting for your wedding? Um,

849
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:23,360
Just a general tableau of what a wedding would be like, but no no specific wedding from art history

850
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,960
No, like dower photo where you guys are recreating american pastoral like you didn't have a buddy

851
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:34,960
It's like all right. He's got the ring and you've got the pitchfork. Do not forget that pitchfork

852
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,440
No, no photo reference

853
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:43,680
Uh, um, oh the only thing well right after we got married though. I did have every there was an announcement made by the dj of

854
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,640
um

855
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,560
Uh, all right. Anyone who is at this wedding who was in the video sex offender shuffle, please proceed to the wedding area

856
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,840
because

857
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,480
Uh an old video of mine if you don't know that one, uh, everyone who's in the video was at my weddings

858
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:01,120
We were able to do a full cast photo. So there was that there was somebody had the phone out like, okay, wait

859
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,920
I was over here. I was looking mad. Okay, I was being creepy in the

860
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,480
Um, so the the grand cast reunion happened a lot of minutes after here at this place no history

861
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,640
Yes, some involving thorough ravens croft and some not american goth

862
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,120
I was just about to get on your ass

863
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:25,360
I was done talking and I apologize. It looks very pastoral and that's why I got that's true

864
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,720
I didn't want our listeners furious for jason all the raw

865
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:33,520
All the filip roth heads going like why is he bringing up american pastoral

866
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,400
He was thinking about a book because jason's the reader of the good jason reese the book guy

867
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,120
He subtly tells us

868
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,840
On me limp mic stand, I know the feeling

869
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,080
Leave it in

870
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:59,840
His line at one point that I liked was I didn't expect a standing ovation, but what's so funny?

871
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,560
Because they all kind of laugh

872
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,560
At one point all the uh ice angels. Okay. Yeah, right

873
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,080
Um, so yeah at this point, I mean the narrative is now they've been caught I believe

874
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,040
Or they're about to be caught I guess well

875
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,480
They leave the planet and then just come back to the same planet, right?

876
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,000
And they don't change anything about the back so it's not like they went somewhere else

877
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
Um, they come back to the planet

878
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,200
And then this is when the sort of more traditional storm troopers

879
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,780
Swarmed the stage in addition to the ice princess. Yes, this I have this moment

880
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,480
You're right side

881
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:10,400
I do really like the like west side story kind of like group snapping. Yes of the storm troopers

882
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,720
This might be the highlight number. I think so. Yeah that first shot

883
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:21,600
That's kind of like low angled and then they start bouncing I was like, okay, I like that and then when they get to the chorus

884
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,200
It's just like oh, yeah, I just like this song. This is fun now

885
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,680
Because everyone's menacing

886
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:33,680
Uh, you know the osmonds and chris christofferson and chewy but no one has any weapons

887
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:41,200
They're menacing them by like one two three one two three like bouncing towards them. Yes dance intimidation

888
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,520
Yes, there's no blast I don't think yeah, does anybody have a blaster no one has a blaster

889
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,680
No, so lucas did not let them borrow the blasters for this

890
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,840
For some reason I don't know but he did but there were this it is real costumes. Yeah

891
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,520
They arranged chubaca that's too close. Like there's no way

892
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:06,000
Whatever prop department could put together these yeah, it's the real chubaca real darth vader real storm troopers

893
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,960
It looks like yes some of them they get this so right and then the set's so wrong

894
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:18,400
Just this this sparkly pink world. I mean, I like the sets, but it's just not star wars. Yeah, it's they

895
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,640
I'll say this

896
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,960
They tease an episode that I did watch and I'll just say it now they do a wizard of oz

897
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,280
12 minute

898
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,520
Show-stopping finale on their next episode that involves lucille ball

899
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:37,440
And that one feels much more like they put time into it than this one. Yes, they know what it is

900
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,680
Yeah, do they say lucille ball?

901
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:45,840
No, I can tell you the whole thing. No, not ruth buzzy. It's it's uh, uh ray bulger

902
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,880
Actual cast member playing the scarecrow yet again, except if he looked wrong and bad. That's right

903
01:01:53,200 --> 01:02:00,480
It's lucille ball as the tin woodsman. It is paul williams. Oh williams. That was the horse. Who's great

904
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,160
Yeah, uh, and it is paul lind and they don't say it but paul lind as the wicked witch of the west

905
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:11,760
Oh, okay, and he's around the thing and yeah, it's so so no, it's not ruth buzzy

906
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,640
But that whole thing it feels like the songs some of those might be originals and if yeah, they knew what that was

907
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,440
More than than some of the old time

908
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:26,080
Coughing writers knew what this was you must have flipped your shit when they said lucille ball's gonna be in our wizard of oz

909
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,440
I absolutely did. Yes, and then paul was back here paul's back

910
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,080
Yes, and lucille singing with ray bulger and marie osmond. Yes

911
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,960
I wanted I was like fuck this show. I want to talk about the wizard of oz

912
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:44,640
Put lucy in the star wars lucy in star wars doesn't feel right generation-wise either

913
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,720
It doesn't feel like lucy should have been alive when star wars was out. You think she saw it

914
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,720
Yes

915
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,480
Because she produced start she was involved in the creation of star trek. She didn't create it

916
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:01,120
But she was it was she you're saying lucy was an avid sci-fi enthusiast the stars. She loved the stars. She loved

917
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,880
She loved the gorn lucy loved the gorn on star trek

918
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:11,200
I love the gorn gary always hears me talking about the goal. I love gail gordon and I love the gorm

919
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,620
Is what uh paul lind would say about work opportunities here today gorn tomorrow

920
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:24,960
You could have been that's it that's if he's in a star trek number playing the gorn playing. Yeah

921
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,200
Yes, it showed which might have happened

922
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:33,360
Also if blanche had to work on some star trek thing and he had to have said he had written that for somebody

923
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,960
That feels like too easy pitching it forever. I pitched it in the 60s. I pitched it for every movie

924
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:44,320
I pitched it to jj nobody took me up on the slide. That's his great white whale

925
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,600
Is no one using here today gorn tomorrow, right? Well if we ever get on a star trek cruise

926
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,520
Maybe you can say that live on stage and it'll bring the house down

927
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,000
Yeah

928
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,760
Mic drop moment. Yeah, I don't know how we get on a star trek cruise in some capacity of performing but it's possible

929
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,720
You're talking I was gonna say we'll get on it by buying a ticket

930
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,960
But you if we have to perform on it, I think so. Hmm. I think we could do that

931
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:14,240
You know, I don't think so. So your dream has now become to be a cruise ship performer

932
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:21,680
On a star trek cruise with all my favorite people over 70. Yes, what are we doing? We're doing the this podcast

933
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,160
I don't know. I don't see why I just thought of so I have to work it out in my head a little bit

934
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:31,200
We have friends the george lou's talk show did the joe coe cruise, right?

935
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,680
Sure. Yes. Great. So they're our hookup to the cruise community. They're on there

936
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,280
We're in there's comedy shows sometimes on the jericho cruise like I feel like these are one step away

937
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,120
We do know somebody actually who is does a lot of stuff on the star trek cruise

938
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,480
But I don't know it doesn't answer the question what we're doing on it. What is this person going to demand of us?

939
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:54,960
What do you need? How we need it so bad person? I don't know who it is

940
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:00,160
I just look I just want to like sip a mai tai with armin shimmerman. That's all I want to do

941
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,600
That's really all this is so the getting you're saying that by guaranteeing that we're the performers on the cruise

942
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,040
It's a free ticket to yeah

943
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:11,600
And then like because we're just the riff raff armin's not drinking a mai tai with just anybody exactly

944
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,240
Once he sees that we have a performer's pass, then he's going to treat us with that respect fellow

945
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,600
Craftsman hello, please here. I bought two

946
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,480
I had a feeling i'd need be needing to share and then I can share with him the anecdote about wallace shawn's play

947
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,440
And sitting

948
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:35,120
There is a tale that i've woven podcast after podcast non podcast after podcast

949
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,760
And mr. Shimmerman when you hear it, I think you'll agree. It's one of the finest tales

950
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,880
Maybe it's just podcast the ride presents the story

951
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:49,200
And we and we you two sit there while I recount the story of going to see wallace shawn's play

952
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:55,520
And andre gregory directed and sitting behind me there. I was me mike carlson. Yeah

953
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,780
Little did I know I was in for the night of a lifetime

954
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,640
Let me set the stage

955
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:11,840
Several soft-spoken men are going to see several other soft-spoken men to a soft-spoken performance temptations get ready plays

956
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,480
I was all nervous because I couldn't find the email

957
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:22,720
What would the box office say if I couldn't show them the ticket email but it turns out they just needed my name and id

958
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,600
Poof got over that hurdle. I wonder if anything else is gonna happen

959
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,000
And then we have armin act out what he said

960
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,240
Oh, wow

961
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,120
That would be a killer thing armin playing himself in the version of the story

962
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,680
Oh, my neck hurts these seats when was the last time they updated these seats?

963
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:49,520
That's what he said right that was no I can tell you what he said I've said it a few times I've heard it so

964
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:54,800
Many times yet. I cannot remember what this story is so boring the bartender

965
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,280
What's what did he say?

966
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:02,400
Okay, it was it was a 17th fucking time. You two don't remember what he said

967
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,600
There was a long play and the first half would be lapping up the story if it was interesting

968
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,600
Jason

969
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:17,520
Barely pays attention while we do this podcast the first half of the show is 90 minutes and it was very long

970
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,760
It's a long story so by the end of the first day you're like, oh it's kind of a long play

971
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,200
Whatever armin stands up realizes there's a second half to the play

972
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,760
He thinks it's done and he turns to his wife and he goes, oh, I thought the play was over

973
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:37,520
Well, I guess we'll just see what happens next and then goes to the bathroom

974
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,840
So my joke did have the spirit correct

975
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,120
Yes, it was a very similar but armin was expressing what the whole audience was expressing like oh there's more, huh?

976
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,880
Okay

977
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,200
And he said it all like that and he was very positive about it

978
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:56,240
But it made me laugh made us laugh just imagining you sitting at the bar talking to him and the bartender sliding over a napkin

979
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:01,920
Sir, there is a raving man who wrote this is a five-timer at the end of their end of the bar

980
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,960
I don't know what it means. But uh, he said you would

981
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,160
This look it's possible i've been over here

982
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:12,720
Um, you know you guys have been chatting but since you finished let me come to you

983
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,400
Hat in hand hand in hat. I forget which

984
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,880
Had to say how wrong I was

985
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,360
That story shook me to the bone

986
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:26,560
I am so glad it's been told again and I can't wait for it to be told again and again and again

987
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,720
Well on the pot we'll get paid for it on the cruise. At least we'll get a free cruise ticket out of it

988
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,160
I

989
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:37,120
When the listeners add up how many times they've paid for some of the same stories over and over

990
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,920
And they'll figure out what a good deal it's been

991
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,080
The hits, uh, that's just the arman shimmerman chestnuts

992
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:50,240
There is no amount of money. I will not keep giving them to hear. Yes tales of arman

993
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,200
Weave your arman lore

994
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,520
At the what are they gonna do go to multiplex see the fucking black adam

995
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:03,040
Turn on netflix watch the russo brothers ai flicks. Yeah, right

996
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,080
They're in the right spot here with the russo brothers new ai

997
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:14,560
Dreams you can fashion all kinds of stories where arman shimmerman says something quietly to his wife at the beginning of an intermission of a play

998
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:21,360
You can even you can even mike conjure a version where jason and I remember what happened in the fucking story

999
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,600
And we applaud we

1000
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,000
Have fun every time. Yay for mike lift him up above our heads

1001
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:33,760
Uh, uh, it's something we'll figure we're gonna figure this out. I'll force you guys to do this somehow

1002
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,720
I don't know how but we'll we'll figure it out somehow

1003
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:41,520
Uh, anyway back to star wars. Well, it sounds like here is an applicable quote what you're almost saying is

1004
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,320
I I vow by the power of my force I shall return

1005
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,400
I vow they will like the story on the ship

1006
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:58,320
Da I will tell the arman shimmerman story again. I vow to tell it again the story will strike back

1007
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,400
The story the story strikes back. That's now that okay

1008
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:08,240
That's the now we have to retire five timers and whenever we retell a story now we say the story struck back

1009
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,960
The story strikes back. Ah, the story strikes back. Yeah, scott

1010
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:18,640
Can you just confirm after he says that quote that's when he just like walks off stage left. He took

1011
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,520
Yes, yeah darth vader's, uh defeat in this is walking away

1012
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:30,480
Yes, and uh paul lind's defeat is wookie putting wookie putting a kind of firm hand on its one shoulder

1013
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,560
For saying it's only turned his lesson wookie pudding

1014
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,120
wookie pudding

1015
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:41,520
Uh, uh, I you know what? I'm on such a star trek high after the season of pacard

1016
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,640
I just like I don't even care about this show anymore

1017
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:51,120
This episode or not the episode this this to this donnie marie, uh-huh I go star trek's better, you know

1018
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,440
Than donnie and marie. No star wars in general. Wait, sorry. Okay. I'm on such a better than star wars

1019
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,680
Yeah, yeah, i'm not such a star trek kick right now. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's in my star trek phase. Mm-hmm

1020
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,920
So what has anything happened recently with star wars that would devalue?

1021
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,720
Your opinion of it somehow

1022
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,640
There's just a lot

1023
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,840
Maybe I like some of it. I like some of it

1024
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:20,640
I believe sir. We just discussed vect no crew. That's true. I like that. He has capable

1025
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,000
We played by flee. I do but if you were a star trek fan

1026
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:31,040
You right now had a season of star trek pacard where all your old favorites and when I say old favorites, I mean old

1027
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,680
Favorites are back together on their spoiler alert old ship

1028
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,800
And anyone who likes any of this is like riding a high

1029
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,720
It's all anybody wants to talk about if they are the fan of this persuasion

1030
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:51,300
Whoa, so you're saying you can go home again. You're saying it's not true that sometimes things are here today going tomorrow

1031
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,080
Wow a red foxesque walk

1032
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,400
Even somehow even slower than

1033
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,240
Executed yeah, I guess let's finish out though talking about this. Yeah. Yeah, let's get to the end here

1034
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,080
Uh, um, so there's a leaving on a jet vader leaves and they sing leaving they sing leaving a jet plane

1035
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:18,080
Basically just the song they don't even really change anything about it. Yeah, that's what I can I understand star wars

1036
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,240
It's that movie about jet planes

1037
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,040
Yeah, you got it. Yes

1038
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,360
Uh for whatever like they couldn't even be bothered to write an original song

1039
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,240
Like for this or or like use the star wars theme and put lyrics to it or something

1040
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,200
With bill murray's famous saturday night live

1041
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:41,120
Sketch he put lyrics to star wars. They didn't have they they weren't innovating like that. Right?

1042
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:47,360
Um, they they didn't think anyone would recognize the song. We know it's popular songs of the day. That's true

1043
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,320
Um, so yeah, there's a big number everyone's on stage

1044
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,920
Everyone's celebrating pauline is in is in like he's roped they tie him tie his hands in rope

1045
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,480
He's like tighter, please

1046
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,960
Is that all you got

1047
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:11,200
If I if I'd known this is where things were heading I would have I would have been a little more bad land ahead

1048
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:20,160
No one did it like pauline by which I mean no one has ever delivered dialogue in that fashion before since

1049
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,040
Well, except for ronda santas

1050
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:30,480
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there hasn't been such a good shaking head delivery since the recent ronda santas press interviews. Yes

1051
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:35,920
He's the new king he's the new if he was more pauline desk i'd be in favor yeah

1052
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,520
But I just sent this

1053
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,600
Paul would send him up if he was still around

1054
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,840
And i'm sure bruce too. I mean bruce is around but I don't know

1055
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,360
He's not really writing on these type of shows anymore. There hasn't been as of this recording

1056
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:57,600
There hasn't been a de santas on snl and lauren's probably like we need a lind type. Yeah, we don't have a lind. That's true

1057
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,160
uh, um, so

1058
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:06,640
anyway, this uh, uh was a special I didn't know I didn't know about it it popped up on instagram and I went well

1059
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,720
This feels right up our alley and of course as always all of our characters appear

1060
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,360
It's almost as like we make them wish on a piece of like we see some schlocky thing

1061
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:21,520
We make a wish and then like michael eisner appears. We make a wish in a wishing cave in a wishing cave

1062
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:29,600
If you see yeah if you see something on it's like I guess we're drawn to our type of stuff in our guys

1063
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,560
and not the guys in the sense of like

1064
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:38,480
Tillman for tita guys our other guys and we still have yet to differentiate between types of guys

1065
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,320
But these are also our guys like capital g and lowercase g

1066
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,360
Is the capital for the I think is bad. Yeah, so the villains are bad

1067
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:51,280
So bruce and thurl and paul are lowercase g's. Yeah, there are there

1068
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:57,840
You're this is mark marron guys as opposed to these are these are our guys. That's good. Okay, that's a good distinction. Uh,

1069
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,880
My question is here. I just just let's let's wind it down. But

1070
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,720
one thing that I like about this is that

1071
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,600
It like I kind of like that. They just dove in not knowing the mythology

1072
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:16,640
I think it's crazy how people are too strict and serious about mythology of this or anything

1073
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,600
If this kind of show was on today

1074
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,480
more recent property

1075
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,040
How do we do how do we do a musical number?

1076
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:33,120
That paul lind can factor into and play a part in yes. Yes, that's I mean star wars especially right now is yes

1077
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,200
There's too much. There's no there's no hoopla. There's no

1078
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,080
fun party happening with it

1079
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:45,040
Um versus the gorn on the star trek cruise who's just like an alcoholic party monster

1080
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:50,480
You know, there's that at least and like the lower dex is a show with people we know that are on it

1081
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,880
And I actually i've watched a little of it and it's like a weird

1082
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,880
They're a little it's a little looser over there in star trek land is what i'm trying to say

1083
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,880
Yeah, yeah, they get to have a little more fun. Yes. It is not lower dex in the success of it proof

1084
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,960
That if you have a little more fun, it's a little it might pay off just sometimes

1085
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:09,440
That the one that's flashing to me, I mean in terms of a lind part

1086
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,100
And like obviously and it's like it's a it's a serious mythology

1087
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,320
Uh, it's a very like there are no laughs in avatar

1088
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,080
So if there was if there was something on today to do like a very

1089
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,040
Avatar

1090
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:29,680
variety kind of song and it's maybe it's then you gotta have lind as

1091
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,800
Uh avatar corich

1092
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,240
And there's gotta be some well, it's do you have the pitch?

1093
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:41,360
I'll let you do it. Uh, because like he would have his own like kind of reveal moment because if you've seen avatar two

1094
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,720
Uh, you know quarich is now and as a navi

1095
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,880
So at this point paul wakes up he's blue and he goes i'm blue

1096
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,520
Like that's what else you want

1097
01:16:56,160 --> 01:17:02,160
Yeah, yeah perfect. Well, I guess you want like I mean this implies that all these people are still alive

1098
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:06,160
But you need like oh well paul williams is spider. Oh my god

1099
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:11,520
I was gonna say paul in his grown-up spider. Oh, no, not grown up. I cut the hair

1100
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,760
Let's do high maintenance

1101
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:20,000
Let's do the de-aging thing with like harrison ford in the indiana jolt like let's do that with paul now so he can play

1102
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:25,120
Himself when he was younger as spider still around so he could do it. That's what i'm saying

1103
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:30,180
Yeah, yeah, do it like mark hamill and mandalorian de-aged. Yeah, do that technology

1104
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:36,960
And have paul play his younger self as spider and he's what he sings like you're walking into spider webs

1105
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,960
Leave a misagenda call you back. Yes like an old time

1106
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:52,080
Yeah, well his spider is always spinning his webs right villains are getting caught in I think it's great that's great

1107
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,080
Yeah, I was still hung up on um

1108
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,880
paul linden star wars

1109
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:02,160
Because then I in my head I just started saying thron. I don't know what's wrong with this thron today

1110
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,760
About admiral thron the extended universe

1111
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,520
Yeah that they're begrudgingly putting in the tv show well not well, so felony's not

1112
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,280
This is a whole other conversation. That's the timothy's on he likes it

1113
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:19,200
Yeah, timothy's on wrote these three novels that are kind of some people consider the actual

1114
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,840
I haven't read them. I know the stories, but I haven't read them because again i'm not a reader like jason is

1115
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,280
um, but

1116
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:30,640
There's three novels that are sort of what happens after the main trilogy and to a lot of people that's you know

1117
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,840
Lucas mary damara jade these these other characters that were thrown out when they made the disney sequels

1118
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,280
And the main villain of the whole of all three of them are a guy is a guy named grand admiral thron

1119
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,920
He's a blue guy and they have I think he's appeared on the mandalorian or boba fat

1120
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,200
I think he's been in some of the cartoons some of the three yes, he's for sure been in there

1121
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:55,360
But like he's going to be uh the villain for whatever so jason is imagining paul and singing about him

1122
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,200
Grand admiral thron the only you guys can answer this is paul linda thron

1123
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,080
Well thron seems scared no

1124
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,940
Thrawn seems a little colder paul's a little more bombastic

1125
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:14,560
So so what 70s the people are dying to know what 70s variety show mainstay could be thron. Oh, gregory peck

1126
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:20,000
Did gregory beck do that many varieties I think he was on some I could be wrong

1127
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,120
But a lot of the johnny cash. I mean, that's the thing there. Yeah, they did all do this kind of thing

1128
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,520
They were all on stuff. Um

1129
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:32,960
So, yeah, there's a lot yes if if we were doing extended universe stuff vincent price

1130
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:40,960
Yeah, great price is good, but it would be funny to see paul linden the big white officer outfit and the blue face paint

1131
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,880
Yeah, well

1132
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,800
Would be a joy to see him doing anything. Yeah, quite frankly. Um, so

1133
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:53,200
Yeah, I was I have this is one of those things where I have to say something that I don't want to open up

1134
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,840
I just have to say it get out of my head because I was just reading about it

1135
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:01,680
Are you breaking up with us or something? What's going on? I'm so sorry. I'm leaving this podcast to do a star trek podcast

1136
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,720
Look, I probably will not make fun of the armin shimmerman story again

1137
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,400
I like I can't handle it

1138
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:11,440
My mental health is taking a toll when that story gets mocked because every morning I wake up and think it's a good story

1139
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:17,920
I'm gonna do it again next time one of these days. They're gonna get it. They don't understand. Uh, no, no, uh,

1140
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,000
Just we're talking about the thron trilogy. I was reading about the shatner verse

1141
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,720
Which is a oh tech war no

1142
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,720
But I love tech war and I want to do an episode about tech war eventually

1143
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:34,880
Can I start packing up the gear? Well, you guys go turn your mic off and we can be done with my laptop

1144
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,040
William shatter's tech war is another original show that he had which we need to talk about

1145
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,680
Uh, it's a future show with no budget about a illegal drug called tech

1146
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,480
Everyone is good looking for tech

1147
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:52,880
William shatter is like not the star but the main character is a character named jimmy johnny cardigan

1148
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,840
johnny cardigan is like on the like stopping people from dealing tech

1149
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,920
And yes, it's not track. It's tech t. E. K

1150
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,920
William shatter's tech war. Hey, i'm really sorry about this

1151
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,640
And there's so much

1152
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:16,160
I gotta find a moment to distance myself from mike here. This is what I want to talk about but tech war there's many shows graphic novels books

1153
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,600
I'm sure william shatter never wrote a word of them, but he is credited as that speaking of william shatter's writing though

1154
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:27,120
However, I do want to talk about you're not done eight or nine novels called the shatter verse that william shatter

1155
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,200
Is credited as the writer on where he writes?

1156
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,920
Himself his character captain kirk coming back to life after star trek generations

1157
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:41,760
And they call these books the shatter verse and he has a whole nother alternative narrative where captain kirk thrives and has

1158
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,240
other adventures past

1159
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:48,800
And there are eight or nine. It's just like him and captain picard going on adventures and he is the writer

1160
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,240
I'm sure they're ghost written though, but this is this is like the

1161
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:58,400
Your adventures of still talking about this after we leave the room. Yes, leave the microphones on yes

1162
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,440
And yes, I also honestly think I thought I thought mike was down for the count

1163
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:09,680
But then he came back to life and got to talk about the entire shatter. He's talking about a played straight garth

1164
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,740
Marengi's dark place

1165
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:13,740
Satin

1166
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:16,140
It is not funny. I think i'm full honestly

1167
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:20,060
I I do have I kind of think a full podcast about william shatter's career

1168
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:25,740
Is sustainable. Oh just an entire what you mean a sat not to say i'm not distancing my say

1169
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:31,020
This is a separate podcast. Yeah. Yeah, but it's probably a good idea. There's so much on there. Yeah. Yeah

1170
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:34,700
No, you're getting into music. I like to work band. It has been I love it

1171
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:38,540
It's gonna be a long long time. Yes

1172
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:40,940
Um, he's got like 12 albums

1173
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:48,540
Wow, this man does not want to die and he is so adamant not to die. He will take anything that is offered

1174
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:54,860
Uh, so anyway, you mean tech well tech to keep himself alive

1175
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:03,500
Wait and and by the way, uh, if if paulin was in a tech war, um variety

1176
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:09,020
Skits yes. Yes. Um, geez, what can what does a guy got to do to get some tech around here?

1177
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:13,180
