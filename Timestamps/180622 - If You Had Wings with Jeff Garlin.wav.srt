1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Warning, today's episode does not feature me, Scott Gardner.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,740
Much like an experimental eight passenger DeLorean, the podcast has been hijacked by

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,660
a devil may care stowaway named Jeff Garland.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,200
As I am trapped like a rat in my own office, I cannot guarantee the podcast will stay strictly

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,520
on the very important topic, defunct Eastern Airlines branded ride, If You Had Wings.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,620
Mike, Jason, Jeff Garland, the fate of the podcast is in your hands.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:52,220
This is If You Had Wings on Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,560
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three childless men in their

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,960
30s, one of which was recently reprimanded by a Disneyland cast member for running in

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
the park.

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,760
I'm of course talking about myself, my name is Mike Carlson, I'm 34 years old.

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,400
Joining me is always Jason Sheridan.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Hello.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
When did that happen?

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,680
That happened two weeks ago and it was at the end of the park and I was trying to make

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,080
it to Big Thunder Mountain, it was 1157 right before the park closes and if you get in line

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,200
before 12, they let you ride.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,240
So my girlfriend and I sprinted from Indiana Jones and they were like, sir, don't run in

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
the park.

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
You can't do that.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
You're an adult man.

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,280
Did you stop or did you keep running?

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,800
I slowed down a bit, but I didn't.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Did you make it?

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Oh yeah, we made it.

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
All right, then you're good.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Yeah, 59.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,320
This voice joining us, a very special guest today.

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,560
This man has many credits, but for the purposes of this podcast, the only one we care about

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,720
is Buttercup, the voice on the Toy Story Midway Mania Ride.

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,640
Oh yes, because you're in the park.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
It's not about Disney.

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Yeah, we don't even talk about the park.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
It's about the movies, yeah.

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,040
Right, so because otherwise you would add other Pixar shit.

36
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,560
And I was also in the Computer War tennis shoes, the remake.

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Oh wow.

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Kirk Cameron.

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Really?

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Yeah.

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Wow, I didn't know that.

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Yeah.

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
How was that?

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Fun.

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Okay.

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Yeah, that's good.

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
I've done lots of weird stuff.

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Yeah, you're in Wall-E, of course.

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,080
You're the captain in Wall-E, which is a crazy good movie.

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Yeah, that's, well, that's, I would actually, I don't often say stuff like this.

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
That's a great movie.

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Yes.

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Oh yeah, agreed.

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
So is Toy Story 3.

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Toy Story 3 is, yeah.

56
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
He is great too.

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm happy to call things good and I'm happy to say when things stink.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sure.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,400
You know, I'm lucky enough to be in a few great things.

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Yeah.

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,840
Lucky is the word.

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
Sure.

63
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,560
I looked right before we did this, I looked at YouTube and I found your dialogue from

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
the ride.

65
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Do you remember?

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,880
Oh, from the Toy Story 3?

67
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Do you remember this?

69
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,240
Was it part of another recording session?

70
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,000
No, it was all, it was strictly for the ride that I went to.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,520
I went to a place where they had, when I recorded this, I saw the Cars Land, like they had it

72
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
on a table.

73
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Wow.

74
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,040
In a big room, a giant room.

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,000
They had the whole, the mountain and you know, all that stuff.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Sure.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,280
That wasn't built yet and they were showing me all that.

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,680
So I was at like some place where they do ride recording and show you.

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,840
Was it possibly in Glendale, California?

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
It was in Glendale, yeah.

81
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
That's what Imagineering is.

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,280
Imagineering, it was at Disney Imagineering.

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
That's where I went.

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,000
I went there with our co-host Scott who couldn't make it today.

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,200
But we went there because an Imagineer invited us and she was horrified by how nerdy we were.

86
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,440
She works there and she'd be like, well, you guys don't want to see this room full of pictures

87
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
of Imagineers.

88
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,480
And we're like, oh, well that's Imagineer Bob Gurr on the wall there and over there's Tony

89
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,680
Baxter and she just had this like look on her face.

90
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,000
While we were at the campus though, it was clear that she had to go back to work and

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,960
Jason wanted to go get a sandwich from the commissary.

92
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,720
I really wanted to get a commissary sandwich.

93
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,360
He can't do what's going to take forever and he's like, she's got time.

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
And we were waiting.

95
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
She did have time.

96
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,200
She was in line for Starbucks and I was in line for a sandwich.

97
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,840
We had like an hour and we spent most of the time in the gift shop because that's the only

98
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,800
thing they let you see because you can buy the special merchandise that's only available

99
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,760
to Imagineering.

100
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,280
So we were let loose in that gift shop and we spent like 45 minutes in there.

101
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,640
Was there a lot of good stuff?

102
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
There was a lot of good stuff.

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
Was there anything that I would want in that gift shop?

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,600
I'm trying to think.

105
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
You're Mr. Haunted Mansion.

106
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,720
Well yeah, I'm Haunted Mansion but what I generally do is I buy things then give them

107
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
away.

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm sure there was like-

109
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,000
You've learned that from me because you've-

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I've gotten, yes.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, you've got on the table there is a Beatles Hot Wheel that I'm giving you.

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Brand new in the package.

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,240
Yes, and when we went to the park, which we'll talk about in a second, you got a lot of Haunted

115
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,320
Mansion stuff and you just gave me the shirt.

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
You bought a Haunted Mansion shirt.

117
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Shirt.

118
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
I gave it to you.

119
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
I gave it to you.

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
I gave you something else too, didn't I?

121
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
I think, well, I think you were giving away a lot of stuff.

122
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm not sure.

123
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
But I bought you stuff then too, right?

124
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Did I buy you something from there?

125
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't think I, nothing specific that I requested.

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay.

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I thought I did.

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But you did offer that which was insanely nice which-

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm a generous young lady.

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,480
A very generous young lady.

132
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Yeah.

133
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,080
Of America's top ten generous young ladies.

134
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,920
That was just voted recently by Granddaughter Magazine.

135
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,720
It's a great publication.

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Yeah.

137
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
I suggest everyone read it.

138
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Yeah.

139
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Subscribe.

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
They need your subscription.

141
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
That's where the real money is for magazines.

143
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
For who?

144
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
For which magazines?

145
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
For any magazine.

146
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
For any magazine specific.

147
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Granddaughter Magazine.

148
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Granddaughter Magazine.

149
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
That's what I'm saying.

150
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Of course.

151
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Come on, Jason.

153
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Yeah.

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Yeah, so-

155
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Jason, you write for Granddaughter Magazine.

156
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm surprised that you-

157
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
I'm a stringer.

158
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,040
I haven't earned my, I haven't made my dues yet.

159
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,720
I haven't earned my chops yet to get them all in staff.

160
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
A staff of where?

161
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,400
Granddaughter Magazine.

162
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
It's never not funny and it's never not gonna be funny.

163
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,640
If you're listening now and you don't think Granddaughter Magazine's funny, I'm gonna

164
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
stop listening.

165
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Yeah, that's it.

166
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Yeah.

167
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Get out of here if you don't.

168
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Get out.

169
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Because that's gonna come up a lot today.

170
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
It might.

171
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
It's a funny phrase.

172
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,080
Do you imagine it being a publication for granddaughters or made by granddaughters?

173
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
That's what I would like to know.

174
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Both.

175
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Okay, vote.

176
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Yeah.

177
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,080
There's a lot of granddaughter pride and the last page is always a different message

178
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,120
to, it's called Message to a Granddaughter and it's written by a grandmother.

179
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Oh, okay.

180
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
That's the back page.

181
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Again, you should know that, Jason.

182
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
You worked there.

183
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
You worked there.

184
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,120
You were in the commissary in the gift shop every time I come by.

185
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,280
I was thinking about the older publication where the last page is always Stephen King

186
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,720
writing about something he likes.

187
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,960
Yeah, Stephen King loved the, he wrote great granddaughter stories better than anybody.

188
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,800
And by the way, I am saying specifically great granddaughter stories.

189
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,160
Not great as in how good they are.

190
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
He wrote great granddaughter stories, but better than anybody.

191
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,200
By the way, his great granddaughter stories were possibly great.

192
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,480
Yeah, I think they were.

193
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,280
He wrote great, great granddaughter stories, but he never wrote any stories about a great,

194
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
great granddaughter.

195
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Yeah.

196
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,280
I mean that, but he still has time.

197
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,040
Yeah, he's got lots of time.

198
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,160
I think that that's, look, if the fans demand it, I think he'll do it.

199
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,640
Write great, great granddaughter stories for granddaughter magazine.

200
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,120
I mean it's, yeah, come on.

201
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Come on, Jason.

202
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,120
I know you have listeners right now that I'm already irritating and they hate me and they're

203
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,560
thinking why did they have them on the show?

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
I love that.

205
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,040
No, they're not thinking that.

206
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Okay.

207
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,800
But actually if they're listening to your show, I think they probably find that stuff

208
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
funny.

209
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Yeah, I think so.

210
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,280
You know, it's podcasts are not, you know, you make a choice to listen to a podcast.

211
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Oh yeah.

212
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,280
And it's just, I mean most podcasts are exclusively tangents.

213
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Yeah.

214
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Yeah.

215
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,920
So around your, so this is what you say.

216
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,400
Do you remember saying this?

217
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,960
You say, I think, knock down the animals.

218
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,000
And then you say, nicely done.

219
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,820
Then you say, hurry, you're running out of time.

220
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:52,020
Then you count down in this, in like simultaneously with Ham and Rex, which is Wallace Shawn and

221
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,720
John Ratzenberger.

222
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,160
And then you say, I think great way to play.

223
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
And then that's it.

224
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Okay.

225
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,720
I probably recorded 75 more lines.

226
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,520
Those are the ones that you...

227
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,040
Because I remember I was there at least for probably an hour, you know, recording.

228
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,080
And it wasn't like, do it with more, like I got it like first or second time.

229
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,260
It's my voice.

230
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,280
The intent is pretty obvious.

231
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,260
So I recorded a lot of stuff, I'm sure.

232
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
Did they let you ad lib?

233
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
Do you remember?

234
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,520
No, there was, it's a ride.

235
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,640
I don't know how much they're not going to, it's not like a movie where they'll change

236
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,760
the ride based on what Jeff said is so funny.

237
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,160
All right, everyone get in the airplane.

238
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,840
Like, hey, good shooting.

239
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,000
You ought to write for granddaughter magazine.

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,080
Well, you can't give them that gold, you know, they're not going to pay you for reuse rights

241
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,320
on granddaughter magazine.

242
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
No, no, no.

243
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Yeah.

244
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
So it was just pretty standard.

245
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,360
But when you first, were you moved when you saw the ride?

246
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,240
How like when you were, when you wrote, you've written it, right?

247
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
You've played the game.

248
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I've written it many times.

249
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
I did.

250
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
It was closed when we were there.

251
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
It was closed when we were there?

252
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Yeah.

253
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Mike and I went to Disneyland, what about two months ago?

254
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
About two months ago, yeah.

255
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Yeah, it was awesome.

256
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
It was amazing.

257
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,800
And what was great for me was watching you with our guide, who knew more.

258
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,320
I feel you knew more, but he knew a ton.

259
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,560
He knew a ton.

260
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,380
He was so impressed with you.

261
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,360
He was so impressed with you.

262
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,000
That's the truth.

263
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's the truth.

264
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He's like, I can't believe this.

265
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He kept saying to me.

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He couldn't.

267
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
Nobody ever, people claim to know.

268
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,920
He knows, you know.

269
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,480
I said, I think it was early we were waiting for Soren and I said something about Tony

270
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,720
Baxter, who's like one of the big Imagineer guys.

271
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,000
And he was like, oh, I know.

272
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,160
Now I could, he could see it in my eyes.

273
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,600
But also how about going up to Walt Disney's, uh, well above the fire stage.

274
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
You want to save that for later?

275
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,920
Well, no, we've, we've, we may as well talk about it now.

276
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,720
So you guys went down.

277
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,600
So we, we went down and, and, um, because of, because I'm on an ABC show, because I

278
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,800
work for Pixar, I get a guide to really nice.

279
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,480
It's a better than a nice perk.

280
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,680
It's an amazing perk.

281
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,880
So I walk around the park and I've never had a guide that was less than wonderful.

282
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Yeah.

283
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,320
I mean, they're always so smart, so kind, so thoughtful.

284
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,240
They're nice to whoever I bring.

285
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,280
But Mike, I had promised I was going to take him.

286
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,600
We had talked about it for a while and it was just he and I, no one else.

287
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,920
But for me, it was him and the guide and I was tagging along because I didn't care about

288
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:36,840
most of the information, but I got such great joy from their excitement at the information

289
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,440
because you gave that guy information too.

290
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,120
Both of you were like, it was like they're a building on one another.

291
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
It was amazing.

292
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,760
It was like my first day of granddaughter.

293
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Of magical time.

294
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,520
That was great.

295
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,800
This was a plaid too.

296
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,080
This is a full, they call it plaids.

297
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,280
So a guide basically like you can get, anybody can get a guide.

298
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,600
It's just, it's an indulgence and I've never done it before.

299
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,920
And a nice young man or lady walks around the park and get you basically on the rides.

300
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,920
You get on the ride quick, you get a reservation.

301
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,760
I treated him to lunch because I wanted to watch the two of you talk more.

302
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Sure.

303
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,600
You know, it was nothing short of a delightful day.

304
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,960
It was wonderful.

305
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,520
And he like, he gets on a phone too.

306
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,800
This is fascinating to me is that he'll say like, if there's something you want to do,

307
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
he'll call ahead and he has to negotiate with people.

308
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,600
Yeah, with his bosses and stuff.

309
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,280
So he's like your consigliere or he's like Robert Duvall and the godfather.

310
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Can Jeff do this?

311
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,840
And we ended up making our way above the fire station.

312
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
So early on.

313
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
And seeing Walt's apartment.

314
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Yeah.

315
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Early on I said like, okay, here's the deal.

316
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,700
I've been here a lot, but if there's anything I've never done, I'm talking about the Matterhorn

317
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
basketball court.

318
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,740
I'm talking about Walt's apartment.

319
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,120
If any of that stuff is possible, let us know.

320
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,920
You got as close as anyone could get to the Matterhorn because you got lots of information.

321
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,760
You got people who had been on it.

322
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,920
Everybody was open, which they normally wouldn't be in talking about it.

323
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Yes.

324
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
We went up to the Matterhorn.

325
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,120
It was for some reason down when we walked.

326
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,800
And I walked, you told me you were like, go up and ask to see the basketball court to

327
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
the employees.

328
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,960
And I go, hey, can I come up and see the basketball court?

329
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,360
And they're like, no, really only people who work on it can see it.

330
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,280
Because Jack, our guide, hadn't seen it either.

331
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Yeah.

332
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,680
But apparently only something that people work.

333
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,120
It's not super easy to get to.

334
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Yes.

335
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
It's not super easy to get to.

336
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,320
And it's like a rare, it's a rare treat.

337
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,800
And I think it's also like not a real basketball court.

338
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,660
It's just like a little half court.

339
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,360
But the thing is Walt's apartment is so much better than that.

340
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Oh yeah.

341
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,640
So he told us like in the middle of the day, he's like, can we, was it okay if we go at

342
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
the end of the day?

343
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
And we're like, of course.

344
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,920
Yeah, we had no, that's also by the exit.

345
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,680
So it's a perfect thing to do at the end of the day.

346
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,000
It was a perfect close.

347
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,200
And he, I remember he, he was like, all right.

348
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,960
And he's like, I feel like he whispered it too, like it was something we were, cause

349
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,040
he was like, it's not usually for guides.

350
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,400
It's usually for like a historical tour.

351
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,440
He goes, but go wait over by the fire station.

352
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Yeah.

353
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,040
And I'm going to go get the keys.

354
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,280
And we were like, Ooh, like I felt like glee, like pure glee.

355
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,200
So we went over there and you go just exit out by the fire station.

356
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,080
You walk up the stairs into this tiny apartment.

357
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
In the back of the fire station.

358
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,880
Yes, in the back of the fire station.

359
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,600
And then you go into this old, well-preserved apartment.

360
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,440
It looks like an apartment from like the thirties.

361
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Yes.

362
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
It's not the thirties.

363
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
It looks like the thirties.

364
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Yes.

365
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,880
It's very old and it feels, it feels ghostly in there, but I think it's because all the

366
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
decorum is still.

367
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
No, it feels ghostly.

368
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
It does.

369
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,080
It feels, that's a great way to describe it because it's got that old time phonograph.

370
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Yes.

371
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,920
And then where the dishes are in the sink and then the shower.

372
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,520
Like we saw the whole place.

373
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,020
It's very tiny.

374
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
It's so small.

375
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,720
It was much smaller than I thought it would be.

376
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,220
It's really extraordinarily small.

377
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,480
Like it's tiny.

378
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
It's like, I think it's small.

379
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,280
Like my first like shitty studio apartment in LA, I think it's smaller than that.

380
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Right.

381
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,560
It's a small studio apartment.

382
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,360
Which yours also was covered in like phonographs and like lace doilies.

383
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
No, that's your apartment.

384
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,080
By the way, there are lace doilies.

385
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
It's like that.

386
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Yes, of course.

387
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,160
It's really that, it's what you imagine it to be.

388
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,480
But then there were pictures and then they, like Walt and his family hang out here.

389
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,080
All the children, grandchildren too, if I'm not mistaken.

390
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Perhaps grandchildren.

391
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
They were there.

392
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,600
Like there's a lot of people in a very small room.

393
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Yeah.

394
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,040
And they had, he told us that Walt and his wife, Lillian, had separate beds.

395
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,600
They just had two couches.

396
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Like there's no room in beds.

397
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
They would just pull out couches.

398
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,300
But not only would they pull out couches, but they were on opposite sides of the room.

399
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Like I Love Lucy or something.

400
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
No, it was different.

401
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Lucy and Desi were next to each other.

402
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
Their beds were pretty close.

403
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,300
These were far.

404
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,000
But that's the way it had to be set up.

405
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,980
It's like you couldn't have done one.

406
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,640
And I know they crawled into each other's beds and made love all night long.

407
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Walt loved that.

408
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
Yeah, of course.

409
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,920
Walt reminded him of when he, he started Granddaughter Magazine and it reminded him of the early

410
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,200
days where he slept in the office.

411
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,520
But then he lost the rights to Granddaughter Magazine.

412
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Yep.

413
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,760
When he used, no, he sold Granddaughter Magazine to help play Pay for Disneyland.

414
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Oh, right.

415
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
That's right.

416
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
You always forget that.

417
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
And Roy told him not to, but...

418
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Roy stayed on.

419
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Roy was always the sensible one.

420
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,440
Roy stayed on at Granddaughter for a lot longer than people know.

421
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Yeah.

422
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,400
Crazy, he was able to hold down two jobs.

423
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
I know, it was amazing.

424
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Walt Disney and Granddaughter Magazine.

425
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,120
Roy was always the unsung hero of the Disney story.

426
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
I met Roy.

427
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
Did you?

428
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Yeah.

429
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
The young Roy, obviously, not the older.

430
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,920
There's two, because Roy E. Disney was the younger one, right?

431
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,400
Wait, I met a very old man named Roy.

432
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,800
I think that's probably Roy's son.

433
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,500
Because Roy was Walt's brother who was older.

434
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Older than Walt.

435
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Older than Walt.

436
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Roy's son, yes.

437
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Yeah, Roy's son, Roy E.

438
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
He was involved with the company.

439
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,720
Yeah, I met him at something, a couple things.

440
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Sure.

441
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,480
I've been involved with Disney for a long time.

442
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:59,960
I was on the very first, when ABC became part of Disney, I did a pilot for Disney that was

443
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,920
the very first show that they ever did, that Disney, ABC ever did.

444
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Wow.

445
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
It didn't get picked up.

446
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,840
It was a mid-30s version of, it was like an old, actually late 30s version of Friends.

447
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
I'm not making this up.

448
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Really?

449
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,320
It was like an older group of Friends, the same sort of thing.

450
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,520
And you were regular on it?

451
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Yeah.

452
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Wow.

453
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
What was it called?

454
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
It was just a pilot.

455
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
It didn't get picked up.

456
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Grandma, granddaughter magazine.

457
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
No, I really don't remember what it was called.

458
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't remember much of it.

459
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,320
Any other, do you remember any other cast members?

460
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Chip and Dale?

461
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
No, I really don't remember.

462
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
I don't.

463
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Wow.

464
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
We're going to look into this.

465
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
We're going to see if this is available maybe.

466
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
Yeah.

467
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
See if it's somewhere.

468
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
It's got to be somewhere.

469
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
James Burroughs directed it.

470
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
I remember.

471
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
That's usually a good luck charm.

472
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
I know you'd think.

473
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Yeah.

474
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,720
So for this Disneyland trip, we were talking, like Jack and I were being very, I didn't

475
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,000
feel like we were trying to outdo each other in knowledge.

476
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,320
His name's Jack, right?

477
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Yeah, Jack.

478
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Yeah, he's such a good guy.

479
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
And he-

480
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,240
No, you weren't trying to out, you were just- excuse me.

481
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Use the term.

482
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,400
You were getting off on how each of you-

483
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,960
You know what I mean though?

484
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

485
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,400
You both loved how each of you knew and you would get more and more excited.

486
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,800
And it wasn't even like you were testing each other.

487
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,600
You were like, do you know about this?

488
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,720
And like, of course you know about it.

489
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,560
And then when you guys didn't know something that the other one said, you got so blown

490
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
away.

491
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,400
But not in a, ha ha, I got you.

492
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,240
But in a, wow, how about that information?

493
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Yeah.

494
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,600
It was delightful.

495
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Thank you.

496
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,640
I do- you said at one point that this was your second favorite Disneyland day ever.

497
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Yes.

498
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Do you remember?

499
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,160
Yes, it was my second favorite of all time.

500
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,560
And do you remember what your first was?

501
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
You told me a little bit about it.

502
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
Yes, correct.

503
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,040
It was, it was not grad night.

504
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
I had a great grad night.

505
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
It was Disney World.

506
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,200
By the way, that was my second favorite Disney.

507
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,880
That was probably my favorite Disneyland trip, to be honest.

508
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,480
Disney World, I had a better trip when I was like, I'll say 15.

509
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,760
I went with a group of kids, like on a youth trip from my temple or something.

510
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,240
And I remember having the best time because I was not following directions.

511
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Right.

512
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,880
You felt like you could like go wild a little bit at the park.

513
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
I went wild.

514
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,000
I went wild and I had a great time.

515
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,260
It was the most fun I'd ever had at the park.

516
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,260
You were number two.

517
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,260
Well, that's pretty good.

518
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,260
Pretty good.

519
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
So think about it.

520
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,260
I was 55.

521
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,260
I'm 56 now.

522
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,260
I've had a birthday since then.

523
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,260
Happy birthday.

524
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,260
Happy birthday.

525
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,120
55 and 15.

526
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,720
So my favorite trip was 15, second favorite 55.

527
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,560
And in between, I'd say I've been to the park at least a dozen times, if not more, which

528
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,920
I know for a lot of people who have the passes, that's not a big deal.

529
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:54,200
But for normal people, I mean, I'd probably, I bet you even more than that.

530
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,680
I mean, since I lived in LA, I go at least once a year.

531
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,080
I'm planning on going again in July, actually.

532
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
I love it there.

533
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
See, that's the thing too.

534
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
I love it.

535
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,760
The only thing that gets a little bit weird for me is I don't go on the scary rides.

536
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:15,120
So I'll sit there and when I sit there, if I say anything or I get recognized by one

537
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,800
person, it sort of opens up a thing of like a lot of people.

538
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,480
But look, I'm honored to be recognized and honored to talk to the people.

539
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,480
But it can be unsettling at times.

540
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,600
It's like a line forms.

541
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Sometimes, yes.

542
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Yeah.

543
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
It's weird.

544
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Yes.

545
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,920
Well, no, it's like I said, Chip and Dale.

546
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,200
It's like I'm one of the characters.

547
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,680
Here, come take a photo.

548
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,800
And I just take photos with people over and over and over again.

549
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Yeah.

550
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,720
You would wait for me a lot of times.

551
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Yeah.

552
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
It was tough.

553
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,120
Thank God when my kids were little, really little, and I took them to Disneyland.

554
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,280
I didn't have to deal with that.

555
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,320
But as they got older, I remember the last time was kind of a drag.

556
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,760
Did the kids, did you guys go often?

557
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,120
Also, would you bring the kids?

558
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,800
The kids love it as much as every kid?

559
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,680
Oh my God, my kids love Disneyland.

560
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Yeah.

561
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Yeah.

562
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,680
Oh my God.

563
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Yeah, of course.

564
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,000
We went, I went and I've stayed overnight before.

565
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,920
No, I love Disneyland.

566
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,740
And there, by the way, as you guys know, there are people out there who don't like it.

567
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,400
And I'm like, what's wrong with you?

568
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,440
And they think I'm nuts.

569
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,560
Like I think my record for going in a year is twice, which is plenty for someone who

570
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,000
doesn't have an annual pass.

571
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You know what I mean?

572
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Right.

573
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,040
But I love it.

574
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,200
Oh my God.

575
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
And that doesn't even include the number of times I've been to downtown Disney.

576
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Oh yeah.

577
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,280
In addition to being at Disneyland.

578
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,880
Do you have a favorite downtown Disney spot?

579
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,840
I've never been to Epcot, by the way.

580
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Really?

581
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,160
And it was even built when I lived in Florida as a kid.

582
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,440
Never went to Epcot once.

583
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,920
Oh, that's a, that's a tragedy.

584
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Yeah.

585
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
I guess.

586
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Epcot's like my favorite place.

587
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Yeah.

588
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,760
It's fallen apart a little bit in the recent years.

589
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Yeah.

590
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
But yeah, my granddaughter works there.

591
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,160
She works at the pumpkin house.

592
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Yeah.

593
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,720
The pumpkin house, one of the best places in the world showcase.

594
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Oh my God.

595
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,840
And by the way, it's pumpkin H A U S.

596
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Yeah.

597
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Cause it's in the German.

598
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
It's in the German.

599
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
Is that your drink or my drink?

600
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
This is my drink.

601
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Oh, I don't know what I did.

602
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Did you not have a drink?

603
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
No, I did.

604
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
I don't know what I did with it.

605
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Sorry.

606
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
We can pause and you can go get it.

607
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
No, I want to stay here.

608
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
All right.

609
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
We'll stay here.

610
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
I don't want to break the flow.

611
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,960
There was a, we were, we were talking when we were at that Disneyland, I remember oftentimes

612
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,160
I would give Jack my opinions about things and I would kind of like foster him.

613
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,360
I feel like he would get like, he couldn't, couldn't, like I would say, Hey, I heard a

614
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,880
rumor or I would say, Hey, I don't care.

615
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Right.

616
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,200
Cause you can't say you heard from him.

617
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Right.

618
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Of course not.

619
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
He, no, he didn't give me any rumors.

620
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,760
But he also would be like, well, I can't deny that.

621
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Right.

622
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,400
I don't have to deny that, you know, he was delightful.

623
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
He was wonderful.

624
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
And he was very respectful.

625
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,940
Here's what I love about it.

626
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,560
And I love about you with it.

627
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:02,040
You both are very respectful of the park and the history and where it's going, where it's

628
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,920
been and he cares.

629
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,720
He cares passionately about his job.

630
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,800
I love that.

631
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,080
We yeah, he, well, we, we all the, all of us on the podcast, we don't like it when a

632
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,960
guest comes on and tells us they ever like got really like fucked up and went there.

633
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Oh, I hate that.

634
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
We feel that's disrespectful to the park.

635
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
It's so disrespectful.

636
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
That's a six flags type of thing.

637
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,080
I don't drink, you know, and I love the park.

638
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:33,080
So I mean, I could see pot enhancing my trip, but it's not something that I mean, to me

639
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,480
going to Disneyland in itself is like getting high.

640
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Yes.

641
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
I get very happy.

642
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Yes.

643
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Yeah.

644
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
And what is it?

645
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
The happiest place on earth.

646
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Of course.

647
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
Yes.

648
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,120
And also a second most fun place to granddaughter magazine.

649
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Oh, that.

650
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm sorry.

651
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,400
That wasn't funny, but we'll bring it back.

652
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
No, we won't.

653
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,480
Uh, the granddaughter magazine adheres to the classic comedy rule of a rule of a three

654
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,160
hundreds, right?

655
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,720
We went on, uh, we went on Haunted Mansion and that was the one I think that you were

656
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,800
particularly like, we went by ourselves.

657
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
You went by yourself.

658
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
I was in a car with Jack.

659
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,320
You would let me travel with just Jack and I, by the way, that is the truth.

660
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
And I'll post a picture.

661
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,240
And the things you wrote with Jack, our guide, and I wrote by myself.

662
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
Yes.

663
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,040
But when we went in the Haunted Mansion, we did the whole elevator thing alone.

664
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
We did all that alone.

665
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,440
So three, so yeah, imagine just three of us in the, he said, wow.

666
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,680
Yeah, it was really good.

667
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,720
It was three of us just empty in that elevator, which is really cool.

668
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Which is really cool.

669
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Yeah.

670
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,720
And, uh, I think that the guy who operated that room was quite uncomfortable.

671
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Really?

672
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,040
Not, not without a crowd and me looking directly at him.

673
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,480
I think you were yelling a lot too.

674
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
I was.

675
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
You were like, why is this happening?

676
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,360
I think you were like, why is this happening?

677
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,880
Like the bodies would stretch.

678
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,320
See, that's I'm fine with if you guys are in there alone.

679
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
Oh, it's hilarious.

680
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
Yes, of course.

681
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,560
I would never ruin it for other people.

682
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,040
Oh my God, no.

683
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,320
But it just is so joyous.

684
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
See that's the thing.

685
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
They say the happiest place on earth.

686
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,880
And by the way, sometimes when small kids have their, they get burnt out and their breakdowns

687
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,720
or you have problems with your girlfriend, it's not always the happiest place on earth.

688
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,480
But I got to tell you, it does its part for joy.

689
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,200
But sometimes it's hot.

690
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,040
And if you have to wait in the lines, which I don't have to do anymore, but it, I could

691
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
see it not being the happiest place.

692
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,680
And I can see a lot of people going, you know, thinking of their breakup at Disney.

693
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:39,000
I bet you Disneyland at this point has hosted so many breakups.

694
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Oh yeah, for sure.

695
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
My God.

696
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah.

697
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,760
And there's not that many people go through these places.

698
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,400
There's going to be all sorts of stuff that happens.

699
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,760
I'm sure plenty of people got engaged there.

700
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Of course.

701
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Plenty of people.

702
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't think about people having sex at Disneyland.

703
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh yeah.

704
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,560
I find it inappropriate, but I just, I just, it's natural, but I don't know how natural

705
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,760
it is for a theme park.

706
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
They had a-

707
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,080
Are you talking about at the hotels or in the park?

708
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
One of the hotels is fine.

709
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
Yeah, well the hotels are-

710
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
Yeah.

711
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,080
You know.

712
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,880
But they had, before the Matterhorn, I think I said this to Jack and he knew what I was

713
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,960
talking about.

714
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,080
Before the Matterhorn, there was a, it was just a hill of dirt and they called it holiday

715
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
hill.

716
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Oh right.

717
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
You told me that.

718
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
And that's where teens used to make out.

719
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
It's a neck.

720
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
They used to neck.

721
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Go a neck.

722
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
Yeah.

723
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
So like that was already, that-

724
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
I just love the idea of teens.

725
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Yeah, teens congregating.

726
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Teens.

727
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:37,600
Just that word so inapplicable to the miscreants that are, are, are 14 to 19 year olds that

728
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
exist.

729
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,800
I don't think of them as sweet teens.

730
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,040
I think of them as major annoyances.

731
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,160
Teens does represent, I feel like teens does like is an annoying word that really represents-

732
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,160
Well teens reminds me of old days.

733
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
Oh it does.

734
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Okay.

735
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,200
I don't look at like those, like who would ever say it was a group of teens.

736
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,600
It was a group of kids.

737
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
It was a group of-

738
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Yeah.

739
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
They were, they were spitting on me.

740
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
I don't know.

741
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,640
I bet you that's happened at Disneyland.

742
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,320
I mean I think we've talked before how we are scared of teens.

743
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,640
By the way, that's also the thing too.

744
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,080
It's so unnatural that I find them scary.

745
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
Yeah.

746
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
Yeah.

747
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,320
But that's just like a built in thing from your childhood.

748
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,240
If there's like a group of five or more teens, I'm petrified.

749
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,600
They might rag on me.

750
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,280
I'm petrified of one teen.

751
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:28,840
But by the way, it's nice if they, you know, if they, if they know who I am because they're

752
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
kinder.

753
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Sure.

754
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
Yeah.

755
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,600
If they don't know who I am, I'm just an old annoying guy.

756
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,640
The last thing I think I can remember from the trip off the top of my head is we were

757
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,280
on Soarin', which is one of your favorites.

758
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Oh, I love Soarin'.

759
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,320
And I got the candle.

760
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Yes.

761
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,200
And you, we got, yeah, we, we tried or you ordered, there's this like company that makes

762
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,120
third, they're not licensed candles.

763
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Yeah.

764
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
But they're unlicensed candle.

765
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,400
By the way, it was burning all day.

766
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Do you smell it?

767
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,920
Is it smelling here like the Haunted Mansion at all?

768
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
A little bit.

769
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
Yeah.

770
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,120
There's a Haunted Mansion candle and it's like, they don't have the exact scent, but it's

771
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
very reminiscent of it.

772
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
And it's very-

773
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
Very much so.

774
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,520
It gets you in the nostalgic Haunted Mansion mood.

775
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,440
But we were on Soarin' and you, I think you were talking to Jack or something.

776
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,280
I heard you like kind of whispering to Jack, like, this is great or something.

777
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,320
And then Tinkerbell came on the screen and you went, what?

778
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,880
It broke the world for you.

779
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,120
Because Soarin', you don't associate with Tinkerbell.

780
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Right.

781
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,920
Soarin' is like, I used to love when it was Soarin' just over California.

782
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Now it's the world.

783
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Yeah.

784
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Yeah.

785
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
And I don't like it as much.

786
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Right.

787
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,880
I used to, I really, it was, I loved the California thing.

788
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,040
Although it's really good still.

789
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
It's great.

790
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
I'll still go on it.

791
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Right.

792
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,720
But that being said, Tinkerbell, not necessary.

793
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:49,940
I mean, I really am pro Tinkerbell in any Peter Pan situation or in an animated situation.

794
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,360
But she sort of jumped out and it's good.

795
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,840
Well, she is on the California version too.

796
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,760
She was on the other version as well, but you must have forgot.

797
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
I must have forgot.

798
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
I wiped it away.

799
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Yeah.

800
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
But I'm pro Tinkerbell.

801
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Sure.

802
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Although she, I do find her one of the more annoying characters.

803
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Uh-huh.

804
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
I'm pro Sparkles.

805
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,280
Um, I was, before we talk, so we're going to talk about, sorry, what you got?

806
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,080
Well, I was going to say, uh, uh, Jeff came into play with a trip you and I took down

807
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
to the parks too.

808
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,400
Which, what are you talking about?

809
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,720
We went down a few weeks ago.

810
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,560
So we were at the parks one day and, uh-

811
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,480
Were you with him when he bought the butter cup?

812
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Oh, yes.

813
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
Yes, yes, yes.

814
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,760
So, uh, Mike, we were in a gift shop and we were looking around and he's like, oh,

815
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,980
look, there's butter cup.

816
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,960
There's a, one of Jeff's character, it took a picture and sent it to you and, uh, you

817
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,360
texted back, buy all of them.

818
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
Yes.

819
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Yeah.

820
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
Um-

821
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
I'm already, I've given away half of them.

822
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Oh, really?

823
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
Yeah.

824
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Why not?

825
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Oh, I'm not getting them for profit.

826
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
No, I give them-

827
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,360
You're not sleeping in a pile of butter cups.

828
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,360
No, but I bought it and I, yeah.

829
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Yeah.

830
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,280
So we still had a lot of hours left in the day.

831
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,000
So Mike went over to the one stand to-

832
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah, in Tomorrowland.

833
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,280
Yeah, to, well, you, in California Adventure, you went over and asked-

834
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

835
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Where you could find it.

836
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,000
And I was just sitting on a bench eating a corn dog and I was just watching you talking

837
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
to this person for-

838
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,640
Well, you love, but while this was going on, you were eating what you talk about as one

839
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
of your favorite seasonal treats at Disneyland, which is a corn dog-

840
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
Oh, this was great.

841
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
Yeah.

842
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
That you're hoping they make permanent.

843
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,920
It's like a triple, it's like a mini, like, Cajun dog and then, like, Pepper Jack cheese

844
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,720
above that and then a Hot Link corn dog above that.

845
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,560
So it's really good for you.

846
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,040
Yeah, it's really good for you.

847
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,080
I was checking to see to make sure they had them over in Tomorrowland and this one, a

848
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,960
very nice woman was checked for me and she said, yes, they did.

849
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,760
So we went to, so I was like, well, right before the park closes, I'm going to get all

850
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
these-

851
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
Right, you don't want to be walking around with them.

852
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Right.

853
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
So I-

854
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
I told you not to.

855
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Yeah, you said not to.

856
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,720
Yeah, I said, if you got to carry them around, do not buy them.

857
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,000
That image of you did not bring me joy.

858
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah.

859
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I was saying-

860
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
If I hated you, yes.

861
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It brought me joy.

862
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Sure.

863
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,360
So we got in, so I was like, you know what, I better buy them before 12 and it was like

864
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,000
11.55 and so I went in, I got all the Buttercups and then, as I said on the start of the podcast,

865
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,200
if you get in line before midnight when it closes, you can get on one more ride.

866
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,880
So we went on Space Mountain.

867
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
So I had the big-

868
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
With all the Buttercups.

869
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
With the big bag of Buttercups.

870
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
With all the Buttercups.

871
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
And I asked an employee, I go, could you like hold it to the side for a second?

872
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,760
They were like, yeah, you can keep it on the ride.

873
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,040
So I brought, I rode Space Mountain with a bag of 12 or more Buttercup dolls.

874
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
Oh, wow.

875
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Just sort of on my lap.

876
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
I need more next time you go.

877
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
Sure.

878
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Well, I'm going to go soon too.

879
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Yeah.

880
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
I can tell you where.

881
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
That'll be like for them.

882
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
They won't even know who I am.

883
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,840
But imagine, I wonder how many times people who are the animated character buy the-

884
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Buy it.

885
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,080
You know what I can't find where they really didn't market is the Captain from WALL-E,

886
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,120
like those dolls or things.

887
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,320
I got a few things and I can always find them on like Amazon or eBay, but it was not something

888
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,320
that, you know-

889
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
I guess-

890
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Kids love unicorns.

891
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
Yeah.

892
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,040
So that's an obvious choice.

893
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,040
More than how popular the character is.

894
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Yeah.

895
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,240
Before we start, so we're going to talk your favorite ride of all time if you had wings.

896
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
Yes.

897
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,480
But real quick, would you mind, you told the story on Conan about Disneyland and it involves

898
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
your son.

899
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Oh, that one.

900
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Oh, geez.

901
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
I mean, we can cut-

902
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
You know one needs to hear that.

903
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
All right, fine.

904
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
We'll cut this part out then.

905
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
No, no.

906
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
You can leave that in.

907
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,080
It's just, it's not for this.

908
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
Okay.

909
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
All right.

910
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
Check out the Team Coco website to hear this story.

911
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,440
I don't even know if it was on when it was still Team Coco.

912
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,800
I think it was like as old, I told it on NBC maybe or-

913
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
It's two years ago.

914
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Two years ago?

915
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Oh, then it was Team Coco.

916
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Okay.

917
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Well, look, we're going to talk-

918
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,400
It's more appropriate for Conan.

919
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Fair enough.

920
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Yeah.

921
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Our listeners are a little more sensitive.

922
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,160
Well, no, I imagine they want to hear about the rides and stuff.

923
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,000
I don't want to ruin things for them.

924
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
That would ruin things.

925
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Seriously though.

926
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Maybe, maybe.

927
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah.

928
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,360
You know, you talk about the Haunted Mansion and it's very common people try to sneak scattering

929
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
ashes.

930
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
Oh, well, that's disgusting.

931
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Yeah.

932
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,560
I've heard a lot of those stories where people do like gross stuff.

933
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Yeah.

934
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,640
Well, my thing was to do it on Pirates of the Caribbean, but the line was too long.

935
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Right.

936
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Yeah.

937
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,800
And I think it's a different thing entirely, but we won't talk about that.

938
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,980
Let's get to the topic though.

939
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
If you had wings-

940
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,980
If you had wings.

941
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,000
Which is a ride that hasn't been around for, God, 30 years, 20 years probably.

942
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Was it ever in Disneyland?

943
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It was only Disney World.

944
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Only Disney World.

945
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Right.

946
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah.

947
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah.

948
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And it was sponsored by Eastern Airlines.

949
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Eastern Airlines, yes indeed.

950
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It was the first ever sponsor of Disney in general.

951
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,680
And the big deal about it was, besides being fun, free.

952
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Oh, yes.

953
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Yes.

954
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
Before, when the ticket, when their ticket books were going on.

955
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Carousel of Progress-

956
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Was either A or an E ticket.

957
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,120
It was like one of the tickets free.

958
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Right.

959
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Yeah.

960
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,000
Carousel of Progress and if you had wings because they were such heavily corporate, corporate

961
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
sponsorship-

962
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Yeah.

963
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,280
Was General Electric Carousel of Progress?

964
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Yeah.

965
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,000
They still would have been doing it at the time.

966
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yeah.

967
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Carousel of Progress was pretty great too.

968
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah.

969
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And that-

970
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You sit there and see the family and-

971
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah.

972
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It was really cool.

973
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Right.

974
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,760
That was a cool thing but it wasn't as good as if you had wings.

975
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Right.

976
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,480
Which, so what was your first trip?

977
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,960
What was the first time you remember going?

978
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
What you remember probably going on it?

979
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:17,560
I remember going to Disneyland for the first time, geez, it must have been 10 years old.

980
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Yeah.

981
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
I mean the park open when?

982
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
70?

983
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
71.

984
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Yeah.

985
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
71.

986
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,640
I went to the park in 72?

987
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
Mm-hmm.

988
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
73?

989
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Yeah.

990
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,480
I lived in Chicago and my grandparents lived in South Florida and I remember we visited

991
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,880
them in South Florida and then we took a bus from South Florida to Orlando, stayed at

992
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,480
like a Holiday Inn type place in Orlando.

993
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
Right.

994
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,040
And then went a couple days to Disney World.

995
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Right.

996
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Yeah.

997
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
That was the first of many Disney World experiences.

998
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Right.

999
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,960
Yeah, when I talk to my mom about her memories going when she was a child, she has a very

1000
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,200
similar like if you had wings of like memory of like, because it was like free, you just

1001
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,200
rode it over and over and over again and it was her favorite.

1002
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Yeah, you'd go back in line.

1003
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Yeah.

1004
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,960
So for people who didn't go on it or don't know what we're talking about, this was an

1005
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,800
OmniMover which is like Haunted Mansion.

1006
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,720
The Haunted Mansion ride system.

1007
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Yeah.

1008
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Which is the vehicles on the Haunted Mansion.

1009
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Right.

1010
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
How do you say ride system?

1011
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
So very similar.

1012
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,960
Very similar to Adventures in Inner Space which was just out here.

1013
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Yeah.

1014
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
In a Hine.

1015
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
And it's not this similar to Soarin'.

1016
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Uh-huh.

1017
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Where you would kind of go in and it's like you're waiting.

1018
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,400
Yeah, you travel around the world.

1019
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,320
You travel where United Airlines goes.

1020
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,320
Right.

1021
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Yeah.

1022
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Where Eastern Airlines goes.

1023
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
I mean Eastern Airlines, yeah.

1024
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,600
It was a travel where Eastern Airlines goes and they kept that song the whole time.

1025
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:41,000
If you had wings, if you had wings, which is really not a great premise.

1026
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,320
No, it's a very simple song.

1027
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,760
I mean, which allows them to like tweak it a little as you go through the different locations.

1028
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,920
And I remember it got very exciting, they had bongos at one time and like they would

1029
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,280
add different sounds, musical sounds from around the world.

1030
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,120
Yes, depending on where you went.

1031
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,520
And then if you, there was two moments that stood out for me.

1032
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,800
I realized why I love the ride.

1033
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,600
Yes, go ahead.

1034
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Okay.

1035
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,400
So, it was generally hot out, especially in Florida.

1036
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Of course.

1037
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,960
And I realized why I love the ride.

1038
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,920
I didn't care if it was free, we had tickets to all the rides.

1039
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Sure.

1040
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,640
Because my dad would let us go on and over and over because it didn't cost anything to

1041
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
have the ticket.

1042
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
Right.

1043
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,480
But there was a little section where it was watery.

1044
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,880
I don't remember what it was, but they would like a light spray in there.

1045
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
A mist.

1046
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,880
A mist.

1047
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
Oh yeah.

1048
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
Not only that, but there was a breeze.

1049
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,160
Like there's this one part where you went through where the wind blew and it was air

1050
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,320
conditioned wind.

1051
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
Sure.

1052
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
And I realized that's why I really love the ride.

1053
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,840
That's why a lot of people seem to like it.

1054
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,440
Yeah, it was so good.

1055
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,000
It was so refreshing.

1056
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Right.

1057
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But you didn't even know it at the time.

1058
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,360
You just felt like this was doing something to me magically.

1059
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
Yes.

1060
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,320
And it also gave you the sense that you were going faster than you were.

1061
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,320
They figured that out back then.

1062
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Right.

1063
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,560
And then yeah, there weren't any robots on the ride.

1064
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
It was all projection.

1065
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,400
It was all projection.

1066
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,040
And then they had the pirates, like right before you got off at the end of the ride,

1067
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,800
they had the pirates come out and pretend to attack you.

1068
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,960
That was like the thing that I think everybody loved.

1069
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
That didn't happen.

1070
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
What?

1071
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
That didn't happen.

1072
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
Sure.

1073
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Were there pirates?

1074
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
There are pirates.

1075
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,800
They come out with like their plastic swords and they just miss your hat with their sword.

1076
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,520
Then they fight each other and they did that for a while until one of them was actually

1077
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
killed.

1078
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
That would have cost a fortune.

1079
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,000
It actually happened.

1080
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,800
Well, there was an expose.

1081
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,600
Where was it?

1082
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Where was it published?

1083
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
I don't know.

1084
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
I don't know where it was.

1085
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
I'm trying to remember.

1086
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,040
Do you guys remember?

1087
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,360
I think it was run in Granddaughter Magazine.

1088
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,800
Right, Granddaughter Magazine.

1089
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,920
But it was a Stephen Glass article.

1090
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,880
So then they had to retract it when they revealed it was a fabulous.

1091
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,560
Stephen Glass wrote for Granddaughter Magazine before, was it The New Yorker?

1092
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
The New Republic?

1093
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
New Republic, yeah.

1094
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,160
Anyhow, no, that didn't happen at the end of the ride.

1095
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,120
But what did happen is there were Eastern Airlines representatives there waiting to

1096
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,200
sell you a ticket if you were interested.

1097
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Seriously?

1098
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Yeah.

1099
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Oh, because I was little.

1100
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
I didn't notice that.

1101
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Right.

1102
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
But they were, yeah.

1103
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
My dad probably said to me, keep walking.

1104
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
I guarantee it's what my dad said.

1105
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Keep walking.

1106
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
We don't need any of that.

1107
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,800
Do you remember who the ending narration of the ride?

1108
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,880
I believe it was Jeffrey, you know, the guy from Live and Let Die.

1109
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,240
What's his name?

1110
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
The Uncola.

1111
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Am I wrong?

1112
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Even a bigger name.

1113
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,520
Oh, I don't know.

1114
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
For a little while.

1115
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
It was Orson Welles.

1116
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,760
Was he the end of If You Had Wings?

1117
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,120
He was the one who said, like, you do have wings.

1118
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,820
You can do all these things.

1119
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,760
You can wide in your world.

1120
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,440
Eastern, the wings of man.

1121
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,520
Boy, that guy made a living from voiceover at a certain point.

1122
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,400
One of the greatest actors who ever lived, one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived.

1123
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,600
And for a while he was telling you that I did have wings and that I could get a what

1124
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,000
was the wine that he did?

1125
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh, yes.

1126
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,760
No wine before its time.

1127
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
The one that's the one with the.

1128
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Paul Mason.

1129
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Paul Mason.

1130
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
Yeah, that's the one with the outtakes.

1131
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
And there's a famous outtakes.

1132
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
Yeah.

1133
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,640
Well, there's the If You Had Wings outtakes.

1134
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
You've heard those though.

1135
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
Of course.

1136
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
Yeah.

1137
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Yeah.

1138
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
He curses up a storm.

1139
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Well, no, it's not him.

1140
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
It's not him.

1141
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
Oh, it's.

1142
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
No, it's Dean Jones.

1143
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
Oh.

1144
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,880
Yelling at Walt in that little room saying.

1145
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
In the apartment.

1146
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
In the apartment.

1147
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Why were they recording there?

1148
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,880
Why did you give the job to Orson Welles?

1149
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,240
It was a big fight.

1150
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Yeah.

1151
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,520
No, I'll never forget listening to those.

1152
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,520
Jack let us listen to those.

1153
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,080
But the weird thing is we had to take off our clothes and sit Indian style on the ground.

1154
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
Yeah.

1155
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,520
And then he put them on and then we got he's got a cupcake.

1156
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
But we had to eat these.

1157
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,040
He said, you got to eat the cupcakes slowly.

1158
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
I remember.

1159
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,800
Yeah, but it was worth it.

1160
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,960
And then we looked out the window and there was a photographer from granddaughter.

1161
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:11,600
But like a telephoto lens, like really trying to scoop them.

1162
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,440
I covered myself, but good.

1163
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
They didn't get anything.

1164
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,160
Yeah, they got me pretty good, though.

1165
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
They did.

1166
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
Yeah, they got all of me.

1167
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
They got your wiener.

1168
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,360
Yeah, they got my wiener.

1169
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,760
And by the way, for a while, it was going to be the first wiener in granddaughter magazine,

1170
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,320
but they decided against it.

1171
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
I use my influence.

1172
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,360
Yeah, I really appreciate that.

1173
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
Yeah.

1174
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Because we bought the pictures back.

1175
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
Yeah.

1176
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,960
And then we sold them to Piper to the Caribbean monthly.

1177
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,760
Yeah, which I'm proud to be in for my first nude nude spread.

1178
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,800
So if you had wings, I do you remember this?

1179
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,640
You again, probably didn't notice as a kid.

1180
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,560
I feel like a lot of people did it that you could hear the project.

1181
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,960
There was like 85 projectors scattered throughout the rise after having been on the ride so

1182
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:04,640
many times over the years, you started noticing the nuances of the delivery of the material.

1183
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,840
And I looked around, I could see the projectors because it was all projectors.

1184
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,160
There were so many.

1185
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,880
It was all images projected onto.

1186
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,680
But a lot of times it was projected onto like moving screens.

1187
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:22,680
And then you your your thing would go through the screens, like underneath the screens,

1188
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,800
you know, because this is well, we were talking about this change into another I call dream

1189
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
flight eventually.

1190
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Oh, really?

1191
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,160
We went on when we were kids.

1192
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Oh, OK.

1193
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,720
I may have written if you had really I went when I was two, but I don't have any memories

1194
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
of it.

1195
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,520
In my mind, I just kind of messed up.

1196
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,520
But in your mind, you should really just go to that you were on if you had wings.

1197
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
Yeah.

1198
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
Yeah.

1199
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
I would do that.

1200
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Why not?

1201
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
I mean, I wish there was better getting ready for this.

1202
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:57,760
Like there is some footage of it, but like VHS or people have like super cameras, like

1203
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,440
did not do well in low lighting.

1204
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,200
So you can't make out a lot.

1205
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,000
I mean, but I have such great memories for of it.

1206
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Yeah.

1207
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,400
And like you sent me the song I did.

1208
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Yeah.

1209
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,240
I put it on and danced because it's like a child.

1210
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,520
It's like one of your favorite types of music.

1211
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
No, I just danced.

1212
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
I just danced.

1213
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
But you like cha cha.

1214
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
I just like I get gassy.

1215
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Sure.

1216
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
And then I have to dance.

1217
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Sure.

1218
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
And that's a great song.

1219
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,560
Remember in the middle of you if you guys weren't on if you had wings, but Chippendale

1220
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,120
came out and they made they did like they made pottery.

1221
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
Wow.

1222
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,880
The ride stopped dead.

1223
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,920
And if you were lucky enough to be by Chippendale, they showed you the pottery.

1224
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,720
The rest of the ride, you're just sitting there.

1225
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Right.

1226
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
And the music was, you know, what's going on.

1227
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,680
But it's like 15, 20 minutes of nothing.

1228
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,240
But some people got a good how to make pottery thing.

1229
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
It's an Easter egg, I guess.

1230
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,760
What did they do with the finished pots?

1231
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Well that's been a mystery that Disney's had to deal with for years.

1232
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
No one knows.

1233
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
No, not even Jack.

1234
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,880
I asked Jack about it, but he didn't know him away.

1235
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,880
He didn't know.

1236
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Yeah, they're somewhere though.

1237
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Yeah.

1238
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,440
Former Eastern Airlines executives also didn't know.

1239
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,800
No, they know it went deep.

1240
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,880
Well you know who did the investigative article that went deep?

1241
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,360
Stephen Glass in the New Republic.

1242
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,360
Nope.

1243
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,600
Try again, Jason.

1244
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Was it me and granddaughter magazine?

1245
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
No, no.

1246
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Oh, you did it.

1247
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Jason.

1248
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
No.

1249
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Hmm.

1250
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Try again, Jason.

1251
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,680
Grandson Tri Weekly.

1252
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,880
So does that come out every three weeks or three times one week?

1253
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,880
Every three weeks.

1254
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,360
I like to think it comes out three times a week.

1255
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:40,440
I would like to think that's more what it is.

1256
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,800
If you pay the premium, it comes out three times a week.

1257
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
Yeah, well you have your choice.

1258
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
Yeah.

1259
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,400
It depends on how often you want grandson news.

1260
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Right.

1261
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,800
There's many grandsons doing big things.

1262
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,680
Me, I want as much as I can get.

1263
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Yeah.

1264
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:01,040
I think the full count of projectors, there were 41 16 millimeters, 40 special effects

1265
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,480
projectors, 370 millimeter projectors and 135 millimeter projector.

1266
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,240
But 370 millimeter, I wonder what part of the ride that was.

1267
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,000
I think that was for the- The big thing at the end?

1268
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,280
What they call the speed room.

1269
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
Oh, the speed room.

1270
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,280
That was the thing that was amazing.

1271
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,440
That's what I told you.

1272
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,240
You felt like you were on like a scooter, like a car.

1273
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,680
It was a car race that you suddenly were in.

1274
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Right.

1275
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,960
And then they had 15 years, June 1972 to June 1987.

1276
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,760
Oh, was it that long?

1277
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
Yeah.

1278
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
Yeah.

1279
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
Wow.

1280
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,920
They had a 15 year contract for the Eastern sponsorship and then Eastern opted not to

1281
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,380
continue the sponsorship.

1282
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:42,520
So it closed for about like five or six days so they could take out any references to Eastern

1283
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,280
and they renamed it If You Could Fly, which pretty similar ride, different song.

1284
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,280
Okay song, not as good.

1285
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
Oh really?

1286
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,280
They recorded a new song.

1287
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
Yeah.

1288
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,800
If You Could Fly.

1289
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,800
If You, was it like that?

1290
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,720
Was it like instead of If You Could Fly?

1291
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,600
If You Could Fly.

1292
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,760
I actually, let me look it up.

1293
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,880
You're not that far off.

1294
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,720
That only lasted about two years.

1295
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,200
I don't remember that one at all.

1296
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,200
You don't have any memories.

1297
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Yeah.

1298
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,760
So what was the last date of the actual If You Had Wings part?

1299
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,720
June 87, like June 2nd I think.

1300
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,320
You said that, how long was the sponsorship?

1301
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,320
15 years.

1302
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,720
Oh, so it was 87.

1303
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,720
Yeah.

1304
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,720
Okay.

1305
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:30,480
And then If You Could Fly went 87 to 89, the Delta Dream Flight moved in from 89 to 1996

1306
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,440
and had like the same thing happen, like they lost the sponsorship in 96.

1307
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Was this in Tomorrowland?

1308
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,440
Yeah.

1309
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,440
This was in Tomorrowland.

1310
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,840
It was kind of not churned out quickly, but like they only had like three things.

1311
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,720
Was it next to Neihae Stocking Mountain?

1312
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,200
No, no, that's on the other side of the park.

1313
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,200
Okay, my mistake.

1314
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,960
That's the totally wrong land.

1315
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
Yeah.

1316
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,960
That's in Stockingland.

1317
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,960
Stockingland by Frontierland.

1318
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,960
I never understood Stockingland.

1319
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,960
It's next to Frontierland, right?

1320
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Yeah, next to Frontierland, Liberty Square.

1321
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,200
The transition from Frontierland to Stockingland is the Horseshoe Cafe.

1322
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Uh-huh, yes.

1323
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:12,440
The Horseshoe Cafe, because that's a person putting a stocking on over the horseshoe,

1324
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,800
when you know you're in Stockingland.

1325
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,760
I'm going to stop now.

1326
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,120
Let's get back to If You Had Wings.

1327
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,280
What did you find over it?

1328
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,920
Did you pull- I have all the If You Had Wings lyrics.

1329
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,200
Were you paying attention?

1330
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,760
These lyrics are a little, I'm amused by them.

1331
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,760
I think these are fun.

1332
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,160
These lyrics by the great ex-Atencio.

1333
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,380
Yes, ex-Atencio who did the Pirates.

1334
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,640
He wrote the Pirates song.

1335
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,640
Yeah.

1336
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,640
Well, Pirates Caribbean song.

1337
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
Which is a great song.

1338
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,640
Great song.

1339
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,320
Uncle or great uncle of comedy director Peter Atencio.

1340
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,160
Yes, of Key and Peele and many other things.

1341
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
Keanu.

1342
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,360
Keanu, the movie, yep.

1343
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,900
So we have all these lyrics here and there's so many different ones.

1344
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,600
My favorite one, where is it?

1345
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:58,280
It says, want to buy a sombrero made of real fine straw or how about a nice handbag for

1346
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,800
your pretty mama?

1347
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,760
That's my favorite line out of all of them.

1348
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
It's all about like-

1349
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,480
Well, that's the one that I experienced.

1350
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:14,200
I was in Mexico and I got a hat and it was made of straw and then I bought my mom a handbag.

1351
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,460
That was quite the day.

1352
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,460
Your pretty mama.

1353
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,080
Yeah, she's very pretty, my mama.

1354
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:23,680
And you said that, I would hope you would ask the man at the store for a gift for your

1355
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,680
mama.

1356
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,920
Well, I just bought her a gift.

1357
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Oh, okay.

1358
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,920
So it was no transaction.

1359
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,920
I had to buy her a gift.

1360
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,920
She was touched though.

1361
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,920
She loved her son.

1362
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,920
Sure, of course.

1363
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,360
I mean, I'm looking through here.

1364
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,640
This was the old, we'll put this on the Twitter.

1365
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,240
This was the old pamphlet you would get.

1366
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,360
With the tickets or with telling you about the park?

1367
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,240
That, well, telling you about Eastern Airlines.

1368
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,240
Oh, great granddaughter.

1369
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,240
How about that?

1370
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,000
There was a lot of cross promotion like in airports of like, cause Eastern was the official

1371
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,040
airline of Disney World for a long time.

1372
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,440
Eastern was a very popular airline.

1373
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,880
I remember flying it a lot.

1374
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,760
Do you think was that the one you flew the most as a child?

1375
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,760
Do you remember?

1376
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,320
I would say Eastern Airlines.

1377
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,400
Eastern and Delta were the two that I remember flying a lot as a kid.

1378
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,240
Did you have an association that it was Disney's airline?

1379
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,280
Did that make it fun?

1380
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,800
I don't remember.

1381
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,160
Sure.

1382
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,160
That's okay.

1383
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,160
I was excited.

1384
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,080
My favorite part was the airport.

1385
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Yeah.

1386
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,560
Well, flying was better in those days, I've been told.

1387
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,320
You don't remember that either?

1388
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,400
Cause that's what my parents say.

1389
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,280
They say flying was better.

1390
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,320
I think my mom.

1391
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,680
When you flew first class, it was really first class.

1392
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,000
Now first class is just a bigger chair than the other section.

1393
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,840
It's not that exciting.

1394
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,120
Unless you fly first class to Europe, then it's really delightful.

1395
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,400
I think my mom just wanted the women to wear dresses.

1396
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,120
I was saying if you could fly the brief two year replacement, yeah, whole new song for

1397
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,120
that.

1398
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:59,440
When Delta Dream Flight moved in, that ran from June of 89 to June of 1996.

1399
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,640
Similar thing happened, I think I'd say, where they lost the sponsorship and then it became

1400
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,320
Disney's take flight.

1401
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,880
For that, they just took all the words Delta out of the song.

1402
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,240
They just found words they could squeeze in instead of Delta.

1403
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,240
What was it called again?

1404
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,240
Disney's what?

1405
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,520
It was called Dream Flight.

1406
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:22,600
Then when they lost the sponsorship, it became Take Flight.

1407
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,920
They would lose the sponsorship and they'd have to change the whole thing of the ride,

1408
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,920
which just happens.

1409
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,000
Cause there's so many different sponsors here.

1410
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,680
Siemens sponsored Space Your Birth for a long time, which is an Epcot Center, which is the

1411
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,720
big ball, the golf ball.

1412
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,160
Then they pulled it so they have to pull all references to the thing.

1413
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,160
That's what happens.

1414
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,920
It happens in baseball parks all the time now.

1415
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,680
You start calling it one name and it's a new name five years later.

1416
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,000
Like Comiskey Park was what I grew up with, but now it's a US cellular field.

1417
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,680
Now it's now called Japanese Woman Park.

1418
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,680
All the women of Japan sponsor it.

1419
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,960
Wow, they all got together and pooled their money?

1420
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,960
They did.

1421
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,960
Wow.

1422
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,400
Is that a profit making venture or a charitable thing?

1423
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,640
By the way, you know the Staples Center is now called Granddaughter Magazine Arena.

1424
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,360
They have well outpaced Staples.

1425
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,800
Their acquisition did not go through.

1426
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
That makes sense though.

1427
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,440
I mean, I think it's, they're going to do a lot of good with it.

1428
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,880
I think that they're the type of company that needs to go to the arena.

1429
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:24,160
This will either be your most popular podcast or by far the one that people go, please don't

1430
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,360
ever have them on again.

1431
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,960
We had an episode that's a little divisive where a fifties gangster hijacked the show.

1432
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,960
That might be our most divisive.

1433
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,520
Was it one of you playing a character?

1434
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,520
It was not, well, not us.

1435
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,760
It was a different person.

1436
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,760
But there's a ride called the Great Movie Ride and on that ride you get hijacked by

1437
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,240
a fifties gangster.

1438
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
So we had a-

1439
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,240
Was there a ride called the Great Movie Ride?

1440
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,160
Yes, it was at the MGM Studio in Florida.

1441
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,480
Oh, so this is like one of the separate park.

1442
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,080
Yeah, it was a separate park in Florida.

1443
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,080
Yeah.

1444
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,320
They never allowed that in like Disney World or Disneyland.

1445
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,920
Well, it was, no, it was Disney World.

1446
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,160
It was Disney World's Hollywood Studios and you get hijacked a guy like a college student

1447
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,960
would come out and be like, hey, stick them up, give me a Jules or whatever.

1448
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
You're a liar.

1449
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
I swear to God.

1450
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,960
Somebody thought this was a good idea.

1451
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,960
It was a great idea.

1452
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,960
It ran for decades.

1453
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,960
It was one of our favorite rides.

1454
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,960
It just closed.

1455
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,960
It was open for 20 years.

1456
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,960
Sometimes it would be a cowboy would ride.

1457
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,400
Yes, sometimes a cowboy, a person-

1458
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,840
You know who got their break on that ride?

1459
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,840
The Olsen twins.

1460
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,840
Really?

1461
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,600
Were they the cowboy and the gangster?

1462
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,740
They were the babies.

1463
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,740
The babies when they were hands.

1464
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:26,600
Because for one year, Disney did some research and they found out people love babies.

1465
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,880
So before they did Full House when they were actual babies, they were the babies on that

1466
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,880
ride.

1467
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,880
That makes a lot of sense.

1468
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,880
I didn't even know that.

1469
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,880
Yeah.

1470
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,880
I didn't know that.

1471
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,880
Yes, I did.

1472
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,880
Oh, okay.

1473
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,640
Well, he knows he does more research than I do.

1474
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:45,720
And you know, people are mad at Disneyland in Paris.

1475
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,720
Yes.

1476
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,400
You know what's going on there.

1477
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,360
Apparently, every single ride is sponsored by a diabetes drug now.

1478
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,880
I didn't know that.

1479
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,680
You think that would happen at the American parks.

1480
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,680
Nope.

1481
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,680
It's in Paris.

1482
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,680
Yeah.

1483
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,640
And they have, well, you know what?

1484
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,640
Now that you say that, I...

1485
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,640
They have the Glucophage.

1486
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,640
Yeah.

1487
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,640
The Glucophage Mountain.

1488
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,640
The Glucophage Mountain.

1489
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,640
The Glucophage also sponsors, it's a small world.

1490
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,280
And they say it's a Glucophage world after all.

1491
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,280
After all, I know.

1492
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
Yeah.

1493
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,280
And that's all.

1494
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,280
I thought there was something different last time we were there.

1495
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,280
Yeah.

1496
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,640
They're taking over other rides too and using their other names.

1497
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,400
There's Metformin teacups that you spend.

1498
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,400
Sure.

1499
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,400
Yeah.

1500
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,760
And there's also reps for the diabetes medicine that hassle you after the rides.

1501
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,220
They're waiting there with Eastern Airlines pamphlets.

1502
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,220
They haven't gotten their act together yet.

1503
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,220
Wow.

1504
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,220
Yeah.

1505
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,220
They're giving away money.

1506
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,480
Those might fetch some money for collectors.

1507
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,480
They're really not...

1508
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,940
They don't have it together yet.

1509
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:49,940
That makes a lot of sense.

1510
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,940
Yeah.

1511
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,720
Do you have anything else or do we want to get to this last segment?

1512
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,720
I think that's everything.

1513
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:01,820
I mean, I thought it was interesting when we mentioned this ride to people.

1514
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,920
It seems like a real fan favorite.

1515
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,160
I told my dad we were doing this episode.

1516
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,900
It was truly delightful.

1517
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,640
I remember having dreams of the other one.

1518
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,500
I mean, this was about where everything, everywhere Eastern would go, but the replacement Dream

1519
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,480
Flight was more focused on the history of airline.

1520
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,480
Was it the same images?

1521
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,480
Oh, okay.

1522
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,480
There was some projection.

1523
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,140
So they would change the visuals.

1524
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,240
They built a bunch of new sets.

1525
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,240
Oh, that's my...

1526
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,320
Siri just went off.

1527
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,720
That's that thing I have in my kitchen again.

1528
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
A HomePod?

1529
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,720
I have a HomePod.

1530
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,720
Oh, okay.

1531
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,320
By the way, it's not gotten the best reviews.

1532
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,320
I'm loving it.

1533
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,320
I'm loving it.

1534
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,320
What have you just been playing music with it?

1535
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,320
I play music.

1536
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,320
I ask questions.

1537
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,320
Like I ask...

1538
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,320
I say, Siri, Siri, Siri.

1539
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,320
Hold on.

1540
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:58,680
Siri, Siri, play the new issue of Granddaughter Magazine.

1541
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,960
I think I see why people don't like this product as much.

1542
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,120
By the way, I'm talking to it too far.

1543
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,120
We're too far away.

1544
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,120
It's two rooms over.

1545
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,120
Two rooms over.

1546
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,120
We just spoke out of nowhere.

1547
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,120
I don't even know what it said.

1548
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,120
We love Apple.

1549
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,120
We don't want to put Apple down.

1550
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,040
No, no, but the point being is that I really am enjoying it.

1551
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,040
Sure.

1552
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,040
And the sound, you heard it the other day.

1553
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,040
The sound is great.

1554
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,040
Yeah.

1555
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,040
So there you go.

1556
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,040
Jeff Garland induced.

1557
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,040
Induced?

1558
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,040
Jeff Garland endorsed HomePod.

1559
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,440
I induced Siri to go on a few anyway.

1560
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,440
Siri, take me...

1561
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,440
Wait.

1562
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,440
Siri.

1563
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
Wait, wait, wait.

1564
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,440
No, no, no.

1565
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,120
Siri, hallucinate me and make me think I'm in a few at wings.

1566
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,120
No.

1567
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
Too far away.

1568
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,120
Hold on.

1569
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,120
Let's do it here.

1570
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,120
Okay.

1571
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,440
Let's see if Siri would know.

1572
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,200
Hey, Siri, tell me about Disneyland's...

1573
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,800
Oh, I screwed up.

1574
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:58,240
Hey, Siri, tell me about Disney World's ride if you had wings.

1575
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,800
I found something on the web about Disney World's ride if you had wings.

1576
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,800
Check it out.

1577
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,480
Oh, she's not going to read it though.

1578
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,480
Oh, yeah.

1579
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,480
I was just giving you a...

1580
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,480
She's just going to show us the entry.

1581
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,880
And then the HomePod had no information.

1582
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,880
So they're two different minds.

1583
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,880
They're two different brains.

1584
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:21,440
Hey, hey, Siri, play the theme to the ride if you had wings.

1585
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,040
I don't think that...

1586
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,800
This is not it.

1587
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
What is this?

1588
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,400
I think it's something very smooth.

1589
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,880
Hold on.

1590
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,360
Disney, stop.

1591
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,360
I mean, Disney.

1592
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,120
Siri, stop playing.

1593
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,120
I think that's just going to be on for the rest of the show.

1594
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,120
Siri, stop playing.

1595
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,120
Stop playing, Siri.

1596
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,120
Oh, dear God.

1597
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,120
Oh, well.

1598
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,120
That's okay.

1599
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,120
Now I have to go.

1600
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,120
Excuse me.

1601
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,120
All right.

1602
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
All right.

1603
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,000
I think that's Andrew Gold.

1604
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,640
I was listening to an album from my childhood called All This in Heaven 2, Andrew Gold,

1605
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,960
which had a huge hit single on it.

1606
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,960
What is it?

1607
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,960
What is it?

1608
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,960
Thank you for being a friend.

1609
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,960
Hold on one second.

1610
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,960
Oh, yeah.

1611
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,960
Yeah.

1612
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,960
I'm sorry if your listeners might get upset with me.

1613
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,680
I'm just picturing them being like, why does he make up things about the ride?

1614
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,680
You can include this.

1615
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,680
All right.

1616
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,680
Keep going.

1617
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,680
Hey, I'll put that in there.

1618
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,680
Okay.

1619
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,680
So we do...

1620
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,400
So basically when we're done talking about the ride, we have a scale.

1621
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,360
So we say like, if you were like an Imagineer, would you say, I want to plus the ride up?

1622
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,360
Would I want to keep it absolutely the same or would I want to burn it down in a mysterious

1623
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,920
fire for insurance money?

1624
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,840
You mean, so if you had wings, that right?

1625
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,840
If it would still exist, if it still existed.

1626
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,740
Oh, I would want to plus it up.

1627
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:36,740
You would want to plus it up.

1628
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:37,740
So then we talk about what would be...

1629
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:43,760
Yeah, I would make the same sensations, but make them more modern and better, like more

1630
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,760
three...

1631
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,840
More three dimensional, not 3D.

1632
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,840
Right.

1633
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,840
Although that's the same thing.

1634
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,840
But you know what I mean?

1635
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,520
I wouldn't want to wear 3D glasses.

1636
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:58,880
But I'd want to make it more, you know, I'm sure that if you went on it now, it'd be nostalgic,

1637
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,640
but it wouldn't necessarily be like, oh, that was amazing.

1638
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,640
Right.

1639
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,040
It'd be like, wow, if they could do that now, how good would that be?

1640
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,320
The sensation of being on the water, the sensation of being in the car race.

1641
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,680
But it is similar to...

1642
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,680
To Soarin'.

1643
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,680
To Soarin'.

1644
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,680
Yeah.

1645
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,680
A lot of people...

1646
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,760
To Soarin' is like an advanced version of if you had wings.

1647
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,120
A lot of people like point at that this is like a precursor to that.

1648
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,120
Very much so.

1649
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,120
It is.

1650
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,120
It is.

1651
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,120
Without a doubt.

1652
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,120
I think the speed room looked really cool.

1653
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,080
I wish they did more stuff like that.

1654
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Like that would be so cool.

1655
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,080
That would be so cool.

1656
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,080
The sensation.

1657
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,080
Like 4K.

1658
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,640
Well, by the way, what a great ride it would be if you say the speed room, let's just say

1659
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,100
it's called the speed room.

1660
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:50,040
In a room where you get the sensation of being in an auto race, being in a boat race.

1661
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,220
Like all these speed...

1662
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:55,880
Even a desert speed test.

1663
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,760
Like simulating that.

1664
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:03,160
And not in terms of your face or feeling it, but seeing visually what that would be like

1665
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,160
the experience.

1666
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,160
Yeah.

1667
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,280
I would probably enjoy that.

1668
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,800
I don't like up and down.

1669
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,800
Yeah.

1670
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,800
You'd say...

1671
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,800
Fast on a straightaway?

1672
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,800
Delightful.

1673
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,520
Did you ever like roller coasters or anything like that?

1674
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,520
No.

1675
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,520
Never.

1676
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,520
At no point in my life.

1677
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,520
I always...

1678
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,520
I avoided them like the play.

1679
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,960
Did you go on one and it ruined it for you or you just never even tried it?

1680
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:30,640
The only roller coaster I've ever been on, like of any, is Space Mountain.

1681
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,640
And when I was done, I must've been like 12 years old or whatever, 14.

1682
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,640
When I was done...

1683
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,480
No, I was older because that came about later.

1684
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,520
What year was Space Mountain?

1685
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,520
It's...

1686
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,520
76?

1687
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,000
Yeah, somewhere around there.

1688
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
76.

1689
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,720
So I was probably 14 or 15 and I went on Space Mountain.

1690
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,040
It had been open less than a year, I remember very clearly.

1691
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,000
And when I was done, I was like, why did I do that?

1692
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It scared the hell out of me.

1693
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It was too scary.

1694
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Yeah.

1695
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,800
And then like now, I can't even do like the Cars ride.

1696
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,800
Yeah, because it's too over the top.

1697
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,800
Yeah, I can't even do that.

1698
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,800
You said you tried it though, right?

1699
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,800
Yeah, I went and I watched the dips.

1700
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,800
You didn't like the thing where it goes dips.

1701
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,800
I don't like dips.

1702
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,800
Oh yeah, there's a lot of dips.

1703
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,320
I don't even like going on a swing.

1704
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,280
That's why Soarin' scares me to a degree.

1705
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,280
Oh, a regular swing.

1706
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,280
Yeah.

1707
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,280
75, 75 in Florida.

1708
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,960
The good thing about Soarin' is you can close your eyes and you're fine.

1709
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:20,960
Yeah, it's not.

1710
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,080
It doesn't jostle you.

1711
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,840
My mom says she hates being jostled on the rides.

1712
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,960
By the way, is your mom's name Jocelyn?

1713
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,120
Jocelyn, Jocelyn.

1714
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,000
Jocelyn Carlson?

1715
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,680
The other ride that it really kind of influenced was the boat ride in the Mexico Pavilion at

1716
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,680
Epcot.

1717
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,680
At Epcot Center that you've never been.

1718
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,720
I've never seen it, but it has a lot of sets with that kind of projection.

1719
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,840
Oh wow, is it still up or no?

1720
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,840
Still up.

1721
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,280
It's made, it's had some changes over the years.

1722
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,720
Oh, I should go to, I should go to Epcot.

1723
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,840
I need to do a road trip to Epcot just based on that ride.

1724
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,800
Your ABC privileges, they extend to Florida.

1725
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,800
They most certainly do.

1726
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,800
They have to.

1727
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,800
It's all the magic of Disney.

1728
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,640
Oh, you would love the World Showcase.

1729
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,360
You know, I don't want Disney to buy Fox only for one reason.

1730
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,360
Go ahead.

1731
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,360
I'm not a big Fox fan.

1732
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,360
I'm a big Disney fan.

1733
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,360
Sure.

1734
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,640
You're on your career on the line saying that.

1735
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,520
I think the big acquisition would be Fox if they got Disney.

1736
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:19,640
I go look at them, but I don't see the excitement, but they still might not get it anyhow.

1737
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,600
Because now Comcast is fighting for it.

1738
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,880
But doesn't Comcast own Universal?

1739
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,800
That'd be weird.

1740
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,840
So and then there's some Marvel properties that they would get.

1741
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:33,480
So they would control some of Marvel and Disney would control other parts of Marvel.

1742
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,480
Fantastic Four, the X-Men.

1743
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,480
And the X-Men.

1744
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,960
Oh, and then Barnaby Jones.

1745
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,080
And of course, Barnaby Jones, who people have been fighting over the license for for years.

1746
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,920
You were talking about remaking that, I think, for a long time.

1747
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:52,880
By the way, I see myself, no, excuse the term, on a crash course with playing Barnaby Jones.

1748
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,360
I mean, see that'll my the more I last, the more beloved I'm going to be.

1749
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,720
And then at a certain point, it'll be logical for me to play Barnaby Jones.

1750
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,720
Yeah, yeah.

1751
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,160
Barnaby Jones over Colombo.

1752
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,480
Or kind of played Colombo Handsome, which yes.

1753
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,040
But I here's the thing.

1754
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:16,400
Truth be told, if they were to do Colombo, they'd want somebody more talented than me.

1755
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,400
Probably.

1756
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,760
No, no, they would.

1757
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,440
Peter Falk was pretty amazing.

1758
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,440
And he was great.

1759
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,680
They want something interesting.

1760
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,920
Whereas I think that Barnaby Jones, you just have to be old.

1761
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,960
But he absent, if I remember, didn't dance and he didn't really talk about the Beverly

1762
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,960
Hillbillies much.

1763
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:38,720
But Barnaby Jones, he had memories as the character of the.

1764
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,480
What about Father Dowling Mysteries?

1765
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,080
That was was was Tom Bosley.

1766
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,080
Yeah.

1767
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,080
How long did that last?

1768
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,080
I think it was seasons.

1769
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,520
Was he a friend of what's her names?

1770
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,520
Friend of who?

1771
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,000
Father Dowling, I think, was a spin off of.

1772
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Yes, yes.

1773
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Yes.

1774
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,120
And I used to live in a building and the landlord was a regular on Father Dowling when he was

1775
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,120
a younger man.

1776
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:06,520
But Father Dowling ride at Disney World was that's a memory.

1777
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,520
That's a whole other show.

1778
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,520
Very relaxing, very slow moving.

1779
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:14,240
They pair you with a senior citizen and you have to solve a crime.

1780
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,360
That's the Barnaby Jones ride, which they had out here at Universal.

1781
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,360
You're getting it mixed up.

1782
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,360
Sorry.

1783
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,360
Yeah.

1784
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,360
Universal.

1785
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,780
And they used to feed you mushed rice and applesauce and mushed bananas.

1786
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,480
That was a sensation on the Barnaby Jones.

1787
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,480
There was no murder.

1788
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,480
There was no murder.

1789
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,480
OK.

1790
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,440
Rockford Files became the first themed bar.

1791
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,440
That was the first.

1792
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,440
Wow.

1793
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,440
Was it really?

1794
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,440
No.

1795
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,440
Because that sounds believable.

1796
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,440
Yeah.

1797
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,240
Like if there was a Rockford bar like in Malibu, I would so totally go.

1798
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,240
Oh, yeah.

1799
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,240
Yeah.

1800
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,360
Like it looks like his camper, you know, and the bartenders all look like Jim Rockford.

1801
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,360
Man.

1802
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,360
Yeah.

1803
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,360
Now this is alienating the audience too.

1804
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,760
And I also think your ideas are pretty horrible.

1805
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,760
Oh, OK.

1806
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,760
Good.

1807
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,840
That it would look like where he lived and all the bartenders look like a middle aged

1808
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
man.

1809
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,520
No, I don't think that would do well.

1810
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,760
What would your plus it up be for the Rockford Files bar?

1811
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,240
The Rockford Files bar would just be like a lot of memorabilia from the Rockford Files.

1812
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,240
OK.

1813
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,240
So it would be immersive.

1814
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,240
But really pretty bartenders and an area where you could go smoke pot because I don't drink.

1815
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,240
Oh, OK.

1816
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,240
So that's just like a dry.

1817
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,160
That sounds like a dry cleaner that's like had a lot of people from the Rockford Files

1818
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,960
use it over the years.

1819
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:29,560
I'm going to say this is probably a worse roasting that I went to one of your shows

1820
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,800
at UCB like 11 years ago.

1821
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:37,680
You gave out pop tarts to the audience and you gave me a real hard time about how I was

1822
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,680
eating that pop tart.

1823
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,680
Oh, you were.

1824
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,680
How were you eating?

1825
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,680
How were you eating?

1826
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,680
I think I was breaking it into pieces.

1827
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,680
Oh, well.

1828
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,240
Because I was like on stage in the light, so I didn't want to look like, you know, a

1829
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,040
man just like shoving it down.

1830
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,320
So you were taking your time.

1831
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,320
I was.

1832
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,320
Yeah.

1833
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,320
Taking my time.

1834
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,320
I give up pop tarts.

1835
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,320
Maybe I'll do.

1836
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,320
I know you do.

1837
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,600
I can't drive my car right now.

1838
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,880
So not physically.

1839
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,440
My license expired.

1840
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,920
Oh, that happened to me.

1841
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:05,920
Yeah.

1842
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:06,920
So I'm waiting now.

1843
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:12,120
I paid online for the fast appointment, which is coming really slowly.

1844
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,680
So hopefully by next week, I'll have my license and one of the shows coming up.

1845
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,480
I'm going to buy pop tarts for the audience.

1846
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,480
Yeah.

1847
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,480
Yeah.

1848
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,840
You know, I told you this already, but you gave me a 10 years ago.

1849
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,840
I wouldn't go to your show, too, when I first came to LA and you gave me a shirt of yours.

1850
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,840
What shirt did I give you?

1851
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,840
Like a white dress shirt.

1852
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,840
Wow.

1853
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,480
It's just like sitting in my closet somewhere.

1854
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,480
Yeah.

1855
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,480
So like, yeah, for people that came to LA, that show at UCD with the pop tarts.

1856
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,960
I gave away stereo systems, TVs.

1857
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,960
I remember.

1858
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,960
I got a white dress shirt.

1859
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:40,960
Wait, what?

1860
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,960
I gave away TVs.

1861
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:42,960
I gave away computers.

1862
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,960
I remember.

1863
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,600
Well, most of my audience was made up of young people who I think I charged a dollar.

1864
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,600
Yes, it was a dollar.

1865
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,000
So that's where we would go because we were fresh off the boat.

1866
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,600
Yeah, and I loved it.

1867
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,600
Yeah.

1868
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,600
Yeah.

1869
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,600
So yeah, I don't know.

1870
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,600
What do we got?

1871
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,600
Anything else?

1872
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:02,160
Now with times changing, the price to see me at the improv every Friday is $18.

1873
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,160
Oh my.

1874
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,160
Which is still a bargain.

1875
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,160
Very good deal, but yes, much.

1876
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:10,440
Because that's a good luck 18.

1877
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,800
You said that you picked the 18?

1878
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,800
Yeah.

1879
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,800
They don't have like a set?

1880
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,800
No.

1881
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,800
It could have been 20.

1882
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,800
Okay.

1883
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,800
Two item minimum, too.

1884
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,800
What's that?

1885
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,800
Two item minimum.

1886
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,800
I don't know what they do with that.

1887
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,040
I don't get involved, but I'm guessing it's two drink minimum.

1888
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:29,160
Well, we always say to our guests at the end that, Jeff Garland, you survived podcast

1889
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,160
The Ride.

1890
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,080
I actually think it's quite different.

1891
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:36,120
I think you two survived your podcast The Ride.

1892
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,560
You're like the 50s gangster that hijacked the podcast.

1893
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,560
Yeah, I did it.

1894
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,400
Well, who was this episode sponsored by?

1895
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,400
I forgot.

1896
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,440
Well, I think we have a couple sponsors, but the main one?

1897
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,440
You're talking about the main one?

1898
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,440
The main one.

1899
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,440
Yeah, Granddaughter Magazine.

1900
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,440
Granddaughter Magazine.

1901
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,440
Yeah.

1902
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,760
And we want to say that the digital copy is very good, too.

1903
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,960
Well, reading it on your iPad is the way to go now.

1904
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,960
Yeah.

1905
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,960
Oh, yeah.

1906
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,960
They have a lot of links, like video hyperlinks.

1907
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,960
Hyperlinks to things.

1908
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:02,960
And it's really intuitive.

1909
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:03,960
It's an enhanced issue.

1910
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,960
And a wonderful app.

1911
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,400
Yeah, it's an enhanced issue.

1912
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,000
Do you have anything to plug?

1913
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Do you want to talk?

1914
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,160
Well, come to my show if you ever want on Friday nights at the Improv.

1915
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,480
I'm recording this week Toy Story 4.

1916
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,480
Really?

1917
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,480
Yes.

1918
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,760
And on the script or they only show it to you there?

1919
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,160
They only show it to me there.

1920
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,160
So you can't prepare at all?

1921
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,080
I also saw Tim Allen on the street in Beverly Hills.

1922
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,800
We talked for a while and he's recording soon.

1923
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,800
Wow.

1924
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,800
That's exciting.

1925
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
Yeah.

1926
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,080
And you're doing it here, but you're not going up to Emeryville or whatever.

1927
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,080
No.

1928
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,200
Generally, the more times you record, you rotate.

1929
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,440
Like you do one up there, one down here.

1930
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,480
And this is the first year I'm not recording at Disney.

1931
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,680
I'm recording at a studio in Hollywood.

1932
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,680
I forgot the name of it.

1933
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,680
Sure.

1934
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,680
We don't have to give.

1935
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,680
We don't have to know.

1936
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,680
No, no.

1937
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,680
I really can't remember the name.

1938
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,680
Sure.

1939
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,680
Or Formosa.

1940
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,680
Well, it's not Formosa.

1941
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,680
It's probably Formosa.

1942
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,680
It's right there.

1943
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,680
Yeah.

1944
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,680
It used to be Warner Brothers.

1945
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,680
Sure.

1946
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,680
I don't know what it's called.

1947
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,680
Well, that's fun.

1948
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,680
That's exciting.

1949
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,680
Yeah.

1950
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,680
I'm recording this coming week.

1951
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,680
Anything else?

1952
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,680
Shows?

1953
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,680
When does Goldberg start?

1954
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,680
Goldberg's is on now.

1955
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,680
I don't know if, you know, and Curb's on.

1956
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,680
Everything's always on.

1957
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,680
It's always on.

1958
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,680
I start filming Goldberg's in August and then Curb in October.

1959
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,240
New season of Curb.

1960
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:24,160
And then, yeah, but, you know, come to see me at the Improv Friday nights.

1961
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,760
And then starting in August, I'll be at Friday nights at the Improv and Saturday nights, Sunday

1962
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,760
nights at Flappers.

1963
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,760
Yeah.

1964
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,760
In Burbank.

1965
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,760
In Burbank.

1966
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,760
That's a fun place.

1967
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,760
In Carlson country.

1968
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
Terrible name.

1969
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,760
Wonderful place.

1970
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,760
Wonderful place.

1971
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,760
The staff there is lovely.

1972
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,760
They're lovely.

1973
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,440
So, yeah, there's plenty of places to see me.

1974
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:47,440
And tonight I'll be doing, you won't be hearing it, but tonight I'm going to do an hour monologue

1975
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,440
about the history of granddaughter magazine.

1976
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,920
Well, people, well, all the kids will be posting about it on social media.

1977
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,360
It's about time this story is told.

1978
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,040
You know what I look forward to, Mike?

1979
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,040
Can I mean this?

1980
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,040
Go ahead.

1981
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,920
Is anyone ever coming up to me on the street and pointing at me and saying, granddaughter

1982
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,920
magazine?

1983
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,960
Because I'll know that they listen to this and they'll make me very happy.

1984
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,240
I think it'll happen because we've had a couple of nice people come up to us in Disneyland

1985
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,240
already.

1986
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,080
So I think people in the park are listening.

1987
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,080
More often than not.

1988
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:21,040
Yeah, because it's, but gosh, I just got to say, I love the idea of the show because I

1989
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,280
love as much as I made up things that happen on the ride.

1990
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,600
I love Disneyland.

1991
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,000
It is just, it just thrills me.

1992
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,760
I don't eat sugar anymore.

1993
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,760
Yeah.

1994
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,440
So, so a lot of certain things.

1995
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,160
A lot of treats are off the table.

1996
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:40,720
Specific treat that I always loved was the two cookies with the ice cream in the middle

1997
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,360
and they move to the other side.

1998
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:48,220
They don't even have the, they used to just be that one little place down the alley where

1999
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:50,760
you could get it and they actually made it fresh.

2000
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,760
Yes.

2001
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,440
I don't know what goes on with that, but it doesn't concern me because it's sugar.

2002
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,720
So I can't concern myself, but there's so many treats.

2003
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,880
We saw some new treats.

2004
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,760
You're like, oh, this is new.

2005
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,520
And it was a sweet treat and I couldn't have it.

2006
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:07,040
I asked, well, I asked Jack, I said, I know that they have a Dole Whip donut now.

2007
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,040
Yeah.

2008
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,000
And he made a call on his phone to see where they were.

2009
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,320
But then they, then the person that like, they didn't have any fresh.

2010
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,320
Yeah.

2011
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,480
She was like, don't worry, but it's not actually that good.

2012
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,480
She didn't say that.

2013
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,480
She did.

2014
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,480
She quietly.

2015
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,480
She said a few.

2016
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,480
Yeah.

2017
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,480
Cause to me they made out like it was great and they said they would have them in like

2018
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,480
an hour, but they'd be in line.

2019
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,480
You'd have to wait in line.

2020
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,480
Yeah.

2021
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,480
There'd be a line and you know,

2022
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,480
And ABC couldn't

2023
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,480
I get a sugar.

2024
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,480
So, you know,

2025
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,360
And Jack couldn't let us cut that line for some reason.

2026
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,360
Yeah.

2027
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,360
That line was not cuttable.

2028
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,360
Right.

2029
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,040
But I have to say, I feel rude cutting.

2030
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,000
Like when you have a guide and they take you to lunch, you don't cut.

2031
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Right.

2032
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
There's a different area you walk in.

2033
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Or you go to the exit.

2034
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,680
Cause I would not do it if you had to walk by all the people.

2035
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:45,680
Oh yeah.

2036
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,680
I would not do it.

2037
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:47,680
That would be rude.

2038
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,680
It would just be so horrible.

2039
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,680
I would never do it.

2040
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,680
Yeah.

2041
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,680
We'd go on the exit.

2042
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,680
Yeah.

2043
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,680
So Disneyland is wonderful.

2044
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,120
A bunch of wonderful people.

2045
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,640
That's why I'm on a plug.

2046
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,600
For anyone listening, if you have the time, go to Disneyland or Disney World or Epcot

2047
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,080
or yeah.

2048
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,400
Or the Disney Hollywood studios where they used to have a great.

2049
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,280
Go to the gift shop at the Imagineering place.

2050
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,920
Or the Rockford Files bar.

2051
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,920
The Rockford Files bar.

2052
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,200
Either Jason's version or Jeff's version.

2053
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,600
I think my version is better because there'd be women.

2054
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:24,320
Well, I think my version would have some very nice stories from middle-aged men.

2055
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:30,000
And I think having women bartenders is much better than stories from middle-aged men.

2056
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,280
Just a middle-aged guy kind of coughing a lot.

2057
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,720
And you want to hear those stories.

2058
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,720
Talking about his alimony.

2059
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,680
You want to just say, how'd you get your cough?

2060
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,680
And then you'll hear it.

2061
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,680
Yeah.

2062
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,680
Yeah.

2063
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,280
By the way, my voice became very distinct after working on WALL-E.

2064
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,280
Yes.

2065
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:50,320
Because I worked on it three years and I blew up my voice and it became much more distinct

2066
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,320
than it is now.

2067
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,320
Right.

2068
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,320
Or the performance in WALL-E.

2069
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,900
I sound like that now.

2070
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:59,120
And prior to doing WALL-E, I of course sounded like that, but it's not as extreme.

2071
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,680
Did you have to get like therapy after that?

2072
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,680
Yeah.

2073
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,000
I did vocal voice stuff I had to do.

2074
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,920
I had to do singing lessons to learn how to talk again.

2075
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,920
Sorry.

2076
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,920
How was your singing?

2077
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,920
Everything's good.

2078
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,920
It's delightful.

2079
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:11,920
Although I lose my voice on occasion.

2080
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,920
I got you.

2081
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,000
Well, look folks, we've done it here today.

2082
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Yes, it's been great.

2083
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
We've talked to a few at Wings.

2084
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It's been great.

2085
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,600

Yeah, it's great.

We love saying that.

2103
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,360
I don't go on Facebook.

2104
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,360

01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,400
Okay.

2109
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,400
So it's called what?

2110
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,400
Podcast, what is it?

2111
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,400
PodcastTheRide?

2112
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,320
Yeah, PodcastTheRide one word.

2113
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,840
We post some fun stuff.

2114
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,320
Do we post pictures when we go?

2115
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,320
Here it is.

2116
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,320
Wow.

2117
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,320
It's got a little purple logo.

2118
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,320
Yeah, I see it.

2119
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,320
It's like an Epcot-ish.

2120
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,720
Is that your girlfriend in that picture there?

2121
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,720
Where?

2122
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,720
I don't think she's on.

2123
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:13,240
No, that's, that's, that's a picture that looks sort of like my girlfriend, but that

2124
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,240
is not my girlfriend.

2125
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,240
Who was that?

2126
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,240
Julie Prescott?

2127
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,240
Julie Prescott.

2128
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,240
She was a guest on a couple of episodes ago.

2129
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,240
Yeah.

2130
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,240
All right.

2131
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,240
So are you just going to follow it?

2132
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,240
I like it.

2133
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,240
Yeah, I'm following it.

2134
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,240
I just followed it.

2135
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,240
I just followed it.

2136
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,240
Well yeah, follow us there.

2137
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,240
And you are not following me.

2138
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,240
You're right.

2139
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,240
Well, we'll be following you.

2140
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,240
We can do that.

2141
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,240
I'm sure that each one of you does the-

2142
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,240
Jason does.

2143
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,240
It's his fault that we're not following you.

2144
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,240
All right.

2145
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:38,960
How else am I going to get more followers if you're of all the places?

2146
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,960
All right.

2147
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:40,960
Thank you everybody.

2148
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,960
Thank you for listening.

2149
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:42,960
Thanks.

2150
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,319
All right.
