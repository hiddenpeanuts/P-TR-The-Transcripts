00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Welcome to podcast the ride the second gate where today we set sail on one of the most ill-advised

2
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:35,360
ventures in theme park history pseudo theme park history. I'm scott gertner mike carlson how do you feel about this one?

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,680
I feel sort of sad that it didn't make it because in concept everything that I've

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,680
Seen online at least in concept. This seems cool. It seems like it could have been cool

5
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,240
But it was a disaster and why and why not try to I know it seems like an odd fit of brand and

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,080
Thing to do but like why should disney be to get the full cruise pie? It doesn't make sense. There's so much

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Wonderful ip that universal has and uh jason charidan. Are you disappointed you didn't get to try this? Um,

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Yeah, I guess um

9
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Yeah, I don't know. I just uh

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,640
Sorry, I don't use I just feel a little what confused a little weird about

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,040
What's wrong? What's going on? What's what are what's happening to you right now? Uh

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,120
Well, you know, you guys know I I like doing the research for the show. I love digging digging down

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,120
We know that yeah. Yeah, that's one of your things one of your trademarks. Yeah. Yeah a little research boy and I

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,800
but um

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,120
You know, I found I found some like speculation of like when will universal try to tackle the cruise market, but I

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,680
I really didn't find a lot else about this

17
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,520
and I

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,640
I don't know. What do you I? I it's not like it was the deepest dive. I don't think I've

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,120
I know all about the shrek deck. I know all about hitch cocks the adults only lounge

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,800
Like why why was this so crazy? Um, he splat ets wet and wild the children's kiddie pool with the giant et

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,640
I yeah. Yeah. No, yeah, I I came across some of that. I don't I maybe i'm just feeling weird

22
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,800
Maybe we should have pushed this recording. I've just been kind of

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,160
Like I feel like weird stuff is going on. Like I like first off. I don't even know how we got

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,480
This zoom. I usually mike sends out the zoom email, but I just got texted a zoom link and like

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,680
Well, I was wait wait from wait a minute. I just that happened to me like yeah

26
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,400
It had no source. Like I assumed it was from mike, but then there was just it was just blank

27
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
It I don't know where the yeah, I thought that was a weird tip

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Yeah, we showed up and it was you and I in the room and then mike and so

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,920
I just chalked it up to technical difficulties. But then I was I've been kind of rearranging like trying to

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,120
Purge and rearrange my room and stuff and like I came across the coffee coin you remember

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,320
Where like two years from city walk? This is the city walking. Yeah, the city wall coffee

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,520
We're about two years out from the city walk saga. And um, oh, yeah, we'll wait. Yeah. Yeah, we yeah

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,640
We were doing this. Yeah, well like two years ago right now. Yeah, and and I

34
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,080
It it felt like it was calling to me

35
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,840
And I feel like if I looked at it at the corner of my eye it it looked like it was glowing like pulsate like

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,600
what so are you uh, how much how much has the the pot smoking increased during I know it's like

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,800
It's that you've enjoyed it during the eat it. These people don't usually hallucinate. Jason, what are you smoking and can I have some of it?

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
You know, I that's

39
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,720
That's fair. I mean it's certainly helping with the the quarantine but but yeah, not not significantly that it would

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,360
It would be that bad. But I you know, I kind of I unwrapped the coin because it it was still

41
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:59,200
Had some painter's tape on it from the live show. Um, and I I gave it a wash. I gave I cleaned it just to see

42
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,720
Because I realized like yeah, it was really grimy, you know, you got to give it a clean coins. I yeah and I

43
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,240
I never noticed this before there was an inscription on the coin

44
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
An inscription, I mean, I guess I never got a good look at it, but there's wait

45
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,720
There's like something on it that you didn't see before. Yeah, and it was like, you know, I was like, I'm not sure

46
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,040
It's like something on it that you didn't see before. Yeah, and it it said when two years have come and gone

47
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,680

It's like home

93
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,020
Yeah, yeah, well that's sort of true. I mean like

94
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,060
I I guess it's funny that this can there must have been

95
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,500
Something in the air because I don't it's all it's almost like like in a way

96
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,820
we knew that this was coming and that we were going to be called to do this because

97
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
strangely a couple days ago

98
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,380
The three of us gathered for the first time anywhere in six months

99
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,460
And we actually went up to city walk

100
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:25,140
All together we were finally we the three of us finally reconvened up. We went to city walk. Yeah. Yeah, it was crazy

101
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,660
It was crazy

102
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
so

103
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Reconvened

104
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,140
Uh, yeah, because we haven't seen each other for a

105
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,340
A while and it's kind of weird to be at city walk. You haven't seen each other

106
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,460
summer break

107
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,940

113
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,340
Do you know what?

114
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,900
There's something happening in the world right now sector keeper that is preventing a lot of people

115
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,540
from gathering

116
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Let me think

117
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,120
Um, yeah, take your time in their houses watching the tokyo olympics

119
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
i'm stumped

120
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,660
Um, I I don't know how to tell you you're a it's this is tough for anyone to hear let alone a child

121
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,620
Um, there is a we're in the midst of a global pandemic. There's a disease that is

122
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,780
Is all over the world? It's not even just just los angeles everywhere on earth is currently

123
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,780
Stuck under the shadow of this very bad disease and we have been for the majority of the year

124
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,820
Oh

125
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,860
Oh, wow, I I missed all of this I was uh

126
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,300
I was on a cricket wireless corporate retreat and we weren't allowed to have phones

127
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,400
What what you were even though it's a phone company

128
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah, that was kind of part of the theme it was about unplugging

129
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,940
so they took our they took our phones and we

130
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,640
Uh, we stayed in cabins and solving

131
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,960
For six months for six months, you know, we just kind of did retreat activities

132
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,680
about how um

133
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
It's better to have

134
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Snacks in the break room than to have a union that kind of stuff

135
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,760
Oh, yeah learned about the family tree of the cricket wireless goo goo people

136
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes. Oh, yeah, he showed up goo. We love goo

137
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,280
He did you know that the goo from cricket wireless is married to the mucinex mom?

138
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,160
Oh, that's like the voice of mickey marrying the voice of minnie. That's so cute

139
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,620
Yeah, that is that's nice. I hope they party with flubber sometimes

140
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Flubber is their dog. I think

141
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,440
He can't talk it's like plow that's a pet

142
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,480
so you've got so sector keeper you

143
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,120
Famously in the last in the downtown disney ordeal you were looking for severance from cricket wireless

144
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:20,520
This sounds like you were looking for a

145
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:28,280
You famously in the last in the downtown disney ordeal you were looking for severance from cricket wireless. This sounds like you were hired back in a corporate setting

146
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
yeah, um, so

147
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,580
We I tried to take them to court and there was a settlement

148
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,880
Um, I don't understand a lot of it, but they let me sign the papers with a cool pen and i'm back

149
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:49,000
Wow, so are you just back in the retail uh sector to speak or yeah, I work the floor

150
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,960
Okay, so you have your old job back essentially. I got my old job back. I get paid a little less

151
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
I get to park a little closer

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,960
um

153
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,640
and uh

154
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,980
The work week includes saturdays

155
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,860
Includes saturdays. So the severance package was just resettling to

156
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,140
Essentially do the same thing but for less money

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Mm-hmm

158
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,180
And a six month corporate retreat

159
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,140
Which sounds fun? I mean I wouldn't mind

160
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,860
Yeah, go into a cabin for a while. You might have had more fun than we've all been having lately

161
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,700
but one cool thing is they use some of my paycheck to put into a

162
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,940
Low interest savings account so that I can maybe afford surgery one day

163
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:45,420
Oh, well, well, that's nice how does does that work everyone pulls their money into a savings account? Yeah, it's like a swear jar

164
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,060
So so the first what is it like the first couple people get their surgeries if they need them

165
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,020
Yeah, it's whoever gets hurt first gets healed first

166
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:01,820
Oh, wow, uh, shouldn't you get preference here back?

167
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,060
Yeah

168
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,580
Can it like bring you back to life because you still exist in this sort of limbo ghost state?

169
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,180
I don't know if there's a surgery to make you a full human again. Oh, um, no pre-existing conditions

170
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,080
Don't count and my death would count as a pre-existing

171
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
condition

172
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,080
Oh shit, that's too bad. You know, maybe one thing to talk about

173
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,360
Right off the gate because there were a lot of odd changes that we encountered when we went up there

174
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,980
But the the place that put you into this condition

175
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,800
to begin with the city walk fountain

176
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,760
Uh is now inaccessible due to the disease

177
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
There's now like a red rope

178
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,860
Surrounding all sides of it. So it's only to look at and no kids can ever play in it again

179
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,100
Hmm

180
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,780
Only took global pandemic to realize unsafe

181
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,980
Yeah, I yeah, I guess I guess story didn't

182
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,020
Resonate. Yeah, that's true. If they had just

183
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,980
If there had been any attention called to your story whenever that happened the mid-90s

184
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,300
then maybe

185
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,700
A lot of kids could have been saved a long time ago

186
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:22,300
Yeah, your story sector keeper. I'm surprised it has not been co-opted by some sort of political movement and used in a

187
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,820
vast

188
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,060
Right-wing conspiracy to be honest with you

189
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,020
hmm

190
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,020
Well, that's something for the movies

191
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,500
Well, if only it stayed in the movies

192
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:42,800
Boys unfortunately robert kennedy jr is just everyone, you know, everyone's trying to save the truth. It's better

193
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
We don't tell you about this. Uh

194
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,160
Yeah, yeah, I would love for you to not hear about anything that's been happening in the last couple years the the boys boys

195
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
There's a lot to cover. There's a reason i'm here

196
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:02,080
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please get to it boys. So sector 20 is jam-packed and loaded with lots of food and fun

197
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,400
sector 20 is

198
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360

Good luck boys there

205
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,040
And remember

206
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,260
If you complete this you'll give me strength

207
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,160
Yeah, that's that's the stuff isn't this nice to hear I felt so

208
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:46,080
Unstructured during this entire pandemic like it's hard to set boundaries of when you work and when you don't like I've that I feel

209
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,360
My life just feels tidier having this assignment to do

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh good. Good. Well, there's a lot to cover and i'm sure you boys have a lot to say

211
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,920
Um, we do um, and and it was it was a lot of fun to go up there

212
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,760
Um, and and we will talk everything that you just listed is new

213
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
At citywalk since we did this

214
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,280
Two years ago. Um, so that's that's good news for you that we can tell you that there's a lot of new fun stuff to do

215
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
shops and restaurants

216
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,160
Um, I do feel like we have to let you know

217
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
I forgot to mention

218
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,640
If you don't complete this i'm in grave danger

219
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Wait how what?

220
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,240
Grave danger and I would have guessed I guess per usual in grave danger

221
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,840
That's why i'm back, but i'm back for a limited time. You see

222
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:50,500
The corporate retreat has not fully ended boys. I need you to complete sector 20 to give me strength to leave solvang

223
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,680
Yeah, you should that's where you're coming from that's where you're like astral zooming from

224
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,200
Yeah, i'm astral projecting from solvang not to over complicate it but yes, uh, uh

225
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Lots on the line. Okay. Good luck

226
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,960
Oh, boy, I mean he should I I didn't want to say anything but like he does look like he's been mostly

227
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,480
eating able skeevers the puffy pancakes because

228
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,460
He's looking a little puffy right now as if he spent six months at solvang just eating pancakes

229
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,920
Yeah, jason, would you switch places with him? Uh

230
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
Out of the current I mean i'd consider it

231
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:28,800
All right

232
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,920
So if we don't just actor keeper if we don't do it if we don't complete our mission

233
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:39,040
And jason will drive up to solvang and dress like you and switch places now. Wait a minute. I thought that was a hypothetical question

234
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,560
No, no, you'll trade lives. Oh, that's fair. That's fair. My my boss is shaking his head. He says that's fair

235
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,760
Your boss is watching you podcast right now

236
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,560
Yes

237
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Okay, very intrusive. Yeah

238
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,680
He just wants a body there. He just wants a head count

239
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,160
Yes, he wants yes

240
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,320
Jason's photo is on the wall of every avar skeever

241
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,460
Restaurant here in solvang. I like to support local small businesses

242
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,720
Is it like his headshot like at a dry cleaner?

243
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,640
Uh, yes, it's like a headshot at a dry cleaner also

244
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,200
It's almost like a competitive type photo where you were uh, you

245
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
You ate the biggest avar skeever and got it for free

246
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,520
Okay, well because what happens is if you do one of the places challenge

247
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,080
Then the then you can get the other challenges for free like they they you know, I have a system

248
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Clearly yeah, you swept it

249
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,600
But boys boys boys, we must focus. We must focus

250
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,240
Please get in a separate challenge

251
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,480
All right. Okay. We got a lot to cover

252
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,040
There's different stages of clothes much like states phased reopening city walk has different stages of clothes

253
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,160
Yeah, what I was getting at surger keeper is that for there's five new things to do?

254
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,440
Uh, and that's good. That's progress but um

255
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,200
Uh, there there have also been some losses. I am sorry to report that there have been

256
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
Honestly a vast degree of fallen brothers

257
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,720
Fallen brothers

258
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,680
Yes, I saw some of raider store

259
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,120
Open. Oh, thank god. No raider images raider images open and thriving in the middle of the week

260
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
wide open

261
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,840
Mid pandemic raiders fans crowding store raiders crowds crowding store as raiders

262
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,620
Raiders organization moves to las vegas. Mm-hmm

263
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,460
Yeah, that's the city move when things are going wrong

264
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,260
Some things when things are going wrong. Some things are still right

265
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,980
Hey, we're all in this together, you know

266
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,460
I will say it's still there

267
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,900
Margaritaville is not open but the raider store is

268
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,420
Now, what do we think about this was one confusing thing about our trip is margaritaville closed

269
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,500
I don't think it's closed for good because it's not gutted but like is it ever open?

270
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:19,300
It wasn't we do it a wednesday afternoon. Yeah, I don't know if it's ever open. I'm not sure

271
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,640
Um, let's let's go through the things closed down permanently

272
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,300
Okay

273
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,220
Let's give the sector keeper space to breathe here because this is going to be tough

274
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:35,940
This is going to be like hearing a laundry list of relatives that have passed away. Okay, most recent ludo bird gone

275
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
uh

276
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,900
Let's see, what else hard rock cafe gone becoming toothsome chocolate

277
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,500
uh

278
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:51,780
And savory treat import whatever the place that smells upsetting in florida because they're cooking savory food and chocolate

279
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
simultaneously in the same facility

280
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,860
um now

281
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,860
There is I would sort of say there's a new

282
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:04,600
Dog that's debuting a spokes dog for the toothsome chocolate. Have we seen this? Uh, yes those boston dynamic

283
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,480
Robot dogs that will eventually hunt us down

284
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,240
Yes, uh

285
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,440
Jacques is the robot man that was there already, uh and

286
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:21,720
Dr. Toothsome is the female like steampunk woman and then latte is their dog and that character is new

287
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
So I just wanted to mention latte

288
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,100
Uh latte debuted right around the time, uh universal florida laid off a significant number of employees

289
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:35,760
But latte is working. They fired a thousand humans and hired one robot dog named latte

290
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:44,220
So anyway, go ahead city walk hollywood though, so hard rock's gone. There's still one on hollywood boulevard sublime

291
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
uh gone like

292
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,740
2016 perfectly preserved in amber the billboards for swell water bottles and patty wax candles still

293
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Loom above the empty store front

294
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:02,940
Uh something from our theme song is gone. It's gone unless again to reopen this does this is it?

295
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,940
About a sublime hot topic and if so, the hot topic is still there and it is still sublime

296
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,820
Yes, i'll never say what my intention was never say these accursed homonyms

297
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,600
Uh potentially still relevant how let the moon gone move to hollywood boulevard

298
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,720
Oh go ahead what oh

299
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,900
That's correct, oh he howled himself i'm not sure that that hollywood boulevard one has opened though. I didn't see it on their website

300
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,760
Yeah, I don't know. That's that's yeah, they announced the plan. I don't think i'm

301
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,240
I was gonna say i'm sure it's not open, but it's possible. It's been open for six months

302
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,320
I I will look in a second. I believe I got a grand opening email and I believe it might have come

303
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,280
Right before a week before so everything shut down. Oh that might be it

304
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,200
I I was looking at the the locations on their website and it's a lot of

305
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,960
Cities, but then right in the middle of it howl at sea

306
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,800
so speed visiting at the topic we didn't get to there there was a

307
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,880
Uh, you can go to a howl at the moon on the norwegian escape

308
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,360
the cruise ship

309
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
um, which I

310
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Wait, but then it's within a different it's how at the moon, but it's inside

311
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,120
Headliners a separate club entity within norwegian cruises

312
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,360
Uh, i'm confused as always very fitting irony. That is on a ship called escape

313
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,920
The main instinct one feels as they enter the doors of howl at the moon

314
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
uh

315
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Uh

316
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,400
Now I

317
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,160
Now and I think this is very important. There's been some real big developments up at city food. Now city food is the second floor area

318
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
What yes

319
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,640
Um, are you okay city food city food is food court. Yeah, that's the food court

320
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,720
uh

321
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
Keep keep going

322
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,960
Oh, right, we still can't do it. We're still not allowed to go to the food court. All right

323
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,680
That's that's fine. I won't complain. We got places to go. Uh if things are talking about yeah, we have plenty of food to talk about

324
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,940
We have to talk about mbc's take on cheesy fries

325
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,260
Well, hang on you might be getting lax up there with your solving easygoing attitude, maybe we're the ones who have to reinforce

326
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:35,780
Uh the way we step through this and when we are not through with jason's tears of what has closed and to what degree

327
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,340
Please jason the floor is yours. Sorry. Mr. Scott

328
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,660
I guess i'm the the rule setter now

329
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:52,580
Uh, I think that's everything that's closed permanently. There is a yeah, no, no, but there's more there's more levels

330
00:24:52,580 --> 00:25:00,180
Oh, yeah, so the next level right right, right. What was closed when we were up there and possibly might be closed forever

331
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,300
uh

332
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:08,500
And we can all chip in on this because I have I mean the big one that we saw was like samba the brazilian steakhouse

333
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,020
kind of

334
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:15,220
An inconvenient setup in current, uh times not open when we were up there

335
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:22,340
Yeah, I don't want to go to a buffet at this point like a just where meat is being tossed around the room

336
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,380
essentially

337
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,660
Mm-hmm

338
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:31,220
Uh samba. Yeah right by the margaritaville, which is closed again. These both could be closed forever. It is possible

339
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:40,340
Yeah, carl strauss looked wasn't open when we were there had no outside tables was unclear what the status of carl strauss was

340
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,300
Yeah, i've i've heard word from you know, the rumor mill that

341
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,940
Universal is trying to

342
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:54,200
Own everything that exists at city walk. So I do wonder if universal is using some backdoor machinations

343
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:00,500
To try to force certain things out of there so they can put in their own toothsome chocolate type things

344
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,780
With their own intellectual property and their own robot dogs

345
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,860
Yeah

346
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,300
Do you think they made the disease? Is this part of their plan? Well, you know, some people are saying

347
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,420
Some people are saying this a lot of i'm not saying they're saying it. Yeah, but a lot of people are saying it

348
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,420
That bathroom by the hot topic

349
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,620
I was gonna say something that would be made for a movie

350
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,700
Straight from the movies that's true

351
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,140
Yeah, I know but you you might not know the degree to which the actual world is getting scary

352
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:39,620
Like those scare the pg-13 movies you would watch before you died things are starting to feel like that a lot

353
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,340
hmm

354
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:49,380
Who else is close who else is close popcornopolis when we were there clothes zen zone I fly

355
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,260
the movie theater

356
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:59,540
Zen, so we can't go into a tube. We can't put people in and out of a tube where you fly we can't like

357
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:06,740
Uh have like a literal aerosol trap that you fly around in during this pandemic

358
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:12,980
Uh, yeah, they they I you know, there are some uh devices they have in the zen zone though that I feel like might be healing

359
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,980
You know, there's those

360
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,980
oxygen machines

361
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,660
Maybe they can put the vaccine in the zen zone oxygen machine and and get it in that way

362
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,660
Well, I want to show you guys, uh, um, you're set up with a screen share capability sector keeper, right?

363
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,620
Uh, I believe so. Yes, I would have to

364
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,700
Uh, uh, all right. Wonderful. So yes, brian's my boss

365
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,740
Um, uh, all right then brian can take a look at this too, uh, here's i'm just going to show you guys the uh,

366
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,700
This is what we found on the door of the zen zone or the water coffins

367
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,380
uh

368
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,380
Here is a number of

369
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,680
notices

370
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
About uh covid-19

371
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:06,500
regulations, let me just count the pieces of paper one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen

372
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,140
There are 17

373
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,600
Laminated pieces of paper on the door along with a padlock

374
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,620
so city walks, uh

375
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:22,020
Doing as good as ever I went and like looked at some of the handwriting to see like some of what I don't know if this is

376
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,300
What they have to do for the city's sake it just looks like they're trying to do something

377
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,580
I don't know if this is what they have to do for the city's sake it clearly didn't help them reopen the place

378
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,940
I'm, not sure the purpose of any of it, but I took one

379
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:42,260
Photo of some of the handwriting mike's upset outside. He can't he's very sore. I know I look like i'm sexually sexually posing

380
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:51,300
Very coy. Yes. Yeah, it looks like scandalous mask. We don't know what face you're making under there. Mike looks like pinup girl

381
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:59,220
Yeah, I really do. I thought I was selling a back injury a body 40s, baby, huh? I'm looking good

382
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,420
Um, so here's uh some of the copy like somebody handwritten wrote, you know how the

383
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,980
How does all the covet regulations apply to the zen zone and then listen to this our aqua massage have?

384
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,660
Zero contact it is self-directed from a machine with no human touch

385
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,160
Customers remains fully clothed

386
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,560
Just so surreal that these things that we experienced two years ago all have to one by one

387
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,560
Discuss with the city and the public the city of us the county of les angeles public health

388
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,240
Bureau whether they can do this

389
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,080
Reopen or not

390
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:45,160
This feels like there was an inspector like an inspector coming to city walk to like discuss with them if they could open or not

391
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,120
And the person never came and they're like, well, I print it all out. Just write just explain to them

392
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,960
We'll just stick it on the wall if they come by and then they'll just like put a big yes

393
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,440
They'll like leave a note that says yes open

394
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:02,860
And it never happened didn't happen. I'm not great at spelling tests, but customer was misspelled

395
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,040
There's a number of yeah, there's some pluralization issues

396
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,280
on this thing

397
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,240
um

398
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:18,200
You know, i'm just glad that you know, I think we we get into the weeds on these these daily podcast series and that's not daily

399
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,680
We're just doing this one and it's it was all two years ago

400
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,880
But I just know that the audience would expect us to read

401
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,400
Some of the bullet points on appendix r from the les angeles department of public health

402
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,920
And we are doing it. So, um, yeah for all your appendix r updates follow podcast

403
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,760
Can we should we find appendix should we find this document online somewhere and give it?

404
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,880
Post it on twitter and you can all out in the audience add your own reasons why zen zone is safe

405
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,200
You know, it'll be a fun contest

406
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,600
We'll have explain why the water coffins are okay during a pandemic like a coloring contest and whoever wins

407
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,600
gets uh

408
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Their bullet point is law

409
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,840
Yeah, exactly

410
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,720
Yes, we'll look for we'll see if we can find this document

411
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:10,760
Full appendix are coming to twitter. Um, so yeah things things really exist in this strange, uh limbo

412
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,560
Um, you'll be happy here searcher keeper, you know, what's not open, you know, it has a ton of pieces of paper on the wall

413
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,860
sparkies

414
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
Sparkies ain't running right now

415
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,600
That's right boo him I don't hell

416
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,320
He might be he might have been sent to hell for poor health regulations he's bad

417
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,000
Yeah

418
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
He's a bad boy. It's very possible

419
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,880
Um, he yeah, he he purposefully coughed on a lot of people sparky. Uh,

420
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,680
Went to trader joe's and tried to film viral videos without masks

421
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,360
he

422
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:52,200
Went and coughed everywhere without a mask and then he got his propeller hat going which helped spread the virus faster

423
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
all around the market

424
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:01,800
And then the biggest insult the video didn't even go viral. So he didn't he didn't get what he wanted at all

425
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,720
I mean we better in case it was we better uh talk about some of these specific I knew going through his mistake

426
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,480
more, um

427
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,800
Popcorn opolis closed nectar bath treats closed when we were there. Um

428
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,320
um

429
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,200
et and frankenstein garages seemed

430
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,000
Impenetrable, I mean you might have been able to get it

431
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,840
Yeah, we were

432
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
Yeah, there was a lot to prevent us

433
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,600
I think et is where because I was very obsessed with trying to see the nintendo land progress, but

434
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,920
It was too hard. I think et would have been the only place you could have maybe gotten a glimpse

435
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah

436
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,280
um

437
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,320
You want to talk a little about um, just how it felt to to be up there because as I said

438
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,360
This was this is the first time we all have hung out since march

439
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:04,200
It was pretty crazy and I think we all felt it that despite all of the the oddity

440
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,880
um

441
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,880
And you know all the fears of right now that

442
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,600
Being in a place that we know so well that we've spent so much time in it was

443
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,240
Very comforting. I think we all were a little touched to emerge into the the center atrium

444
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Yeah, so

445
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,560
We went yeah, we went we parked in the parking garage

446
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,920
We went to this little area where they were doing your temperature check, which is of course theater

447
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,960
It's just theater for people because you know, you can take tylenol and get rid of a temperature

448
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,400
Anyway, they do a temperature check. They have the hand sanitizer there

449
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:44,440
Don't forget one step of this though. You just you just glazed past the parking and this is notable

450
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,640
That how surreal was it to park at city walk for free? Yes

451
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,840
Yes with the parking attendant, uh in the little uh security shack

452
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,560
Being even more checked out than usual like when I pulled up

453
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,280
He did like this with his hand and I was like does that mean keep going or stop?

454
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,160
And then he handed me like a parking ticket

455
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,000
But I I saw no cars plenty of cars in the garage

456
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,520
I saw no cars on the streets driving up there

457
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Mm-hmm. It was uh, yeah

458
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,680
Wow

459
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,640
I got I got a receipt as well. I definitely felt like I was getting away with something

460
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:31,000
And did you feel guilty did you like oh, sorry? No, no go sector keeper. I was gonna say

461
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,320
Actually free parking or did you have to?

462
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,140
Go into amc and do some strange exchange rate

463
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,120
Uh shockingly

464
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,640
For just pure free you but whether you bought anything or not

465
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:54,200
I think a couple of us bought a thing or two, but even if we hadn't yeah you it's finally is genuinely free up there

466
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,440
You're talking about when you uh pay for parking and then

467
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,560
Unless you use the app you have to go into the amc and they give you like a dirty 10 dollar bill

468
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,240
To redeem part of your parking the filthiest around

469
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,600
Uh, no, yeah, we didn't have to do that amc of course was not open

470
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,720
still had the onward posters and posters for

471
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,240
Minions coming soon. Well tenant. Yeah

472
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,880
Tenants up there. I'm very i'm very happy with a very obscure thing that I shot up there that I won't even mention

473
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,360
We'll put it on the social media. No one will understand what the reference is. I didn't get it

474
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:39,640
But now that I it's been explained to me. It's uh delightful. Yeah, so we'll put that up

475
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
but do you mike do you feel like

476
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,320
Does that take away some of the city walk thrill for you in a way that you didn't get to do?

477
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,560
An outsmarting of the system that you don't get to play that that mental game

478
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,440
of trying to park where I can

479
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,560
Yes, I can outsmart them all that's kind of what it is. Uh

480
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,880
There was a lot of other stuff going on in my mind that day

481
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,760
So it was not so high on my list

482
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,720
I think sometimes i'd have to I have to really like be in the pandemic city walk a few times to see

483
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,360
Where the system's weaknesses are there has to be something I can do

484
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,080
But I was just scoping it out this first time and i'm sure there's got to be a way

485
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,520
And I want a spoiler alert. I got a some sort of food to go

486
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:32,280
There might be some sort of discount I can figure out there can be some sort of twitter alert for a coupon perhaps

487
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:38,200
Uh, i'm i'm just at the start of my journey as far as pandemic city walk deals are concerned

488
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,120
Adjusting to the new normal the new the new normal way to try to get value out of this one

489
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,400
theme park adjacent shopping complex. Yes

490
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,780
Absolutely thrilling stuff

491
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,020
Well, someone got drool over the last six months

492
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,460
He used to be polite and like would pretend like he was sick or so

493
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,660
He was like he was getting sick and now he's just he's just goofing on me

494
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,420
That's fine he's grown that's character development that's you know, it's growth it's growth

495
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:20,780
Yeah, well if you didn't find that exciting let me talk about how uh, the the there is though the

496
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,040
Parking rates have changed and in some cases gone down by 45

497
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,920
There is one thing about the parking experience that has maintained it is still incredibly confusing

498
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,300
We all parked in different places

499
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:40,400
We didn't understand where we did and why we all had to follow a series of signs that took you into narrow corridors

500
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,680
The kind of thing you don't want to be in during a pandemic

501
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,400
Uh, it was as confusing as ever and but again normalcy. I kind of like that

502
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,240
Yeah, and they had

503
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,560
They had social distanced the cars

504
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,560
with with cones in between each space

505
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,880
which

506
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,640
What are we doing here folks?

507
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,480
Like there's some basic information about what's actually a concern and I don't think the cars are going to catch covid from each other

508
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,120
Uh, which is what I think that was signaling to me that they thought perhaps a car

509
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,120
Would get covid from another car and then infect a family cars get sick

510
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,280
Well, well in a certain universe like mater

511
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:33,120
Oh, so you've seen cars sector keeper you've seen the movie cars we have movie nights at the compound at the cricket wireless compound

512
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,760
Oh, wow, so you like you like mater

513
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
Mm-hmm mater's funny

514
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,480
Yeah, yeah

515
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,440
Calling it the compound is a little unsettling it starts that's where it starts to feel like sort of a um, you know a nixie

516
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,640
Situation you don't all like dress identically. Do you brian has a lot of good ideas?

517
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,200
Brian has good ideas and we'll get well every

518
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,920
Well every afternoon we get together and play kickball and listen to his ideas

519
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,480
Oh, that's his brand ever like just like loudly discussed

520
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,160
His iq test. Does he like say what his iq is a strange amount of times?

521
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Yeah every day

522
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,080
Every day, huh? That's how we know you don't find that

523
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,040
Alarming or a little like uh, if somebody was really that smart they wouldn't have to

524
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,580
Say it no, he's like bill nye

525
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,000
Okay, brian from cricket wireless is like bill nye

526
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,080
Um, okay

527
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:42,240
I just I guess just be on the lookout that if you if it goes beyond ideas to way make the business better

528
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,080
And heads into I don't know like ways to ascend to higher

529
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,400
Planes or achieve better and I want to say a bad word in front of you

530
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,200
But orgasms if it gets into like that just be on the lookout for some for shady language from brian. Yeah, okay

531
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,160
I will

532
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,240
I'll tell you this. I I felt like I needed bill nye to figure out how to get out of that dang parking garage

533
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,700
They made walking through it as confusing as driving through it now with this uh security

534
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,460
Uh screening stuff. Well, they don't do security screening. No, no still no metal detectors to get into city

535
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:26,100
Yeah, orlando has the metal detectors, but universal does not holly in hollywood does not have them yet, right?

536
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,420
Um, they have yes the temperature check they have also and I really should have written down exactly what it was. They have the

537
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,660
virhovan

538
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,820
Cheery voice telling you to wear a mask and social distance at city walk

539
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:44,820
Oh, it's the classic universal voice. It was kind of nice to hear the voice again, even though it's saying scary things

540
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:52,420
Yeah that uh, there's like a line and like people in masks and then the classic universal voice

541
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,140
Telling you not to get sick

542
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,660
Uh, so I'll be honest I was a little stressed there that was stressful

543
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:06,740
but then when we emerged so we emerge out and if you if I had to

544
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,140
To bet a thousand dollars. I would have bet that we were coming out right by the movie theater

545
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,500
We were not coming out by the movie theater. We were coming out

546
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,140
by the the uh

547
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,060
NBC bar and grill or whatever and the the bamboo cage

548
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,700
Ceiling area of city walk and let's be clear that NBC grill is not it's completed

549
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,460
But it's empty and the tvs are all on outside

550
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:39,460
But and inside and inside but I don't yeah think it's officially open even though it has a decent sized outdoor dining

551
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,140
area

552
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,180
Yes

553
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,860
Um, so we can't really tell you much about the nbc sports grill and brew unfortunately, so keeper. Hope that's okay

554
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:53,460
Yeah, we know it's a good idea. We just don't know you can't even tell me if they have lester holt ribs

555
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,820
Well, i'm hoping

556
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:05,140
Yeah, we're hoping uh, maybe maybe don't know yet maybe you'll have to go back boys

557
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:14,820
Huh, I don't I hope that it gets that creative with the uh, you know blacklist burgers and uh,

558
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,460
What's uh, zoe's incredible?

559
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,100
uh pizza zoe's

560
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,020
That's good that's good

561
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,820
I will say, uh if for nothing else we have to go back to meet latte

562
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,020
So we'll at least get back there to meet latte

563
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,940
Do you think we're getting a latte or they just shipping that latte or they overnighting that latte to the hollywood one?

564
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
You're saying maybe they won't have separate lattes

565
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,500
Hmm

566
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:50,180
I don't know. It depends how how much longer we're in lockdown. That's true. But then latte could be a spreader

567
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,340
What if somebody gave latte?

568
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,880
Covid in florida and then it's shipped here and then it spreads it here

569
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,800
And then latte gives it to a car in the parking garage and all the other cars get it

570
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,920
They all their hoods pop up. They're all coughing

571
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,640
And then they give it to uh one of jay's cars in the big dog garage and then it's over all of burbank

572
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
My family they're all sick

573
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,120
I lost every last one of them

574
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,880
All 300

575
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,600
And the motorcycles too. I knew it was a problem when the motorcycles got it

576
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,560
the sweet innocent motorcycles

577
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,440
300 sounds low, doesn't it? Yeah, he probably has more cars than cars. Yeah

578
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,840
Uh, so we emerge we emerged in the bamboo cage ceiling area

579
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,240
And I think I said and I was feeling I go i'm a little emotional

580
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,120
Yeah

581
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:56,280
But uh, I haven't I really we have really not been out much late at all. We're very very uh locked down here

582
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,200
Uh, and it was like a mixture of being outside

583
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,000
And in a place I have a lot of fondness for

584
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,080
So it wasn't like bawling or anything, but I was like, huh? I'm a little touched

585
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,240
I'm a little i'm a little moved

586
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:14,600
I could tell it was affecting you guys in another way because both it seems like both of you guys like forgot how to walk

587
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:22,120
You're both well, like straining yours like mike you walked up like a half set of stairs and we're like, oh god

588
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,760
Never walk anymore. Well, I was oh, okay. You explain yourself. I'll explain myself

589
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:37,960
Well, I think cycle psychologically I get very i've only been into a couple stories. I would we're crazy about keeping inside so

590
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,720
I was in a best buy for like eight minutes and like I start to like I feel physical problems

591
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:50,360
Like I have a mental block of being around people a lot in this situation

592
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,920
Even if I kind of intellectually know

593
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,640
That this is probably fine. So I think it's something that you did it. I'm glad you you did this

594
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,480
Yeah, and also it's affecting the fact that i've mentioned this on the show before

595
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,400
Somebody once referred to my walk as the walk of a fancy horse

596
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,200
so I think that

597
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Whatever anxiety I was feeling

598
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:20,360
And it was it was low anxiety wasn't like crazy or anything. But whatever I was feeling was certainly affecting my gait

599
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,720
It was certainly affecting the the manner in which I moved

600
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
Mike's trot looks weird

601
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:33,400
Mike's trot looks weird. He should have brought a salt lick along for comfort

602
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,880
Yeah, yeah, so that was that was I think probably any any strange energy. I was giving off

603
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,280
Well, and I just got I got a cramp so I have been

604
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
uh when when

605
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,200
The first few months of lockdown I was making sure to like walk like take a long walk every day

606
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,880
and then

607
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,240
Uh half the state of california caught on fire

608
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,800
So trying to do a walk hurt both my eyes and my chest

609
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,520
So I really had not been walking very much the air quality slowly clearing up

610
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,160
Um, I might still kind of bothering my eyes. But um

611
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,280
Uh, yeah, so if I don't like stretch I forgot to like stretch in the morning

612
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,280
So I got a cramp like and we we took a sit upstairs in the totally empty seating area

613
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,960
You gotta limber up. Uh, yeah city walk you gotta

614
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,400
I was very worried worried about you. I'll be honest. I was like I looked over and I was like what?

615
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:37,320
Well, yeah, we were coming up a slight incline and I was like my my leg was cramping up. So

616
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,560
But had an ice it for a few minutes and then I felt fine. So

617
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,200
Uh, I forgot that yeah, you're right

618
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,560
It has been harder to walk because of air quality and and I have I have something that circumvents all this as I said

619
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:55,000
Which is that i'm putting on daily dance parties, uh for a baby. Um

620
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,160
Uh sector keeper. I don't know if you know this. I have a kid now that happened since

621
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,280
Since I talked to you last. Yeah. Yeah

622
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:10,440
thanks, um, there is uh, i'm sorry to say that I have another child in my life and it's a little

623
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,440
More I have to defer to him over you i'm glad when you if you ever need it, let me know

624
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:22,520
No, no, of course, of course no, so good boy has good boy

625
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,000
Hey, that's that's how I felt about it

626
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,560
And the only thing that I do feel guilty about is that you know, I know you remember how we met all your cousins and

627
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,920
They sent us on all these different adventures that we got to do. Yeah

628
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,240
The expeditions are just I mean they're already tough because of lockdown and now with the extra time being apparent

629
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,440
I'm just like i'm not sure how many of your cousins i'm gonna get to

630
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,200
Hang with in the near future. It's just very imposing to do these

631
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,840
30 day series or whatever. Well, we met one of them not long ago. Yeah, he did. Oh, right. He was a jerk

632
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:02,040
Hey, we met the american dream keeper from new jersey. I don't know how well you know him. He was an absolute ass

633
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,600
Yeah, he was mean to us. Yeah. Yeah, I know i'm okay from um

634
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,480
From like christmas and stuff, you know when you get together. Um,

635
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:18,280
Oh, that's a bummer. I'm sorry to hear that. Uh, uh, hey, but scott. I know you're saying you're maybe a little low on time

636
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:25,080
Remember spirits live forever. So we'll we'll always have time for you. Well, you'll get to it

637
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,120
Well, that's nice

638
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:33,640
All right, so we'll do we'll get to we'll get through that full list when i'm like by the time i'm like

639
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,540
74

640
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,080
Yeah, yeah

641
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,960
74. Yeah. Yeah, and none of it's behind the paywall

642
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,400
And in the meantime since scott can't care for you, uh, sector keeper, whatever whenever you get out of the compound just move on with jason

643
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,400
Yeah, sure. Yeah, i'd love that. Yeah. Yeah

644
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:02,040
We just gotta make sure to do some some stretching and walk it with me because I clearly my body will just fall apart

645
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,080
Oh like visiting my grandpa

646
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,360
Yeah

647
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,360
Basically, yeah. Yeah

648
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:15,480
I'm, assuming uh grandparents also have allergy attacks in their eyes as well. Like I've been experiencing for about a week. So

649
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,600
And get tummy aches from drinking seltzer

650
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,560
That was me. Yeah, that was that was both

651
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:27,420
We both we both done that before. Yeah, we agreed on that boy. That was my favorite part of the kusamigos

652
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,000
Imagine me listening to that and like I can't respond to this right now kusamigos episode

653
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,120
I I was so amped up for it. I don't remember most of it

654
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,960
Hey, that was one of the yeah mike and I working on our marketing plan, you know

655
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,080
We met up to take pictures on uh los angeles city bikes

656
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,960
Oh, that's right. Yeah, you guys met up. Yeah. Yeah, but the three and after our big fight we hadn't convened

657
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,200
We had a person and we got to do it here

658
00:49:52,280 --> 00:50:00,120
You know what would help you jason, uh, I think with future uh walks and posture and not sprangling if you say fruits and vegetables

659
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,520
I don't want to hear it again. No, that's a lost cause

660
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,280
Um, no, i'm i'm talking about you need some better

661
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,960
footwear

662
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:16,280
Uh big new big headline new we really buried the lead that the flip-flop shop is gone

663
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,760
and instead it's replaced by

664
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,620
Hawaii enos, hava

665
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:28,200
Anas, havaianas, uh, it is not havalinas the wild boar found in parts of the world

666
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,480
But have I not just full of boars when you open the door?

667
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:37,240
Um, yeah, it's the flip-flop shop has been replaced by a different store that sells flip-flops

668
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,120
wow, it's

669
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,840
It's a bit of a lateral move you might say

670
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,120
Not that that's bad extremely. Yeah

671
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,760
no, brian says there's no bad ideas

672
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,280
Oh, but see he's conditioning you i think brian might have some really bad ideas

673
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:01,080
What so havaianas did you get to go inside did you try on flip-flops

674
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:07,000
I I did I looked around a little bit. I asked them some questions. They said they were from brazil

675
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:12,680
I said cool. They asked if I wanted to try anything on I was like absolutely not i'm not gonna go

676
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,760
Like I don't think i'd be doing that anyway for foot cleaning

677
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,980
You don't want to try a barefoot shoe on during pandemic

678
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:27,340
During pandemic it didn't sound good to me. No despite how nice the person in there

679
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:34,060
Was made me feel awkward and then I left uh right away. So, uh, that's that's my report about

680
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:42,060
Havaianas shit. Yeah, there was three it said three customers could go in at a time scott was the only customer in

681
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:46,060
jason and I looked through the window as if there was some sort of uh

682
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:50,860
A bunch of chocolate being made or something. Yes, and I later learned that uh

683
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:57,820
Havaianas embodies brazil's fun and vibrant and spontaneous way of life and at

684
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:04,380
200 million sold a year. It's the most popular flip-flop brand in the world both of those

685
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,100
according to the havaianas

686
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,380
Twitter and website and that sort of thing

687
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,940
Yeah

688
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,180
uh, I was looking online because you know

689
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,900
We we of course talked about the sock market in the city walk

690
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,820
So I was looking online to see if there were any maybe like dirty flip-flops

691
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,260
With like a dirty message on them or an aggressive message

692
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:34,220
So you were looking for dirty mike carlson google's dirty flip-flop. That's not a foot fetish thing

693
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,100
That is just I was looking for for comedy

694
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,780
Like the sock that said carpe the fuck out of this dm

695
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:46,080
Mm-hmm famously, uh, but there's nothing like that. It's all there's a couple, uh, you know

696
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,320
stranger things and star wars flip-flops, but mostly

697
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,600
I mean the most outrageous thing is there's a skull

698
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,960
There's a skull on some flip-flops, I think

699
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,000
Wow

700
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,160
That's about the extent of how how crazy the brand is

701
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,600
Well, I guess that's that yeah, so

702
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,880
Hey since you you mentioned the sock market

703
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:16,480
There's exciting developments since we were there. We were there on a wednesday friday afternoon

704
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:22,240
There was an update on the city walk on the universal studios hollywood twitter account city walk update

705
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:30,320
Wetzel's pretzels and la sock market have reopened both are open friday through sunday only noon to eight p.m

706
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,120
so

707
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,120
A return to normal, huh?

708
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,120
Yeah

709
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,440
For the weekend, yeah

710
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,240
Yeah, because wetzel's was closed where I have a picture of you despairing outside of it. Well, jason was happy. I was happy

711
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,520
I was happy. Oh because that you made the what defeated your stomach, uh before the

712
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,880
indoor skydiving the beast has been felled during the week. Yes. Yes, senator giebert

713
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:03,520
If sock market strong economy us economy good

714
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,480
I guess that's fair

715
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,800
Well, I mean the fed has been pumping the sock market full of

716
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,560
Liquidity actually during this last six to nine months

717
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:23,040
Uh, so some people would say that just because the sock market is strong. It doesn't necessarily reflect to the actual economy, especially right now

718
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,600
So I just say and there's been a little bit of a pullback lately, uh on the stock on the stock market

719
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,680
so people are a little bit, uh

720
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,960
Worried people are still cautious as far as the stock market goes and not maybe not willing to carpe the fuck out of this dm

721
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,680
That's what steve munchen and larry kudlow said, uh last week at least

722
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,520
They were they were really waiting for the the minions

723
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:56,640
Sequel socks and the wonder woman 84 socks and like all the stuff that's been pushed the black widow socks. Um,

724
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:03,600
Yeah, they're thinking that the stim if they're if they have to pass another stimulus for all of us before maybe there's more

725
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,840
More faith in the sock market. Hmm

726
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,560
Yeah, so

727
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:15,600
We figured it out. We figured it out. Yeah. Um, the what have we not

728
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,960
What's in that list that we haven't done to make sure we cover?

729
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,120
Anteheato's

730
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,600
Oh anteheato's. I can't tell if you did finish talking about nbc's

731
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,160
I

732
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,560
I think we did

733
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,200
There's just not a lot we can say it's the former tony romas

734
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,440
Um, and they did almost nothing to it except put on a tv that plays

735
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,080
For no one. Mm-hmm

736
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,400
Anteheato's I have been

737
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:48,240
Anteheato's a few times now before pandemic. Have you guys been I forget I did in florida

738
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,680
Not not here. I really like uh, I have not been

739
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,680
But you I went I went before horror nights last year

740
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:02,480
I went we were we saw some movie. I forget what movie and we saw we ate there before i'm i'm i'm into it

741
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,080
I like it a lot. All three of us agreed. We're not really like

742
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:12,240
ready to eat at a table with other people outside of our bubbles yet even outside so we

743
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,800
we uh, yeah, we did not eat at anahito's or the

744
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:24,720
Bubba gump or outside, uh bubblegump annex where the hat stands hat stands are currently inactive. No hat stands

745
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,120
Right now. Well, take it from someone who's died a good call

746
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:34,480
Yeah, hopefully no no ghost boys join you uh as much as you might like having some new friends

747
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,520
Yeah, my friend

748
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:44,800
Menchies was open was it? Yeah, I oh, okay minchi bad boy

749
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,720
Yeah, I guess menchies menchies is one of the people that's been around for a long time

750
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,720
I don't know if you guys know menchies

751
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:59,920
Minchi bad boy. Yeah, I guess menchies menchies is one of the people that early on was saying

752
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,920
We must keep the economy open. So

753
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,120
That's just I guess

754
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,280
Yeah menchies point of view I guess

755
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,880
You got to use gloves. I think I think that was a big change at menchies

756
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,680
You have to use gloves to because you because menchies you have to and we've talked about this before

757
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,200
I don't really care as much for scooping my own toppings on frozen yogurt

758
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:25,120
But this new change is not that they do it for you. It's that you just put on like disposable gloves

759
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:30,080
That seemed that seemed to be the vibe or you have to bring your own winter gloves into a menchie

760
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,600
They've got to be padded yeah

761
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:44,720
Leather gloves leather vortex at least bring a byo g. Yeah, that's right

762
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,240
Bring your own gloves tcby is now byo g

763
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,520
airtight and jason

764
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,200
Jason did not have his frozen yogurt gloves with I did not have the frozen

765
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,960
gloves

766
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,080
um

767
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,800
Uh, no, so we didn't end up eating anything up there. But you know what we did what we felt we had to do

768
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:10,720
Was support the local businesses of city walk and we bought some masks and not just any masks

769
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,680
but masks with the classic neon

770
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:20,960
Universal studios logo and we got some photos that will post of the three of us looking very happy and normal

771
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,880
all wearing

772
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,000
matching

773
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,720
cool retro masks. It's almost better. We have a new way to express ourselves. It's cool. It's cool

774
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,160
We cool. We we put them on we oh, they were sealed in bags

775
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:40,000
We opened up those bags put them right on and boy. Did they smell like industrial grade shit?

776
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,760
They stink to high heaven

777
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:49,920
Three just three boys and stinky masks. Well, surely these are not just repurposed novelty panties

778
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,160
We said as we put them on our faces

779
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,280
You think they're

780
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,280
like vending machine

781
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,880
Is this the debut of the word panties on podcast the ride no, I don't

782
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:18,880
We might just call it edible underwear, maybe I was gonna say I think that's the body word panties well, we're behind the paywall. Yeah

783
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:28,240
But it just felt like very thin like like joke gag gag material like it didn't feel like joke gag joke gag

784
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,240
Well it was like a Halloween costume

785
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,240
Yeah like a Halloween costume

786
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,240
We were wearing a sliced up Dracula's cape

787
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,040
Yes

788
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,200
But we were tricked into buying because it had a 90s thing on it

789
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,040
It fit fine. I mean it was fine. It's probably fine

790
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:48,960
I it was the first time I encountered small medium and large masks. Like I think we all just bought mediums

791
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,400
Yeah, I don't know my mask size. Yeah the hell yeah

792
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:57,440
Um, you gotta get sized you got you guys haven't gotten sized at a tailor for your mask

793
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,360
No

794
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:06,240
I'll be unfitted. Okay, my luxury mask. I went to Joseph a bank and got sized for my mask

795
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,960
That's weird, I thought everyone did that

796
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,520
You're gonna like the way you mask I guarantee it

797
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:22,640
Um, you bought uh, all the retro stuff is out at the studio store scott. You bought the mug you bought the coffee mug

798
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,720
I bought a mug. That was nice. Yeah, it's nice to see all the basic stuff in the studio store. Nice to see the retro

799
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,480
logos

800
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,600
um

801
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,080
Yeah, um just just nice to be there and be spending you know, I've

802
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:41,760
I've really missed giving my money to this place. I didn't give any money to abercrombie kids

803
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,240
Um, that's a new place sector keeper. You were excited about that because that's a kid's thing

804
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,900
abercrombie kids

805
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,280
Sort of like

806
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,560
off-puttingly

807
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,480
uh breathy

808
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,840
I feel

809
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,980
I guess you I guess that's just childlike joy, but abercrombie abercrombie

810
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,340
Is for the cool kid

811
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:16,180
Oh wow, so so the kids you know are all no I forget what is your age? What is your age at this point?

812
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,220
What?

813
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:28,740
I'm just forgetting because you're working so you're not like an eight-year-old kid. Are you i'm well, I i'm timeless. I'm i'm

814
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:34,500
I'm as old as I was when I passed don't oh don't drum that up michael

815
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,820
Oh, i'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't

816
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:42,500
Reopening wounds. Yeah, that's my fault. Um

817
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:50,840
Isn't it just like universal that if you're wearing abercrombie, you're one of the cool kids

818
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:57,460
That is universal and that's probably why universal chose to uh open it up there

819
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,300
Yeah, yeah

820
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:04,660
So basically there's a new there's a new door that says abercrombie kids so you can enter a different way

821
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:09,860
That's a kid section. I went up to the door you guys encouraged me to you have a kid you get in there

822
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,060
I started opening the door and I was like, I don't need to know what's in

823
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,260
Abercrombie kids I could see through the it's all I don't know. It's all like khaki pants, but little that's the end of that

824
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,540
Well, and we can get yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Go ahead

825
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:30,500
Oh, I was gonna say we're all this made because there was a new store called production central that replaced the old skate shop

826
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:37,060
Uh that used to be next to like hot topic around that area and that was closed when we were up there

827
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:44,420
It appeared to have the identical material for the identical product for sale. It's the studio store half a block down

828
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:50,900
But with a really bad logo a terrible font that they did add that yeah

829
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:53,940
um

830
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,460
What haven't we

831
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,100
Tilly's

832
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:02,500
Oh, man, well everyone buckle up for the 30 minutes of tilly's talk

833
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,340
Um, it's a small tilly's which mike and jason have go

834
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:10,980
It's like tilly's but it's small. It used to be angel. It's now tilly's

835
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:15,060
It's small angel is now tilly's. No, it's now tilly's

836
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:18,900
You know what? I'm sorry. Maybe i'm getting these tillies

837
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,380
Angel is tilly's that's a big adjustment for you to make I know

838
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,380
Hmm you're trying you're trying to square it

839
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,020
Is not angel

840
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,900
No, not the other way

841
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,260
Yeah, why even so much problem with so much of a problem with this

842
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,260
Tillie's is cool. Yeah

843
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,820
Angel is now tilly's

844
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:48,820
Hmm, he's you weren't brian isn't putting stuff in your water. Is he?

845
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:56,420
Brian no brian's no, he's just in his recliner behind me

846
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,100
He's writing in his journal

847
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:04,340
He's fully clothed, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah

848
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:10,180
Can I ask is brian does brian like um purified rain water and grain alcohol?

849
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,180
Whoa, yeah, wait, whoa, you know brian

850
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,540
Yeah, yeah sure

851
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,380
Okay, huh?

852
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,820
Let's probably move on

853
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:25,460
I just think you should get out. I think I think you should get out of there and we should you guys are gonna

854
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:30,900
Help me get out of here. Yeah. Well if and again if we don't do it jason will come and help

855
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,780
Yeah, well if and again if we don't do it jason will come and replace you. Yeah

856
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:43,060
Get to hang out with brian and drink rain water all day as long as you can walk around and you can get some exercise

857
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,340
Jason there's a lot of land

858
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,380
I you know, I like that

859
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,140
Sounds good

860
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:57,220
Clear air up there when it's not on fire and brian will make you walk because brian monitors everyone's weight. Oh, that's true

861
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,220
Um

862
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:06,660
So a back to away from the ranch back to the compound back to city walk. Um, this is uh,

863
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:13,220
I I went a little above and beyond this wasn't on the list, but I did want to address something odd

864
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:16,100
That I found about city walks past

865
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,940
Somehow during the saga. There's a thing that completely

866
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,740
Eluded us and i'll explain how I got to it

867
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:28,900
Uh, um, I was uh, I mentioned a thing a long time ago on the show called shangri-la plaza this weird

868
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,580
failed pilot that actually starred alison mac aka

869
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:35,560
pimp mac of the nixxiom organization

870
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,620
uh

871
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:44,340
And uh, there was I don't know it was this weird like kooky pilot about a strip mall. Uh, I I did an interview about it

872
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:49,380
Uh, uh that a listener, uh wrote and for la magazine you can look that up

873
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,540
But I was looking up like who because there's a really distinct like vibe to this

874
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:59,220
Uh to this show in this place and I looked it up and it's a guy who was a production designer of uh,

875
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:05,140
Pee-wee's playhouse. So it's got that vibe and i'm like what else did this guy build because he's got a cool artistic sense

876
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:10,520
And I saw something that he built that i'd never heard of that was at city walk called the panasonic pavilion

877
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:17,940
And i'm going to show you guys a picture of the panasonic pavilion. This place is crazy. Um, check that out

878
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:18,900
Oh

879
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,320
It's a it's like a carnival. It's like a merry-go-round

880
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:22,980
thing

881
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:26,500
Um with a lot of neon and like a big circus

882
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:31,140
Tent i'm still sort of confused about what this thing

883
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:39,780
Is uh, but then the only description i've been able to find about it is that uh, let me find it

884
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:46,200
It is a a it has it's an electro a panasonic electronic showroom featuring an interactive merry-go-round

885
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,740
with robotic animals created by steven spielberg

886
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:56,520
What the hell what was this steven spielberg made a bunch of plastic animals

887
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,560
He handmade them. I mean

888
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,120
I think so. He overs

889
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:09,160
He was really active in all this stuff for a while. Obviously we have not done his restaurant yet. That's on the list

890
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,560
Oh, I can't dive. Yeah, uh

891
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,520
and he obviously, you know universal and

892
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:21,000
I I I don't know. It's it's looks cool. It looks cool as shit. It looked really neat. That's a cool vibe, right?

893
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:25,080
I wish there was more information about it. And if anyone listeners know anything about the very

894
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:33,880
Cool looking but dull named panasonic pavilion, but then I kept going like what else were there other things like this like kind of weird

895
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,920
The world's fairish stuff and this guy the same designer jeremy railton

896
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:44,040
Um also on his website. There was something listed called hollow world

897
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:49,160
hollow world was a restaurant in pasadena in the mid 90s

898
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:55,400
And when you hear hollow worlds, what does that sound like to you? What do you think hollow world is?

899
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:00,360
The hollow earth. Hello. Not that spelling of hollow. No. Oh, okay

900
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,160
I was thinking kevin bacon

901
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,880
Kevin bacon. Not no also again. Not that no

902
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:14,920
It wasn't a themed experience. It wasn't a restaurant themed after the the creepy film hollow man. Is it how michael eiser says? Hello?

903
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,560
hollow

904
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,560
Hello world. Hello

905
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:27,320
No, no, I heard hollow grah holo and I thought hologram was this some kind of hologram

906
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:34,700
Oh restaurant and then I kept looking and no the answer is it is an alien themed restaurant

907
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:39,580
Because it's an it's a restaurant where you learn the story of an alien named hollow

908
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,140
showello

909
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,500
um, it is hollow is a

910
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,260
alien

911
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,380
Who?

912
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,780
Is telling us about he when you go to the restaurant?

913
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:56,700
He narrates the story of our planet back to us how aliens built our pyramids stonehenge

914
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:04,380
He tells us about what area 51 is all about seems like kind of a cousin of blue 32. Wow. Um

915
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:10,700
So this was open in pasadena for like nine months. It was very brief

916
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:12,060
but

917
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,340
huh

918
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:20,320
It's called hollow world yet. It's about aliens and then it also has a laser tag that is about dinosaurs

919
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:25,900
And then also there's a volcano in the front that erupted every 20 seconds

920
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:32,460
Which seems like a lot seems like a lot. Yeah in barbaryttaville vegas that volcano goes off like once an hour

921
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:36,780
20 seconds is a ton of eruptions the lava fees alone

922
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:42,220
Uh, is there a photo of this anywhere? No, I don't think so

923
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:48,060
And again, I implore a listener if you have one or if there is one because I think other ones did open

924
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:51,500
I think they tried to do this in dallas and maybe atlanta

925
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,580
Uh, um, and it didn't work. I'm so confused by it. What's that?

926
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,860
And it did not work

927
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:04,380
And it did not work people did not want to go eat and learn the legend of hollow the alien

928
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,660
Um and play dinosaur laser tag

929
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:14,060
Um, though there was a big kickoff event where all of hollywood's biggest stars came to check it out

930
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,460
nichelle nichols from star trek

931
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:19,680
grizzly adams himself dan haggardy

932
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:25,920
Wow, really and uh the the biggest and brightest star kato kalen

933
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:32,720
They all gathered in pasadena to learn about hollow the alien. Is there a photo of that?

934
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:39,440
No, I looked on getty editorial like to see if there was a movie premiere picture, but there wasn't there's no grizzly adams

935
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,440
And kato kalen picture

936
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,960
You can't see grizzly and kato fighting an alien or fighting a dinosaur with lasers anywhere

937
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,880
Which kills me it kills me inside did not get to see this this feels fake

938
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,960
It's all very strange, but it's corroborated by if you I I

939
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,280
Forgive me for going on this rabbit hole, but I have to I made me feel so crazy

940
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,880
I kept googling and somehow discovered that gary coleman didn't just attend this

941
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:09,120
Opening he was the spokesperson. He was a paid member of the staff of hollow what?

942
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:15,440
Because gary coleman in general is very interested was very interested in

943
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,840
Interest it was very interested in arcades

944
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:26,800
Did you know that in 1993 gary coleman opened the gary coleman game parlor in fisherman's village in marina del rey?

945
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,720
california

946
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:34,580
The shooting location of arrested development. Um, it the motto of the gcgp

947
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:42,100
Was our games are easier so you can play longer it went out of business in 1994

948
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,100
1994 oh

949
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,540
What?

950
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:50,180
Is there a photo of that? No, there's no photographic evidence

951
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,580
What?

952
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:55,460
Why I gotta get off this compound man

953
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,100
This is this is like you're hallucinating all this

954
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,780
It's got whatever you're smoking. I want some of it

955
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:09,300
What kind of doobies are you smoking these days scott

956
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:14,900
Um, it's gary coleman lost 200 000 during this endeavor

957
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:21,140
In the brief year that it was open he was talking it up like it's great

958
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:27,700
Everybody loves it big success coming to my game parlor and not only that I gary coleman am developing a new sitcom

959
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,660
In the sitcom I play an arcade owner

960
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:38,740
The sitcom never aired and there are no photographs of it. Did they shoot a pilot? Do we know don't know that

961
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,740
I can't tell you that you said

962
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,140
the

963
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,900
arcade

964
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,140
Idea is games last longer

965
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:55,380
Um our games are easier so you can play longer. So there's no like super challenging games

966
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:58,180
Isn't point of arcade more quarters?

967
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:01,540
That's right

968
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:06,580
I guess it might be and with harder games. Maybe they would have had 200 000

969
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,820
200 000 more quarters

970
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,060
That might have been the problem with the business model

971
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:20,180
That's like a like pay what you want kind of I think it's kind of sweet that gary thought he could pull this off

972
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,300
Well, he's right those games especially for kids

973
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:26,660
You'd go this is so hard and i'm just spending so much money

974
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,900
so that must have been a thing of concern he had and I

975
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:32,820
I my head is off to him for trying to solve that problem. Yeah. Yeah

976
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:35,460
You tried but he sank

977
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,460
Uh, we'll cover that in the first

978
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,620
The first time we're speechless thinking about easy arcade games. Yeah

979
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:50,580
Wow i'm imagining being there playing and just for hours hours all on one quarter. Yeah, you show up at 10 a.m

980
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:57,300
Gary coleman checks in on you. Hey you need anything? All right. Well, hey, i'm right here. I'm the owner

981
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:00,180
I'm gary. Let me know if you need anything and then 6 p.m

982
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:05,860
Um, this is business manager his business manager comes up and he's like we've made eight quarters today

983
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:12,660
That's all we've made gary. This isn't gonna work. That's fine. We're gonna be here for 20 years at least

984
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,580
It'll pay for itself in 20 years

985
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:25,700
So that's we'll cover that in the fisherman's village, um fiasco fiasco

986
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:33,940
Yeah, great, um, well and we'll cover hollow world of course as well. Um, I yeah my sailor cousin stuck there

987
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,460
In fisherman village

988
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:42,500
So he's like at sea and he can't find a dock. Yeah, he needs a dock

989
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,220
He needs you all to build a dock by discussing everything

990
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:52,040
Has brian screened the lighthouse for you in the compound the will defoe robber paddison

991
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:56,920
No, we only have one copy of um of cars

992
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,720
on uh hd dvd

993
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,920
Oh, yeah that for that that was a pain

994
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:09,960
So you've watched cars at least once a week for six months straight. Mm-hmm. Yeah

995
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:15,640
Do you like doc are you a fan of doc? Yeah doc rules

996
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,680
Mm-hmm. Yeah, uh, how about

01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,780
um lightning mcqueen. Yeah lightning mcqueen rules

998
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,680
How about uh luigi

999
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,880
Yeah, luigi rules

1000
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,080
Where are we going with this line of questioning?

1001
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:41,720
Hold on. I gotta get to the imdb real quick. Oh, no. All right. I'll get someone call off. Hurry. Um, I I mean what have we not

1002
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,440
Talked about. Um, well, I mean we could talk about what I got

1003
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:53,880
Oh, yes, let's absolutely so bubblegum shrimp was open and they were blasting all the cool tunes

1004
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:00,680
And it was a good vibe going on and I said, you know what I don't really want to eat

1005
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,800
At bubblegum, but maybe i'll take some food to go

1006
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,840
Was the filthy shrimp outside?

1007
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,120
The dirt, you know the man

1008
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:15,240
The uh, you're talking about the shrimp mascot that always looks like he rolled in a pile of mud

1009
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,240
Before coming out and waving to people

1010
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:24,040
He he was not out there. I think maybe that's well, honestly that would might be safer for him

1011
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,600
Or her whoever's playing the shrimp

1012
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,360
Um, because you know you can that's a good barrier for

1013
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,400
For air for aerosols

1014
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,880
Um, but no that no shrimp

1015
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,760
Um, so I went up to the menu

1016
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:43,480
They told me okay. Here's here's what I should have done for the good of the show

1017
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:48,280
And I didn't do it and everyone can be mad at me. They told me I could order an alcoholic drink

1018
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:56,120
Right and they have and as maybe you may remember from the city walk saga. I thought I was drinking an alcoholic drink

1019
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,600
I was not as eva anderson said you were drinking an ice cream smoothie

1020
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,920
And two of them and licking the glass

1021
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,280
I licked the glass sugar off the rim in my car

1022
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:13,000
Yes, the rim in my car. I licked sugar off of a rim of a plastic

1023
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:19,160
Bubba gum shrimp glass in scott's car on the way back to my apartment clean on the out team my memories this

1024
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,560
These precious moments

1025
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:28,040
That class clean on the outside cream on the inside ice cream smoothie ice cream smoothie

1026
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,760
And she was like you can order whatever she's like

1027
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:35,240
She can or you can order whatever you want and we'll wrap it up

1028
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,520
But you can't drink it out here. You can't drink it like walking around

1029
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,520
And then I was like, okay if I order a crazy funny thing

1030
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:47,260
Should I go to the top of the parking garage and drink it or am I really going to transport?

1031
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,160
An alcoholic drink in my car on the way back to burbank

1032
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,560
What if it spills?

1033
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:58,520
What if I get arrested so wait just you know, you could take it to go but you couldn't drink

1034
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,160
Yes on the patio upstairs where we were hanging out

1035
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:06,280
No, not there because if you remember how the moon has a policy of no drinking on the actual

1036
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,600
Like sidewalk area they had to surf an alcoholic drink

1037
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:17,480
You had to give your alcoholic drink over to an employee and you would go to their like like mandated patio

1038
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:21,000
That was approved for drinking and then they would surf your drink

1039
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:28,760
Literally two feet across the sidewalk to you and their other area that they said was okay for it

1040
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:33,560
Right. It's not like public. Florida's different. Yeah, it was like public consumption

1041
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,840
Law. Yeah, I I did see other bars

1042
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,040
This is not an uncommon thing right after we did out at the moon

1043
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,280
I did hear about other bars that had to do that

1044
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:48,600
But it's very weird with city walk because this mix of public and private land that like yeah, you gotta jump through all these

1045
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:54,200
You gotta drink the alcohol drink in at your home or in the bubblegum eating pens

1046
01:18:54,200 --> 01:19:01,720
So like I I wanted to force another like snow monster situation where I was trying to like hide and secretly drink

1047
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,720
on the top of a parking garage and then I thought of the scenario like

1048
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:10,840
I'll get arrested at the city walk jail and that would be great for

1049
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,720
Be great for the content of the show

1050
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:17,640
But then i'm going to be in a small place with people like people and I don't want that

1051
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:24,120
So I apologize. The many people they arrested that day. Yes, the many people many city walk felons

1052
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,760
Yes, yeah

1053
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,320
So I apologize to the listener for not

1054
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,960
making something clums like making myself have to do something clumsily or

1055
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:40,200
Put myself in a weird situation. So I ordered instead I ordered the uh,

1056
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,160
a southern charmed fried shrimp

1057
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,880
Sounds like

1058
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,360
Like sorry to interrupt

1059
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,140
But sounds like unfinished business

1060
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,480
Oh no

1061
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,680
Yeah, I guess it is

1062
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:03,560
I guess maybe I should go back and and do it and try to find the funniest silliest slushy drink and actually have alcohol

1063
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,480
in it and then

1064
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:10,520
Drink it in the parking garage somewhere. I guess I should have done that curious george

1065
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:19,000
Yeah, I guess I maybe I should you know what I should do is I should prep for this more I should get like a big

1066
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,760
brown paper bag

1067
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,600
And bring it with me

1068
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,880
You're and put the yeah. Yeah, Jason. Well, you're a tall guy

1069
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:33,240
You could hike at the next to the studio store. They had a big green grass wall blocking you from going by the globe

1070
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:40,840
So you should like hoist yourself up and like kick your little your little feeties like on the wall drink a big drink

1071
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:48,440
You should sit on the wall the big grass wall. Oh, I should sit like humpty dumpty on the wall and drink a slushy drink

1072
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,320
Well, that's a that's kind of advertising what i'm doing. I guess so

1073
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:58,920
I'm trying to be incognito. I don't know. Sometimes it feels good to kick your feeties

1074
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,920
Well, I can't argue with that

1075
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,600
We should have tried to at least without even without an alcoholic drink

1076
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:08,520
We should have tried to sit on top of the green wall, which is something we also have to talk about

1077
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,560
Yeah, but uh to sum up I took the southern

1078
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,560
charmed fried shrimp home and it was fine

1079
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,400
What does charmed mean it was okay. What do you what is southern charmed?

1080
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,300
Uh, it is fries and slaw served with cocktail and tartar sauce

1081
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:31,660
That's what southern charmed it did not taste much different than uh,

1082
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,220
Fried shrimp you'd get from the supermarket

1083
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:39,420
And it and it costs what twenty twenty dollars. Yeah, it was

1084
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:43,980
Thirteen dollars because it was a lunch special. Oh, okay. Okay

1085
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:46,460
so that's if it was I there was

1086
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:51,180
I was thinking about getting a surf and turf for like 45 dollars, but I decided against that

1087
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:58,300
Driving home with a full surf and turf in your car. Yeah, I will I I will hear one strike against bubba gump

1088
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:01,420
Is they don't have the name or logo on any of their to go?

1089
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:07,500
Uh things the bag didn't say bubba gump the container that that got it in didn't say bubba gump

1090
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,020
But I would really like a little of that

1091
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:12,940
Because that would make me feel good having a bubba gump bag in the house

1092
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:16,540
So lindsay probably didn't believe you. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know

1093
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:22,540
There's no way you have bubba gum. She was very skeptical. Uh, she

1094
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:28,540
Tasted it and she was like this isn't bubba gum, but she threw it against the wall. You're a fucking liar. Michael

1095
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,500
Says no southern charm

1096
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:34,620
There's no I can't even detect a spice. I can't even detect

1097
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:40,940
Yeah, no, it's true. It's true. I was the liar that day. Yeah, um, I mean

1098
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:43,020
I was the liar that day. I was the liar that day

1109
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,420

1110
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:36,460
Date night at city walk missing date night. This is where it's at

1111
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:39,580
When you're ready for date night city walk is here for you

1112
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:44,940
So and then like we have enhanced sanitation measures and implemented additional measures for

1113
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:50,060
Distance spacing and screen like everything has to have the scary copy right after

1114
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:54,300
Yeah, uh, yeah every every email has a scary copy

1115
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:58,300
I mean this all started back at the start of july when city walk reopened

1116
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:02,780
Uh city, uh universal hollywood also promoting city walk

1117
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:07,740
Uh city, uh universal hollywood also promoting city walk on their twitter account

1118
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,580
They post some you know

1119
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:16,780
They post funny memes about like pinocchio sleeping and they got some real flack because they posted one of those the day they

1120
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,660
Permanently laid off like hundreds of people

1121
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:27,100
Here's another favorite email get those steps in and enjoy the scenery at the same time

1122
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:32,300
Did you know walking a circuit on city walk from the iconic universal studios hollywood globe fountain?

1123
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:37,100
To the far end of the street and back will net you approximately one thousand steps

1124
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:40,860
Do it five times and you'll be halfway to your ten thousand

1125
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:46,940
Daily required steps ten times and score because you'll have reached your daily goal

1126
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:53,420
Now that email was sent, uh august 21st when we were in the middle of a heat wave

1127
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,100
Temperatures topped 95 degrees that weekend

1128
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:05,020
And two weeks later was the hottest recorded day in la county history at 121 degrees in woodland hills nearby

1129
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:14,220
So get up here get your steps gang bring the whole fam walk a few miles in a heat wave at city walk

1130
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:23,020
Which uh, we could not famously uncovered very little shade city

1131
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,020
Oh

1132
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:30,780
And yeah by about that screen there's there's zero shade yes, there's zero shade and like there was a wall

1133
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:35,500
There's a big green grass wall blocking us from the iconic globe fountain

1134
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,860
Oh, yeah, you can't even get to the globe. Yeah

1135
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:42,300
You can't even gram it with your besties

1136
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:45,980
So jason, are you thinking though while the when the temperature drops though?

1137
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:49,020
Maybe this is the solution to to limbering up your muscles

1138
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:56,860
I mean we might be like becoming mall walkers michael like the the older folks who walk at malls because city walks pretty empty

1139
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:01,260
You know, I think there was as many guests up there as there were security guards

1140
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:06,940
Well, you know like they say, uh ten times and score

1141
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:13,520
Ten times and score you've reached your daily goal. We're all saying it. Everyone is gamifying

1142
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,740
City walk walking at city walk. It's sweeping the city

1143
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:25,260

1156
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:33,220

Just there's also there's also a workbook

1162
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:58,100
Could you could you open to a random page and just read a little bit from it for us sure

01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:02,580
Sure, you want me to call out a number sure. Yeah

521

1166
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,040
521 that's towards the end

1167
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:14,740
That is yeah, you're right. It is towards the end

1168
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,020
He's getting there almost

1169
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:20,580
Rippling through okay

1170
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:26,740
Oh, this is uh, this is towards the beginning uh, or towards the beginning of the finals chapter

1171
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,740
uh chapter 7

1172
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:31,940
Right go ahead

1173
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:33,700
Okay, so

1174
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:40,580
This chapter is entitled. Uh, the power of the individual is stronger than the power of the collective

1175
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:49,540
Okay, okay good, okay got it so um, let's see

1176
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:55,780
When working at cricket wireless remember that your power is stronger than the power of the teams

1177
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:58,420
There is no team

1178
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:01,140
If you're considering

1179
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:04,660
Forming a team

1180
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,740
Remember that the team weakens

1181
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:09,780
What the individual can deliver?

1182
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,100
Everything you need is inside of you

1183
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:17,780
If you ever see anyone trying to form a team say a

1184
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:20,580
To form a team say in a break room

1185
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:26,660
During lunch or even after hours getting drinks be sure to tell brian

1186
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:30,420
Remember there is no power in the collective

1187
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:33,700
Wow, huh?

1188
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:34,420
Oh my god

1189
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:41,220
Well, it also but also we can see the pages that you're reading from and there's a bunch of like smiling suns and colorful squiggles

1190
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:43,940
All over. Yeah, that's sunny. He guides you through it

1191
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,060
Oh some mascot

1192
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:50,580
To conveying all these dark mess. I feel like it's tricking you

1193
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:55,940
Um, I mean, this is a little bit of grim stuff to us that we haven't been onboarded

1194
01:29:56,420 --> 01:30:01,780
Yeah, I feel like maybe he means they mean something else by team. There's might be another word

1195
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:03,860
that he was

1196
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:07,620
Using meant to use there, but that's just kind of a feeling I have I don't know

1197
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,660
I could be wrong. I don't know brian's heart

1198
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:15,380
Yeah, well also you can color in sunny so that's cool

1199
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:21,540
Oh, well, that's cool. He looks cute. Yeah, he's a cute mascot. He's a cute mascot. Would you call him a friend?

1200
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,740
Oh, yeah, absolutely

1201
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:28,980
Do you think you need some friend time? It's been too long since you've hung out with their friends

1202
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:32,500
But when you get ready to roll city walk is ready for you

1203
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:40,500
And that email came friday afternoon short, you know, just a couple days after we had been there. So they had our ticket, you know

1204
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:47,300
This is what we did except that this photo of these girls in these cool hats outside of uh, voodoo donuts aren't

1205
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:53,300
Distancing at all. No, no, man. There's no mask. Yeah, and they don't even have like the mask around

1206
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:58,180
It's not even like they pulled it down to eat the donut. They're just no they don't even exist the man

1207
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:04,660
Yeah, i'm gonna assume that they're in a cluster together for the sake of but even still they should be wearing masks for other

1208
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:06,500
people

1209
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:10,500
Um, but if you're gonna cluster together, why do you need to get out and go to city wall?

1210
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:15,940
You're already having fun at home. Yeah, right if you're having a fun cluster at home why take it to city walk?

1211
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:21,780
It's more it's more howl at the moon is even there. Yeah. Yeah, what's even the point? Um, I

1212
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:25,460
I got there's one of these emails that I want to point out and I

1213
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:30,740
Found it a little odd, but still kind of fun. Um, there's a picture

1214
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:33,220
I think they're trying to do that kind of like instagrammable

1215
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:34,900
snacks

1216
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,420
sort of vibe

1217
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:42,340
So I ended up with with this eats treats photo ops and it's a picture of one of those mini monster things

1218
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:47,940
Whatever you're feeling we've got it grab a bite for dinner satisfy your sweet tooth with dessert

1219
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:51,060
Up for a mini monster boba anyone try it

1220
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:54,820
But if you don't like it do not dare waste it waste is shame

1221
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:59,620
Hide your shame at all costs if you try to throw a mini monster boba away

1222
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:03,860
Everyone will be looking at you hide your shame hide your shame

1223
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:10,420
Good boys don't waste food when you waste food mommy cries rock out with your besties at city walk

1224
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:11,700
Huh?

1225
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:13,300
Kind of crazy

1226
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:19,380
You didn't get that one. I didn't get that one. That's interesting. It's yeah, it's odd. Very very specific

1227
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,500
A little it got fun at the end, but seemed a little

1228
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:28,340
Um, yeah, yeah a little dark in the middle. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that makes sense

1229
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,540
I mean, it's don't want to make mommy mad

1230
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:35,940
I'm I'm I don't want to do that. That's one of the things i'm scared the most about

1231
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:41,460
I think that was in the same email that email the subject line was don't make mommy mad and then

1232
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:48,020
Oh, right. Right. Right intriguing. You want to click on that like when a politician sends you an email with your name in the subject

1233
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:53,540
Right. Wait, something's up. Something might be wrong with mommy. I better click this better click this look

1234
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:59,060
It's national eat outside day. Okay, but that's not as important as keeping mommy happy

1235
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:02,260
Is let me can I ask a question and I don't want to get us off on a whole thing here

1236
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,340
Is city walk mommy?

1237
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:06,180
Oh

1238
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:13,540
Well, it was very comforting during a very dark time and I felt like I was inside of a city walk

1239
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:19,780
Hug right as we know is what families give and get that is right. You're right about that

1240
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:25,380
So yeah, I asked this question and we don't have to even answer it right now, but is city walk mommy?

1241
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:30,500
Hmm just something to ponder I think I'm gonna have a full workbook tonight

1242
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:37,460
You better for else you're not sleeping right that's what you said. Yeah

1243
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:42,980
I'm gonna get that I'm gonna guess that that workbook poses the question is

1244
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,780
It already answers it that brian is daddy

1245
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:50,500
Oh, well, I haven't gotten there yet. Wow scott. Have you been to the compound?

1246
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:56,260
Uh, I haven't and i'm pretty busy. I got the kid. I don't know if i'm willing to come visit the compound

1247
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,100
Okay

1248
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,100
Well jason's coming anyway

1249
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:04,580
Oh, that's right. Jason. Well, especially if we don't wrap this thing up and get his soul free

1250
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:08,180
I mean do we have I mean like city walk his mommy is a wonderful thought but wait

1251
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:13,220
Is there is there any way to anything else we want to say about this experience? What a crazy way

1252
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:16,180
To go back to this place that means so much to us

1253
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:21,860
Yeah, I I I liked being there. It was certainly odd

1254
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:24,820
for a lot of reasons

1255
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:28,260
Uh, I also just it completely take the pandemic out of it

1256
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:33,860
I will say even as much as for hard rock fallen brother and we won't see harper ray anymore

1257
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:35,780
uh

1258
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:40,340
That I am excited by the idea that there's going to be this big gaudy ass

1259
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:48,340
Uh toothsome chalk like there is city walk is changing and I think I I was kind of getting excited for the possibilities of how

1260
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:54,500
Uh tacky it's going to look in a couple years like it's going to take tacky is going to be

1261
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:58,180
Taken up a couple notches. I think with that toothsome

1262
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,900
There and I think at that point

1263
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:03,460
As I was saying universal maybe gets rid of more

1264
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,060
uh

1265
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:10,740
Non-universal owned things. I am excited at the future a non-pandemic future

1266
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:13,460
with maybe a uh, uh

1267
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:17,460
Attackier city walk to come like it seems like it might have been in the past

1268
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:22,260
I have high hopes for I have high hopes for the tackiness of mommy

1269
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:25,220
Tacky is backy

1270
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:28,900
That's a great way to put it yeah, yeah

1271
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:35,940
So it's really the main thing like stringing you through this era like the hope of getting to be done with this and go visit

1272
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:39,300
the the toothsome jock and latte and

1273
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:44,180
Yeah, um, oh wait, this is bad news. Oh, no, I just clicked on

1274
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:50,100
CNN and it seemed I guess trump's probable supreme court pick has spoken

1275
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,900
At length in the past

1276
01:35:52,900 --> 01:36:00,680
I guess trump's probable supreme court pick has spoken at length in the past against chocolate emporiums

1277
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:03,460
They might all be shut down

1278
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,340
once she is installed so

1279
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:10,260
chocolate emporium out vatican 2 out

1280
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:16,100
There's a chance by the way, there's a chance that is that you're not making a joke and that is real

1281
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:20,200
I it seems like the kind of thing right as we find a future episode

1282
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:26,940
Chocolate's illegal what as a future? Yeah future episode. We did a little run of of that. Yeah, it seems possible

1283
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:29,900
Chocolate is illegal in america

1284
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:36,140
Says it in the bible somewhere uh, sector keeper in the manifesto. Is there anything about chocolate?

1285
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:39,020
Hmm, let me look in the index

1286
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:42,460
And take your time, please

1287
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:50,380

1289
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:04,860
Coffee no no chalk. There's nothing about chocolate. Oh, that's too bad

1290
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:11,180
That's a bummer brian imagines a world with no chocolate. Uh, it's full of cars. Um, well

1291
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:14,620
Hey, what a blast to go up there. I guess

1292
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,780

1298
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:44,620

1312
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,360
Little one

1313
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:56,220
Oh my gosh, he's singing a song a song a song that he made up for a

1314
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,940
Yeah, is that a made up song? I think it's made up

1315
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:00,940
little

1316
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,700
Good good and remember

1317
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,820
City walk was there for you when times were hard

1318
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:28,460
So it only makes sense that we go back when we can go back safely and do it all over again

1319
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,940
And it's not behind a paywall. We'll see you guys soon

1320
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:39,260
Wait, what do you wait? What do you mean? You mean like the original saga again?

1321
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:42,960
Hey, anything's possible. It's gonna be 2021

1322
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:46,220
And everything's gonna be fine

1323
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:52,060
Fine, okay. Yeah, let's just so let's not have too many more

1324
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:56,460
Refrains of that song or else. They'll say the children psychos are gonna be on us

1325
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:04,060
Yeah, we're gonna get accused of some stuff yeah, we're gonna get we're gonna get cuties we're gonna get oh no

1326
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:09,980
Cuties. Um, okay. Well, I guess we have our marching orders which is what to do the

1327
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:13,100
City walk saga again. Maybe he'll forget. I don't know

1328
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:15,580
Well, we're gonna have to be next year doesn't have to be

1329
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:19,820
But if tacky's back you we gotta check it out, right?

1330
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:27,020
Well, I guess he's got a fair point heck I might go up next week. I mean I could work outside that empty area, you know

1331
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:32,300
You won't run into a soul. It is a socially distanced place. So I recommend it to

1332
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:40,140
Listeners just don't go all at once don't go put on cool hats and share donuts with people. You don't live with

1333
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:48,460
um, and don't get any alcoholic beverages and try to brown bag them on top of a roof or you will be arrested you will be

1334
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,460
arrested, yeah, yeah

1335
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:56,860
So I guess wow, it's nice to say it again you survived the city walk saga

1336
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,180
sector 20

1337
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:02,700
Uh the end question mark who knows?

1338
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:07,020
This this thing could go and go forever if it can surprise us

1339
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:13,260
In the middle of a universal cruise line episode then it could come back really at any time during any episode

1340
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:17,040
Especially here on the second gate. So please stay subscribed

1341
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:22,460
Um, and so we'll do when you want to get to cruise line some other time then

1342
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:30,140
Yeah, we'll just table it for now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll finish it out. Um, okay. Well fun stuff

1343
