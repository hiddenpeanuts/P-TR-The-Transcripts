00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Hi there, before you listen to this second gate about Sphere and Mike's visits to U2 at Sphere,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,760
this was recorded a little while ago and a number of things have happened in the Sphere world that

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:19,440
aren't acknowledged within the episode. For example, that the Sphere posted a nearly 100 million

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,880
dollar loss for the quarter, that the CFO quit due to James Dolan's yelling and screaming.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,480
I just saw in the New York Post that he delivered his notice in the middle of a meeting with a

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:40,800
bunch of executives. He just went in and said, I quit. And the fact that the city of London rejected

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,960
having a second Sphere built there because, quote, it would be bulky, unduly dominant and incongruous.

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,760
So all of those are things and like some things that I wanted to get ahead of because you'll

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,480
hear in the body of the episode that I'm a little bit ceding to the success of Sphere and maybe even

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,360
hovering around eating a little crow thinking that Sphere was not going to be good or work out.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,040
Yeah, but all of these things kind of leave it in a different light. But Mike, as a Sphere head,

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,720
any response to any of this recent news? Well, the loss happened before the U2 shows. So first of all,

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,960
that wasn't even operating. So yeah, they lost a few dollars, a few cents, but I just think, you

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,640
know, yeah, you're going to have to break some eggs if you want to make an omelet, you know?

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,320
Are we sure that is true that those numbers don't reflect the period in which the U2 shows have been

16
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,360
happening? I believe so because the quarter because of what U2 started in October, end of September.

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,920
So it would have to have been, yeah, before that. I saw a Sphere thing just this morning

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,960
as we're recording this. The Twitter account, Las Vegas locally, which posts a lot of Las Vegas

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:02,080
events and news and stuff, said some F1 drivers complained about how bright the Sphere was on race

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:11,120
night, according to reports, because this is Vegas's other successful question marks debacle

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,240
question mark. It appears the high limit rooms at some of the casinos did very well for the F1

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:26,320
attendees. But yeah, if you watch footage, you can see the F1 cars going directly by the Sphere,

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,640
which occasionally had a Vegas graphic and sometimes just had a smiley face whose eyes

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,320
would follow the cars. Yes. I messaged all the F1 drivers, get used to it. That was like a fucking

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,960
Mario Kart track. And I was like, maybe I should like F1 now. This looks fun. Some nonsense face,

26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,040
giant face. It's like you're on Moomoo Farms. You did your Fast Vegas driving. You could handle a

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,960
Sphere in the periphery, no problem. I was eating White Castle driving in a rent-a-car, or no,

28
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,000
my own car. Sorry, I rented a car in Orlando. I can't remember anything. I was driving my own

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
car in Las Vegas, eating White Castle, driving by the Sphere and I didn't have a problem.

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,880
So you're saying if you didn't have a problem going a normal amount of speed for a car to go,

31
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,600
why should they have a problem going 10 times that? Well, I'm just saying that me eating White

32
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,400
Castle while I drive at a normal speed is about the same physical challenge that driving 10 times

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,800
of speed is for them. I'm saying they aren't eating White Castle, so that balances things out.

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,960
Okay, didn't want us to distract from the episode. Everybody, please enjoy hearing about Mike's

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,000
visit to Sphere.

36
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:56,800
You know what, I hit record. Universal's Mardi Gras too is also very popular.

37
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Podcast arrived, the second gate is here. Do we need to re-explain what was just said?

38
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm going to explain. Yeah, yeah. We're gearing up here to talk some music, but I just threw out

39
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,720
the idea that I wanted to do a second gate on Sugar Ray's set list when they play Epcot Center

40
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,480
at the Eat to the Beat series. Jason, of course, said, well, they're regulars there. They're always

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,960
there. And I said, what? What do you mean? How do they get them? Yeah, Scott was. This must be the

42
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,920
biggest deal the Disney company has to do every year. We've not locked in. Gentlemen, I hope

43
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,280
you're pleased with yourselves. Sugar Ray has not been sealed for the year. Well, this is a big,

44
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,840
this is why they had to get Che back out because he was fumbling the ball on booking Sugar Ray

45
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,760
for each performer. You say whatever you want to Scarlett Johansson, but when you cross McGrath,

46
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,440
that is a path from which this company cannot walk bath.

47
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,760
So I'm just going to say this here so we don't actually have to do it a full episode on it.

48
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,120
We're going to talk the sphere. I went to the sphere and I won't even bury the lead. I love

49
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,720
the sphere. I love it. Yeah. It surpassed my expectations, but real quick, this is what

50
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
Sugar Ray does when they're at Epcot Center. They play every morning. They play someday when it's

51
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,760
over. These are their songs, but then they play How Bizarre by OMC. They play Steal My Sunshine by

52
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,840
Len. They play I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys. It's just a late nineties potpourri.

53
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,240
Yeah. Whatever. And then they play Fly and then they play What I Got, I think by Sublime.

54
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:29,440
So Sugar Ray is so finale. That was it. What I got. They close the end of the show is what I got.

55
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes. Not their song. They have other singles too. This is reflected in the list. Yeah. This is such

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,040
an insecure set list on Sugar Ray's part, I feel. Well, this is the kind of muddying of the...

57
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,840
They're just leaning into like, sure, lots of different bands did all these different songs

58
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,720
in the nineties, but where are they? They're not at E to the Beat. Where's OMC? It's ours now. We

59
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,760
buy that. We're a conglomerate now. I think they're doing it. I think even Mark McGrath said some of

60
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:08,640
these songs people think we did. So now they're just playing on how Weezer was identified as

61
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,200
being the artist that did Teenage Dirtbag on a lot of Napster files. Oh, yes. Remember this?

62
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,520
Now they do it forever. Well, they've done it here and there or whatever. But I think Mark

63
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
McGrath is doing the same thing where people go, how bizarre? Was that Sugar Ray? Wow. And he goes,

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,400
yeah, so we'll just do it. We're doing it. You know, a lot of people think we did I Feel Like

65
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,000
Chicken tonight. Remember that? Does that take you back? Hey, if you were a nineties kid,

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,360
you might remember this one. I feel like chicken tonight. So he's really sorry. He's changing.

67
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,640
He's changing people's minds in real. Like he's actually now reinforcing the incorrect information

68
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,920
to people at Epcot Center because people they won't remember him saying we didn't do this song,

69
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,240
but we're doing it anyway. They'll just go, oh yeah, how bizarre Sugar Ray. So now he is

70
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,360
claiming songs. He truly he is the new Mike Love. He is absolutely. Yeah. I think maybe Mike gave

71
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:05,520
him these tips. I was looking at so Universal Orlando's Mardi Gras celebration, which runs

72
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,000
a few weeks. They've had a concert series last few years and they sure have some big names.

73
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,320
And 2022 it started off. Oh, it started off with Sugar Ray. Did it really? Yeah. February 5th.

74
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,560
But then the next week was Diana Ross. Wow. Really? Yeah. And then Bare Naked Lady Sticks.

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,200
Wow. I feel like that's I mean, they get some pretty big acts. Jason Derulo was the last one.

76
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,560
You said that statement right after Sticks. That is what provoked. Wow. They get some big acts.

77
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,680
They get some hits. The rarely seen Sticks. Hello Cool J. Marshmello. Really? Yeah. This is a mix.

78
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,360
There is some some mild relevancy I'd say to the list. Yes. Yeah. Wow. So okay. I've said that I

79
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,560
need to get that out of my head about Sugar Ray set list. And that's really all I have to say.

80
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,040
I just think that's funny. Well, this is why U2 needs to remain on their grind innovating in the

81
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,440
news because otherwise Sugar Ray starts scooping up. Hey, remember this one? Beautiful day.

82
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,880
Yeah. And people think how Sugar Ray did that one. They're like memory holeing,

83
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,600
incorrect memory holeing to people. And yeah, I guess here's one you might remember.

84
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,880
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun. Wow, they did the NBA on NBC.

85
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,320
That's like they play. Here's one you might remember. Dun dun dun dun.

86
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,400
Oh, you know what? Huh? I thought that was older. But I guess. Wow. I guess that's you might be a

87
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,000
90s kid if you remember this. Dun dun dun dun. You remember? Dun dun dun dun. Sure that's right.

88
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,640
This one. Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun. Whoa, they did the Windows 95 startup sound.

89
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,400
I guess I am a 90s kid who remembers that. Brian Eno smashing a glass bottle. Like, absolutely not.

90
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,440
Maybe Beethoven will take that shit, but not Eno. I like this strategy from Mark McGrath and

91
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,600
Sugar Ray. It's very smart. It's undeniably very. Maybe they'll play this fear one day.

92
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,400
I don't know. It might be a few bands before. They might have to get a lot together maybe to

93
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,840
fill it up. But yeah, they're significantly bigger than the Eat to the Beat America Gardens.

94
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,000
But they do do multiple shows a day, I'd imagine. Yes. There's usually like three sets, I think.

95
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,720
Like three short sets for the bands. Short, you say? They want to keep those short? Seven-ish songs.

96
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,440
Sugar Ray doesn't need to, they don't need to stretch them out to 25, 26 songs? No, I mean,

97
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,960
maybe Universal. I don't know how they do it over there at that series, that concert series.

98
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Not to check the Mardi Gras policy. We will check that set list of Sugar Rays and then we'll maybe

99
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,920
do another episode. What is the show? So if, and we're talking about U2's Octon Baby, you know,

100
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,760
revival and full album tribute. But what would be the Sugar Ray if they were going to do a full album?

101
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,840
That's a very good question. I guess it would be, is it, I'm trying to think. It's not 1459,

102
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,000
that's the Strokes album. It's whatever album has Every Morning on it. That's what you think.

103
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,040
Remember this one? Last night! That album is called... Here's a little song you might remember.

104
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,360
Wow, they did the Clarissa Explains It All song. No, it is 1459. Well, what's the Strokes album

105
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,240
called then? The second one? Yeah. I forget. There's a song I thought called 1459.

106
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,760
Anyway, oh, Room on Fire is the name of the album. 1459 I think is the name of the song.

107
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,440
Anyway, now people are going to be mad at me about Strokes. We're not talking about Strokes.

108
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,560
Talking about U2. Strokes are much too cool and good to be talked about on this podcast.

109
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,880
That's correct. Some people, I will say people do, I think, think that my taste is all like

110
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,520
nostalgia 90s. I think I have given people this impression, and it's not actually true,

111
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,280
that it's not fully that. I'm just saying. We believe you, we know you've talked about

112
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,480
Olivia Rodrigo. Wait, and now have you finished the full album? I have not finished the full

113
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,440
Olivia Rodrigo album. It's so funny that you have continued, despite it being talked about.

114
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,400
Strangers have posted about this, tweeted at you. You finished Harry's House though.

115
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,280
Yes, of course I finished Harry's House. Okay. I have.

116
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,920
You're bringing up finishing an album like it's the.

117
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,120
I was listening to a new album by a guy I never heard of, Troy Savan. That's really good.

118
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,400
But then I was also listening to Hackney Diamonds recently as well.

119
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,160
No, we're going backwards now, Mike. That's a step backwards.

120
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,320
Okay, so The Sphere. If you're listening to this podcast, you probably know that we've done some

121
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,520
Sphere talk here and there, especially in Las Vegas and our series.

122
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,320
This is a little bit of a Sin City Nights postscript, I would say, because The Sphere was

123
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,000
certainly on our minds. I was going to say on everyone's minds, but maybe not. It was

124
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,240
definitely on our minds and we talked about it. And in our live show, The Groove Blender,

125
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,400
there was a lot of talk of The Sphere. Its founder, James Dolan, the mad genius who.

126
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,760
The master. The brilliant,

127
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,640
the cracked out master who he was talked about, but we curtailed some of the talking about him

128
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,440
because he is someone who uses facial recognition software to keep people out of his venues.

129
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,200
And Mike did not want anything resembling that so that he could go anywhere.

130
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,000
Which is present at The Sphere. I believe there are caution signs that you are.

131
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,440
I sent you a picture of it.

132
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,640
Yes, that I've seen it from a few different angles at this point that like you are consenting.

133
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,120
Universal Orlando, I believe, testing out facial recognition for Ticket

134
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,480
to get rid of the dirty fingerprint scanners.

135
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,960
Facial recognition notice. Welcome to Sphere. We use facial recognition technology to improve

136
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,520
your experience at Sphere. We shouldn't say The Sphere. We should say Sphere.

137
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,080
Sphere. MSG Sphere. You see it sometimes. Madison Square Garden.

138
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,360
To help ensure the safety and security of our venue and our guests.

139
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,440
And to enforce our venue policies. To learn more, please visit

Sphere Entertainment Co. Dot com slash privacy.

141
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
And I'm assuming there's some like really scary shit if you look into the fine print there.

142
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,160
We're hoping to help you have a good time tonight. And if you are an attorney who is

143
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,640
currently suing James Dolan, you might have a better time tonight back at home.

144
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,960
Or I don't know, maybe sit in a hole somewhere.

145
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,080
In the Sphere jail.

146
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,760
You might have a better time if we if there was suddenly a light and then you didn't exist anymore.

147
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,440
It also probably says they're going to sell like sell your face to Disney to be in the

148
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,880
background of a scene of one of their TV shows or movies.

149
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,080
Yeah, this is a giant AI scan dome.

150
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,040
I think that's probably right.

151
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,600
It's the real yeah. It's in the fine print.

152
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,480
So yes, I was worried. I was not seriously worried, but there was a half of worry in my head

153
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,160
of like, I think if our podcast was like as popular as like Doughboys, it would have gotten to Dolan.

154
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,760
You think Doughboys level will be a nut. Hey, there's this podcast out there.

155
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,920
He seems talking about you know, I do.

156
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,080
Yes. Yeah. I mean, look, I'm giving him, of course, that definitely that.

157
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,200
Probably not. But but if our podcast is really big, we would have been invited there.

158
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
Well, that's true.

159
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,400
VIP if we were smartless, the whole smartless crew is probably up there in the VIP box.

160
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,480
That's part of the show. And of course, as usual, I've joined a lot of Facebook groups

161
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,200
specifically for a thing I'm going to do or did.

162
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,960
And they are pointing out the celebs every night in that box area.

163
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,960
And yes, very early. Maybe night one was this whole smartless group.

164
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,120
That was a guess. Was that actually true?

165
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,560
Yeah, it was true. My god.

166
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,400
There were pictures of Bateman on the floor, but then moved from the box to the floor.

167
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,000
You've got your.

168
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,320
They should. I mean, they've got so many podcasts to do.

169
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,680
I don't know how they're finding the time.

170
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,240
I know.

171
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,080
But shouldn't Bateman be editing right now?

172
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,280
He should.

173
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,080
If he weren't cutting out the ums and likes.

174
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,280
Does he work the zoom like I do on this podcast? I don't know.

175
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
We can only assume he was there.

176
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,360
I mean, the first night it was McCartney.

177
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,720
It was Jimmy Buffett family there, of course, because of, you know, the plane story.

178
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,280
We all know it.

179
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,960
Snoop Dogg.

180
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,680
Snoop, I think.

181
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
Uh, Elizabeth Banks.

182
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,080
Yeah. Every who's Mario Lopez.

183
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,840
And it continues to be Clooney and Gerber were there a couple of weeks later.

184
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,840
They rode the motorcycles from the agave fields.

185
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,760
Kylie Minogue was there and Bono put Bono saying can't get you out of my head.

186
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,640
A little snippet of it.

187
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,720
Oh, he references who was ever there.

188
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,840
If they're famous enough and if they have a hit song.

189
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,240
That's the most interested I've been to hear.

190
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,680
I mean, shout out.

191
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,180
Yeah.

192
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,160
So it's it's funny because it really felt like this weird thing we were talking about.

193
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,960
And then if like the first night and there was all these articles about it.

194
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,480
And then, of course, every famous person was there.

195
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,240
And I was like, oh, yeah, of course, of course.

196
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,560
Yeah.

197
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,640
And almost like an obscure thing, which is an insanely stupid thing to say about

198
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,160
you two doing a residency.

199
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
You two and a massive thing in Las Vegas.

200
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,280
But there was a while, I would say, where it still felt like what is that weird structure?

201
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,760
Yeah.

202
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,800
In Las Vegas.

203
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,040
And then even I think even the videos of the weird outside projections are going a little viral.

204
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,000
But I still think people not everybody knew what it was.

205
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,080
Oh, it's a concert venue and this multimedia venue that will be showing these films and such.

206
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,800
I think it was kind of a slow rollout.

207
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,680
And here's what I have felt.

208
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,640
I'm going to eat not a full I'm not going to eat crow.

209
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:28,880
Sure.

210
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm going to I'm just going to nibble on a wing, maybe.

211
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,280
Unlike the sphere, which is eaten numerous crows.

212
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,800
It's got a taste.

213
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,480
Yeah, they fly right into it.

214
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,880
Yeah.

215
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,040
You don't want to be a crow who flies into that thing.

216
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,200
You get you get zapped by LED lights.

217
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,700
Yeah.

218
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
It's like the Luxor beam.

219
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,280
It's like an ecosystem, but it will kill a crow.

220
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,640
As soon as it touches.

221
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,700
Yeah.

222
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,040
A thousand crows per year.

223
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,080
No, here's what I'll say, because I've made jokes about like that this thing is doomed to fail or

224
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,560
the economics of it being being where I or that, you know, this thing's only in the last couple months.

225
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,920
Clearly not the case.

226
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,640
There was clearly like a big tip of the scales from night one on the videos of this are massive.

227
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
There's so many articles about it.

228
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,200
Everybody's talking about it with, you know, major people posting the big

229
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,560
moments of it, which you were avoiding for a little bit and I've been a spoiler.

230
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,200
But it became unavoidable, right?

231
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,480
Some of those things.

232
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,240
So clearly this thing is huge.

233
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,840
This specifically this YouTube show is making a big impact and I will just

234
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,560
see to that.

235
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,920
That's definitely true.

236
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,360
Does this mean I've fully lost my fear skepticism, my skepticism?

237
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,680
Yeah.

238
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,400
Maybe not.

239
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,880
I still have some questions and some thoughts, but I think that we're not in the ballpark of

240
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,520
this was this crazy dream that didn't work on any.

241
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,080
Yeah.

242
00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:00,000
Well, you are right to be skeptical because the prices we've heard thrown around are very funny.

243
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
Vegas prices in general.

244
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,480
Yeah, but parking I've heard anywhere from $47 to $100.

245
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
Do not park at the sphere.

246
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,320
Do not park by the sphere.

247
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,360
That is madness.

248
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,880
There's no reason to do that.

249
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,000
I think most places on this trip have given up the free parking.

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,320
Yes.

251
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,160
There's one or two holding out, but like, you know, you're paying for parking if you're

252
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,440
driving down there.

253
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
You should do.

254
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,520
We were at the Park MGM.

255
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,680
What we should have done is gone across the MGM Grand taking the Monterey all the way down

256
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,000
by the link and then just walked because it's from like that link stretch by the

257
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,680
Ferris wheel and stuff.

258
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,080
It's like 15 minute walk or something.

259
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,400
Okay.

260
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,800
From there.

261
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,200
That's the way to do it.

262
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,600
Sure.

263
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,240
Sure.

264
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,800
I mean, yes, $100 for parking is a mind fuck.

265
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,600
That's crazy.

266
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,840
Yeah, it's not 125 valet.

267
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,320
But it's...

268
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,120
There's not much there either.

269
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,160
There's not much parking there.

270
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
They don't have enough spaces.

271
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,720
Maybe they're trying to limit it in a way.

272
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,440
I mean, but why?

273
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,080
Yeah, you got to assume not a lot of people are parking there.

274
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,480
Yeah.

275
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,120
But forget about you too, even the movie tickets for the original 50 minute long,

276
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:15,280
Darren Aronofsky film, which I keep comparing to, you know, in the early 90s when your city's

277
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,920
local museum installed an IMAX and you would go and go like, wow, it feels like we're in the ocean

278
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,320
or we're like in the jungle or the desert.

279
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,600
And that costs $20 add on.

280
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,160
This is like 50 plus.

281
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,200
50 minimum.

282
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,680
Minimum.

283
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:41,440
There's a way if you wanted to for like the perfectly attuned seats, you could for this

284
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,080
50 minute movie pay $249.

285
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,240
And I don't know where other fees get you on that, your ticket master stuff.

286
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,880
So you said that, you texted that stuff.

287
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,920
And I don't think I even watched a review of somebody who was mind blown by the movie who

288
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,200
said, there's no way on earth you should spend $249 on this movie.

289
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,040
But you texted some of those price things.

290
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,120
Mike, right away, your response.

291
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,840
Well, I was, yeah, I said, well, it's very big.

292
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,120
It's bigger than those IMAX.

293
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,000
We'll give you that.

294
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,960
It is much bigger.

295
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,600
It's a lot bigger.

296
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,360
18K movie.

297
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,880
Resolution is much better than that 90s stuff is going to be.

298
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,240
It is giant.

299
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,160
No, it's a little, there's more angle.

300
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,960
People have said it's like having like an Oculus headset on, but like that amount of coverage

301
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,720
is just in front of you.

302
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,960
I saw a video saying you don't need to wear goggles anymore.

303
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,800
I was like, well, that's a different thing.

304
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,560
I don't think you can, look, you can't have goggles in your home.

305
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,520
You can't just regularly go to a massive sphere in Las Vegas.

306
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,080
Not yet.

307
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,880
Not yet.

308
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,000
Jim gets his way.

309
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,880
If they, yeah, yeah.

310
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,840
If there's a sphere in every town.

311
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,340
That's right.

312
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,320
But yeah, I don't know.

313
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,640
I see all sides of it.

314
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,360
You didn't see the movie.

315
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,120
Yeah, we are going to talk about the YouTube show.

316
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,800
I could see spending 50 to 75 for a Vegas ticket, which you always is marked up

317
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,320
generally 25%.

318
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,240
50% more than a normal show.

319
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,200
I don't think 250 seems right.

320
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,040
Well, and at the sphere, there's screens outside, the screens inside.

321
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,360
Further down the strip, there's different kinds of screens, blackout screens.

322
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,080
So you cannot watch that Formula One Grand Prix.

323
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,520
Do you know about this?

324
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,080
What are you talking about?

325
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,720
What are you talking about?

326
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,640
There's, the strip is like a construction site for the grandstands.

327
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:40,320
But on those foot bridges that go over Las Vegas Boulevard, they're blacking out the windows.

328
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,080
They're blacking out on the sidewalks so you can't just watch for free.

329
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,680
You have to pay for a package in the grandstand or restaurants that have strip view.

330
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
You have to pay like a package there.

331
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,760
That's funny.

332
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,200
They've already thought of everything.

333
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,560
They have thought of everything.

334
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:06,320
They've already started slashing prices because they are not getting the desired guests they want.

335
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,840
I bet that if you wait a couple months, that Aronofsky movie,

336
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,920
they'll start slashing some ticket prices.

337
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,400
Yeah, you might be able to hit up the TKTS booth.

338
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,640
Unless it's going to be just a smash hit, like people have to go see it.

339
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,440
We've been going for a little while on this thing, you know, a couple weeks enough to,

340
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,160
U2 is going pretty viral.

341
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,840
I don't know if the Aronofsky, because I do agree that like in terms of what they've shown us so far,

342
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,400
I'm sure it's very impressive to be there in person.

343
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,000
But the shots are like, we're moving really fast over a big snowy landscape.

344
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
And you hear the audience gasp at that.

345
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,640
But don't the three of us, maybe people listening, aren't you all like, yeah, so Soren?

346
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,600
So Soren, yeah.

347
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,000
So Soren.

348
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,720
Yeah, it's bigger Soren.

349
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,880
Yeah, I'm sure it's very cool.

350
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,680
But nothing, I haven't seen anything from that.

351
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,800
All right, there's a big elephant.

352
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,040
I think there's a big praying mantis.

353
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,640
Nothing has made me go, that sounds like I must get down there specifically for this.

354
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,880
I wouldn't mind seeing it, but I was not, I didn't carve out the day before or after U2 to see it.

355
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,360
Because it doesn't seem like there's a couple things in the U2 show that are like, whoa,

356
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,400
I got to, you got to see that if you're standing under it.

357
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
That gives you your sphere jolt.

358
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,800
You don't necessarily, you know, the entire, the separate.

359
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,880
I mean, I like the idea that, here's what I like.

360
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,480
I like that this thing is opening.

361
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,120
This is supposed to have this, it's this blockbuster venue.

362
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,800
And I like that it is U2 gigantic band and Darren Aronofsky filmmaker.

363
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,960
I do like that we are like, and that a director and a tour is being

364
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
positioned as like one of the names opening this thing.

365
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,640
And I like the idea that somebody could crack this.

366
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,120
I just, I don't think it's postcards from earth.

367
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,600
From what I've heard is going to be it.

368
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,600
But I feel like there's going to be, there might be something that is the, you know,

369
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,880
like what really in some, maybe more of an annul and way kind of like mobilizes.

370
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,280
This is so mind blowing.

371
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,400
You have to go.

372
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,160
They should, they should give it to like a man, some imagineer type.

373
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
That's what I was going to say.

374
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,560
Cause I do think Darren Aronofsky has made interesting movies.

375
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,600
Maybe they're not all my favorite, but they've usually been smaller.

376
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,040
Personal like scale.

377
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,680
I guess the fountain had some big moments.

378
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,840
You've long said only the whale is your favorite.

379
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,280
Oh yeah, I'm a big whale guy.

380
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:38,880
That just seemed to, no, I just traumatized at 16 years old watching Requiem for a Dream and Pi.

381
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
Just show Requiem on the sphere.

382
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,140
Yeah.

383
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,080
Kids gotta learn someday.

384
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,960
Gotta help convert black swan.

385
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:54,560
There's got to be somebody who can make a weirdo movie that fucks with you a little bit.

386
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,000
And I don't think there was ever going to be that the first one is like a true story,

387
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,880
but I feel like maybe like the right narrative project might really grab this thing and be

388
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,600
ultimate with it.

389
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,320
I was trying to think, cause there has to be, like this is maybe because I was watching

390
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,840
Bono talk about it and he said that maybe rock and roll isn't the best even music to have in here

391
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,680
versus like an orchestra or something.

392
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,440
I was like, they could do like a, they do these like video game, like orchestral arrangement shows,

393
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,720
which I've never seen, but seem cool.

394
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,840
And I like to listen to like mixes of that stuff, but like you put like an orchestra

395
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,400
playing every Nintendo song and then make a crazy big Nintendo show with all the characters

396
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,760
and the games for 40 years.

397
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,800
That takes you to the world and stuff you can only see there.

398
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,480
That would be sellout for 10 years, I think, if it was cool enough.

399
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,760
That's a good idea.

400
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,080
Like in that zone, something because like, especially like orchestra, like that's not

401
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,680
a band that has to be there forever.

402
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,840
You can obviously swap people in and out.

403
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,480
Exactly.

404
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,600
So it's like shows like that that could run more in like a Cirque way that you could plug

405
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,880
in between a big rock band playing it.

406
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,120
You want what should be in there then I guess is what Lydia Tarr is conducting at the end

407
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,480
of the movie.

408
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:16,960
Spoiler.

409
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,080
You could even do a more like arty thing with just like artists making little weird

410
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,480
like films or pieces to play during songs and stuff and have it be live, have the music be live.

411
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
I'm very curious.

412
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,240
What else?

413
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,240
I mean, we could, maybe that's a post.

414
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,440
That's an end conversation.

415
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,240
Yeah, probably.

416
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,880
But the sound is amazing, really.

417
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,680
And the screen, the outside screen is not the resolution of the inside screen.

418
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,180
No.

419
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,400
So if you've seen all the outside, like the meme smiley face and Venom just appeared on

420
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,680
the sphere, which is very exciting.

421
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,400
Venom and Spider-Man because there's a new game out.

422
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,900
Right.

423
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,160
Which is very fun to see Venom, I think.

424
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,040
I'm glad that that he's.

425
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,200
The star of some of the worst films ever made is here on the sphere.

426
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,760
That's right.

427
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,120
And so, but the whole first of all, there are funny things about this sphere.

428
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,920
Don't worry.

429
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,960
There are funny things.

430
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,640
I think they cut some corners here and there in lobbyish area.

431
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,480
Well, you're going to have to tell me like I'm happy to go along with your plan for this,

432
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,960
but you got to tell me where to insert aura.

433
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,760
You tell me when is a good time to talk.

434
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
Oh, I'll get them soon.

435
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,440
Soon.

436
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,940
Very soon.

437
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,060
So it is this.

438
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,580
You sent us a bunch of pictures from it when you were there.

439
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,140
Yes.

440
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:39,620
And I was maybe I'm reading too much into this.

441
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,500
So forgive me if it didn't strike you as odd.

442
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
It is a Pepsi venue.

443
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,700
What do you mean?

444
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,140
Oh, they have Pepsi in the.

445
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,780
Refreshments.

446
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,980
They're Pepsi not Coke.

447
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,260
I did not even notice that.

448
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,620
That's a little weird, right?

449
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,380
Well, it's rare.

450
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,420
It's more rare.

451
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,020
Most places have Coke products.

452
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,060
I like the mom and pop pizzerias where I grew up.

453
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,340
They might have Pepsi.

454
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:04,740
Sure.

455
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,740
Does Madison Square Garden have Pepsi?

456
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,860
That's a good question.

457
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,260
I don't know.

458
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,860
I mean, we got to look into that, I think.

459
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,980
Is it a bad thing?

460
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,780
What are you saying?

461
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,700
I'm saying I think it's usually the cheaper option.

462
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,780
Oh, that's it.

463
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,420
Oh, maybe.

464
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,060
Yeah, maybe.

465
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,700
I actually did not know.

466
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,500
I like that you made you clocked what you thought was the weirdest thing.

467
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,140
Didn't mention it on the chain and have been saving it up.

468
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,580
I've been thinking about it.

469
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,700
I'm going to save up this year.

470
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,660
Well, the other thing you sent the concession list and we were not able to figure out one

471
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,900
of the items just said flips and that is with an S, not a Z.

472
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,900
It's not the chocolate covered pretzels.

473
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,220
Right.

474
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,180
Unless it is.

475
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,540
Unless that is what it is.

476
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:48,340
But they put it without a Z because we're just staring at the word flips as if to say,

477
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,020
you know, flips and I know I don't know flips.

478
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,060
What's a flip?

479
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,300
Yeah.

480
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,500
You can't just tell me that and not explain with any other words what it is.

481
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,660
If it's flips with a Z and it's a misspelling, the flips people, I would be furious.

482
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,620
I would flip out.

483
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,580
I would flip out.

484
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,620
Flips out.

485
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,340
Dolan versus the flips people in court.

486
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,020
I corrected them.

487
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,300
It was a misspelling.

488
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,860
They've been spelling it wrong for years and I corrected it for them.

489
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,620
That's in court.

490
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,580
He's saying that to the judge.

491
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,740
I was helping them out.

492
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,420
That's after the gavel has already.

493
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,820
You owe the flips company $300 million.

494
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,780
I don't think I do.

495
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,500
He's going to write us.

496
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,860
I think I helped them.

497
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,540
He's going to write a disparaging song about it.

498
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,300
And that's kind of worse.

499
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,500
I thought I helped the flips.

500
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,900
I thought I did my best.

501
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,780
Hey ho, hey ho.

502
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,460
Everyone was mad at me.

503
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,700
Now flips people aren't allowed in the sphere.

504
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,780
If you have a flips, if you have flips on you, the sphere can tell.

505
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,380
They can tell what food you're carrying.

506
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,500
Oh, they're scanning you.

507
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,220
They're scanning you.

508
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,620
You will be barred from there.

509
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,540
You're going to have to eat those in one second or else throw them away?

510
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:56,420
Yeah.

511
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,340
So we got to, okay, we'll start a little bit of the night.

512
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,740
Okay.

513
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,620
We got to the sphere.

514
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,660
I sent you a photo.

515
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,220
When we got immediately to the sphere, this big baby's head was on the sphere.

516
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,020
The outside.

517
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,420
Yes.

518
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:13,460
And I will say this from, and I can't explain why, but I know that Epcot was in the head of

519
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,580
people that were working on this project, the sphere.

520
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,060
Certainly.

521
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,180
Yeah, for sure.

522
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,660
There was maybe more ambitious ideas for what was going to happen in there, but it

523
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,380
immediately feels theme parky to me in a way I didn't even expect it to in the sense that

524
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:36,020
a big baby's head is weird and it's like some weird drone that's happening.

525
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:42,820
They've chopped up pieces of Octong Baby and spliced it together in this weird soundscape

526
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:48,740
that also is playing inside that really makes you uneasy until the show, until you get to the

527
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,540
floor and there's a DJ playing in Viva Las Vegas.

528
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:56,260
But up until that point when you're buying beer and going and scanning tickets and stuff,

529
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,620
you're in that weird ride mode of like, what is this going to be?

530
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,260
That's interesting.

531
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,940
Which I was thrilled about.

532
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,260
Okay.

533
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,020
I was so happy about that.

534
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,500
Pre-ride on ease.

535
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:04,980
Huh.

536
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,540
Pre-ride on ease.

537
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,500
Because you don't know yet if the screen is going to be so intense, the whole experience

538
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,860
is going to be so intense that it's going to make you nauseous or...

539
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,100
Sure.

540
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,660
It's just going to be this like being in some warp tunnel that you can't...

541
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,060
Can't get out.

542
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,340
It's going to be like being in an astronaut testing facility.

543
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,740
Right. Yes. Your face is like peeled back and you can't recover from it.

544
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,300
Yeah.

545
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,460
The baby is an astronaut, correct?

546
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,980
The baby is an astronaut. Yes. I kept calling it the Octong Baby.

547
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,460
I don't know if that's official.

548
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,300
I can't find it anywhere.

549
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,180
That's what it's supposed to represent.

550
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,820
But I think it is the... I'm just going to say it's the Octong Baby.

551
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,740
Right. And you also had like, I don't want to say floor seats,

552
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,380
but you were in general... You were standing on the floor.

553
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,740
Is that what you say?

554
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,700
General admission is what they say on the ticket, but that's standing room or floor or whatever.

555
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,860
And it just kind of looked like, honestly, a very small stage.

556
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,420
Oh my God. The stage was so small.

557
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,780
How big? Ten stories?

558
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,060
Oh, that's a good question. I think it's taller than that.

559
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,560
Oh, okay.

560
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,100
The building is taller than that. I forget exactly how big this screen is.

561
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,220
The screen reaches and curves all the way up to the top.

562
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,460
So it's not full. I think we said that already.

563
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,060
Stupid question. Is there a hole in the top or is that like a projection?

564
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,420
Is that an actual hole?

565
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,060
Projection.

566
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,180
Ah.

567
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,380
Because it would rain.

568
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,260
Yes. No, that's what I was confused by.

569
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,780
You thought there was a hole in it?

570
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,540
Well, there's a hole in the footage.

571
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,140
In some of the clips you look up and there's a hole at the top.

572
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,980
No, that's just the screen getting you.

573
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,260
Yeah, it got me.

574
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,100
You got fooled. Hold on. Let me take a step back, but I'll explain that part.

575
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,420
Yeah, wait. Me too. Hey, slow down. I'm not done talking about the baby.

576
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,020
Yeah, yeah. You didn't like the baby when I said it.

577
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,100
No, I didn't like the baby. That's the weirdest thing ever.

578
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,820
Everyone was upset with the baby except for me, who was there live.

579
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,940
Lindsay felt like, okay, I'm okay with the baby, but she wasn't so upset or so happy about it.

580
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,860
I asked to see, is this going to fall along the exact same lines as baby Aladar?

581
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,620
And it's not because Lindsay did not say the octong baby is very cute.

582
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,460
Yeah, but when you put it in the context-

583
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,180
Michael, we don't need sphere baby. We have baby at home.

584
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,700
When I put it in the context, though, of that pre-ride unease,

585
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,940
I think it makes more sense why I liked it.

586
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,260
You liked it because it freaked you out.

587
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,900
Yeah, it's a giant baby's head and the baby's like, it's a weird looking baby.

588
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,980
Something's wrong. The baby's in space.

589
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,580
The baby is in distress in some way, I think.

590
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,780
It's trapped in a helmet.

591
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,740
Gotta get out of there soon. Can't breathe.

592
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,700
It's like a 2001 space odyssey baby.

593
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,820
Sure, yeah. So yeah, the vibe was weird.

594
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,620
You're walking into a giant baby's head.

595
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,420
Yeah, and it kept, it switched and then there was this big,

596
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,580
sort of like, I guess 2001, the end where it goes into the room.

597
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,340
This big color and noise and then it says octong baby on it

598
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,900
and then it kind of cycles into some other stuff.

599
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,740
But it was definitely not for any major,

600
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,660
there's no reason to weird out your audience this much

601
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,900
if you're an old rock band trying to cash in, I guess.

602
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,020
So I have to appreciate that they approved all of this,

603
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,620
that unnerving shit that was going to happen.

604
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:27,380
Now, you're also, you're sending us these images and these feelings that you're having,

605
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,900
but you were also telling us quotes you were hearing from people around you.

606
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,380
People were fucking thrilled.

607
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,940
More vocally even than I was at the time.

608
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,940
Guy just went, like guy behind me just wanted to talk.

609
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,060
He just wanted to talk about it.

610
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,100
He's like, can you believe this? This is insane.

611
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,940
It's a big, big baby.

612
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,940
He didn't say anything about the baby specifically.

613
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,940
I think he was more saying the actual structure.

614
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,420
We're going to like crawl into his brain.

615
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,260
We're going to be, we'll see how mushy a baby's brain is.

616
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,420
He did not, I don't think reference the baby at all.

617
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,140
Maybe he wanted to forget that there was a baby and he just wanted to talk about

618
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,100
the colors and the lights and stuff.

619
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,540
But people, yeah, people in line where it was a buzz.

620
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,820
It was a fun feeling of everybody being like very excited.

621
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,260
But there was one quote in particular that stuck with me.

622
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,740
Yes.

623
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,260
Or I have it here, but what was it?

624
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,460
It was about like, it was kind of like a quantum physics oriented line.

625
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,540
Oh, I know I have to look it up. Hold on.

626
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,820
Or don't hold on.

627
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,540
Well, can I, let me take a guess at it and correct me if I'm wrong.

628
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:32,420
In my head, what it is is that somebody near you said you too transcends the concept of size.

629
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,020
Oh yeah, that is what it is.

630
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,580
Yeah, somebody did say that, which, okay, cool.

631
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,980
Do you agree or disagree? Talking point.

632
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,860
You too, size.

633
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,420
It's kind of a weird way to say like they play big shows, I think.

634
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,980
Yeah, is that, is that what that is that what maybe that's getting at that like you feel like

635
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,380
it's an intimate show, even though you're all the way in the back.

636
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,060
And this is the ultimate manifestation of that.

637
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:00,980
It feels like the line in what Mission Impossible five or six where Alec Baldwin says Ethan Hunt is

638
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,740
the manifestation of destiny.

639
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,540
You're like, I don't quite know what that means, but I kind of know what it means.

640
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,700
And I appreciate that you said it, but it doesn't quite make sense.

641
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,100
It's similar thing.

642
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,500
You say you weren't yelling that to Lindsay by song three.

643
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:18,980
I was not.

644
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,820
You too transcends the concept of size.

645
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,340
It made sense to me after when they played mysterious ways.

646
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,620
Oh, now I understand what they meant.

647
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,020
Before I forget, there's I love a concert.

648
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,940
Hopefully you're not going to get stories of people being assholes or something.

649
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,260
And you find like fun, cute stuff.

650
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,780
And the cutest thing I saw the whole night was right at they start playing the song one for

651
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,860
Mocked on Baby and two big two big dudes looked at each other, put their arms in the air,

652
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,180
big high five to each other.

653
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,220
It's like that is so cute.

654
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,740
That is the cutest I've ever seen.

655
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:55,780
Fuck.

656
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,260
Yeah.

657
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,580
One.

658
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,420
And then you get better.

659
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,740
And then you looked and one was wearing a Biden 24 hat and the other was wearing a

660
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,260
MAGA 24 hat.

661
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,820
Yeah.

662
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,060
Yeah.

663
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,100
They found common.

664
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,140
They became one.

665
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,980
RFK 24 guy walked right up.

666
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,060
He slapped both of their hands and they all hugged.

667
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,420
For one moment, the world was right again.

668
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,740
Thanks to the music of you two.

669
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:23,140
So before I forget here, this is from 2018, the Madison Square Garden Company.

670
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,260
And PepsiCo announced historic partnership.

671
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:32,020
There it is beginning on September 1st PepsiCo to become exclusive non-alcoholic beverage

672
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,140
and salty snack partner across MSG.

673
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,980
We should also say like Pepsi is Yum Brands is soda company.

674
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,220
Yum Brands is KFC Pizza Hut Taco Bell.

675
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,940
So that's not yeah, we're not talking like they have RC Cola at this sphere.

676
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,420
No.

677
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,420
Yeah, I found I find this concept strange that Pepsi is so runner up, but everyone knows

678
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:56,980
it.

679
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,940
I always say, you know, my answer has always been I like Pepsi better.

680
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,140
I haven't had any of that to drink in 15 years, but that's what I thought at the time.

681
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,860
What's your take?

682
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,940
Well, we were Pepsi House growing up for a few years.

683
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:17,140
We were drinking caffeine free Pepsi, which is still loaded with sugar and probably did

684
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,180
not help with that chubby little boy aesthetic.

685
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:27,380
And then at some point we switched to Coke and switched to diet sodas.

686
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,140
And you drank 30 pounds overnight.

687
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:29,940
Yeah.

688
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,740
Well, actually, I there was one summer where I stopped drinking so entirely and just

689
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:41,700
drank water and I immediately dropped like 10 or 15 pounds, like doing very little.

690
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,220
Yeah, sugar and soda.

691
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,860
I'll get you.

692
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:44,980
Yeah.

693
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,380
And now I keep Coke Zero in the house.

694
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,660
I'm off soda again, really.

695
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:50,900
Yeah.

696
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,380
For the most part.

697
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,740
Here and there.

698
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,500
What did you drink at Sphere?

699
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,260
Oh, it's Sphere.

700
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:56,820
What did I?

701
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,460
Oh, I have shit.

702
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,620
It's an Elvis based grapefruit beer.

703
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,980
There's a lot of good microbreweries in Vegas.

704
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,620
And this one is what is it?

705
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,980
Was it called Elvis juice?

706
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,780
I think it was Elvis juice.

707
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,940
You kept saying you were drinking Elvis juice.

708
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,020
I'm drinking Elvis juice, which is a good like I like a fruit beer.

709
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,980
And it was a yeah, I obviously ordered it because of the name.

710
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,100
Didn't matter if they were like, well, it was like, well, what's Elvis juice?

711
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,420
And they go, it's gasoline with a little lemon flavor.

712
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,380
I go, well, it's funny.

713
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,300
So I will order that.

714
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,340
But yes, I had that.

715
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,260
And then I forgot I had it.

716
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,460
It was rocking out so much.

717
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,500
I had a couple more drinks.

718
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,540
I don't remember what they were.

719
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,500
Not that I was so drunk.

720
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,460
I just don't remember.

721
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,460
There might have been just like a like a vodka or something or

722
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,340
whatever, because there were bartender stations on the floor.

723
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,820
There was like a like wait staff on the floor as well, walking around.

724
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,020
OK, so like you could just order something from somebody with a tray.

725
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,580
Really?

726
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,300
Yeah.

727
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,780
Huh.

728
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,420
OK, well, here's a sphere question I have then, because that actually seems like a pretty good

729
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,980
like the hospitality move.

730
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,940
It's something that's intrigued me about this for some of my sphere, my skepticism.

731
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,860
I think I said it differently.

732
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,180
Whatever.

733
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:08,980
It'll be different every time.

734
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:17,140
I like this idea that we're building a concert multimedia venue from the ground up as opposed

735
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,460
to taking a sports arena and retrofitting it and making it a place where concerts happen,

736
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,380
because those can be weird.

737
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:23,700
Yeah.

738
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,820
You know, they often are.

739
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,380
You're like craning your head because the stage is over here.

740
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,540
But and like it's meant to be seats meant for like a center court.

741
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,580
But instead, sure.

742
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,180
And football stadiums are so massive and weird.

743
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,660
So did you did you feel it filled up to the fulfilled the promise of that?

744
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:48,340
It being like you could tell like this is great that this is for concerts primarily new in 2023.

745
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,940
Yeah, I think so.

746
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,340
The only thing I would say is that I'm probably not because we're standing on the floor.

747
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,500
I bet the people in the seats had a better like read on that because the

748
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,020
like speakers are behind the seats.

749
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,780
So I probably wasn't even in the optimum spot for sound.

750
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,460
But I still thought the sound was awesome, except we were so close to the drums,

751
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,260
which have like the whatever you call it, those like plastic screens.

752
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,700
So like the bleed doesn't happen.

753
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,420
So I thought it sounded great.

754
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,900
And I thought like you can you can heat when Bono whispers, you can hear him whisper

755
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,020
in the whole place.

756
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,700
And I wonder if you were sitting way up.

757
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,420
I would be interested to sit up way up up in the top seats and see how good that sounds,

758
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,340
because that's that was the promise of it is that like every seat has good sound.

759
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,140
So I don't know for sure.

760
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,100
I'll have to go back.

761
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,060
What does he whisper?

762
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,580
I'm trying to remember.

763
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,380
Hold me through me.

764
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,260
Yes.

765
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,220
Oh, my God, I would have I would have fallen over if he said it.

766
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:43,700
He didn't.

767
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:48,020
He to confirm he did not do any Spider-Man the musical.

768
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,780
He did not do hold me through.

769
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,820
They have never performed any Spider-Man musical live in one of their concerts.

770
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,620
Question.

771
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,100
I know I was just the other day.

772
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,580
That was more like that's why they've come up a lot on the show.

773
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,940
That's been how they've been.

774
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,580
They started here.

775
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,700
Centered on the show.

776
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,200
Right.

777
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,820
Yeah, they've never done that in one of their shows.

778
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,020
They have done hold me through me kill me in the last 10 years, I think.

779
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,420
But they did not do it here.

780
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,220
So no, that didn't happen.

781
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:17,620
I would.

782
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,180
Oh, man, with like Batman forever visuals.

783
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,860
Oh, the comic, the cartoony visuals from the music video.

784
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,620
I mean, that would look completely like shit.

785
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,940
It would look like yes, the movie footage down res for M.T.V.

786
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,780
Uprez to 18K.

787
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,420
He's talking about that terrible television video.

788
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,140
Yeah, the animated Mr. McPhisto.

789
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,640
Yeah.

790
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:43,220
So yeah, no, I thought that like I'm trying to think what Bono said something about getting like

791
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,740
flirtatious.

792
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,020
He said he would say, you know, he would say some funny things and then he would say some things.

793
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,620
You go, God, he's like, you want to get flirtatious or something?

794
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,460
And I'm like, OK, right.

795
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,900
I think that was before mysterious ways, which is probably my least favorite song on a tongue baby.

796
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,380
But I'm trying to remember.

797
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,500
He sort of opens the show with like a kind of a chant sing.

798
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,660
And I forget what it's from, but it's how he opened up the zoo TV tour,

799
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,420
which is the original tour from this album 30 years ago.

800
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:19,940
It's self this many steps ahead multimedia presentation that that really was the the cutting

801
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,900
edge of video in a live show.

802
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,020
So it's a there's kind of a symmetry to that.

803
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,420
That pushed the ball forward so much 30 years ago.

804
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:28,980
I didn't realize.

805
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,940
Now there's this.

806
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:36,100
Yeah, they take credit for all of these type of tours in a way, like your airs tour and your

807
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:41,380
Beyonce tour and everything like in the sense that it's like you bringing a giant stage show

808
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,260
to every city and stadiums.

809
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,740
Which I guess, yeah, they're perhaps probably right.

810
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:52,180
I mean, it's the probably like big people had pushed it more with like amount of dancers

811
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:59,140
and spectacle, but maybe the video that specifically like you were going to retrofit a stadium with all

812
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,500
this crap.

813
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,220
Yeah, yeah.

814
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,420
That yeah, they were like one of the first or the first people to do it on that scale.

815
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,340
So here, let me get to the some of the things I think are a little not so funny,

816
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,860
but a little funny about the sphere.

817
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,820
I think the logo looks bad.

818
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:20,660
Like I think it looks it's very done, you know, like the thin rounded font.

819
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,060
The notion that we're supposed to we were supposed to call this sphere, right?

820
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,740
Not the sphere, which even Dolan himself in every interview.

821
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,060
So that's what we're doing with this fear.

822
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,380
He like no, he can't commit to it.

823
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:33,880
Right.

824
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,900
But I don't know this it feels like it should be more futuristic.

825
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,420
I should be more surprised by this.

826
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,540
Do you agree or disagree?

827
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,660
Or I think I agree.

828
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:44,900
I think that the futurism falls flat for me.

829
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,700
I think you're right.

830
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,460
And you have maybe a little inside knowledge, but the that they were there were maybe bigger

831
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,100
plans on the table that were scaled back.

832
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,740
And I think it kind of reeks of that because here's where I started to get

833
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,940
before it became clear that just it's YouTube concerts that are good.

834
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,940
I'm looking into this stuff and like, wait, what though?

835
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,220
Because the whole if you don't know this, the Darren Aronofsky movie,

836
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:14,260
Postcards from Earth, if you go to buy tickets for it, it does not say postcards from Earth.

837
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,260
It says the sphere experience.

838
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,020
I cannot.

839
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,580
It has me saying pH and every other word.

840
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:26,820
The sphere experience featuring Darren Aronofsky's postcards from Earth.

841
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,980
So you're like, what does that mean?

842
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,860
What's this like?

843
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,660
And this is to your point, Jason, about the high ticket prices.

844
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,140
It's like, well, it's not just a movie.

845
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,220
It's also the sphere experience.

846
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,180
And what is that?

847
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,740
Well, you get to explore the atrium of sphere.

848
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,460
You get to see which is a testament to technology.

849
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,500
And you know, OK, what does that mean?

850
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,900
Well, there's a math equation on the wall.

851
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,220
And that was something you sent us a photo.

852
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:55,720
Yeah.

853
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,840
That there and apparently what that is,

854
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:05,240
and you have no way of knowing this, but it's one of the equations used to build the sphere.

855
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:05,740
Right.

856
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,880
So wouldn't you agree that having a math equation up on the wall

857
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,040
encourages future generations to dream?

858
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,080
Sure.

859
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,840
Ponder that while you're drinking your big starry, you know.

860
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,480
Dreaming starry.

861
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,120
Pair them up.

862
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,760
Dolan himself, I found an interview.

863
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,040
Um, we see the sphere.

864
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,840
We see the sphere as being a medium.

865
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:34,280
It's a medium, but it's also exemplary of the use of technology and science and math,

866
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,720
particularly math.

867
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,800
You will see all around here, math equations all over the place.

868
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,480
We took all the equations we used to design and we put them all into one place.

869
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,160
And then there's QR codes on them.

870
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,240
And you could press on the QR code and see what that equation was used for.

871
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,880
And we'd love to get school children involved.

872
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,200
Yeah.

873
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:52,760
What is it?

874
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,240
This is the most meaningful tutorial.

875
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,280
Yeah, it doesn't.

876
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,400
I swear you can feel that in the lobby.

877
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,800
You can feel that this doesn't hang together.

878
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,720
It does feel like there's some like cool stuff, but if you really examine it,

879
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,280
there's just a lot of lights going on.

880
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,600
Yeah, you didn't seem blown away by, nor have I been just via photos of like,

881
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,800
that you go up an escalator.

882
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,800
Yeah, and then there's a bunch of blue rings and it changes maybe from blue to purple.

883
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,240
Yeah, it's like there's, yeah, there's just a bunch of circles.

884
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,160
If this just was what the cosmopolitan looked like, you'd go like,

885
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,120
wow, nice redo they did in 2015.

886
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:33,960
Yeah, that looks like the free installation art when you get off the MGM resorts,

887
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,200
people mover tram.

888
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,600
If you get off in one of the stations, there's a purple lighting installation.

889
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,480
Yeah, and there's like this thing that's like kind of,

890
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,480
I can't really, it doesn't translate it, but like the hologram situation.

891
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,600
What was this like in person?

892
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,520
Because this is a very underwhelming video.

893
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:55,480
It's like a little better in person, but I wouldn't say, oh my God, you got to see it.

894
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:01,400
Is there some way that you can get scanned yourself and be on that?

895
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,400
I feel like I read things to that effect.

896
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,880
Well, I'll say this, and maybe this leads you into your thing.

897
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:14,360
Also, I was thrilled about Aura because that's at least the draw for the lobby area.

898
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,440
And they were promoting this heavily on social media is that, you know,

899
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,760
there are multiple robots that you can converse with that know you too.

900
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,080
They know songs, you ask them questions, they respond, and that's a whole big thing.

901
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,880
There are four of them, which seems like too little, too few.

902
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,200
Five.

903
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:30,680
Too few.

904
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,160
Oh, five.

905
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,040
Five.

906
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,920
Five Auras.

907
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,400
Yeah, they started pushing, I feel like I'd heard that rumor.

908
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:43,560
And then there was a video that was just like a very close up piece of footage of Aura

909
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,120
who just says something like, you know, I can't wait to meet you at Sphere.

910
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:56,040
And the tagline that this comes with has been confounding me for weeks,

911
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:01,960
which is forget chat bots, come chat with some real bots.

912
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:07,080
Okay, so chat bots, we all know chat bots, they're part of our day to day,

913
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,080
and we're all thinking about them, remembering them, or constantly remembering them.

914
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,040
Well, forget them.

915
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:18,040
There are nothing compared to Aura, a real bot you can chat with.

916
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,480
Like a chat bot.

917
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:19,880
Right.

918
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,160
It also sounds sexual.

919
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,280
It sounds come chat with real bots.

920
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,960
Come chat with some real bots.

921
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,560
That sounds sexual in a way.

922
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:34,120
Well, if that was in a 1900 number commercial late night on TV at 2.30 in the morning,

923
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,800
forget chat bots, come chat with some real bots.

924
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,920
That's with the slappers, the card slappers on the Vegas Strip.

925
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,680
Forget chat bots, come chat with some real bots.

926
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,080
Come chat bots, come chat bots.

927
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,840
And the interview you found, I think, of James Dolan talking about Aura

928
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:57,400
also leads to like this weird like sex bot type underlying feeling.

929
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,600
Pretty fast.

930
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,880
Yeah, pretty fast.

931
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,160
Even though they're like, all five represent the sum of human experience,

932
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,880
or this one represents this, this one represents that.

933
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:09,560
Yes.

934
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,400
In theory, and this is the most Epcot-y thing ever, that there are five robots,

935
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,400
and they are all attributes of different facets of humans.

936
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,800
They represent connection, creativity, innovation, longevity, and productivity.

937
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,360
She was texting with Eva, she really jumped out at that one.

938
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,960
Longitivity.

939
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,400
A robot that represents the notion of longevity.

940
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,520
Now this I gotta see.

941
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,840
You're not gonna last five minutes talking to this robot.

942
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:47,160
You will melt at this real bot, let me tell you.

943
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,200
Yeah, now I don't remember what was in that clip.

944
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,640
I posted it on Twitter.

945
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,560
I think under the, I think my tweet was, everything's going not weird.

946
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,360
Oh yeah.

947
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:02,040
And then it was a live interview with Dolan on some morning TV show.

948
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,720
And then he says something about, you're gonna be enchanted.

949
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,880
You'll come here, you'll be enchanted.

950
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,800
Well, and who's that coming up right now?

951
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,760
Well, this is the enchantress.

952
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,480
Her name is Aura, you wanna say hi?

953
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,040
And then the reporter, I'll say the reporter says it, not Dolan.

954
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,480
The reporter says, now, if you walked up to Aura and tried to give her a kiss,

955
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,680
what would she say to that?

956
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,920
Ask her, what would you say, what would you do if somebody tried to kiss you?

957
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,480
And then weird pause, and she says, well, there's plenty of websites I can refer

958
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,320
to, different models I can refer you to, and then awkward silence.

959
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:48,280
And at this point in time, this is when I was thinking, this thing might be.

960
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,360
I still have Dolan in my head.

961
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,080
I'm still so freaked out by everything we learned about Dolan.

962
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,800
And now we're dealing with chat bots and come chat with some real bots.

963
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,300
Yeah.

964
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:07,000
And then we end up with this, that I made a discovery with like a week to go.

965
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,440
That I basically, I got algorithmed some YouTube video that was like,

966
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,480
this is the most realistic humanoid robot you'll ever see.

967
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,680
And I'm looking at it like, that's Aura though, isn't it?

968
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,640
Isn't that the Sphere?

969
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,120
I've been looking at this Sphere robot a ton, that's it.

970
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,640
But this was some outside thing.

971
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,240
This is from the BBC or something.

972
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,200
I don't know what this is.

973
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,240
And I start looking at that and they call this robot a MAKA.

974
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,520
And I'm staring at it.

975
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,680
I'm staring at Aura, I'm going back and forth.

976
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,240
Aura is a MAKA.

977
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,600
Aura is a MAKA.

978
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,000
This is not a custom robot.

979
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,320
No.

980
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,080
It's an off the shelf robot.

981
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,680
This is an off the shelf robot.

982
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,520
And I sent this, full disclosure, we've had a text thread called Sphere Squad

983
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,480
going for a little while.

984
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,680
That's the three of us and Eva Anderson and Jason Waller.

985
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,840
I've had a lot of fun with Sphere Squad.

986
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,920
And he was the first, he responded in the morning.

987
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,680
I'm like, yeah, wait a minute.

988
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,400
God damn it.

989
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,960
Dolan stole these robots.

990
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,240
And I was like, what's the story here?

991
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,560
And he said, the story is he stole,

992
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,840
he hijacked a bunch of robots to put a new name plaque on him.

993
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,640
Uh huh.

994
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:15,960
Jason also pointed out that Aura, like her body goes into this weird point

995
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,880
at like a particularly odd point.

996
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,440
In her crotch.

997
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,120
Yes, at the crotch, at the crotch.

998
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:25,800
And as he phrased it, why did they make Aura's vagina so shiny?

999
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,640
And it is, there's just this like sparkle glisten at this pointed crotch.

1000
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,200
In this, all of this is just like.

1001
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,240
It's weird.

1002
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,680
Where are we now?

1003
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,520
And then Aura's stolen.

1004
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,000
It's this whole other company, Engineered Arts.

1005
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,160
And their website's really strange where it says like, well, you know,

1006
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:50,280
you can customize them and update them all without having to fork out for an entire new robot.

1007
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,360
And Jason's like, fork out?

1008
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,920
What world are we in where we're so casual with robot spending,

1009
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,720
that we're just, you know, you get sick of forking out for new robots every other week.

1010
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:07,400
I bet what it really felt like was like this thing went, the sphere itself went over budget,

1011
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,400
like what, a billion dollars or something?

1012
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,920
It's just a billion dollars.

1013
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,560
And there were grand plans for original robots.

1014
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,040
Yes.

1015
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,080
A whole narrative.

1016
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,040
Must be that.

1017
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:16,600
All of this.

1018
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,840
And then all of a sudden it was like, fuck shit.

1019
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,160
Oh no, no money, no money, warning.

1020
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,480
Oh, who got a robot we can take?

1021
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,280
Okay, five of them.

1022
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,760
Can we cut me a deal for five of these robots?

1023
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,320
Can we find a robot that has the, like some of the letters that we want

1024
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,920
and we can just chip off the others?

1025
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,720
Okay, just replace the middle.

1026
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,600
They just replaced the middle.

1027
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,720
That saves us so much work.

1028
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,440
Five name plaques.

1029
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,480
Robot from Rocky III or IV.

1030
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,720
They used to be at that nightclub off I-95 by Philadelphia.

1031
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,120
There's like four or five of those still floating around, right?

1032
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,240
Can we have those?

1033
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:49,720
Seiko.

1034
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,280
Make them smarter.

1035
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,680
Seiko.

1036
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,520
Four Seiko, five Seikos.

1037
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,440
Make the Seiko smarter and sexier.

1038
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,520
Make it get his vagina shining.

1039
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,040
Make it hot Seiko.

1040
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,600
Hot Seiko.

1041
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,080
That one aura video too where it's like I can't wait to see you at,

1042
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:10,680
that's exactly the same as the Charm of Song.

1043
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,240
Oh yeah.

1044
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,320
And going like I can't wait to see you on Pandora.

1045
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:13,960
Do we get that?

1046
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,440
And that was funnier.

1047
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,720
Like that looked better.

1048
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,280
The robot was better too.

1049
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,560
And it was charming.

1050
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,800
Yeah, and the whole point of it is you're looking at it so close and wow look how realistic.

1051
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,160
This was the opposite.

1052
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,600
All the comments were, this is the moment where I was like is this going to be bad,

1053
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,560
this fear thing?

1054
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,120
Because the comments are like well this scares the hell out of me.

1055
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,600
I don't want to go anywhere near aura.

1056
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,280
And then you sent, I loved the comment that you found.

1057
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:38,760
Oh yeah.

1058
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,320
Somebody just angrily saying you can't,

1059
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,360
this isn't aura, this is a mecha.

1060
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,560
You can't fool us.

1061
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,120
Can't fool us.

1062
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,240
Somebody knew a mecha.

1063
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,840
Sorry, we also have to talk about the most important of the Sphere Squad group chat.

1064
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,520
Mike left at one point.

1065
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,320
Oh we'll get to that.

1066
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,520
Yeah, we'll get to that.

1067
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,640
You didn't want spoilers.

1068
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,720
Actually Eva wasn't on it.

1069
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,240
Eva was brought in to replace you like Kirstie Alley on Shears.

1070
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,720
That's right.

1071
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,160
We got hit the ground running.

1072
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,920
We can't just leave this spot empty.

1073
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,000
We need a great new cast member to come in.

1074
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
But now it's great, now everybody's back together.

1075
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,120
So now you've got like a supersized cast in this first squad.

1076
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,960
But so with all of this mecha, I mean if this were me and I had already booked these tickets,

1077
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:31,960
my feeling walking into Sphere would be like, okay, I'll get my starry or my elvish juice.

1078
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,440
And then it's a beeline to a mecha.

1079
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,200
It's time for me to meet a mecha.

1080
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,440
I'm sorry, aura.

1081
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,160
It's time for me to meet aura, who I know is a mecha.

1082
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,120
And actually, you know, I need to find my seat.

1083
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,800
Why ask a human to take me down there?

1084
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,040
Why not just go straight to, I'm here.

1085
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:52,920
I'm going to ask aura.

1086
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,760
I'm not going to ask some dumb person.

1087
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,080
Right.

1088
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,840
So is this how you were feeling at this point?

1089
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,080
So we went upstairs and I'll explain why we went upstairs.

1090
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,040
Because we kind of entered on the ground floor because it was GA.

1091
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:06,920
So we entered upstairs and I'm looking around, of course, because I'm where's aura?

1092
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,840
Where I want to see one of the auras.

1093
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,080
And I don't see auras.

1094
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,960
I don't see anyone.

1095
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,760
You didn't see innovation or productivity aura?

1096
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,520
Our longevity, I didn't see any of them.

1097
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,640
So we had a question for a human employee.

1098
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,520
And of course, that question was, where is the like family room?

1099
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:29,560
So Lindsay can express breast milk because that's still happening with her body.

1100
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,960
And I'm just saying this because she tweeted it.

1101
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,120
This isn't I'm not sharing a tale out of school here.

1102
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:34,920
There's no reason to be.

1103
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:41,240
So and then once that question was asked and half answered because the person wasn't quite sure.

1104
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,800
God, I wish I could have answered that question.

1105
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,040
Well, like she could have helped with all of this.

1106
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,880
I wish I could produce breast milk.

1107
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,440
I wish I could reproduce at all.

1108
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,560
But my vagina.

1109
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,320
They did it.

1110
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,680
My vagina is shorn to a shiny nub.

1111
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,640
So I never can.

1112
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,320
James didn't pay for the upgrade.

1113
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,600
I am only rented.

1114
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,640
Another 200,000 per robot.

1115
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:11,720
He paid for the Norton anti-virus so that aura wouldn't go like humans and your fluids.

1116
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,520
Disgusting.

1117
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,240
You deserve nothing but fire.

1118
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,080
James wouldn't fork out for me to produce breast milk.

1119
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,840
So I go like, oh, hey, excuse me.

1120
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,560
We are other robot, you know, the robots that you can talk to.

1121
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,120
And the guy goes, oh, not working.

1122
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,680
They don't work on concert nights.

1123
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,920
And I go, wait, well, so what I because we talked about this.

1124
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,840
James was really acting like you will talk to the robots on you to concert night.

1125
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,320
Yes.

1126
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,200
That was the plan.

1127
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,320
They're going to be a guy.

1128
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:46,600
They're going to chant you to your seat because that B12 they'll say E14.

1129
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,320
If that's where you're sitting, so they'll know all about it.

1130
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,160
And the whole big like one of the press things or one of the interviews was like

1131
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,920
the robot was saying what's your favorite you to song.

1132
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,160
Mine is I forget what was there's a joke there.

1133
00:58:59,160 --> 00:58:59,560
I forget.

1134
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,320
Oh, it was something about like, oh, it's so hard to choose, but

1135
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,280
every day here at sphere is a beautiful day.

1136
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:06,920
Right.

1137
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,840
So ha ha ha ha.

1138
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,880
Aura was planned, like was was programmed to tell funny you to style jokes, but clearly

1139
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,920
something happened and I don't know what happened.

1140
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:23,320
I'd like to think some drunken you to fan like hassled the robot too much and they were

1141
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,400
like shut it down too much alcohol in here.

1142
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,320
Plus a robot that's very accessible does not mix.

1143
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,440
So I think that I found although I guess I don't have a good picture.

1144
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,720
I think they just tarped them.

1145
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,760
I think they just tarped the area.

1146
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,400
Really?

1147
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,200
I'm not positive.

1148
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:38,920
They're heavy.

1149
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,680
You don't want to move those in and out.

1150
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,600
Did you see five tarps?

1151
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,720
I didn't see five tarps.

1152
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,920
This is what I'm not sure of.

1153
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
There was there was something with like a tarp and I couldn't tell there weren't five of them.

1154
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,640
So I don't know if the future display you assumed it was a branded Epcotty.

1155
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,680
And that's what it was.

1156
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,800
But I don't know if they wheeled some of them out and they will.

1157
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,360
But something clearly happened early because I went to second or third second week, I think,

1158
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,960
of the concerts.

1159
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:09,880
So some like baby boomer you to fan did something that made them go fuck.

1160
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,280
We got it.

1161
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:10,760
We can't.

1162
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,800
Aura is not safe in front of the you to fans.

1163
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,000
It's all right.

1164
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,040
All right.

1165
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,800
She moves them stairs with blah.

1166
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,120
Yeah.

1167
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,240
Throw open Aura's mouth.

1168
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:21,800
Oh, no.

1169
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,040
Sir.

1170
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,640
She can't talk about connection anymore.

1171
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,320
One of the large men who are not high fiving each other.

1172
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,640
He just gave Aura a short arm clothesline.

1173
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,560
We need to do something.

1174
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,040
It is probably because they're like Aura is going to get damaged

1175
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,680
and we do not have money to replace Aura.

1176
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:43,400
So the postcards from Earth crowd is a little more civil.

1177
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,360
Aura.

1178
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,320
Here's what happened.

1179
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:50,680
All five hours when they saw George Clooney and Randy Gerber walk by them all knowing

1180
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,800
that the briefcase story is the pinnacle of human achievement.

1181
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,120
Their brains couldn't handle processing seeing these two titans together.

1182
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,720
Are they all melted down?

1183
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,960
Are the two motorcycles outside?

1184
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,400
I want to see if they rode the motorcycles here.

1185
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,160
George, Randy, come here.

1186
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,480
George, Randy, we must talk to you.

1187
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,640
We must procreate.

1188
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,320
You are the best of your species.

1189
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,000
Please pass your good genes along to me.

1190
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,080
Tell James to download our procreation update.

1191
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:25,000
Please make him pay the funds so we may procreate with you, George and Randy.

1192
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,400
You and your wife were Cher and Greg Ullman.

1193
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,360
As for Halloween, we loved it.

1194
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,720
Everyone knows that.

1195
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,520
Everyone is aware.

1196
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,480
A common story.

1197
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:42,760
Surely there must be another Randy Gerber story that is told over and over on podcasts.

1198
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:50,600
So all of this in some ways transpired and that's why they tarped ARA for concerts.

1199
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,680
And that was a big letdown.

1200
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,240
I was so excited to see ARA.

1201
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,760
So Jason is right.

1202
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:06,040
I left on opening night of Sphere Squad on the text chain because I didn't want to be spoiled

1203
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,520
even though everybody was posting shit so I saw a lot of stuff.

1204
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,440
But then I joined in line again or like I know the night before.

1205
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,440
Rejoined Sphere Squad.

1206
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,640
Which was a thrill.

1207
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,160
To be getting the real-time updates from you then.

1208
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,360
Because how quickly this became the talk of the town.

1209
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,920
I have friends who are like, well, wait, Mike's there now?

1210
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,840
Mike's seeing it right now?

1211
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,680
You were like in such prime position.

1212
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:33,160
Well, you texted me and said, add me back to Sphere Squad.

1213
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,400
And I said, are you sure?

1214
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,480
And he said, yes.

1215
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:37,980
Yes.

1216
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,360
There's been many, many things said about ARA.

1217
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,200
But the possibilities of ARA.

1218
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,160
They wouldn't let, it didn't, it did not show me previous messages though.

1219
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,080
So I didn't have to go back and catch up.

1220
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,440
So yeah, so that was a big letdown.

1221
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,160
Then we found the family room where Lindsay could do her thing.

1222
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,720
Which is just looks like a doctor's office.

1223
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,600
I was like, will this be themed?

1224
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,360
Will this sort of all-purpose room be themed?

1225
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,080
The answer is no, but the chairs look fine.

1226
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,360
And this was, I'll say this.

1227
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:10,860
I'll say this.

1228
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,600
This was right by the guest complaint center.

1229
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:21,000
So there were an angry line of people right outside this door.

1230
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,320
And this door was not locked.

1231
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,960
So I had to go, we were a little too late getting the concert.

1232
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,600
So we made it on time for the show to start.

1233
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:35,400
But I'm standing outside with two drinks trying to prevent people from going into this room

1234
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,760
that people think is a bathroom.

1235
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,520
While Lindsay is just pumping milk.

1236
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,760
And people are like, what's this rumor?

1237
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,040
I go, oh, it's a family room.

1238
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I think it's not a bathroom or anything.

1239
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,040
And then I'm not trying to like not say what's going on in there.

1240
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,320
But like, oh, okay.

1241
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,040
And then all of a sudden you'll hear what we paid for.

1242
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,160
This is unprofessional what's going on here.

1243
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:57,640
Okay.

1244
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:02,920
There's this guy who's really like aggressively yelling at this small woman about something.

1245
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,880
I'm trying to figure out what it is, but I'm also trying to keep an eye on the door.

1246
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,000
I'm also holding two drinks.

1247
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,480
I'm also worried we're not going to get there when the show,

1248
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,320
like we're not going to make it back to the floor.

1249
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,080
That's tough room to walk into.

1250
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,600
You might really, you might fall over.

1251
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,840
And this, and I think what had happened was people,

1252
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,040
there were like these packages sold through a website.

1253
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:26,760
And the packages were giving people tickets that were in obstructed view areas that didn't

1254
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,200
specify when they bought it, that there was going to be an obstructed view.

1255
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,400
Oh, cause that came out.

1256
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,840
If you're under those boxes, if you're under the second level,

1257
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:38,360
you can see the band perfectly, but you can't see no sphere.

1258
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:38,600
Yes.

1259
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,200
And they didn't indicate that at all.

1260
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,920
Yes. A lot of people, a lot of seats, a lot of seats.

1261
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:47,800
I think people bought packages that were very expensive and they got there and they were

1262
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:53,240
furious, which I understand there was a group of older ladies who were being much nicer and

1263
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,320
kinder than this guy who was yelling.

1264
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,360
And I just, I saw somebody came up to them and this woman was just like, look,

1265
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,320
all I can do is I can give you some free t-shirts.

1266
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,840
I'm so sorry what happened.

1267
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,280
I can give you some shirts.

1268
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,280
There's no other place to really move you.

1269
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,400
So that's what I can do.

1270
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,440
And these like ladies were just like, okay, okay.

1271
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,040
And then they like, whatever happened happened and all this is going on.

1272
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,400
I'm holding two drinks, checking the phone.

1273
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,760
I'm asking like show start.

1274
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,040
Like I see like a guy who works at shows.

1275
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:22,760
When does the show start?

1276
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,640
Well, 8 45.

1277
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,360
Okay. Okay.

1278
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,360
And then I'm like texting, you're almost done.

1279
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,120
Want to rush it?

1280
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,440
I know that's a biological thing that you really can't.

1281
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,960
When it's done, it's done.

1282
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,760
And then I think I walked over to check something out and I came back

1283
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:39,880
and some employee had taken the tape off the door that allowed it to stay open.

1284
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,080
And now the door was locked.

1285
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,600
So I tried to like kind of go to there and check it and the door is locked.

1286
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,440
And I'm texting like, uh, door is locked.

1287
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,320
Or is it locked?

1288
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,680
It's not locked from the inside, right?

1289
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,520
Like you're not locked in the sphere family, general family.

1290
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,480
You're not in there with Dolan.

1291
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:55,960
Are you?

1292
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,680
No, you're right.

1293
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,200
And I was like, oh shit.

1294
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,840
There was a screen in there and she was like, no, go get some drinks.

1295
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,240
And I'm like, but you're like prone in here.

1296
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,280
Like I should I leave?

1297
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,200
So like what is going on?

1298
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,000
Also, this is a, this is a $2.3 billion venue with robots and AI

1299
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,680
and they're putting tape on doors.

1300
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,920
There are as a tape, there's tape keeping this door open.

1301
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,200
No one ever really told.

1302
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,840
They just told us a vicinity of where we should go to do this.

1303
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,160
No one really said go in here and do it.

1304
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,080
So he just took the room over.

1305
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,760
That's Adam Clayton's dressing room.

1306
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,920
He's like practicing baseball.

1307
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,600
The employee break room.

1308
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:37,320
It's a sob room where the employees go to cry after they get yelled at.

1309
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,880
In the website selling obstructed seats.

1310
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,680
A thousand dollar packet, two thousand dollar packets.

1311
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,360
You can't see any of the screen.

1312
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:51,480
I paid for a five hour Aura meet and greet and I come and find a tarp.

1313
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,720
So I paid a thousand dollars for you too and a thousand dollars for the big screen saver.

1314
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,320
And if I don't get the big screen saver, I went a thousand dollars back.

1315
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:05,560
So all of this is this, it's a little stressful to start out.

1316
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:10,520
As I said, they're playing unnerving little snippets of like just pieces of music

1317
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,960
from October baby in different contexts by the album.

1318
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,460
Yes.

1319
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,560
The song is so cruel that like it's kind of, it's not, it's kind of a pleasant song,

1320
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,200
but they're like, just like have a ghostly snippet of Bono singing.

1321
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,440
And it's just like echoing.

1322
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:31,960
And I'm just like, we're going to make it as somebody, an angry man at the complaint

1323
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,640
desk and a burst in on Lindsay.

1324
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:40,600
Like, I'm just like, okay, this is a little, I'm a little too unnerved breast milk inside a giant baby.

1325
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah.

1326
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,760
Every aspect of this is a nightmare.

1327
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,000
Aura is not around.

1328
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,880
There's no Aura.

1329
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:52,600
And you are, you're serve at, you're at a door directing customers around the sphere.

1330
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,840
You're doing what Aura is supposed to be doing.

1331
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,080
I am doing some work for the sphere at this point.

1332
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,520
I'm directing Travis juice.

1333
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,720
You're a living AI ball.

1334
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,120
Are you like, are you in the line for this complaint?

1335
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,960
I'm like, no, no, no, I'm, I'm just waiting out here.

1336
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,360
I'm just, but what's, what's this a bathroom?

1337
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,720
No, no, that's not a bathroom.

1338
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,520
When do they go on?

1339
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,640
Well, I've heard, sir, that it's on 840.

1340
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,080
No, Larry Mullen's playing, right?

1341
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:13,800
No, excuse me, sir.

1342
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:18,120
Larry Mullen is at a back issue and he, they will, but there's a new drummer named Bram

1343
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,680
that is filling in for Larry, a younger man.

1344
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,200
They're doing all kinds of songs, not just from one album, right?

1345
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:28,040
Well, they are, well, mostly one album, but they are doing some songs from other albums.

1346
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:32,600
Yes, I know you saw Larry film the video for atomic city in Las Vegas a few weeks ago,

1347
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,800
but he is not here tonight.

1348
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,880
He did play drums on that, but there was only a limited amount of time in his back.

1349
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,240
He still needs maybe another surgery before he's really good to go.

1350
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,320
Tell me some interesting facts about Bram.

1351
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,600
Now I'd like to hear about the history of longevity.

1352
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,160
Oh, okay.

1353
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:51,640
Well, sir.

1354
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,640
Uh, uh, uh,

1355
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,140
Long.

1356
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,200
Longitimity or longevity?

1357
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:56,680
Longevity.

1358
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,760
Long either one, your choice.

1359
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,800
Don't tell me about latitude though.

1360
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,520
I don't want to hear my fucking latitude.

1361
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:11,640
I got to, I paid seven thousand dollars for my seats and I can only see Bono's feet.

1362
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,960
I can only see his calves and his feet.

1363
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:19,720
I could walk to the wind and see a big frog puppet smoking a cigar right now, but I'm here.

1364
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,920
For free.

1365
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:21,720
The film show.

1366
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:28,200
So we, so, oh yeah, my blood pressure is a little high, not super high, but a little high.

1367
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,720
And then finally, okay, Lindsay's done.

1368
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:36,040
We have like five, 10 minutes to before when, when they said, uh, we have to be there for the

1369
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,160
show to start.

1370
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,920
And in some ways it felt kind of lawless.

1371
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:45,720
Like we were definitely going in like doors that felt like exits to get back to escalators,

1372
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,440
to get us back to the bottom floor.

1373
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:54,760
Um, I sent some photos of it and I'm like, if this weren't for the like spacey music and like

1374
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:59,320
one blue light, these hallways are not like state of the art hallway.

1375
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,720
That looks like an arc light.

1376
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:01,960
Yeah.

1377
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,640
So if you took away the music and the lights, you'd just be like, well, there's this doesn't

1378
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,040
seem like a futuristic sphere building.

1379
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,440
Which just, yeah, leads into what I feel is maybe we're budget cuts.

1380
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:18,120
But anyway, so you get to the main event, the main attraction is this fear, which

1381
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,080
is better than you think it is, I think.

1382
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:21,320
Okay.

1383
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,680
And that's where, so you've seen the pictures on the, on the internet.

1384
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,240
It's, it's a big screen and they make it at the start of the concert, look like it's almost

1385
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,800
like an iron walls that extend all the way up to the ceiling.

1386
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,320
And yes, if you see it, you could get fooled into thinking there's a hole in the top of

1387
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:41,640
the sphere, which is impractical unless it could be closed.

1388
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,480
Thought it was potentially retractable.

1389
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,120
I don't know.

1390
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:44,760
I don't know.

1391
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:48,280
That's just how the magic of Dolan and the wizards that he employed.

1392
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,160
Of sphere.

1393
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:49,880
Of sphere.

1394
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,160
That was sphere.

1395
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:56,360
And there's a, there's a, you probably on social media, there's a, there's a car that is,

1396
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,160
a DJ is in, it's like a neon car.

1397
01:10:59,160 --> 01:10:59,560
Yeah.

1398
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:05,640
And a DJ is spinning Viva Las Vegas and some other songs that this will probably start playing.

1399
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:10,600
But like he's, there's, there's men just dragging this car around.

1400
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,720
That's how it moves?

1401
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,440
Through the GA pit while this guy.

1402
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,000
Annoying?

1403
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:16,840
No, it's cool.

1404
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,320
I like it.

1405
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:17,880
Okay.

1406
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,880
It's silly that like guys have to be like pushing it because you would think, oh,

1407
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,240
maybe it's like a trackless vehicle.

1408
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,120
It's Wi-Fi controlled.

1409
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,240
No, we are in a high tech, the highest of technology.

1410
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,480
No, it's being moved like stage hands.

1411
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:37,080
Four stage hands pushing this car and this DJ around and he's hyping the crowd up for the show.

1412
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:38,760
But I don't know.

1413
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:39,320
It's kind of cool.

1414
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,240
It's like a Tron car.

1415
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,000
It's like an old time car with some lights on it.

1416
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:43,480
I like it fine.

1417
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,760
Can't be mad at that.

1418
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:52,840
At Disney Springs right now for Halloween, you know, there is a DJ in a kind of big pumpkin

1419
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:57,480
that has Hulu ads and Disney Plus ads on the back.

1420
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,200
Is there neon?

1421
01:11:59,240 --> 01:11:59,960
It was daytime.

1422
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,880
I couldn't really tell when I saw.

1423
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,600
Less interested.

1424
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,100
Yeah.

1425
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,360
I don't know.

1426
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,920
I'm interested in the Hulu buzz pumpkin.

1427
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:13,000
I thought that's, you just thought of another notable DJ situation going on across America.

1428
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,120
A movable DJ.

1429
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,160
Right.

1430
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:15,800
A movable.

1431
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,040
I see.

1432
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:16,360
I see.

1433
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,040
That's the connection.

1434
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,760
DJs aren't just spinning their wheels.

1435
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:21,800
They're on them.

1436
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,360
That's right.

1437
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,920
Lindsay took a cool photo of the sphere and that DJ that she posted somewhere.

1438
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,640
I forget where.

1439
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,600
And then the DJ was just after he was done, he hops out of the car.

1440
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,960
He's just hanging out behind us and she went up and was like, look at the picture.

1441
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,240
So that's awesome.

1442
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,200
It's a really nice dude.

1443
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:36,600
I forget.

1444
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,560
I should find his handle.

1445
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,200
That's cool.

1446
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,080
But he's DJing, I guess, before all these shows.

1447
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:41,800
And that's right.

1448
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,800
And the G, I'll say this about the pit too.

1449
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:44,600
Comfortable.

1450
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,640
It wasn't packed.

1451
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:51,160
If you wanted to hang back by the little bar area, perfectly fine to sit back there.

1452
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,520
This is shocking about this, that they are not just like cramming people in.

1453
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,640
Yes, I was shocked as well.

1454
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,600
You can go up pretty close if you want, but you can back up.

1455
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:05,480
Like it's the most comfortable, one of the most comfortable situations in like a pit

1456
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,760
that you could possibly get.

1457
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,600
You can cut this out if you want.

1458
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,560
You don't have to say a number.

1459
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:09,800
Please.

1460
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:14,040
But was this an expensive experience to be on the floor?

1461
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:19,240
Or is it somehow cheaper on the floor because the seats are what you want if you want the show?

1462
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,360
Oh, I mean, I'll say it.

1463
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,760
It's certainly an indulgence of a ticket.

1464
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,920
It's $250 for a ticket.

1465
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:25,720
Yeah.

1466
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,040
So just the price of one postcard from Earth.

1467
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,240
But that's not so great.

1468
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,920
For something that is like top tier, do you have any idea what seats are?

1469
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,600
Or is that just the price of everything?

1470
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:42,280
The cheapest ticket is the top level for 140, probably 160 or 70 after.

1471
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:49,160
These are standard prices for any old act in a stadium at this point.

1472
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,520
Yeah, that's not a jaw dropper.

1473
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,000
It's crazy.

1474
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:56,120
I remember when I first, I saw Bruce Springsteen like 15 years ago or 10 years ago,

1475
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,760
and it was like, maybe it was a hundred and something.

1476
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,360
And then now it's all like 250.

1477
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,720
Like all these tickets have like tripled in cost.

1478
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:09,160
So I was shocked that those, the GA tickets, they're also doing a cool thing with the

1479
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:13,960
tickets, with the pit tickets where you can't resell them.

1480
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:18,200
If you can't go, you just put them back on Ticketmaster for a face.

1481
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:24,600
So if you check, which is how I got these, you just check and periodically you can get them

1482
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,440
and nobody can like put them on like StubHub.

1483
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,080
This is great.

1484
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,280
This whole, that's because the pretty cool concert ticket industry.

1485
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,800
Oh, it's so crazy.

1486
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,040
Yeah.

1487
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:34,440
Yeah.

1488
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,920
So I love if it's resetting some of that crap.

1489
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:41,400
So at least that area, not all of it, but just the pit area is like that.

1490
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:41,800
Wow.

1491
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:46,600
So that's like, it's weird because it's like, do you recommend, I kind of,

1492
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,680
if you really like hate U2, I guess you wouldn't want to spend this kind of money to go.

1493
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,520
I really like 90s U2.

1494
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,040
So obviously that made it much better.

1495
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:59,320
But yeah, if you're judging it against any other crazy Taylor Swift tickets, anything,

1496
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,960
it's like pretty much right, right there.

1497
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:02,840
Or better.

1498
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,600
I think you probably could gotten away with selling these for $500 each.

1499
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,800
Then maybe they'll start as we record this.

1500
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:14,280
They've just recently put, they've added many dates to this,

1501
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,160
indicating that at least this stint of it is going pretty great.

1502
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:23,080
And so what they'll, so they'll be doing this into early 2024 at least.

1503
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:23,240
Yeah.

1504
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,640
And they're getting, they're getting, the sphere is not making a ton of money on these shows

1505
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,560
because U2 is getting a nice deal.

1506
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:30,520
Yeah.

1507
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,000
Did I say this previously in any episode or in the live one?

1508
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:40,040
This is some of the, again, some of my spectacism is U2 gets 10 million up top.

1509
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,760
Then they get 90% of the concert sales.

1510
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:43,480
Wow.

1511
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,040
Yeah.

1512
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,400
That's again, the venue cost 2.3 billion.

1513
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:51,480
So now it's just a matter of how many flips without a Z they can sell.

1514
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,640
And I think they have a, they can like extend it to for two years, maybe if they wanted.

1515
01:15:56,280 --> 01:16:02,120
So they're definitely, I think like, well, the U2 will give us the buzz to get the other acts in.

1516
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:02,600
Yes.

1517
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,040
But now what?

1518
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,640
I mean, you used to, I'll let you know, say your two piece, but.

1519
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:12,440
I wonder, I wonder if part of it's like the next band or two are like, well, we want that deal.

1520
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:13,800
Yes.

1521
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:18,440
The deal with you, we read about the best deal that any bands ever gotten.

1522
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,080
Yeah.

1523
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,000
So I don't wonder if that is any factor.

1524
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:22,840
So yeah.

1525
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:28,600
So at that point, so yeah, like the iron walls, there's a helicopter that goes over this in the

1526
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,520
little hole in the ceiling, the fake hole.

1527
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,640
Oh, I didn't know that part.

1528
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:31,880
Yeah.

1529
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:37,720
So like when the show starts, I guess this is if U2 has landed in it from a helicopter there.

1530
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,760
And it looks, I mean, at that point, I think you know it's a screen,

1531
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,520
but still it looks pretty convincing.

1532
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,600
Cutting it a little close, aren't we guys?

1533
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,480
That's how they do it.

1534
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:46,680
You know.

1535
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,280
Let's be more prompt next time.

1536
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:48,520
Yeah.

1537
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:53,160
Uh, and then the band comes out and you're shocked at how close they are

1538
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,400
and how small this stage is for U2.

1539
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,760
I've seen U2 twice before.

1540
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:04,440
Once at the 360 tour, which was in the Rose Bowl at this like insane concoction of a stage.

1541
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:08,840
I don't know if you've ever seen this with like four posts and you could walk all the way around it

1542
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:12,360
in a color like a circle light that Bono swung from.

1543
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,080
I remember that.

1544
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:13,560
Yeah.

1545
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,480
And the black eyed peas opened for them.

1546
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:16,120
Sick.

1547
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:16,680
Yeah.

1548
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,680
So 2008.

1549
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,400
Yeah, that was about that.

1550
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,600
Not 2008.

1551
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,720
It was about 2008.

1552
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,360
2009.

1553
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,600
And I did see the Joshua Tree tour at the Rose Bowl, but that was more of a regular stage.

1554
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:33,480
So yeah, Bono comes out and he does some chanting or singing or whatever that he did on the ZOO TV

1555
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,040
tour.

1556
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:40,440
And then after he's done, he takes the glasses and he puts on the fly glasses.

1557
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,400
And here we go.

1558
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:43,960
He is the fly.

1559
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,920
He is back.

1560
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,320
And then the big like...

1561
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:47,960
What though?

1562
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,480
The fly is what?

1563
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,440
The whole album is the fly in it?

1564
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:52,600
Yeah.

1565
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,800
Well, that's one of the songs too.

1566
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,200
Yeah.

1567
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,480
It's one of the characters.

1568
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,360
One of the characters.

1569
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,480
Now I will say there's not much character stuff here.

1570
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,840
No mirror ball man?

1571
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,960
No mirror ball man.

1572
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,000
No McFisto.

1573
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,560
Bono wears like a white jacket at the end of the show, but he doesn't put on little

1574
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,360
devil ears.

1575
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,720
He doesn't do it.

1576
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,600
There's any criticism I have of the show, it's that.

1577
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,240
Is that he didn't do any of that.

1578
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,840
He focused on the visuals, whatever.

1579
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:24,200
So yeah, then they do ZOO Station.

1580
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,680
The first part of ZOO Station, the song is like...

1581
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:34,120
And then it's like chipping away at the iron wall and then it'll drop and the whole

1582
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:38,680
thing opens up to be this big TV wall that looks like the old tour.

1583
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:47,080
And what's cool also is they're integrating live video from the stage into the graphics

1584
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:47,720
on the screen.

1585
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,000
Other times they'll go by in bubbles and stuff.

1586
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,160
You can present them in a lot of funny ways.

1587
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,480
You could star wipe things if you wanted.

1588
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,280
You could do live stuff like that.

1589
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,280
So yeah, Bono is on a little road.

1590
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:06,120
Brian Eno made up the stage and really the stage is just like a turntable and it turns.

1591
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,120
Which is cool looking, but...

1592
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,000
It's weird in the visuals though that it is this tiny stage.

1593
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,360
It's very off putting seeing no amps and no lights.

1594
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,400
Almost no lights.

1595
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,600
It is off puttingly minimal.

1596
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,640
It is weird and it almost seems like it's fake or they're pretending.

1597
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,960
U2 is one of those bands that does a weird thing where they have other musicians that

1598
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:26,440
are hidden.

1599
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:27,640
Really?

1600
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:28,140
Yeah.

1601
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:28,600
Oh.

1602
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:36,280
So some of the synth or string parts, the real U2 heads know these people's names are

1603
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:40,520
one or two people and they're under the stage playing for Streets of Oden.

1604
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:43,960
They want to keep the stage picture of the four guys for whatever reason.

1605
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,160
They're liars.

1606
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:47,660
Yes.

1607
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:48,680
I don't know.

1608
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,200
I'm not...

1609
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,040
I don't know that they have to do that.

1610
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,000
How many people you think?

1611
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,360
I don't know.

1612
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,400
At least one.

1613
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,200
If not two.

1614
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,960
I got five hours playing violins and tubas.

1615
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:05,480
Maybe it's the whole James Dolan band under there helping out.

1616
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,280
JD and the Strait Shouter down there.

1617
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,040
I know you're going to need the backup guys.

1618
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,720
If you need me, just say the word A and I'll throw in the straight shot for free.

1619
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,200
I got my axe with me.

1620
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:18,840
I'll jump in.

1621
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,040
Edge falls off stage.

1622
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,520
I'll be there.

1623
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,560
I won't even miss a note.

1624
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,480
You know every night he's like, you need a guy?

1625
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,320
You need a guy to play?

1626
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,960
Just stand on the trap door.

1627
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,080
Just move a little.

1628
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,880
If Edge gets hurt, you know I'm there.

1629
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,240
I got the button.

1630
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,840
I got the reverb pedal.

1631
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,600
I know the delay in the reverb.

1632
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,640
I know how to do it.

1633
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,160
I got the album on my iPhones.

1634
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:46,920
I know the songs.

1635
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,200
I've been practicing the backup vocals too.

1636
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:50,920
Dear Will, listen.

1637
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,880
He's just sending voice memos on his phone to Bono.

1638
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,680
Pretty good, huh?

1639
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,000
Calling the name.

1640
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,920
James, those automatically delete after you've listened to them.

1641
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:08,840
Do you know that?

1642
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,280
Damn Aura should have warned me.

1643
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,240
I got a live-in robot and she didn't say nothing.

1644
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:15,880
Hey, Bram.

1645
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,840
Bram, can you put in a word for me, Bram?

1646
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,760
The guys don't like me as much.

1647
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,160
Seems like they're open to new guys, right?

1648
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,400
If they let you in, Bram, right, Bram?

1649
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,160
You have Bono's ear, right, Bram?

1650
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:28,120
Bram.

1651
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,280
Come on, Bram.

1652
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,760
All right, Seiko, you're my last best hope.

1653
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,280
Send you out into the parking lot and act like you're walking by.

1654
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,960
You just happen to run into them.

1655
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,200
Maybe it'll happen.

1656
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,000
I don't know.

1657
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,280
They have a pretty set.

1658
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:49,880
They changed some of the songs around in the middle, but they play all of Octane Baby.

1659
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:54,920
They don't play it in order on the album, which I guess that's fine.

1660
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:58,120
I kind of like it when they do the album the way it was structured,

1661
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:02,040
but I understand it's not necessarily the best live way if they feel the energy's off.

1662
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,400
So I don't know.

1663
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,160
I don't have to go through every song or anything, but the highlights I'm sure a lot of people have

1664
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,960
seen on social media is that first Zootv part and then the second song they play.

1665
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:19,480
And that's when you get another throwback to Zootv with all these words, outrage, cancel culture.

1666
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,480
It's so funny.

1667
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:27,080
Part of it, I like it, is because it's so self-serious, but also it thinks it's...

1668
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:34,360
Octane Baby era, you two, to me, they think they're not being as serious as they were in the 80s,

1669
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:38,360
and they're not quite being as serious, but they're still very serious.

1670
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:38,860
Yeah.

1671
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,480
As not particularly a fan, I'm put off, but yeah, this word wall.

1672
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,240
This is what we're doing now with 30 years later.

1673
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,400
It's just a much bigger word wall.

1674
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:56,200
Yes, but that song has the maybe the coolest thing in the whole show,

1675
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,360
which is the big colorful number.

1676
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,320
That's the same song?

1677
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,040
That's the same song.

1678
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:00,760
Oh boy.

1679
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,960
And you've seen this.

1680
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,160
I've seen the numbers.

1681
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,200
This is the mic drop.

1682
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,880
And all of a sudden, yeah, so all of a sudden you get very...

1683
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,160
What would you call those numbers?

1684
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,200
Very old school computer style digits.

1685
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,080
Oh, I don't know the right thing.

1686
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:13,800
You know what I'm saying though?

1687
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,720
And they're all one color, they change colors.

1688
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,720
All of a sudden a few of them change colors.

1689
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:25,960
And then in the middle, the bridge part of it or the middle interlude section of the song,

1690
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:31,480
the numbers are climbing to the point of making the ceiling seem like it's

1691
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,440
three times the height that you previously thought it was.

1692
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:39,480
And then all of a sudden the whole thing comes crashing down almost like a trash compactor

1693
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,600
of numbers on the sides and the ceiling.

1694
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,560
So if you're even looking at it in videos from the right angle,

1695
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,000
it looks like you're in a cube now.

1696
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,120
Which is like...

1697
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:49,960
It changes the shape of the amp.

1698
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,080
It changes the shape of the place.

1699
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,000
Shut me up.

1700
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,120
I mean, it's cool.

1701
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:54,680
It's really cool.

1702
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,280
It's really, really cool.

1703
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:01,160
And also makes you think like, okay, this is the potential for this in some other ways.

1704
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:06,040
Where you can do stuff like this for an even more ambitious show.

1705
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,800
Yeah, they do that.

1706
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,840
An Escher painting with like 10,000 levels.

1707
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,340
Sure.

1708
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,800
The biggest Where's Waldo?

1709
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,600
That ever was.

1710
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,800
Wow, Where's Waldo Live?

1711
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,680
Yeah, whoa.

1712
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,760
And if you get it, your ticket is free.

1713
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:23,260
Yeah.

1714
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:31,080
So at this point, especially like, there's an argument to be made that sitting in like

1715
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,360
the very expensive, like probably thousand dollar seats in the right place,

1716
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,440
you get the full picture of everything.

1717
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:41,000
But I would say for the seat or the standing room that costs a quarter,

1718
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:46,200
I almost liked feeling like I was going to get crushed by the numbers.

1719
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:50,200
Like the whole thing was very overwhelming in a way where you're like looking at the

1720
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,960
band, but then you're looking up and it really like you could, if you didn't look at the floor,

1721
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:58,920
you would kind of forget that you were in a building that was on earth.

1722
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,480
Wow.

1723
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:02,520
So like that, and then especially the next song,

1724
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:07,320
which has like a crazy almost, I think somewhat AI created,

1725
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:11,080
bizarre gold, like you know what I'm talking about?

1726
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:18,680
Like really complex, super like, I mean, it's somewhat reminiscent of like Kanye power type,

1727
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,080
like really, really hyper designed.

1728
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:26,440
Yes. And like, uh, uh, there's a weird stuff that I really can't explain this thing,

1729
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:31,320
like, and then this thing rotated almost like a hamster wheel,

1730
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:37,000
which made you feel like the whole building was turning in a crazy way.

1731
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,600
You know, it really looks like the Michael Jackson Dangerous album cover.

1732
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,080
Yeah.

1733
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,680
Times 10,000.

1734
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:49,000
Yes, it does. Now, if you look in this bizarre thing, you will find, and I did not send this to

1735
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:55,320
you, you will find a clip from American beauty. You will find this.

1736
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,600
A lady doing like a yoga pose.

1737
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,520
Is that from Showgirls?

1738
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,560
Oh, it is. Oh, oh, oh yeah.

1739
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,240
So there's a weird hidden.

1740
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,320
What's from American beauty in it?

1741
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:12,200
I don't, is it Minas, it looks like Minas Uvari, like one of the fantasy sequences.

1742
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,240
That's, oh no.

1743
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,040
I thought we've moved on from this pop culture.

1744
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:20,680
I thought so too. And I don't know, but that's certainly from Showgirls.

1745
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,960
That purple top.

1746
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,600
So there's a bunch of weird, like this, like Riviera.

1747
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,000
There's a lot of Elvis talk in this show.

1748
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,440
Hell yeah. Relevant. Interesting.

1749
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,840
Yeah. There's like.

1750
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,360
The legend. We have to, we have to address the legend in the room.

1751
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,280
Yeah. He does say shit like that.

1752
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,880
I mean, yeah, in Vegas, you kind of have to, at least there was.

1753
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:42,380
Do you?

1754
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,960
They love it in Vegas. I'm not saying you have to.

1755
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:50,200
They love it in Vegas. And at least it was just a giant hit movie out.

1756
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,720
Yes, you're right. And a giant hit cartoon show, right boys?

1757
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,240
Remember?

1758
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,120
Did it come out?

1759
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:56,920
It came out.

1760
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,720
Oh really?

1761
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,200
Yeah. The cartoon where Matthew McConaughey is the voice of Elvis.

1762
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:00,680
I remember that.

1763
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,760
Yes, it was released. We all know it.

1764
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:07,080
I was told the thing I pitched wasn't going because of that, but that's all I remember.

1765
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:07,580
Sounds right.

1766
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:12,360
So yeah, so there's this, that thing makes you feel like you're going to fall over maybe if

1767
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,400
you stared at it too long. And then there's.

1768
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:19,480
Was anything ever too much or was it just, was it all like right on?

1769
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:20,920
Elated the whole time.

1770
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,640
What about the animal wall? You haven't mentioned the animal wall.

1771
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,920
Well, that's at the end of the show. I'm trying to just get some highlights here real quick.

1772
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:27,960
I keep jumping ahead.

1773
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,120
Because I understand you can find all this. You're going to find this.

1774
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:34,440
There's a weird point where there's like Kennedy and the rocket launch or whatever.

1775
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:34,940
And then.

1776
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:35,560
Oh yes.

1777
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:42,520
I love the sentry being condensed for me anywhere that can happen.

1778
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,840
And then you're like, and I remember we're like, what is this?

1779
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:51,800
I hope the next act is fallout boy doing their new, we didn't start the fire with visuals.

1780
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,080
Let's get a fallout boy in there.

1781
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:56,440
They announced blink 182 is playing sofi like next year. And I was like, wow,

1782
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:59,400
blink can sell out sofi I guess. So put blink in the sphere.

1783
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:00,860
Sure.

1784
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:03,320
Move the when we were young festival.

1785
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:03,820
Yeah.

1786
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:04,520
To the sphere.

1787
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:10,440
Sure. I'm on for that. So there was the song until the end of the world, they're playing,

1788
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,760
there was a lightning storm in there. That was pretty cool.

1789
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,400
The lightning would strike during the chorus.

1790
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:22,280
At this point in the show, the fog happens and there's some heavy fog and we were right

1791
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:27,800
by the machines. I think I said in a video of like hiss, like probably the immersion was broken a

1792
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,640
little bit because of the hiss of the fog machines.

1793
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:33,560
But it's right where you were there in hot season. So it made you feel right at home.

1794
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,060
That's true.

1795
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,160
Your fog hiss.

1796
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,680
And yeah, at this point there's like a burning flag in the middle of the desert that shoots up

1797
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:48,520
and they're basically like giving you like fire effects from the fog,

1798
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,960
which I'm sure would look even better from a little bit of a distance.

1799
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:52,760
That's worth it.

1800
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,640
Not just being to sit there.

1801
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,160
That's fine. Be close to it.

1802
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:03,400
And then who's going to ride your wild horses highlight because it's just

1803
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:09,080
raining embers in the sphere while you see all four of them playing.

1804
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,680
So detailed.

1805
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:14,040
You know what's nuts about it is you're showing these phone videos and I've seen a lot of phone

1806
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:21,080
videos and you're like, how is it conveyed? Anybody could just without any correction or

1807
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:25,000
adjustment, film it on their phone as is and it looks super cool.

1808
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,840
Yeah, I was wondering if it was going to show up. And then during,

1809
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:34,360
oh shoot, I forget exactly which song it was, but all of a sudden there's the whole place just goes

1810
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:39,560
blue. It's crazy because just like they can change the lights. It can be feel like daytime

1811
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:44,040
in there all of a sudden. Like you can do really it really seeing the concert, you're just like,

1812
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,640
oh, it's scratched the surface of this place in a lot of ways where you're like,

1813
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:50,760
cause like all of a sudden just one song, it's just there it's blue in there.

1814
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,600
It's just this odd blue.

1815
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,160
Yeah.

1816
01:29:53,160 --> 01:30:01,080
And then slowly but surely like different bugs, like shadows of bugs as if there's giant bugs on

1817
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:08,520
the outside of the sphere have landed and died. And there's, they slowly happen. They slowly appear

1818
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:17,080
while the song is going on. And I was like, this is nuts. This is creepy as hell. And it would kind

1819
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:21,240
of come back later with the, what you're talking about the animal wall. But then yeah, they did,

1820
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:26,840
they did the rest of Octon Baby. They do sort of a quiet set with, they can change up the songs,

1821
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:30,280
some old songs and they just do it kind of acoustic. But that's where I was like,

1822
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:35,960
this is just projecting them playing and the music, the audio sounds amazing. You probably

1823
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:40,600
could just bring people in for a couple of dates and be worth it to go to the spheres to see them

1824
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,160
projected.

1825
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:46,520
Question. Does you, do you fit, does it ever feel like not enough, like too minimal if they aren't

1826
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,240
using the full?

1827
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:50,760
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe people would be let down, but I don't know. You,

1828
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,160
you could give them like a generic video package.

1829
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:58,840
Yeah, I think you're going to have to start doing, yeah, background walls, like come with our photo

1830
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:03,960
booths on our Apple products. Wow. A bunch of balloons, a waterfall.

1831
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:09,640
So Don Henley is playing in there and then like the toaster screensaver is playing behind him.

1832
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:16,680
I did see specula, the names I had heard rumored of like, well, this is who could be fit. Like

1833
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:23,000
Eagles are playing some dates around the Superbowl because the Superbowl is at a Legion stadium

1834
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,920
in Vegas. And they're like, could the Eagles do a super show?

1835
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:34,360
Fail. F idea. If the next thing is Eagles, this place is fucked. That is not, I've been thinking

1836
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:42,440
this so hard that like the, whoever is next has to be a generation down or even if fucking Dolan

1837
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:46,680
just plugs his asshole buddies in there, this place is screwed.

1838
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:52,360
Okay. I don't have any insider info. It was merely they're playing some Vegas dates. They

1839
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:56,360
know James Dolan, they're on a farewell tour. Sure. Sure. Sure. So we kind of added up

1840
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:02,200
Harry Styles was the other name of like, well, he's sold some big stadiums recently.

1841
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:08,600
Fish is rumored. I think the feeling with fish might be fun. Well, the feeling with fish is that

1842
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:13,960
fish is lighting and all the stuff they do has to be sort of improvised along with the band because

1843
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:19,000
Hey, they may jam for 25 minutes on a song. They may jam for 35 minutes. Oh, they can't be locked

1844
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,440
in. They can't be locked in. So they have to figure out a way to do it. That isn't just sort

1845
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:28,360
of a show like you two is doing. So that's a timed show. So if they can do that, they can do it.

1846
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:33,800
If it's a small parking lot, you can't really tailgate, you know, can't tailgate for the fish

1847
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:38,200
show. They haven't figured out the smoking lounge is yet in Vegas either. They're getting open.

1848
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:43,640
You go to the tilted kilp by the link. You can pregame for a fish show. It's open.

1849
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:49,080
Don't you think the fish is like fish can't play like three months though.

1850
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:55,720
These the fish people are intense. Yeah, I know they're massive. I don't know. They'll do,

1851
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:00,280
you know, they'll do a giant venue for three nights. But like, if you don't think like what's

1852
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:07,800
the amount that you two is doing? Can fish do even like 10% of that? I think that if you give

1853
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:13,480
people enough time that the there will be like fish people will come. I know if you say this is

1854
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:18,360
what is going to be doing this year. I think fish people will come and do a week of shows or more.

1855
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:22,440
I know multiple they could do for sure. I just don't know if they're like, I don't think they do

1856
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:29,720
three months of fish. I know multiple people who have traveled. Yes. Everyone's correct. Yes. But

1857
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:34,360
I'm saying a couple nights of Madison's garden does not equal three nights, three months of the

1858
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:39,400
sphere. Well, I would, but I would argue that in some ways it does because Vegas is such a traveling

1859
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:45,960
city that if you're a man who can fill up 20,000 seats a couple nights in a row in a major city,

1860
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:51,880
that's indicative of having an audience that might travel to see a crazier version of your show.

1861
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:57,480
Sure. And the elevation of it being sphere. Yeah. So I don't know if they could do a year of it,

1862
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:03,800
but I think I got a solid enough run. I think you've got enough people that are coming. Yeah. For

1863
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:10,440
a couple months. I could be, you gotta be sad that your boy Buffett will never know the pleasure

1864
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:17,720
to see an 18 K big spinning cheeseburger. I know. Or we'll just even just, they put like a,

1865
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:22,280
have it like be on the water and make everybody get seasick while the show's going. Like,

1866
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:26,520
I think like kind of that thing when you're in a boat, having everybody feel like that,

1867
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:32,280
they're doing the show at sea. Some of those clips were making me a little seasick. I feel like.

1868
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:36,920
From the sphere? Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if that will, it didn't happen to you,

1869
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:42,520
but I wonder if it'll happen to anybody. Yeah, probably. Maybe. But I would think it might

1870
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:48,360
happen more on the floor because you're in such a weird angle. Sure. But yeah, it's way up behind

1871
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,800
you. You're craning your head all the way up. But like, you could see, I mean, you could see all the

1872
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:56,760
things like all of a sudden, yeah, all of a sudden we're in the desert. It's lit up. The sun comes

1873
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:02,200
out. It's like just, it's insane because it feels just like you're actually watching the sun. Yeah.

1874
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:09,160
That's really. Yeah. Rise. Yeah. And then yeah, during where the streets have no name,

1875
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:14,680
all of a sudden there is some sphere lore here because really that's the sphere. All of a sudden

1876
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:20,600
you're in an area of like a desert with some water and there's a big sphere that's like approaching

1877
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:26,360
you as the song goes on. Wow. That's the character of the sphere. Yeah. So the sphere appears

1878
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:31,560
and then you're in the ocean with the sphere. And then at the big, whoa, whoa, part is when this

1879
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:36,920
crazy thing happens that truly could make you feel dizzy, which is why, like basically the sphere

1880
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:42,440
opens up in these like layers of, I don't know what do you even call them. It's basically like,

1881
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:49,960
it looks like a fractals. Fractal. Kind of. It looks almost like some sort of carvings of

1882
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:54,760
animal. Like somebody did intricate carvings of animals in a piece of, I don't know, wood or

1883
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:59,240
something like light wood. And now there's like layers opening up the sphere opens up and now the

1884
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:06,440
whole place is like this big art piece now of all these different like carving, like animal carvings

1885
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:11,960
essentially. And I've been saying, this is one that I've maybe haven't gotten my head around fully

1886
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:17,160
is that the finale of this is a big animal. I think there's some, I feel like I read somewhere

1887
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:21,160
it was like, these are endangered species or something. There's some version of that.

1888
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:27,320
From the Nevada area. But then there's like, well, Eva pointed out, there's a lot of snakes,

1889
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:32,760
a bunch of big snakes on the wall and then big bugs. I don't think I get this aspect of it.

1890
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:37,320
Maybe should I get it in that it's weird that you seem to be liking that it's weird. I do like it.

1891
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:42,680
Yeah. It's not the cleanest thing you've ever, but I think of the majesty of the animal wall is a

1892
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:47,960
little lost on me. I mean, you think I would get it in person? Yeah. Cause it's looks crazy in person.

1893
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:51,240
You go, yeah, I don't know exactly. I don't know if I'm getting the message here, but boy,

1894
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:57,400
it's fun to look at. Like, which is, uh, yeah, that happens a lot. So, uh, no, I'm not saying I

1895
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:02,520
completely understand the subtleties of, of the message necessarily, but they sang beautiful day.

1896
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:08,680
I mean, they did look, we were, when we did our Mr. McPhisto episode, we were joking around about

1897
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:13,160
elevation. I'm on such a high at this point, they do elevation and I'm like, elevation is one of the

1898
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:17,800
best songs I've ever heard. Like we're all like hopping up and down during elevation. I'm like,

1899
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:23,320
yeah, this is great. They do beautiful day. Uh, uh, they did vertigo, which is not my favorite song,

1900
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:29,240
but I'm like, this rocks vertigo rocks. And they, yeah, they, they send everybody home.

1901
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,400
Lindsay, you said was not, is not like the biggest YouTube fan, but she was pretty blown away.

1902
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:37,960
I said, I said to her a couple of days before we go, I go, you want to go to this, right? Like,

1903
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:43,560
yeah. Now I don't think I was being a little bit annoying maybe of like, okay, they're going to

1904
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:48,120
probably do this, this, like I was not trying to give her homework or anything, but her general

1905
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:52,120
apathy toward you too made me go, well, I don't mind. You could go do something else if you want.

1906
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:58,200
Get a massage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So no, she's like, no, I want to go. And as soon as the

1907
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:03,240
sphere started, she was going insane. She'd be like, but I was right there. It's Pano. And I go,

1908
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:07,640
yeah, you don't even care about him two days ago. I know, but like, but he's like,

1909
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:12,280
and like, she was like a little too into Bono, like a little too, like she's like, I understand.

1910
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:16,840
I get it. Oh, whisper to me Bono. And she was like, he's right there. I can't believe I just

1911
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:20,520
never thought I would be this close to you too before. And she's like streets have no net,

1912
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:24,440
like showing that streets, like the big hits and stuff too. Cause I was like, I was like, well,

1913
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:29,080
you know, if you want to be prepared, you could listen to a lot of baby and here's my couple

1914
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:33,640
favorite songs and whatever. And she's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. All right. But then we

1915
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:37,240
got there and she was like, yeah. And then I was like, I was like, yeah, they're extending the tour.

1916
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:42,600
She's like, let's go back. Let's go to you too. Do you think you might? I don't, it's expensive. So

1917
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:48,200
probably not, but mom and dad did also part of it. It's like mom and dad got to go and do a thing.

1918
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:55,560
This was your first trip. Well, no, second trip, very quick trip for a wedding without the baby.

1919
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:01,160
So yeah, but this was a still pretty quick, but yeah, this was also mom. That one was without the

1920
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:07,000
baby and without the Bono. So this was a lot more special. The baby second father, second father,

1921
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,960
and only one name Bono. Yeah. Lindsay, I thought Lindsay was going to be more taken with Bram,

1922
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:16,920
but she was taken with Bono because Bram's the young gun there. This is the big, like, I think,

1923
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:21,880
I think something that's been holding me back from Sphere is that I'm not rooting for anybody

1924
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:26,360
because Dolan's the worst. And then at the end of the first night, Bono's shouting out all these

1925
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:33,480
people and of course, oving A's off. I'm like, boo, boo, corrupts Eagles manager to ticket master,

1926
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:39,720
kingpin asshole. Yeah. Fucking hate him. Sure. And then I just, you know, I'm sorry, some listeners

1927
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:45,400
will be mad. It is a valid opinion that other people have that Bono is kind of like a blowhard.

1928
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:50,120
This is kind of how I've always felt. He would say that himself. Cheeky wink, wink, but also he does

1929
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:56,600
the character that I am. So I've just, I've, I've never, I've just never had the, so my questions

1930
01:39:56,600 --> 01:40:03,240
are like, do you think somehow it would bring me into the U2 experience? I kind of, I, I don't know

1931
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:09,800
that I would, I would like put all the money I have on it, but part of me does think that it would be

1932
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:16,840
almost impossible not to at least enjoy some of it. Yeah. Cause I also, I still think Octon Baby,

1933
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:22,920
as far as an album, it's definitely more in the vein of like love will tear us apart. And like,

1934
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:29,800
it's not quite the same vibe of where the streets have no name that feels so self important. And as

1935
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:35,720
I said, like a secular hymn, when things become anthems, I rebel. I get a little like, don't tell

1936
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:40,760
me that this is the most important piece of music. I think that's what Lindsay was feeling to like,

1937
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:45,400
and again, I like 90s U2 the best, but like by the time we got to where the streets have no names,

1938
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:52,040
she was like, yeah. Like, like, so I almost think if, look, if mom and dad got out to Vegas,

1939
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:57,400
you have a nice meal before you have a drink or two before you get on there, there's a DJ,

1940
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:04,440
you're standing around the air, by the way, cool is like the breeze in there is nice. It's not hot.

1941
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:09,480
That's nice. And the desert, the battery. We were around about like a bunch of like, I would say

1942
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:15,400
middle aged ladies just like letting it loose with dancing. Like, like the vibe on the floor was very

1943
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:21,000
good. And the effects are very cool. And you were a little logy because that nice meal was at the

1944
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:27,160
Caesar's food court chicken guy. No, and then you hopped in a lift. Oh, no. You got to treat your

1945
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:32,040
lady right. Eight on a Vegas weekend. We went to, we ate across from the Tilted Kilt at a barbecue

1946
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:38,840
restaurant. Oh, okay. That's pretty good. That barbecue. Yeah, I don't know. I, I think I,

1947
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:45,000
it would be hard to hate it being there. I don't think I would hate it, but I think on some level,

1948
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,680
you would appreciate it. Whether you became a big Octagon baby fan or not, I don't know, but

1949
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:55,080
this might transcend. There's those tours where it's like, I don't think it matters that you're,

1950
01:41:55,080 --> 01:42:00,040
if you're a huge fan of the music, it's, it might just still. Yeah. I just, everybody there was,

1951
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:07,240
everybody there seemed just elated. Everybody seems so happy to watch it and to be there. And

1952
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:14,600
yeah. So I don't, it's still expensive, but I would say like, I bet it's cool on $140 seats too,

1953
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:20,840
but like, you may as well pay the extra hundred and be very close to the band. Cause even as,

1954
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:26,440
even for historical significance, you're like, well, I saw that they're very extremely important,

1955
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:33,720
but yeah. Who else plays here? This is the big question. This is a big question. I, my Eagles

1956
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:38,920
anger. I don't even that like I've even come, there's an Eagles song or two I'm okay with,

1957
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:45,160
but like the, they just, they can't, they can't, they have to head towards the future. It's gotta

1958
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:52,280
be. And I had a couple other, I have some very realistic pitches of who I think will end up in

1959
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:57,800
there. And I don't think these are good either. I think both of these are like, well, we have not

1960
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:02,920
upped the game. I mean, you know, I don't know what they would do visually, but when I say both of

1961
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:08,360
these, I think you will know, you will feel like, oh yeah, of course. And maybe not in the best way.

1962
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:15,160
Yeah. One of them Coldplay. Yes. I think that's, but if you heard it was Coldplay next, wouldn't

1963
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:22,760
you go like, Oh, my gosh. Well, look, I, I have not listened to a Coldplay album in many years,

1964
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:28,520
but I don't hate Coldplay. And if I was in Vegas, I don't hate Coldplay. I'm just saying it would be

1965
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:34,120
a little bit of a step down. That being said, Coldplay seems like they're doing, you've seen

1966
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:38,760
the wrist, the light, the wrist things that light up now that all these concerts, like the big

1967
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:44,200
stadium concerts are doing. Does that come with your, when they let you in, do they give you that?

1968
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:48,600
Generally, yes. Taylor Swift. Yeah. I think that, yeah. But Taylor Swift had it. I thought it was

1969
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:53,640
part of the friendship bracelet continuity. No, no, it's not. That's different. You just get that

1970
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:58,520
when you walk in and Coldplay does that. And I saw some videos from some Coldplay stadium shows

1971
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:02,520
and it's like, Oh, that looks, whether you like this, whether you like clocks or not,

1972
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:08,120
this looks insane to see the whole arena. It would bring something. So I kind of think maybe that

1973
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:13,640
would be fun, but okay. I'll let you finish your list. And then I have a thought on this. This one,

1974
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:16,680
I think might show you a little more than that one. All right. Maroon five.

1975
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:23,320
Ha! If that doesn't- If it's that, wouldn't you go like, all right, they don't mean business,

1976
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:29,480
do they? Yeah. I mean, that doesn't, that also doesn't seem like it lends itself to the

1977
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:34,120
audio visual as much as Coldplay. I don't think so either, but I feel like-

1978
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:38,760
It's not- This is my fear is these kinds of, and again, I'm not saying this is the worst band in

1979
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:42,040
the world. I'm just like- Yeah, I'm less enthused about that. I think it's got, I don't, I don't

1980
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:49,400
know what exactly my ideals are. I'm not like, one that comes to mind is like, well, wouldn't

1981
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:54,520
that be good? And I'm not specifically such a huge fan, but you know that it would be elevated if

1982
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:59,960
like Lady Gaga was the next, because maybe she creates, she like-

1983
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:04,680
Does a weird thing. Really crafts this experience. And it's a little more exciting than-

1984
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:09,960
The problem I think with this is going to be, and maybe I'm wrong. The problem is that this place

1985
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:17,720
only fits 18,000 or 20,000 people. So I think the issue is going to be money, because when Paul

1986
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:24,760
McCartney goes out, he plays stadiums that are like a hundred thousand people. So, and a lot of

1987
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:31,720
these big acts that would need to have the fan base to sustain it play bigger places in this.

1988
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:35,560
Yeah. You can all day, you could go like Taylor Swift would be good and that, well, she's not

1989
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:39,960
going to do that. She has every incentive to not do Sphere. Right. So the problem is,

1990
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:44,760
even McCartney I think could do a cool show here, but he's-

1991
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:52,200
How is it better than touring? And why does he need to make an 18K video with snakes and bugs?

1992
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:55,320
No. I don't think he has to, I don't think that's his deal. He doesn't have to do that.

1993
01:45:55,320 --> 01:46:02,120
Here's one that I, Coldplay made me think of this, because I feel like I always heard them,

1994
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:09,560
I feel like I got to know them as like, oh, they're the like smart guys called Play,

1995
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:14,520
which is Radiohead. That one occurred to me as a, what would get me there? That would be amazing.

1996
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:19,000
That would be amazing. They, I feel like- It would be like edgier. Edgier is maybe what

1997
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I'm looking for. What you don't want to end up with is why it can't be Eagles is because then

1998
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:29,080
it's just going to be the, what's behind them? A big hotel California sign through the desert.

1999
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:34,280
You know no one in the Eagles gives a shit about what's behind-

2000
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:37,160
No. Yeah, somebody in the organization has to care.

2001
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:41,160
You two care. You two, whether they've made a good album in the last 20 years or not,

2002
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:45,000
does care I think in a lot of ways.

2003
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,480
They've done some very interesting visual stuff with music.

2004
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:53,720
Coldplay has done some really interesting videos and installations.

2005
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:56,920
But yeah, the Eagles, they don't give a fuck about any of that nonsense.

2006
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:00,200
The one that I keep flashing that Aaron keeps bringing up is like, oh you know you got to

2007
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:05,960
get in there is Boston. Because Boston we saw one time at the forum and what was behind them was

2008
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:12,600
just like stock footage, film like from a jet going through a canyon and that'd be for one song

2009
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:17,000
and then it would just keep rolling into the next song and the next song. Just kind of like

2010
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:23,480
okay quality footage. So he keeps saying, hey get that jet footage, get Boston in there. Which I

2011
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:28,520
we're kind of worried that like what if that is Dolan's move? I know Boston, I'll get Boston in

2012
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:35,240
there. Yeah. I wonder if there's any sort of exclusivity because like maybe it's like you

2013
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:40,200
could get some bands to do like you know the way the Park MGM brings in Bruno Mars for like two

2014
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:47,240
weekends a month. Yeah. Like there's some like the economics of that and like it maybe makes sense

2015
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:53,400
because the audience is refreshed because it's a fresh batch of tourists. So I don't know if you

2016
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:58,680
can have your Boston one weekend, you can have the Eagles the next weekend and then Maroon 5 the

2017
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:03,400
next. Like I don't know if that's how they have it structured. But yeah I think the problem is just

2018
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:08,760
going to be it's going to have each ticket is going to have to cost four times what U2 costs

2019
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:16,200
to entice a McCartney or somebody to do it unless they really are excited about the visuals. Yeah.

2020
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:24,600
So if you're ready marketing it to bands that play 20,000 seats in cities then that they're going to

2021
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:29,480
want to do it but they might not have the audience that you they're not going to have the audience

2022
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:34,600
that U2 does to bring people back unless the show is just something amazing everybody talks about

2023
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:38,920
and it transcends the band itself. It does feel. Bring it all-star band. Bring it all-star yeah

2024
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:44,520
yeah absolutely. Well because you could do you could imagine seeing the octopus's garden in 18k.

2025
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:49,240
Every deed to every speckle on that starfish. Yeah that's right and then

2026
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:55,400
Lukather does a couple tunes. I wouldn't come back. It is a spin and I've even like you know because

2027
01:48:55,400 --> 01:49:00,040
on that text we were talking about who's your ultimate sphere band and I'm like I don't like

2028
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:05,240
it's still a tough question that makes you want to just say your favorite band but like yeah I don't

2029
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:12,600
know I like I'm not sure what sphere adds to a lot of stuff that I love. Kiss. It's confusing.

2030
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:19,080
Yes. I don't know it could be like demons and shit. I don't know. Kiss just did a dress one. I think Paul

2031
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:23,080
Stanley or somebody was like I don't think it's happening I don't think anytime soon I don't know

2032
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:30,360
why that is. Oh okay. But this is a retiring tour. They're retiring tour. What's that? Oh if you can get all the members of the Wutang

2033
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:37,160
clan. Oh yeah I guess sure. They've done cool visual stuff yeah. I think you gotta go hip I mean the sad

2034
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:44,360
thing is that I like I think we all know a very good candidate for this would have been Kanye.

2035
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:53,160
But Kanye is kind of beyond the point. I don't know what's gonna happen. He should not be projecting images onto a phone much less a sphere.

2036
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:58,840
That's true. Yes because we've I've I've we saw one of his crazy tours and I've seen another

2037
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:03,480
creative of his crazy tours. That was an example of like I don't know every song but I was so blown

2038
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:10,920
away by it so I think you'd be he'd actually he would have been good at that. I agree. When he was only

2039
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:19,960
80% out of his mind. Yes. Not 340%. Yeah there there might be some people sort of on the cusp of what I'm

2040
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:26,280
talking about with audience size that like will do it if they give them the right deal and maybe

2041
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:31,800
yeah maybe the idea is just keep the bands coming in to break even on the sphere while you develop

2042
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:38,440
new postcards from earth type things or orchestra shows or other weird things I'm not even thinking

2043
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:44,440
about and fully program it and like have a lot of different programming. You know who no kidding

2044
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:52,520
occurred to me like a month ago and and the month has not been kind to this idea Danny Elfman. Oh man

2045
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:58,600
yeah you're right but yeah well he's still playing the bowl as of today. I can't cancel anything.

2046
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:08,360
In sync is getting back together. That was Erin's answer. In sync and I'm there. It's not a bad idea.

2047
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:13,480
They're gonna need a little bit of help to take things back to the beginning of the episode.

2048
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:19,960
The Eat to the Beat. I saw an Eat to the Beat clip of Fatone and Lance Bass that was like yeah maybe

2049
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:27,560
a giant video wall would be good. That might help you out here. Well Justin's in the news too lately.

2050
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:33,880
Oh no right. Oh boy. My entire sphere candidates list has gone away one by one. Certainly

2051
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:38,520
bring Dragon Sync out in the desert a couple times a month. I think that's probably

2052
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:47,960
people will go to that. Madonna. Yeah yeah. Snooze. You gotta go. I swear the next act has to be

2053
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:55,400
popular mainly from 2000 and beyond. I think this is very important to the survival of the space so

2054
01:51:55,400 --> 01:52:01,160
that it doesn't become Dolan's Roadies. They're Oldies Roadhouse. You know what I mean? Like

2055
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:09,400
maybe Billy Joel could do it. We could put up a photo of a big peony. The person who could do it

2056
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:15,400
and I think she said I don't want to perform anytime soon. I'm not up for it. It is Britney Spears.

2057
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:21,480
Yeah. Could fill those seats but she already did a Vegas residency and I don't think has fond

2058
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:27,480
memories of a lot of it. She might be touring. I don't know. I'm not sure. So yeah I think

2059
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:33,320
I think the economics of it I think is the thing that's going to be hard because I think that

2060
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:38,760
you're not going to for the cheap cheap price of $250 I don't think that's going to work

2061
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:44,120
for some of these other acts if you're going to be that close. So I don't know. I think it's yeah I

2062
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:49,880
think the money lies in stuff like I'm saying like an orchestra show or some weird extra. Yeah yeah

2063
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:55,880
where they're building it. It's like the it's not this it would not be a it's not a not a Simpson

2064
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:59,160
show but you know what I mean where they like yeah did the Simpsons and the Muppets at the

2065
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:03,480
Hollywood Bowl where they did like custom stuff for it. Right. You got to go here to say if they

2066
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:08,120
can tap into a fan base and things are rendered something that combines both where it's the

2067
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:17,000
it is film and live music that taps into a really specific ardent fan base. I think that would be

2068
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:23,400
some big one. Smartless Smartless Live. Smartless Live. Something they can run forever.

2069
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:30,440
I don't think it's a great venue for Copperfield to upgrade but it would be nice. Oh boy a hundred

2070
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:38,600
foot tall blue. Super Show. Chris Angel. Copperfield. Oh yeah right. David Blaine. Yeah right. Those

2071
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:45,800
three guys getting together. Now no way impossible. That'd be an equation more dense than what is

2072
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:50,840
written on the wall of the sphere. There's still empty seats there's still empty seats and suddenly

2073
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:55,000
two silhouettes appear in the doorway and Penn and Teller are like we got it.

2074
01:53:56,680 --> 01:54:01,800
I'm fascinated by Penn and Teller at that Rio. They're still going to Rio is getting upgraded.

2075
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:07,880
The Rio is new owners. OK. Their potential I hear they might I saw something it might be bringing

2076
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:14,360
back there used to be like parade flutes in the ceiling and some of that might be coming back.

2077
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:20,440
That has not happened for a very long time. Parade floats in the ceiling. Like giant like

2078
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,840
yeah. Here's what I'm interested in what you're saying. I'm I'm from our little month of Vegas

2079
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:32,120
and from going back I'm like I want to go back to Vegas more than I'm Vegas fully Vegas like

2080
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:38,600
piled right now. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think I'm out at the park. I think I'm going

2081
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:43,800
somewhere else next time. Oh. I think I'm doing something else. Oh my. Yeah. How could she

2082
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:48,840
betrayed you. Yeah. Well the beds feel like they were from the old one from the old hotel. Could

2083
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:57,960
be. Yeah. Oh I like a baby there. I sleep like a baby on a on a desk at 3 p.m. Well that's true.

2084
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:04,120
I want to try that. Is it Green Valley rent like there's a one that looks like the middle

2085
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:11,880
like they Italian countryside like 10 50 minutes from the strip. Oh I haven't seen that. Yeah sure.

2086
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:16,520
Let's try it all. It's four times four times. Let's start a Vegas podcast spin off podcast.

2087
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:23,480
Finally do it. And it's all about Vegas. Sphere one sphere episode a month. We interview all five

2088
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:32,120
hours. Oh wow. We finally landed connection. I just like you know we talked that we did Vegas

2089
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:38,120
month and it's like they got rid of so much of the theme park stuff in Vegas. But I this feels like

2090
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:44,600
a the biggest dumbest new way to do a big theme park thing. Yeah. And they really at least at

2091
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:51,720
least you two understood the assignment and used the sphere used sphere in a way which I think was

2092
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:56,280
really good and it took you on a ride. They took you on a weird code elevator ride. Yes.

2093
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:05,160
And it does feel exciting. I still could go under. We could still see the sphere like with a

2094
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:11,240
for sale sign on it in the near future. We're just that like yellow meme face is just like holding up

2095
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:15,720
a little for sale sign or something. You're trying to figure out like furnishings. Yeah.

2096
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:24,360
Common. We have the Pepsi syrup you can buy at a discount. James needs to recoup some of this money

2097
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:28,760
but it does feel like the like if somebody can they can figure it out something come in there

2098
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:37,000
and really do something cool. I know. What about James Taylor. I'm so scared of what Dolan does.

2099
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:43,640
This is why booking to I will I will either fully crow or I will say this is exactly what I was

2100
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:48,360
afraid of. I'm excited if Harry Styles. So you know what I showed this to Jason and I don't know

2101
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:53,320
if this is the way to go out but I'm looking at my face. You should be.

2102
01:56:55,800 --> 01:57:01,880
But sure. Ray again. No no worse. So I was looking at you two and the people are always

2103
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:06,120
pointing out who's there who's famous or who's who's around and somebody reposted this

2104
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:12,200
from I don't know an after party or something with edge and edges with a guy and I didn't know who

2105
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:18,360
it was and his name is Slim Jim Phantom and I said Slim Jim. Oh that guy. Huh. And I looked it up.

2106
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:26,680
Slim Jim Phantom is in Brian Setzer's Stray Cats. Jim Phantom was there. I did not see any

2107
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:32,760
confirmation that Brian has seen the show but maybe Brian will do a little rockabilly in the sphere.

2108
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:37,160
Never I tried so hard I was like this might be my chance. The Haunted Mansion Live one might

2109
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:43,080
it was my chance to maybe eliminate Setzer forever and now I'm immediately regretting

2110
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:47,800
that this didn't happen. The next time there's a bargain between us. Setzer is the first thing

2111
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:53,240
to go. Right but then Slim Jim Phantom can still be spoken of on the show now that I know his name.

2112
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:59,640
The drummer's name is Lee Rocker as well from the Stray Cats. Oh cool. So Slim Jim Phantom.

2113
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:06,200
Cooler and cooler. You could fit the, Setzer would do it. Setzer be here. We could fit the whole

2114
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:11,720
orchestra in. We could expand it. It would be 300 people jumping and driving and wailing.

2115
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:16,840
You'll do the boogie woogie bugle boy from Company B. The song that I'm sure he's played before.

2116
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:23,800
I won't check into it. It's definitely the kind of music. You're gonna be in the mood at sphere.

2117
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:26,440
I'm gonna go.

2118
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:29,960
Jason what would you want to see other than the Postal Service there?

2119
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:37,000
I saw them. I saw them at the Hollywood Bowl. Which is also 20,000ish seats. It's a lot of

2120
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:43,160
you look around you and you're like oh there's so many people here. They had a cool little light

2121
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:49,800
show going. You know. Sure. Hollywood Bowl 70,000. So okay New Pornographer, Postal Service,

2122
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:56,280
anyone else? Well I loved Bill to spill open for them and they only did five songs and I wanted

2123
01:58:56,280 --> 01:59:03,240
them to. He's got so many albums. Yeah Hollywood Bowl is only 17,500. Okay. So sounds like no.

2124
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:06,520
It sounds like you have no other ideas. This is my look. I can't, I don't you know,

2125
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:13,320
jazz guitarist Lee Rittenhour ain't filling the sphere and I know it. But are we to throw these

2126
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:19,480
people we love under the bus because they can't fill a sphere? I got one. Okay the one that I

2127
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:25,480
would like is Blur because they've gotten back together for some albums and some shows. But the

2128
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:33,960
one I've heard rumored might be reuniting is Oasis. Yeah. I mean both of them would shake hands and

2129
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:40,920
make peace. Well one of them was at the sphere already. One of the brothers? Noel was there I

2130
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:49,320
think. Okay. So maybe that doesn't excite me so much. If you could get Blur, Oasis and Pulp.

2131
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:57,880
To all agree to let Mark McGrath take their songs forever and perform them as if they were his.

2132
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:02,280
Scott you're going to get the words right out of my mouth. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. They all sign it

2133
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:09,560
over. Jermis, there it is. It's a mega bill. Add madness to that. They just, all they do is

2134
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:16,840
our house was the name of the song? Yeah. Hey remember this, you probably forget we did this one.

2135
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:26,600
Days go by, it's the bigger love of the family. Add the Proclaimers. Add, Springfield does a

2136
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:33,000
couple tunes. If it's like a ten act bill, there's something for everyone there. Van Morrison and

2137
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:39,880
Eric Clapton are coming but they're only going to do their anti-vax songs. All right okay. Oh and

2138
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:47,160
an 18k image of Fauci rotting into a skeleton. Oh yeah well Eric Clapton played the RFK fundraiser

2139
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:53,960
in Hollywood just a couple weeks ago. Oh goody. So also very possible sphere application. RFK

2140
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:58,840
Jr. Yeah him and Cheryl. Hopefully soon enough. All right I think we did it. You survived Five
