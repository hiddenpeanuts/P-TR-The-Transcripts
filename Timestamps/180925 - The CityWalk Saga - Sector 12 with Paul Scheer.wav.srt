1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your port has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's all go to City Walk

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tonight, tonight

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hi. Yep, me too.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Maybe they pick it up here.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Maybe they come back, you're right.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Maybe they go, oh, 12 looks good.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Maybe hopefully they come back for Paul Scheer.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Paul Scheer is back.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I am so excited to be in Sector 12.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I wouldn't have it any other way.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't want to talk about 5 or 4.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I mean, 12 was the one, if I had my eye on any of the sectors, it would be this.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's the most elusive sector of City Walk.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In my opinion, it's kind of hidden in the corner.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It doesn't, yeah, it doesn't get the,

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
it doesn't get the sunlight of the tourists as much as the rest, I feel like, you know.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is a nice change of pace because our last guest, Nick Mundy,

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
was trying to annex things into his sector.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh really?

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It became a whole thing.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Use the rules.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, no, I like my sector a lot.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I mean, you know, you know, and we're going to spend, I would say what,

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
we agreed before the podcast, about 90 minutes on Samba, right?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The Brazilian Grill.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Is that like, we're just really going to break down that.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, Samba is in another, it's in another sector.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, it's not in our sector?

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It is not in our sector.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So you are not required to know anything about Samba.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Samba is in sector 14.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now why? Because it's so geographically.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The Sector Keep, these have been set years and years, eons ago.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh no, no, as I know, and in fact, maybe this is a good time to get the reminder

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
from the Sector Keeper, oh, great master, what are we talking about today?

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Boys, boys, Paul, today's sector is Sector 12, Margaritaville, Wetzel's Pretzels,

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hard Rock Cafe, retail store, and I fly indoor skydiving.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Good luck, boys.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So it's Margaritaville, Wetzel's Pretzels, Hard Rock Cafe, retail store only,

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
not the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant, and most importantly, maybe,

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I fly indoor skydiving.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, so we got to build to that, I suppose.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I think that's probably last, although Margaritaville could be last as well,

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
but whatever, yeah, we'll build to I fly, I fly.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I will say that in recapping from the Sector Keeper,

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I had forgotten about the Hard Rock store because it was such a jam-packed sector

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that I feel like I'm remembering it now, but it's been a big night.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, it's been a big day, and we spent a significant amount of time

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
in that Hard Rock store.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We did.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I talked to the employee.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We talked to the employee, too.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, you want to talk about it?

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's talk about it.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So it's removed from the, it's not, as opposed to Margaritaville,

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which Margaritaville no longer has the retail location, though it still says store,

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
but they took it out and put tables in.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
In Hard Rock Cafe, it's removed entirely.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's outside.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's far away from the entrance to the restaurant,

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and you cannot access it from the restaurant.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Which is a bold move because, you know, someone who has visited

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, you got to walk through that gift shop.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's very, you know, Bank CES, right?

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I mean, like, you know, you go through the gift shop.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I mean, here, you know, here you got to exit and then go to the gift shop,

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
which is, that means that Hard Rock is so comfortable in the appeal of their merchandise.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
They're like, we don't even need you to walk inside

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
because you want one of these classic Hard Rock shirts.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah. Do they have merchandise in the restaurant as well?

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
My memory is they might also have some merchandise as well.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So it's not only that. It's also just like it's an overrun,

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
like the embarrassment of riches.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, this is for the people who, like, don't want to mess with the food,

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
but want the t-shirt.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Now, I don't know if you guys can speak to this at all.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is a question I've always had.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There's been so many Hard Rock shirts that you'll see

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that identify Hard Rock Cafe in places that they're clearly not, right?

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is that like, that's like a thing, right?

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't know. I think they're there.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There's a lot of locations.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There are a lot of locations.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They are everywhere and a ton of international.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Although they've started to maybe dry up and close a little,

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
but not near, that's not that much.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Planet Hollywood, pretty dead in the water.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hard Rock marches on.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I went to, like, the first Hard Rock when I was a kid

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
because I grew up in New York City and it was a real event to go there.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That was like when, like, you know, Dan Ackroyd would like pop in

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and do like a blues set or whatever, you know, like.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sure.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But I did ask the guy behind the counter

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
because the classic shirt is the white shirt with the Hard Rock,

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
like the most basic, the one that you would see at like souvenir stores.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Right.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And he said that is the best-selling shirt.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He's like, so much so that he sells out of them on a regular basis.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Really?

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He said that a woman came in and she's like, he's like,

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I don't have them and I won't get them again until next Sunday.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Wow.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
When I get my delivery.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He gets a delivery every Sunday and he's like,

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and it's he's he said that that shirt is the reason why people come in.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It still has the staying power.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Because people collect those.

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Like, if they travel a lot, I feel like people collect.

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
There is, God, I got to see if I can figure out who this is.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's either like a journalist or like a Microsoft executive,

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
someone who was like an early adopter on Twitter

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and someone found like someone realized they every time they traveled,

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
they're like in Macau, got to get my Hard Rock shot glass or got my Rock shirt.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And there was just dozens of these posts.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, he, the person by the counter is also saying that the two things that people come in for

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
are the pins that are specific to Hard Rock.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He's a guest.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The regular pin like the regular shirt is always a good seller.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He said, but there's two specific ones.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And there was one I actually had my eye on.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It was a film camera that is shooting out the word Hard Rock.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He said that's only available at Universal Studios because of the specific nature of it.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then there's a drama mask, like a happy sad drama mask.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And that is also an exclusive to the club, the Hard Rock Club, the Universal Club.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Paul, this begs the question.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Are you a pinhead?

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, you know, we really got into it there because it seems like Hard Rock got in

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
on this this pin craze so much so that they have a whole pin section.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, it's a ton of black, which then delves into seemingly some double entendre.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If you're always on the lookout for new ways to poke, prick, stab and stick it to your style,

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
then maybe you should be a pinhead.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And this black goes on and on and on.

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And I guess relevant to theme park worlds that this is, I guess,

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
maybe perhaps inspired by the Disney thing.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't know why.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, I feel like people feel like if you have exclusive pins,

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
you have to get them or you're missing out on something.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's a collectible mentality of like we need to get all of these.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, it's weird. I don't know.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's that's the thing that has stuck around almost at Disney because they've had little toy

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
like little vinylmation toys, but they got they seem to be phasing those out a little bit.

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah. But like the pins remain.

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That does seem to be like a very consistent collectible item for adults.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I am often disturbed by seeing older people with their pin books at Disneyland.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You opened up on some sort of barrel and children approach garbage can garbage can.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, there's a there's a lot of trading and it feels like it's gone to a seedier side than it originally was intended.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I believe like the idea was that you were wearing a lanyard and you might have a couple on there

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and then you would pass somebody and hey, I like that pin and then you would switch pins.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But now it seems like a much more of like a market.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, a dirty marketplace about the hacks.

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You can buy bulk lots of pins like twenty five to one hundred pins on Amazon for like twenty five bucks or something.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Your eyes are getting all shifty when you're talking about this.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And then you just take them to the parks and you trade with cast members for ones you really want.

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You get a randomized assortment of like real pins and for like a fraction of the price.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So what are you where are you buying them bulk?

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You buy them on like Amazon. You buy like a lot of twenty five for maybe like twenty five dollars.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Are they real Disney pins?

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Real Disney.

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So then the cast members are forced into this barter.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah.

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Or if you go to a shop and say like, oh, do you have any pins to trade?

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sometimes I'll have a little display.

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They keep behind the counter.

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Interesting, interesting goal of this being combative and trying to like I think the system.

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I wish I kept my original pins because when I went on one trip, I had an MGM Studios hat and I put a bunch of like Roger Rabbit pins on there.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And it was very specific to Disney.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Now, those would have been worth.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, yeah. Sweet, sweet coin.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You know, yeah, yeah.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, that's all explode.

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's like the only consistent I feel like collectible.

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Like that's still money, like everything else I feel like has its ups and downs.

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But that's only been on the rise for whatever reason.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And you think that the hard rock is I mean, it's hard because you wouldn't be you wouldn't be walking around the hard rock trying to pin trade.

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This is only for your own personal gratification and satisfaction that you would have like a wall of hard rock pins.

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Like this is like, you know, and I could see someone who like also has like a tequila and hot sauce collection.

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Sure.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And they're selling off their hard rock.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They're Mr. Worldwide 2017 Pitbull collaboration.

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Do any of our listeners have a collection of Hard Rock Cafe pins?

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Please post them.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I would love to see them because I used to collect the Hard Rock Cafe shirts that had original artwork by musicians on them.

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Those short lived t shirt things. It was like, you know, the lead singer of Crash Test Dummies designed this Hard Rock Cafe.

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Whoa, it's Stone Temple Pilots have their own shirt.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And it was sort of like in the mix of the Jerry guys and Jerry Garcia was like making ties and that nature.

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But it was like, did you have I had about five or six because, you know, it just sort of like, well, this is an exclusive shirt.

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I got to get on and get to get get in on this.

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And do you think that the era of the Hard Rock Organization having relationships with the current rock stars has waned?

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Like because I don't I feel like I walked in there and into those restaurants in the 90s and thought, well, they are clearly in league with people of that nature.

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And now I don't know because like who's on the wall now is the bass player from Korn Monkey Shaffer.

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, I looked at that. I feel I feel like the gift shop had the lower tier memorabilia.

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, yeah. Because it was sort of like that's not where you're going.

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You know, and then I'm also like, do you feel any special anymore when like someone comes up to you?

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hey, great set tonight. Korn killed it.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Can we have that guitar for the merch store Hard Rock Cafe L.A.?

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Like, do you feel like who does that? Who's collecting these things?

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You know, is there a play? You know, I don't know. Is there a place you have to go?

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah. Who is the broker? Yeah, I would read a big like article or oral history.

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hard Rock. All that stuff comes through it because I've also heard the rumor that it is fake.

213
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There is a Beck biography I read where he walked into a Hard Rock Cafe and something was labeled Beck and he's like, not as far as I know.

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So like, yeah, some guitar and it was not even recognized.

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Well, we didn't you walk we walked in a couple.

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It might have been three months ago and you pointed at something on the mall.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You go, who's that? And the guy behind the counter went, I don't know.

218
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I think that was about are you there was one is one is Chiodos, Derek Frost from Chiodos.

219
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And I'm sorry if I'm the Chiodos might be a great band. I just don't know them.

220
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And what's the other one? A Treyu. Don't know Treyu.

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I've heard of a Treyu. Do you guys think that we should open up like the stream, the stream shack, a podcast themed restaurant?

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, man. Like sit under like some watercolors of Mark Maron's cats.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You could see Joe Rogan's weights, whatever it is, you know, a replica of the ear wolf table.

224
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Everyone's eating on signed ear wolf tables. Look at that display case.

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's a collar from Bosh, Sean Clements' dog that shows up on Hollywood and book a lot.

226
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You know, you could you could you can sit under the image of Dustin from Feral Audio and you could read his tail of woe.

227
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, the full pop. The actual manifesto.

228
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And then at the end, you can pay with Mike Mitchell's actual credit card because it was actually stolen from him and he hasn't noticed.

229
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That seemed like something that would happen. Sure. Stream shack.

230
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Jason's working there.

231
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes, I'm laundering, I'm waiting tables and laundering money.

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
When I first ate at Planet Hollywood, one of the first times again, it was in New York City was like one of the first.

233
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I think it was the first Planet Hollywood.

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was so excited because I went there one day and Anthony Michael Hall was just eating like lunch there.

235
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I was like, Whoa, celebrities do come here.

236
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I thought that was a real cool thing.

237
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And I feel like we could all do a shift at the stream shack. Yeah, sure.

238
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:24,000
To kind of mix it up. Well, it starts the legend that, you know, the big stars like us, you know, really are.

239
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They actually do. This is their place.

240
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And it would be great to, you know, maybe the stream studio.

241
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I mean, that would be like the thing or be like a studio or you have to have like live shows there so you could be munching down on burgers and listening to great interviews.

242
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And this would all like stop happening as time went on like how ESPNZone used to do live broadcasts.

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And then after two years, like, nah, nah, nah, fuck it. Yeah, let's not get out there.

244
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But we start the. Well, we need a mascot.

245
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And it's interesting because we learned a little bit about the Hard Rock Cafe mascot, which I did not even understand was a thing.

246
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I Googled this right before we started a big, you thought I was just looking up the sector. I was looking up.

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, this is a thing that given more time, we would have researched for days. Yeah.

248
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Just being hit with this information.

249
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So, yeah, we're going to do our best here, but we do not have all the information on the official doll doll of Hard Rock Cafe.

250
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
She's a mascot. She's just it's I would say it's the mascot is personified by the doll.

251
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Right. I can't find her in other media.

252
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh, the top of my very quickly. Her name is Harper Ray.

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes. And we've gone through a lot of changes over the years, apparently.

254
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes. And she's different. So she's a she's in a sort of a Barbie like box.

255
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:51,000
She is very similar to Barbie. The one we saw, she was like she had a drum and she had like a cool scarf and she had a shirt that said, I'm with the band with the Hard Rock logo under it.

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Can I read what the back says? Yes, please.

257
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It says Hamburg, Cancun, Bali, Rome, Harper Ray travels the world playing to packed houses at the coolest venues from Munich to Macau, Bogota to Boston. Harper Ray rocks every Hard Rock with a uniquely signature style.

258
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
She's dressed differently at every Hard Rock, too. It says music is in her DNA.

259
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
She was raised on late 70s blues rock and 80s metal punk.

260
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
She has layers of rhythm in everything. That's a weird thing to say. And Harper Ray is a drummer.

261
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Sorry. And Harper Ray's drummer is a true rocker, never happier when she's improvising a drum solo. Where will Harper Ray show up next?

262
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Straight up typo. Yeah, right.

263
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:50,000
She is with the band or she is in the band? Because it should be like, and Harper, it should be like she hears a rhythm in everything. Harper Ray is a drummer.

264
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I guess it says Harper Ray's drummer is a true rocker. That's like saying that there's somebody else that we are not familiar with.

265
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Who's not available for purchase. Who doesn't even have a name?

266
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And the single drum also strange for someone with such an inherent rhythm sense. Right. She doesn't have a sense you need more than one drum. Is it a snare or a tom?

267
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It looks kind of like a tom to me. Kind of kind of thick. It's kind of a yeah. And she's got two sticks.

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I will say maybe I'm maybe I'm being sexist and I really don't want to be. But she's wearing a shirt that says I'm with the band. Yeah, that's what I. She's in the band. Right.

269
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So in. Yeah. Yeah. Like and I get like why that may be ironic. But when you look at the way that she looks, you would think, oh, she's like my first thought was, oh, is she like a groupie?

270
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Like that's what she that's what she appears to be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See, there's different. OK. So this is a different Harper Ray. I found her on eBay.

271
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And she's wearing what basically looks like a Disney bounder like outfit, you know, like a right like a rockabilly girl kind of a thing. And she's got a guitar. So this one very much makes it seem more like she's in the band. Yeah.

272
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Versus just a fan of the band. And by the way, I guess I've read it and keep the same instrument. No, apparently. Yeah. But maybe that's the confusion. Maybe she comes with a drum.

273
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But that's for another character in the Harper Ray verse, which I was looking I was like looking online, trying to find if like Harper Ray is like a little sister named Midge or something or like summer, which I'm looking at.

274
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know what store this is from, but I'm looking at a guitar one and totally different hair kind of black black with the street.

275
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He said, yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah. And this one says collectible pin included. Yeah, that's one here, too. Yeah. He said that she has changed her look many a time.

276
00:19:41,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I can only find two looks. I can to. So he said that, yes, she's she's changed looks either for some reason. People don't love Harper Ray like we all do immediately. Yeah. Not like putting her old dolls on eBay. Or there really are only two versions of Harper Ray.

277
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I think there's two in this one. The one that we're looking at looks more like Katy Perry and the one that we saw. I don't even know if she has a analogous person.

278
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Harper Ray like Barbie box reminded me of like a thing we Paul you noticed earlier. There were some L.A. specific pins. Oh, yeah.

279
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The Harper Ray bar like box like we have very clearly skirting around like look. It looks like Barbie box. Right. Very clearly skirting copyright laws.

280
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Just like those other pins were at the Hard Rock store of like Dodger Stadium with no Dodgers logo. That was a bizarre choice. It was like co-opting L.A. landmarks. Yeah. Not giving the due to the landmark.

281
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Right. Because that costs money. Because there was a. What was the other was a universal one. But it was kind of it was kind of it was a large dinosaur that we hypothesize either from back to the future of the ride. Right.

282
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Or Jurassic Park the ride we didn't know. And then a roller coaster that simply does not exist at Universal Studios which actually makes me go why doesn't Universal Studios have like a real like simple roller coaster.

283
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean the hippogriff ride I guess is a version of it. But I mean it would be really smart for them to just pop in the thrill ride. They have the one in Orlando that's very generic the rip ride rocket.

284
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I like that one. Yeah. Music. Yeah. But it's not themed or anything. It seems simple enough. It does seem like there's a real opportunity to make something that starts up on top of the hill and go down.

285
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah. Is it an easy neighbors. I think it's a neighbor. They're right on. Oh you're right. Because they're like the roller coasters are loud. That being said they're running fireworks now at night.

286
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Like there's a they're being very lax about stuff. I mean you know you know me I'm just just waiting and hoping for that tonight show ride to get over there. I mean come on. Yeah.

287
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That in our fingers you know. Yeah. I know the barbershop quartet. I think we should skip right to the Seth Meyers ride.

288
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Alan. Oh yeah. Meyers. OK. Yeah. Why not. We don't want to clone. We don't want the world. Yeah right. Let's do things.

289
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Look I'll take a morning Joe right if you want to do a meek and just garbara. Sure. In the NBC family.

290
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:33,000
We're talking about the VR experiences you could have on the VR episode where you could just do all the shows you could have a VR experience with everyone.

291
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That would be amazing. 30 Rock. Yeah. Hard Rock Cafe where I would say that I think what I like about it is it feels or the gift shop I should say. Right.

292
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:54,000
No we can't talk about it. It feels exclusive. It feels like it feels like you're going to get some cool stuff out of there whether it's jewelry which they do sell.

293
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Scott you look great in the leather jacket. You know I was just looking at photos. I don't think I look bad at all. Yeah.

294
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Actually I'm a man. Maybe I should get that jacket. My question is joining an IMF team.

295
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:17,000
My question about that jacket is you have to agree on some level that you want a leather jacket right. Yeah. Which I just don't know if I'm willing to.

296
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Right. That's a big it's a big person. But then once you've committed to that you're going like well I'm going to get a hard rock one I'm not going to get like I'm not going to commit to like just a nice leather jacket like that you can go like it's odd that you would want it on brand.

297
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah. Yeah. And if you're going to choose a brand for a leather jacket obviously Taz clearly the only way to go. Yeah of course. I think maybe a lot of hard rock merch is bought and not worn or used in any.

298
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah. I am around shocked that because this is a brand I think you was I realize now there's some crossover now between both of our episodes Scott and I episode of Doughboys.

299
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Scott had a hard rock cafe item are redeveloped episode and I think you were saying on that episode like what is this brand. Yeah. Who loves this brand. So when you're talking about the merchant like not only is a t-shirt fine a leather jacket that really proclaims that you're a fan of the hard rock.

300
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Well here's I'll add to this and say that I think that we all share one thing because my doughboys was Bubba gum shrimp company. Oh yes. Same idea. Who feels like I need to immortalize this meal with merch.

301
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I bought a shirt there that I thought was hilariously funny and I wore it once. It was an election shirt. I wore it on election day and it said vote for gump and it was a special election theme shirt.

302
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But then it looked too close to vote for Trump like if you look at it and so I felt really self-conscious about it. I put that right next to my adult swim when I was down there visiting them. They made these make fish center great again hats.

303
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So it was just like just Trump hats but they just replaced the thing but again it requires a real fine look at the thing you can't just glance and when you glance at these right they elicit a different response than you want requires a knowledge of the daily adult swim streaming only show fish center.

304
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yes which is a very very niche kind of like if Decker and on cinema weren't on obscure enough for you if you want to go even deeper and streaming comedy. Have you guys seen the adult swim streaming show called like pitch session where like basically just like take callers pitches for TV shows and then they have like Walter Newman who is one of the adult swim development execs like will then like kind of give them feedback.

305
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's odd that you really are pitching the shows. Yeah. Would they ever do it. Probably not. Yeah. So I guess that makes it like okay. It's not like nefarious. Yeah. But it is like if you have a good idea it could be that could be just whipped away from you. Yeah right. Yeah.

306
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah. Yeah. Well that's why we should save pitches from the show when we pitch great ideas we just throw them out into the air and like that when we just I worried about we just talked about that start to start tours this the story of Rex and star tours but it's it's sully it could be as far as you want to go it can be sully inspired could be sully shot for shot and but with Rex.

307
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah. I'm worried that's just going to get taken. Well I mean I would be freaked out if I were you guys because I know that in was it Hong Kong Disneyland. They just opened that Apple dumpling gang thing.

308
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:12,000
They announced that. Yeah. They were able to get enough kids and do the adoption thing. So it's like it and apparently they can turn over a hundred adoptions in an hour. But it is you know they want to kind of upgrade it a little more.

309
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yeah. And they're going to have a lot of children there and that was the key. Why are we pitching it for Anaheim man and the right I heard now that I'm now that's Paul brings it over I remember and it starts in Shanghai Disney. That's where the right connects to Hong Kong.

310
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That's a bummer. I think I've had a breakthrough here of Mike. I've answered my own question. I think hard rock because like you're saying bubblegum and that makes a lot more sense to me to buy a bubblegum shirt really for whatever reason.

311
00:27:43,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's so strange to have more specific for us. Yes. OK. Yes. That's what I'm saying. So that's all right. I think in general because you could end up with like some some joke or his weird philosophy right. Even a stupid is a stupid does shirt makes more sense to me than what.

312
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What is hard rock hard rock saying I think that I think the fact that it's so generic is the strength of hard rock rock is just like wearing a Nike shirt even though Nike is an athletic thing but it's just as generic it means nothing like it's for a dad to where he feels comfortable.

313
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's as hard rock it's nothing weird but it falls into the same category that the hard rock park fell into which is like music is not like popular music is not that anymore. Like when we look about you know our the mascot I've got her name now already.

314
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Hey Haley Haley Ray I was going to call her Harper Lee Harper Harper Harper Ray who is like into like a blues and rock like that. It's almost like saying like Harper Ray is not of this world or of this musical like that's not.

315
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I mean that music is slowly dying out in popularity like it will always be around but like it's not the hot music so it wouldn't. I think when hard rock first started in the 80s it was like everything was the cool hard rock but now it's different.

316
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah, yeah. And like so they had a leg in like 90s like you were like Stone Temple Pilots yeah grunge stuff and you've honored the club of classic masters because they led to this, but now what did 90s grunge lead to they lead to nothing it's gone.

317
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I would think that people feel less connected to Jimi Hendrix now than you know than than Mo you know I think he's I think he's you know I think he's just like losing popularity I were at least my mind I grew up like the cool yeah the doors Jimi Hendrix yeah they don't think kids are like going back to Jimi Hendrix.

318
00:29:41,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So what do you see on any show on the VMAs or the Tonight Show or anything that is well this guy's clearly Hendrix inspired right yeah yeah so there's more of the like current you know current R&B hip hop is more is influenced by older R&B hip hop but like there's no the rock lineage in terms of popular

319
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:21,000
scale seems like done yeah for sure I so so yeah this is this is a comfortable shirt for baby boomer dads and moms to wear but in addition I think it's such a generic brand and a generic logo that anyone can wear it and it's literally just like wearing a Hanes a blank Hanes shirt or something

320
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:38,000
that just says like music a shirt right music on it it's a place yeah you're less good like you're not comfortable wearing the band that you actually like you're like I need to just get something that represents music that I like yeah it would be like us like wearing your shirt just

321
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:56,000
said like funny comedy that would be like oh you like funny comedy like cool yeah yeah it's always like well like like funny or die almost started to feel I started feeling like what is this brand like because there's not a clear besides that will Ferrell's part of it

322
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:12,000
like anybody every like all the comedians all did funny or die videos and then what right what is it that's theirs besides sometimes will ferrell's like the thing of funny or die was so great at and and still great at is like finding humor and like the Kia or you know

323
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:32,000
ziplock bags and things like that you know and then the simple oil company I oil Gail yeah five Miller light spots I did in two days for the price of a half spot the Reds Apple ale you know that kind of stuff really you know the lighter side of all of that sure

324
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,980
Humor to be found in every classic Remington rifle

325
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,420
Boy well, did we keep marching on that we

326
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,680
We can we rock on well if we rocked next to it. How about we rock past?

327
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,240
What's what I want to just say one thing to what that we may lead right into our if we go to Margaritaville

328
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
I think there's a similar idea here, right?

329
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:02,840
We're Margaritaville I would argue is the best merch of the three Bubba Gump hard rock in this because Margaritaville

330
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,720
Represents I'm a Jimmy Buffett fan. This is like an out on offshoot of that, but I could at least buy

331
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,360
That your but your it's like another level of merch for someone you like

332
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,140
Like you know saying it's it's it's it has a built-in audience more than the other two. Yeah

333
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:27,860
Very specific also kind of co-opted island breezy lifestyle like somehow

334
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:33,280
I think there's probably people who like the restaurant and who are not necessarily even a too much about

335
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,940
Jimmy Buffett the guy and it's right really you think that that's a two

336
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,780
Two different sex of people people who like Margaritaville and people who like Jimmy Buffett. I think there might be there's a there's

337
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,900
There's people on the outliers

338
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,860
But like there has to be a crossover at least of people like I like the margarita mostly it's across

339
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,600
But I think that's the way he's made it bigger than right. Yes the brand

340
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:01,820
Yeah, you're right the brand itself now is so just insanely large like insanely huge and pervasive the restaurant

341
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,620
I feel like he that's how he became elevated

342
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,280
Yeah, but don't use these songs, but it as I get older and they understand

343
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,680
Things more feel like people feel really like they're cutting loose and they have like margarita, right?

344
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:21,220
And yeah, like somebody by calling your place a margarita like margarita bill sure the song obviously and but yeah

345
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,800
I feel like it's like let's go there. We're gonna have Margaret like it's like you you well

346
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,180
Like it's almost like now we're gonna cut like it's like it's a it's a perfect thing. It's not like they're like Jimmy Buffett food

347
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:37,740
It's like it's basically calling people in to get shit face like you're saying like let's have margarita

348
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,340
It's like I think people like always want margaritas. I don't know that like yeah, it's not a rate

349
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,300
It's not even like a beer is like a kind of a just thrown. Yeah a margarita

350
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,700
Suggests that you're somewhere that's like exotic or it's a little sugar

351
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,900
Having fun drinks before sipping and you're taking your time with it. It's right

352
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,300
In a place that names itself margarita, yeah, we're gonna probably have the best margarita

353
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,400
It's like that's the other thing too. It's like I can go to a bar get a margarita, but this place is I mean

354
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,540
It's it's on the wall. It's it's there. We know they're gonna make the best you sure

355
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,260
Did it deliver as promised?

356
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,220
Did you think well, this is my first time in a margarita Ville?

357
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:24,740
So this is you know, I was taking it all in and I was I have a couple questions. Yeah

358
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,320
I get to the margarita. I just want to like work up to it for one second. Yeah, of course. So

359
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:36,660
It's interesting. There's a lot of TVs there a lot of TVs that you would see like a sports center, but uh, it's all Jimmy Buffett

360
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,740
Mostly like once there's a Bieber song. Oh, okay real mismatchy

361
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,740
Modern music makes no sense. They're all read or Jimmy Buffett on the TV

362
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:52,140
There's no Bieber videos in that TV right what was playing while the Bieber song was on but some I think once every six songs

363
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:58,220
It'll be maybe to be different pretty buffett heavy rotation tonight. Yeah, it was just for the best there

364
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,400
Jason is falling asleep. I all right. Yeah, no, I'm good too much margarita

365
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,920
Oh, yeah, well the the idea that like

366
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,880
the the videos I was really in impressed by because

367
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,400
They look very much like heavy metal rock and roll parking lot videos

368
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,840
It's like there was one video where the average was having fun

369
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,120
It looks like all like back behind the scenes footage

370
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:25,680
But one video of like one of the fans like in a leg like a boot like they broke their leg or their foot

371
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:32,560
And it's just like they're just like dancing and like the cameras pans down to like a boot like you know

372
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,600
A corrective boot because they broke their leg. It's like oh alright

373
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,760
This is like it's it's just kind of showing all sides of the Jimmy Buffett's man

374
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,320
Yeah, this so there is a there is a documentary

375
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,200
I believe still on Netflix and I forget the name of it, but it's about parrot heads and it's produced parrot head

376
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Is that what it's called?

377
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,360
It's on you've seen is why it's on a

378
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Gulf what's the Gulf and Western?

379
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:59,520
Yeah, Jerry Jerry Diaz all these different trop. What do they call them chop rocks?

380
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,800
Do they call them chop rock guys, maybe and they're all

381
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,480
They're all like most of them are Buffett imitators essentially and they have I should look up some Jerry Diaz music

382
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,720
But the whole thing is a propaganda piece for parrot heads like they're trying my

383
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,240
Interpretation of it, and it's not a bad. It's interesting some of the stories or whatever

384
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,480
But my interpretation of it is they're trying to tell you that parrot heads are not just a bunch of drunken asshole baby boomers

385
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,640
You know we have a lot of diversity here. There's a lot of inclusion

386
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,080
And then there's a lot of like what good things for the community the parrot heads do when they put on their different concerts

387
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,400
So I do wonder if maybe it's like and then yeah take a picture of a guy with a cast

388
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
We don't care if you got a cast

389
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,960
Yeah, well, there's a good they saw Jimmy Buffett also wearing a shirt that said Hank what's the relevance of that? Oh that was um

390
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,760
What song came on? It was like an honky-tonk song came on. I don't know. That was like a Hank Williams shirt

391
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh, hey good looking right? Yeah, right

392
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,840
Yeah, there was like six of them. Is that an original Jimmy Buffett song? No

393
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
No, that's a that's a

394
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Yeah, so Jerry so just real quick so there's all these different Buffett imitators, so I highly recommend watching this

395
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Mostly on his record label

396
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
Oh yeah, some of them are

397
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,840
But this I don't know that this gentleman is his name is Jerry Diaz and his his band is called Hannah's Reef

398
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:36,560
And here are just some songs that he wrote in this vein of Jimmy Buffett beer in the cooler on a beach in Mexico down in the

399
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,200
Cooler on a beach in Mexico down to the islands and welcome to Senorita Ville

400
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Amazing

401
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,600
Just all people this is like if Harry Potter fan fiction was as popular or like

402
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Well, it's popular as Harry Potter

403
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
It's interesting because

404
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:02,240
It's like I was watching him on stage and I had no no offense to Jimmy Buffett at all actually I but I was surprised that like

405
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:11,680
He is dressed like if you were to take it if you were to grab a random sampling of dads like like, you know

406
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,080
Mid 40s to 60s, right?

407
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,480
Just a random family across the country

408
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,000
I think that Jimmy Buffett would blend in if you have if you had no faces

409
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,760
But just like what they were wearing like he's one time like almost like wearing cargo shorts and like a little Hawaiian shirt

410
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:36,080
Like he one thing was tucked in and he's not like it's interesting. He looks like one of them

411
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:43,600
He does so here's I look I'm here just to start out. I talked a lot about this on that doughboys episode

412
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,720
I got very fascinated with this whole thing because it's and I follow all the social media of Jimmy Buffett

413
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,640
It started honestly it started when I we I could play the song. I'll play the song a second

414
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:00,600
And I'm sort of fascinated with what you're saying because I think at this point his whole life is a calculation

415
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,640
to maintain the appearance of

416
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:10,600
This man who surfs like every day right wears the clothes you're talking about chances are though. He sells the clothes

417
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,560
He's wearing as well. He's like Tommy Bahama, but another yeah. Yeah exactly

418
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,840
So like I think that like his instagram they just there's one day of one day a month

419
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,600
They go over to a beach. They have 12 different sets of clothes

420
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,280
They change them in and out of clothes and he's like going surfing again

421
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,320
Hey fans up and then like it's a different shirt

422
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,240
They get him in and out and it's like they post these periodically through the week

423
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,640
And then this is a very I have then they ran a restaurant and he's like crab legs

424
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
Go best gumbo in town

425
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,800
I'm they just get a lot of a lot of pictures of them doing stuff just to make you think

426
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:55,320
That this man is just always in a hammock or in the water or or eating crab legs or eating gumbo somewhere and like

427
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:02,840
He runs an empire. He's busy never alone meetings. They're always documenting him. He is busy in meetings

428
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,120
So like yeah when you're saying he's dressed like kevin the heart of

429
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,820
Trap rock. Yeah

430
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,760
Every second is a chance to be perpetuating the brand he lives and dies by that 12 inch ipad pro

431
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,840
That he is often photographed with yes, like he's always like working on it, right?

432
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,720
They show you behind the curtain of like look oh here's he's in the office

433
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,080
He is always on this ipad

434
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,560
So they will show you once in a while him in like a meeting

435
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,080
But he is there's so many videos and posts I will say this paul if you want to see him

436
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,520
Yeah a lot follow movie producer frank marshall

437
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,320
Oh, yeah, because frank marshall who's married to kathleen kennedy course is his like best friend

438
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,080
Okay, and I follow frank marshall and he is with jimmy buffett by the way

439
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,960
It says it right here when I typed in frank marshall's name followed by you

440
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Right there at the top one like wow

441
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,200
With buffett

442
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Like so much more than his wife honestly, that's calculated too. I don't know no frank. I don't think it's

443
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,840
Calculate brand just calibrated. That's just if you want to see pictures of jimmy buffett

444
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,360
I don't think frank has a handler frank just like loves jimmy and hangs out with them to see pictures of him

445
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
That's the way I want to see this

446
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:29,000
All the time. So how many followers do you think jimmy buffett has on social media versus how many margaritaville?

447
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,520
Is that where you're going?

448
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,600
just because i'm thinking of him as what we just talked about like this guy was like

449
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:39,400
You know all right, so on instagram, how many followers do you think he has probably low?

450
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,920
That lower than I think yeah 150 000. Okay. Anybody else?

451
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,560
Hmm do you get lower or higher? I don't know. I don't know. That's at 200. I'll go higher. All right, uh

452
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,160
300 000, okay 171

453
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,560
Because because part of me is like oh, you know what I bet you it's because

454
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,360
He's not probably doing that much on social media ultimately because his fan base is probably

455
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,440
Not on instagram. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah younger

456
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,080
User base, I believe. Yeah, but he it was

457
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,600
Isn't his entire rise and fandom

458
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
social media before

459
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:26,600
Social media it was like truly the definition of viral right just person to person spreading the gospel

460
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:32,840
So does he really need to be pushing it? But he might also be splitting his fan base because he's got

461
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,160
His account he's got the margaritaville restaurant account the margaritaville

462
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:43,400
Clothing account, right? Aren't these? Yeah, they're all yeah margaritaville itself has less than he does. It's got like 100 000

463
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,040
buffet too

464
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
Wasn't even big till the 90s

465
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,240
Yeah, he didn't charge the 90s for parrot head was coined in the 90s

466
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,760
Uh, and that's when the whole thing exploded into like yeah

467
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,880
Became a big touring. Yeah when assholes were then this is this is record

468
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,160
Shitting in the parking lot and not cleaning it up, which is like a couple years ago. What was the city?

469
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:13,080
It was on the east coast somewhere where there's like the police were like, please if you make make sure do not use

470
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,600
Make sure toilets in our parking lot and then leave them there

471
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,680
It sounds like a philadelphia thing

472
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:27,080
If it was so he didn't chart until alan jackson had him on five o'clock somewhere. Wow

473
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:35,080
Yeah, by the way five o'clock somewhere. It was a great um, uh piece in margaritaville a big giant clock that is stuck perennially

474
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,680
Yeah, five o'clock and it kind of looks like it's moving. Yeah, but it's yeah

475
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,680
Yeah, also the clock's like a lime too. Yeah, we should mention that we did sit in the giant boat man

476
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:51,240
Yeah, because we were occupied with what we had a place to ourselves that was great

477
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,920
Parties, i've really dreamed of being in the big boat. Yeah, they give you a lot all those restaurants

478
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,600
I mean there's like

479
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,600
It's it's disappointing to be at a boring table because there are so many great other options

480
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,240
A lot of those tiki booths and stuff like that. Yeah, I was a little worse to be the merch store

481
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,360
It's not a merch store. I mean to be in that like what am I in? I mean that is such an anomaly

482
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,640
Yeah, i've never seen this before in any other margaritaville

483
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:22,520
they open when they open there was a little store not a huge store about the size of the bubblegum store and

484
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,400
You really didn't see a lot of people in there

485
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,520
So they yanked the store out and filled in more tables because I guess they figure they make more

486
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,480
But uh, but oddly kept the sign up which seems so easy to take. Oh, yeah

487
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,680
Very easy one of the words you have to take the whole thing. Yeah exactly sure

488
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,640
Yeah, there's a dude. There's a good gift shop in margarita in orlando margaritaville. Oh, it's huge

489
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,520
When you talk about this is like the real mecca. I mean

490
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:55,160
Well, look i've said it many times this this is the margaritaville that has jimmy's real plane real life plane

491
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,200
The hemisphere dancer the one that was shot at by the jamaican government. Okay. He was not on board

492
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,680
I believe bana was on board at the time and that's why he wrote the song jamaica mistake

493
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,320
Right and I believe you might have told me this because that sounds familiar to me

494
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,920
And there's no one else probably you're told that the musicality of you saying this. I feel like you've heard it

495
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,080
seven or eight of nine

496
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,880
Maybe you've listened to it if not been told it directly

497
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,480
But I and and I now fear i'm repeating myself

498
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,280
But to say that i'm also a fan of jimmy buffett's appearances on hawaii 5-0

499
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,320
Oh, yeah plays a pilot a good friend of the main character. Yeah, frank frank bam

500
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,800
Yeah, and they and they and they uh, and they go to north korea in an episode

501
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
He flies them into north korea. Yeah

502
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,320
Yeah

503
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,320
I was sorry about somebody who was on

504
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:49,240
Uh, hawaii 5-0 and messed up a line and then one of the regular he was just on that episode and then one of the regulars

505
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,260
Said hey man, forget about it. It's okay. It's a white 50

506
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
That's a little of a shit thing

507
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,080
It's really good. I think things are a little more chill when you film in hawaii

508
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,040
Yes, yeah, yeah with real money

509
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,600
um the uh

510
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:11,960
Uh, we wouldn't we didn't really partake in the food. You had the uh, I had the i've had

511
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,440
Probably nine or ten things on the menu in my lifetime. Okay

512
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,380
The i have a burger in paradise. I've had the cheeseburger paradise solid chain restaurant cheeseburger

513
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:28,600
Yeah, uh, i've had you know, like the turkey version of it fine. It's fine. I had the ahi

514
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,560
Tuna or what was it poke poke?

515
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,440
Okay, yeah, and those were good very salty but pretty good for you know chain restaurant

516
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,800
And they have regional stuff at some of these margaret because the florida one is like fresh conch fritters. Oh, okay, but that is

517
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,560
The most serious

518
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,920
I they're delicious. I've had them a number of times before what are you talking about conch?

519
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:59,000
What's a good conch? I only know that it's a shell. Yeah, it's a good conch is what's inside the shell. It's used

520
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yeah, oh, interesting. Oh

521
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,000
Yeah, it's like I would imagine like a clam consistency very similar to a clam

522
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,080
Very similar to a clam for the conch shell mentors. The conch

523
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,400
You get down there or conch stew I forget what it is. Um, I felt like this place

524
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,400
Uh

525
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,440
Definitely keeps the spirit alive. I mean, it's a big one. It's definitely a big one

526
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,960
They have a whole outdoor dining area with a fire pit and nice like uh, like lounge chairs

527
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,360
Oh, yeah in shaped fire

528
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,680
Oh, we see that you see it from above and the big but the big issue

529
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:41,640
I think with the with this margaret of a location is it replaced what used to be was an arcade right that place jillian's

530
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,440
Yeah, one of a ripoff david buster. Yeah. Yeah, and that was two stories

531
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,520
But which made me think this will be a sprawling that's what we were all fantasizing about that. It would be something

532
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,720
There's this big stairwell by the fire pit that leads up to nothing you get to a locked door

533
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:03,960
and that's a big bummer if it was a massive two story because we talked why I would have in last episode about uh,

534
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,420
Bucatubepo yeah about that bucatebepo

535
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:13,160
sprawling many little rooms and pockets and almost like uh, it was like a restaurant that

536
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,680
We got so popular. We just had to keep on expanding. But like yeah, yeah, they don't like they didn't know one out of their apartment

537
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:24,120
Yeah, there's and broken there. Yeah. Yeah, but this one. Yeah, it's and it feels a little claustrophobic

538
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,080
Yeah, that's the problem as opposed to the vegas

539
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,800
Location very high ceiling in vegas. Yeah. Yeah low ceiling in orlando

540
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,760
But like kind of the shack kind of porch thing is very charming and inside is

541
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,600
Inside it's got a high ceiling. But yeah, I like the low ceilings because I could look at the artwork on the ceiling where it's one

542
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,560
was a

543
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,680
uh a cloud in the shape of a salt shaker

544
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:53,080
Sure, that was one of those is is weed like a part of the jimmy buffett culture. Yes

545
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,000
It is more drinking. He's he's very much on record

546
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,920
Supporting legalized weed stuff. Okay on his youtube channel

547
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah, there was a video of him in like florida where he's like I want to support prop 91 like legalize bear one in florida

548
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:15,240
Like so he is sort of behind that and got it. Okay his audience is a bunch of drunken high fools

549
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,880
So right sure, I think that has to be a big thing. Obviously they don't sell weed yet

550
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,680
Legally in these places, but I have to imagine that's coming soon. Maybe yeah

551
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:30,200
I feel like it's in a again a very baby boomer way where it's like they're mostly drinking boat drinks

552
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,000
But a little weed when the kids go to bed

553
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,440
We all take a toke

554
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,040
Secret dad weed is very charming. Yeah. Oh, yeah

555
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:51,320
That's that's one of my old mild. I feel like they should start making like cbd infused cocktails. So like yeah

556
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,560
It's also like it's not gonna get me high. Right me that at margaritaville. Yeah, it should maybe like have like a cd

557
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,160
However, I don't think citywalk is open to that kind of thing as we talked about voodoo

558
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,840
Don't know. Yeah is like a in portland is very

559
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:13,240
It's like this is clearly like acknowledging weed culture and this one looks like a dick and

560
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:20,520
Where this is a gay rights themed donut. Yeah, no none of that made it to la. Oh, so I which

561
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,800
Why why does citywalk think we're I guess it's a family. There's so

562
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,460
conservative serve so many

563
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,680
Demographics it ended up sterilizing. Um, but a ramp but you know what?

564
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,280
Halloween horror nights when things get a little more adults

565
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,600
Maybe maybe though maybe the citywalk locations need to get into the spirit too. Well, I also feel like you are

566
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,480
entering at your own risk at Halloween horror nights because it's like

567
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,960
They put a warning. It's like now you come in here

568
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,120
It this is an adult night. It's an adult night

569
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:03,720
You know, like I feel like citywalk can never do like this is like citywalk is almost like independent of Halloween horror nights

570
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,440
Yeah, you know, it'd be no way to go warning

571
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,480
You if you come in this voodoo don't know it still be a donut that has two men kissing drawn on it

572
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,960
Yeah, like you can't do that thing that I was on so disturbing is like during Halloween horror nights

573
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:22,220
They do those like crazier shows like it was like the Shrek fucks the donkey and the 3d show. It's a really vulgar

574
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,920
vulgar

575
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:31,240
It's like kind of replacing that Bill and Ted kind of uh, but no liquor in the part like no one's getting fucked up in the

576
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:39,320
Part Hollywood no Hollywood no Orlando all bets are off in a way. They do some liquor though, right? Don't they have beer in uh, universal day

577
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,240
I probably had

578
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:48,520
I think I was maybe beer. I was just there like two weeks ago and I remember seeing like cold Heineken's in

579
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,880
um

580
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,680
A bin. Yeah, you can buy it in the day. Do they stop selling alcohol for horror?

581
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:00,920
Might stop at our nights because it's such a young populace because I never heard local populace

582
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,560
I've been there every year for about five or six years and gotten private guides and stuff for it

583
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,680
Like that's I bring in a big enough group that we get our own guide and don't do all in her. Yeah

584
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:15,720
It's the best. Wow. You have to like pack it in and you gotta like do it now. You gotta like what's

585
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:22,040
What's the highlight? The highlight is you get a good oral tour of Halloween horror nights, but then you also

586
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:27,400
Uh, they know how to I've never moved around that park in a more efficient

587
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:34,200
Uh away. It's like boom boom boom boom like you just like they start in a very weird way and they and they

588
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,760
They just wrap you in and out like it's

589
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:43,000
I always find that park to be a little bit of a nightmare to or move around especially with that big

590
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,400
You know, especially when horror nights kind of goes into like the uh

591
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,960
Like streets, right?

592
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,960
Your streets. Yeah

593
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,800
so they they they

594
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:58,360
Are very adept at going this is how we do the whole thing and you leave and they kind of like

595
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,200
Edge you out of like don't do that one. It's not that good and this is

596
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:08,040
Our waitress tonight was very helpful in that respect margaritaville was very good about like yeah

597
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,680
That one's a little sweet. That one's a little like there was one or two drinkers. She's like don't

598
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,080
Yeah, don't do it. Don't do it. So then she was her. Yeah pretty pretty

599
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,080
Uh

600
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,320
Give it giving with information but not like really dragging anything

601
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,800
She's like well if you like if you're that's what you're looking for try this

602
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,560
Like I asked her should I get a key lime pie or strawberry shot cake or shortcake and she was like

603
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,640
Look strawberry shortcake is good

604
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,080
But they put the ice cream on top of the bread and the bread gets hard and a little cold

605
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:41,240
Just so you know, wow very good honest response. Yeah the problems of the which by the I did keelin

606
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:47,720
But we both again and that was good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I hadn't done dessert there. I like to uh, and sorry is uh, uh, they sell

607
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,040
alcohol at mows

608
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,960
Uh, just in mows, but you can't bring any alcohol into the mazes or anything

609
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,160
Okay, and like it seems like just at mows here. Okay. Um

610
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,320
So the margaritas we all had margarita. Yes a version of margarita

611
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:09,880
Yeah, I followed mike's lead and got what is it called the feeling hot hot hot margarita, right? Okay spicy

612
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,920
The margarita. It was spicy. Yeah, I was surprised at how much spice it had. I like the spicy drink

613
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Yeah, I was surprised. I felt like a chain restaurant wouldn't go that spicy

614
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,760
It was actually a little spicier than I remember having it when I had it

615
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,760
Uh a week and a half ago. Okay, just on a leisure trip. I love it

616
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,480
So you go there not for just for journalism purposes. My friend works right over there. I said let's go to margarita. I said yes, please

617
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,480
um, so

618
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,480
Good or bad then? Oh, uh

619
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,400
perfectly fine not

620
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,280
Uh, not too sweet. Yeah, uh, not too much

621
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,760
And I feel like the liquor content was a little bit high or i'm becoming more of a lightweight because I did feel like I was

622
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,160
Like oh, yeah, yeah, I was at an empty stomach. We had just done an exciting thing too

623
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,880
But I I as soon as I had like three sips I was like, oh here we go. We're in margaritaville now

624
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:04,040
Yeah, I did like three fourths of that drink and I felt like that was a the right amount for me to do and then still

625
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,600
Drive, which that's good at that point if you you want to feel like because the drinks are a little expensive

626
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,760
You want to feel like the one is gonna kind of yeah, like get you take you home. Yeah

627
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:18,280
Uh fan of the shark fin, I think what I think that was a rum, uh tequila

628
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,400
Mambo and and uh, yeah, not too sweet rum could be a dangerous area

629
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,360
Oh, I had the one particular harbor, which was all rum and fruit juices

630
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,000
Are you reading the ingredients?

631
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,120
Hmm. Are you reading the ingredients? Are you all right? I was just summarizing

632
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,080
Yeah, I I will say that I found

633
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:42,360
I guess what my expectation of bargaritaville was was that we were gonna get

634
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Almost an aggressive cheesecake factory like menu of drinks. I was gonna see like

635
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:55,000
What do you got here? Because this is a place where you like the goal is let's have fun, right?

636
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,320
Our drinks should be fun little cheeky-esque

637
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:03,080
Um, but no it was it was a fine fine menu of drink is a lot of drinks

638
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:09,880
A lot of drinks, but I I would argue that baba gump has a more interesting selection of alcoholic beverages crazier, too

639
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,320
Yeah, the atmosphere in there is crazier and the menu itself

640
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,160
Uh as like I ordered I mean, it's so crazy

641
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,840
I ordered a drink I thought was alcoholic and I didn't realize until I had the whole thing that it wasn't

642
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,960
Well, yeah, I mean look, I mean I think I think uh

643
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:33,320
Uh, baba gump was the first time ever had one of those mini carnita bottles like yeah in like shoved in the drink

644
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,520
Yeah, it was good. Amazing. It was great. Yeah

645
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,640
Um because it kind of like it actually lessened the taste it was like I think it was a margarita

646
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,440
with a corona stuck into the corona is kind of like

647
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,240
Uh like sucking out the sweet so you kind of have this like beer orita. It is i've had that before it is very good

648
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,640
Yeah, my city walk places

649
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:00,920
Is have a have a bottle and another bottle shoved in yeah, bless him my uh, uh, buddy richie

650
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,880
Uh, I I took I was like, hey, you know, let's go

651
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,520
Let's go to drink a margarita, but that'll be a fun

652
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,000
He seemed like a guy be into that and he was like

653
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:14,680
Uh pretty hard edged after and said, you know, I you know gotta be honest

654
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,240
I don't think this place is happening. I think it's too far

655
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,880
It's at the end of the right at the end of the whole thing as opposed to i'm thinking of baba gumps

656
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,040
As you say it's in the middle. It's in the hub of all the action margaritaville's

657
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,560
It is like literally you can't see it behind the hard rock

658
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,920
You might miss it and I don't think la is really

659
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,320
adopting jimmy buffett

660
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:40,760
Yeah culture could be wrong, but I think that two story thing is I I don't think I don't think uh

661
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,480
margaritaville's on the verge of a collapse or anything, but I don't know how if it makes I don't know

662
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,080
It's gonna be a gigantic. I feel like they should have stuck out with jillian's because

663
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:54,600
Because that well, I guess maybe it's hard because I would like a david busters closer

664
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,800
I mean, there's a david busters nearby in hollywood, but

665
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,000
It's that impenetrable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard to get to and now it's close

666
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,080
Hollywood in highland. You're good. Yeah

667
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,280
I mean first of all what you guys are saying is heartbreaking and the idea that maybe this isn't the right spot for it

668
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,840
Or though like I think hollywood and highland would be a much better spot for margarita. Yeah, I think

669
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,240
Well, they have the cabo wabo

670
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:23,800
Yeah, tina's there. I think honestly a better place for it is third street promenade

671
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,440
That's right by the water. Yeah

672
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
The fear itself each yes

673
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,360
They were like bubble gump is there too. Yes now they should make it

674
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:37,720
There's i've been to the margaritaville at navy pier in chicago, right and it sucks

675
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,720
It is small and cramped and bad and it's too far from the water and it's like dirty

676
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,480
It's like it's so disappointing. So like if they did a full-on

677
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,100
Orlando style one on the pier. Oh

678
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,080
We'd be there all day. We we would never leave

679
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:58,200
I've been to the uh, atlantic city one which I would put on par with like the vegas one

680
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,520
Like it has a nice tall ceiling

681
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:06,680
It's built into the resorts casino right on the boardwalk and on the other side of the boardwalk on the beach

682
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,400
There's a land shark lager bar and grill

683
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:15,240
Um, sure it's got two and then there's the margaritaville casino area of resorts

684
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:15,800
Wow

685
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:21,960
so and I think the thing that that has a going because it's a casino and it's like always open or I think maybe they

686
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,040
close for a couple hours in jersey, but like

687
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:30,040
I remember going there around christmas one year and eating there and the place was packed

688
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:37,080
You see yeah, and that's a city walk. Yeah. Yeah, and so like casinos the vegas one's usually crowded

689
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,200
but uh city walk even like

690
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,840
you know

691
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:49,400
The end of summer ending summer, but like tuesday night. It's empty. Well, here's what I'm gonna say

692
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,160
it

693
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:57,560
Reads as an adult place if i'm a family which I would argue the majority of people in city walk are

694
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,840
If i'm a family and i'm going where are we gonna go to eat?

695
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:07,080
I think margaritaville doesn't feel like a family establishment buco di peppo feels like a family establishment far

696
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:10,860
Bump a gum feels like a fart, you know, like feel like johnny rockets

697
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,940
Uh old classic even saddle ranch which you know

698
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:20,060
I think like runs that gamut because it's like there's a little bit of an edge to it, especially when hollywood

699
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,780
But that one it was a little tamer. Yeah

700
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:27,820
You know it they're I just don't feel like it calls to families

701
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:33,580
I feel like you know it calls to the the parents even though you sit in there perfectly family oriented

702
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:39,100
But you might not know that yeah, sometimes there's stilt walkers making balloon animals. That's fun

703
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,020
Yeah, but not always you should see it in full swing sometime

704
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:48,540
I would love it is shut with a band that is instead why go in and just hear the recording of

705
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,080
margaritaville when you can hear a band playing

706
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,140
exact same way

707
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:59,020
Jason and I this is a video that never came out that I do have a copy of that

708
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,860
Maybe I will put online someday jason

709
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:07,100
I were we went to the opening of the margaritaville to cover it and saw jimmy buffett play on the stage

710
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,900
Wow, yeah 30 minutes there. So

711
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,900
We got to see the ultimate concert. I mean, that's amazing. Yeah

712
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:18,220
Yeah, and we also like that same that was last year

713
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:23,260
We went up there. I think all three of us on the day. It's soft opened

714
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:25,260
That's true

715
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,900
We got word that it opened then we went to the press event. Yes, that's true

716
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:34,620
Wow, we also went back for your birthday like a month or two later

717
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:39,920
People like oh hey, yeah. Yeah, so people started to we started to recognize

718
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:44,780
Waiters and still walkers staff has turned over those since because I haven't seen a lot of those folks

719
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:51,260
Yeah, let me ask one question. I don't mean to upset anybody here. Okay, go ahead the difference between kaba wabo and

720
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,500
and margaritaville is

721
01:01:54,780 --> 01:02:00,060
Uh, I would say it's a little more of a specific what the lifestyle is at margaritaville

722
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:04,300
I see like what the vibe is what the kaba wabo is a similar vibe

723
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:08,940
But it's just feels a little more generic to me, but it's it's trying to do what margaritaville does

724
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,780
But I'm kind of pulling some hard rock energy

725
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:18,620
Yes, yeah, I'm letting the difference. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Also the menu is primarily

726
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:23,100
I'm sure there's burgers and steaks and stuff, but it's primarily tacos burritos

727
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:27,020
enchiladas nachos that sort of guy so it's a more mexican

728
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,620
Femme, yeah, right. Um, all right, so that's an interesting

729
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,340
I mean into when you look at the rock stars behind

730
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:38,060
Sammy hagar jimmy buffett hagar a little more aggressive a little more wild

731
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,420
I think I think kaba wabo is a more unpleasant

732
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:46,540
Brand, okay, so that to me, I don't know how other people I think that's right

733
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:51,260
And we've sat though with that cool that the big table at kaba wabo cantina and hollywood and highland more than once

734
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:58,140
And we sat there before a jimmy buffett concert before a jimmy buffett, which I went I went with mike to the bowl

735
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,740
To see just like two or three years ago already, which was

736
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,380
It was fun interesting

737
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,660
But why you went with us to wire's air as well

738
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:13,980
I was there and the it like I just by he played all the hits by half hour

739
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:20,540
And he like oddly stacked at the top and then I I was just like I am thirsty for a fourth chord

740
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,580
Give me one more just give me a minor. Give me a sharp

741
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,740
Anyway, it was gda city

742
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,900
For two and a half hours and then I

743
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:41,280
His guitarist do a song like two songs and he's like goes as a glass of wine off stage. Mm-hmm. Wow, it's so fantastic

744
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:47,200
Uh his show his live show. You got to listen to live recordings. He's barely singing. He's like, yeah

745
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:52,080
Like yelling this this is the noise that comes out of his mouth when he's singing now

746
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,920
uh

747
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,920
It's I can't wait till he comes back

748
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,480
We've been talking about it jason and I were just talking about it on the way over

749
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:04,400
I will not be joining just god is gonna be a real stick in the mud. It does not want to go. I just

750
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:10,320
Be curious to see what it would be like I just want to see what kind of

751
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:15,840
Uh, can like what kind of dancers he picks because in the videos we've seen there there's a real

752
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,080
mix between different shows

753
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:23,840
Um, we we we were going too long on margaret. I could do another two hours. So now we go to the main event

754
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,840
Well, no, I I'm so

755
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,760
There are two things that I must do all I was saying is that we're only going to do 10 more minutes of

756
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,760
Uh, I'll do you hold to it. I'll do one more. I was gonna play a little math sucks

757
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:42,480
Which is the song that math sucks on your own time. Yeah, look up the song math sucks

758
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,120
uk s

759
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:50,080
That's when I fell in love with jimmy buffett, uh, and it's from his album beach house on the moon

760
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:56,000
All right. Anyway, so a couple years ago, uh, I signed up for a mailing list because margarita

761
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,040
ville

762
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:01,280
Is gonna have like a resort in orlando called margarita village and people will be able to live there

763
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,880
They'll be able to buy homes

764
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,240
There's going to be some sort of kind of water parky part of it and I think you'll be able to rent stuff for vacations

765
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:14,640
Are available for tours at the moment, but uh, they're still doing it all in phases. So the water park is not ready

766
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:19,120
So this is 2016. So I signed up for this mailing list just to you know, be in the know

767
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,680
So they would like send you stuff about like hey

768
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,400
Do you want to put 100 grand down on a house and I'd be like, oh no

769
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,920
Thanks or whatever like you get emails like that. So then I get an email from a guy and he says hey

770
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,480
Hey mike, it's time for us to begin submitting names for the streets of margaritaville resort orlando

771
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,320
I would love to have your creative help in naming our streets for the resort

772

What was the one?

802
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,800
There was one you had this car it's just shorts street that was my favorite of yours

803
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:42,720
Why I was also proud of drinking drive. Oh, yeah, because I think I had drunk drive and you had drink and drive

804
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,800
And we submitted them both

805
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:52,420
When it's a hundred and jason's I think this is yours if there was a four or six way intersection port of indecision

806
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,160
And then I explained

807
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:02,240
I have a qualifier here because I said marshall park after jimmy's friend movie producer frank marshall

808
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:10,240
So we'll post all of these on twitter. Yeah, uh, we submitted all of these and then I got a response awesome list

809
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:15,520
Mike really appreciate your creativity and time put this put this list together. I will keep you posted on the results

810
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:22,400
Uh, so that was two and a half years ago years ago every once in a while. You get a construction update, right? But

811
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:31,040
So it's not open yet. No march 27 2018. Hey there david. Just wondering if the final street names were ever finalized

812
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:37,120
Thanks, no response. Come on david. So how do we put pressure?

813
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,200
on

814
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,200
The margarita village resort

815
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,760
How can we utilize our?

816
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,040
You're competing ardent fan base

817
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,960
uh

818
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:55,280
Hundreds strong to get them to make sure that we really love all streets is one of our names

819
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,280
And it could be any of them whatever we give them such a range such a great. Yeah

820
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,520
I mean, don't you feel that maybe?

821
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,440
it's it's just throwing like a little like uh chum

822
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:10,000
Um to like, you know their fans like go name our streets, but they have no intention of using those

823
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:15,120
Yeah, and then everyone just assumes like oh, maybe that was somebody else's cool name or whatever

824
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,360
Yeah, but they don't want yeah

825
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,400
I think we got to look up this guy on linkedin to start

826
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:26,480
Make sure he's still with the company and not with another company or in jail for financial fraud or something

827
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,720
There was a there was an email in between this exchange where he said mike

828
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:36,240
We submitted over 50 names, but he doesn't say our names 50 names to the county for approval

829
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,600
Once we finalize our site plan, we will assign street names

830
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:44,000
Probably later this summer. That's 2016. So we have a great holiday weekend

831
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,960
It's if it's a government issue, right people to storm this. Let's look up whatever county it's in

832
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,360
That's what we're saying. I mean, I feel like your audience can help

833
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,960
Get this together there had but but how specifically there's got to be a way

834
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,640
Maybe it's a dual approach of hitting the margarita village

835
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,560
uh

836
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,560
Homeowners board or whatever

837
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,960
um in the and the

838
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,520
And something in the city of orlando

839
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:18,080
But i'm worried tweeting isn't going to do I think someone has to introduce a referendum to make sure here's what we've talked about people

840
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,280
Oh, yeah, that's good, too

841
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,800
I was going to say somebody with a backpack has to hop some fences

842
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,760
And see if they can get a peek at them one of these urban explorer

843
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:33,040
Types that one that's look. I don't want anyone trespassing but I have already seen

844
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,600
footage of how this

845
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,480
Uh construction is progressing via

846
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,220
drone

847
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:45,700
Somebody needs to get a drone going over the in progress margarita village

848
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,080
And zoom into any signs that you see and get the footage back to us

849
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,640
So if you're an orlando drone owner, first of all great to meet you

850
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:00,240
And happy you're listening to the podcast. We may have a lot of other jobs for you, but thing number one

851
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,880
Get that drone going over margarita village

852
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:07,440
Do you think that the idea of the village has not been built and the street names have been picked?

853
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,080
Really are indicative of the fan and the culture of the parrot head like we'll get to it man, but first

854
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,720
We don't have to do construction every morning like yeah

855
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,760
Like this is like, you know, like they put it like you just do a drone video like footage and it's like

856
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,880
Like one house like kind of halfway done like like we're on island time

857
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,440
Hard to work with disney world down the road

858
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,160
so fun

859
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:39,200
We wanted to put a barbecue grill in the center of the house, so, you know, like just weird like

860
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,120
choices

861
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,920
Um, this foundation is crooked. No, it's not

862
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,400
What's fine to me?

863
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,360
now

864
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,360
Are we moving out of margarita village?

865
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,800
I would say it's hard for me to be ripped away from it. But yes, we should probably move on

866
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:01,680
pretzels as the next which you know, I I did not partake in a wet souls today. Yeah

867
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,240
But i've partaken in wet souls before sure

868
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,240
But my concern about wet souls at universal

869
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:14,480
Is that it's not going to be up to the high standards of my wet souls thing because they have to turn over too many pretzels

870
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:20,240
Yeah, I had a pretzel today. I we split a pretzel. I had a pretzel right before we did iFly

871
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:25,680
And I gotta tell you that first pretzel I thought was good. Yeah, like a mall level pretzel

872
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:32,560
It was warm. It had the salt on it. It was very good. Now we had a second. I did not like it

873
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,600
You didn't really know that's like a standard wet soul pretzel

874
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:40,720
Yeah, I just don't like the wet soul because I had it even like and it's because I was hungry because I didn't dinner

875
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:46,160
But I was like I could really go for some more pretzel. Like I was even like craving more pretzel once it was over

876
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,200
So that's always the worst because you go back for seconds and it's never as good

877
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:57,680
There was no way I mean it was because I was hungry. Yeah, like it was an amazing pretzel

878
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:04,960
What I what I appreciate and I think that the people who are listening to this obviously you're committed too because you're 12 or 14 episodes in here

879
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:10,320
You uh, you didn't just go over to voodoo donuts, which is only a mere feet away

880
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,760
You stayed in yeah, we actually stay in the sector. Yeah, you didn't yeah

881
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,920
You could have easily just broken for the second one. You already had your pretzel

882
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,800
You could just go over to voodoo and be like this is you know

883
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,840
Yeah, you know no

884
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,920
sector breaking anywhere

885
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,920
Oh really never straight

886
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,200
No, no

887
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:34,000
And even we had a piece of pretzel and we were in the hard rock gift shop and all of a sudden jason walks in

888
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:38,000
And he's got a big cup of like wet souls like pepperoni. Yeah

889
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,240
Yeah, yeah, he's rubbing his eyes

890
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,960
And like I will say I had one of those and those were not good

891
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:50,800
I fucked up. I was concerned about doing the skydiving on an empty stomach like

892
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:56,560
No, no, no, you have to do stuff like that on an empty stomach. I I was giving starting to fade

893
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,520
And I was like, well i'm gonna get a bottle of water and I was in there anyway this morning

894
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,000
Like eight or nine

895
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Okay, i'm rocking a 6 a.m

896
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,880
Yeah, I did 7 a.m. And you're still here. Yeah

897
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:15,680
I do it. It's it's his loyalty to content. Yeah, I have to I have to place your loyalty to content

898
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,160
Every hour you're sleeping. No content

899
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,200
Yeah, they were um

900
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,720
They they were uh, that was I thought a good option. I thought it'd be interesting a good option

901
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:33,920
uh the pizza pretzel bites it said pizza, but it was really just like

902
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,220
Pepperoni baked into little bits of pretzel and it was

903
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,420
It was didn't look good to me

904
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:48,020
No looking at that cup that no, I don't like pretzels in the cup. I honestly after the the boat drink

905
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:54,340
And the skydive i'm starting to feel at all. You're jacked up. I can tell something is going on with you

906
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:59,060
I've keep mentioning it during the show. You're rubbing your eyes. You're yawning a lot. It's I am worried

907
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:02,500
We're gonna look over and you'll be as asleep as edwin is right now on the on the couch

908
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:07,780
Edwin nipped it me a little earlier. I think you went out he sometimes if you're if you're not me or lindsey

909
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:14,100
And you rub his little belly or his haunches. He doesn't like it on that. But yeah, my ride i'm screwed. Oh, you're no you're fine

910
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,820
You're gonna have to drive

911
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,820
You're gonna have to drop him off. You're gonna he's gonna have to know

912
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,980
So I can get under the cubs, you know get those covers

913
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,340
All right

914
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,540
Yeah, so

915
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:33,380
Let's also stick to the stick to the bottles of water and the regular pretzel was a was a b those

916
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:41,540
Pepperonis were a d minus you need some culpability and you really thought there was a world where a cup of pepperoni

917
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:47,460
Had those before i've had the full-size ones before and it's been fine full. What do you mean full-size?

918
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:51,940
Just a regular pretzel, but like little pepperoni baked onto the top

919
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:56,180
Really about this pretzel pepperoni

920
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:59,380
That's crazy. The thing also they were out of the hot dog pretzel

921
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,340
He's awake. Yeah

922
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:05,780
Masterpiece this is most awake. He's been all night. Have you noticed this? Yeah, I know

923
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:12,580
Pepperoni it looked like the thing you bought looked like a cup of discarded pizza crusts and somebody like smack

924
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,700
Like as we didn't eat. Yeah

925
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,460
Like you're cleaning out your car

926
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:23,860
We had a lot of

927
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:29,780
You know variables the the I we weren't sure if we were gonna hit the cutoff for the skydiving

928
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:32,900
So we didn't realize how much training?

929
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:39,380
Was here's what we've been talking and talking talking. We never said hey

930
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:44,740
We this is the one where we went indoor skydiving. It's the most exciting

931
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:50,500
Actual it's the only in all 19 of these fucking things. It's the only thing it's an actual

932
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:55,220
Full-themed experience and we never let's get excited about it now. It's a ride

933
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:59,940
We're building up to the end because we had to we started with it

934
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:03,140
You would not want to hear about wet's those pretzels. We got to walk

935
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,580
We got to walk into this like we you know, you get your this is it

936
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,540
This is your tom cruise find the helicopter sequence like they like

937
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:17,940
This is the moment you're gonna walk out remembering feel like you've done the halo jump now, yes, we all did it

938
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:22,900
I'm ready to be in a movie with tom. I'm feeling comfortable and with stunts. I fly

939
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,580
is

940
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:28,900
This experience that has alluded me but i've seen it numerous times

941
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:33,540
It's a big giant tube with a gigantic fan underneath that simulates

942
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,260
skydiving

943
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,260
and seems

944
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:42,020
Insane when you walk by it, but it gathers a large crowd

945
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:45,140
I think we all gathered a crowd in our time there

946
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:53,300
Yeah, it's interesting to see people just floating in the air and especially the instructors who are truly impressive in putting on a show

947
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:58,340
Yeah, during the day they can go real high they do flips. They do all sorts of tricks

948
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:04,420
Which now we know the system that they take in like eight at a time everybody at minimum gets to

949
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:09,780
Perhaps more and then when it's all said and done and you know how difficult it was

950
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:16,500
That here now watch what I can do and the guy does legitimately incredible like literally does a show off

951
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:21,860
Section which honestly I have to say I could do without that part

952
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:25,860
I like maybe it was because we saw about four people do show off

953
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:29,220
Minutes, but it was it was fun

954
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,100
but i'm also like

955
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,180
Well, i'm trying to get i'm trying to get up in this

956
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:38,900
Yeah, it's like it's like it's like lebron james like going like now watch me play and then you like, yeah

957
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,180
Like yeah, it's like, oh, yeah, you're great

958
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:45,460
Like all right that too buddy if he just got out of here cranked it all the way up and didn't mind me fucking myself up

959
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:50,420
Well, I mean like you look here's the thing. Oh, you should walk through the whole thing

960
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:53,460
But they only give you a minute at a time. Yeah, which

961
01:18:54,580 --> 01:19:00,500
Seems when you're in there, it seems longer than a minute. Oh, it seems like 10 minutes. Yeah, it felt so long

962
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,900
But it also feels like not enough to get fully

963
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:12,260
Uh used to it. Yeah, yeah, yeah kind of as soon as you're starting to feel although, you know what happened to me. I think

964
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:17,460
It's a long minute and that and the in like 30 to 40 seconds

965
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:20,100
I was like, I think i'm really cruising and then the rest like

966
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:25,700
Nope gone. I got too cocky now i'm wobbling around then it's not working out but yeah, but then

967
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:30,900
Yeah, I found the exit kind of fun. I like the exit yourself out there

968
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:35,380
I felt a little cool doing that even though i'm sure it did not look cool. Yeah, actually there was a

969
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:41,300
When jason exited it looked like a charlie chaplin movie like when they're like if you ever seen the gold rush

970
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:45,700
Where like he opens the door there's a big wind burst and he gets knocked back the first time you did it

971
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:50,500
You went and all of a sudden you got knocked back. I real confidently went for it and fucked it up

972
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:56,740
Yeah, which is not to say by the way, that's not the most i'm sure my first one was the most embarrassing of all of us

973
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:00,740
I mean, I think I think we all had moments. I I never felt

974
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:02,500
uh

975
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:07,460
Great, but I felt or confident. I should never they never have confident, but I feel like

976
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:14,180
It's so easy what you have to do, but it's so hard when a giant fan is pushing at you. Yeah

977
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:20,340
truly insane can we talk about first of all hats off to the ifly people because

978
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:24,740
Uh, not only did they make room for us. Yeah, they hunted us down

979
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:27,220
Yeah, we had given up all hope

980
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:32,500
Uh, and they found us in margaritaville and they brought us back in so

981
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:39,700
Kudos to the ifly team at universal studios if you are 12 episodes deep and you're hearing this you guys

982
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:44,340
Yeah, I know I said the thing about the showboating but uh, you guys are all uh,

983
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:50,100
Classy great people who cared about you know, giving us uh the the experience of a lifetime

984
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:56,500
Yeah, check kept checking in. We're really monitoring everything very it none. It was not confusing

985
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:01,460
They did a good job of paring it down to just the basics. You need to know right they throw

986
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:08,260
Yeah, I find i've found laser tag tutorials to be more complicated than what they present

987
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:12,180
It's like four things. Yes, and they but they also presented it like well

988
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,380
You need to go to school before you do it and there was a moment. I was like, oh wow

989
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:20,100
we have to like go in here and like learn something right and uh,

990
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:23,220
It's like I was saying in there. It's like

991
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,380
there

992
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,940
The uh the introduction video to soren

993
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:33,780
Uh, it seemed to be more serious than yes, so maybe we watched about a lot of guys

994
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,940
But then you enter this crazy yeah, you watch kind of a pre

995
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:44,820
Ride video where they show you the the hand signals that you need to learn

996
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:50,500
Uh, which I guess if we list them off, it's like the you know, straighten your legs bend your legs

997
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,700
Uh, just yeah chin up and relax

998
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:58,420
Toughest thing to figure out how to do because I would relax and I would fuck up

999
01:21:58,820 --> 01:21:58,980
Yeah

1000
01:21:58,980 --> 01:21:59,540
Well, yeah

1001
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:04,260
Like I would relax and I tried to get my body so relaxed then my arms would drop down right

1002
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:09,540
Head up is the trickiest thing because you always got to keep your head kind of elevated your arms are out

1003
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:13,060
like it is an interesting body position because

1004
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:19,300
It's a lot of things you have to be focused on at the same time. Yeah, also in the preview video

1005
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:24,580
They did a smart thing which I don't I don't even think I talked about this and I there was a bachelor party

1006
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:30,580
I went to where I had to drive a fast car around a track with other fast cars and the pre video

1007
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,940
Made everyone in there terrified because it threw

1008
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,220
50 things

1009
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:35,460
All right

1010
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:38,340
So what you're going to do is look at the green marker when you pass the green marker

1011
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:44,340
Then you put your eye on this other marker and you you you uh pedal to the metal you put your full gas down

1012
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:49,540
You try to drive and it's throwing all of this terminology at you and we left there going

1013
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:54,180
Oh my god, we're never going to be able to do this. What I liked about this was

1014
01:22:54,820 --> 01:23:00,100
They don't over explain everything they throw everything at you like basically once and then it's just posted on things

1015
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:06,180
And they basically kind of are like there's no way these people are going to remember exactly what we're saying until they're in there

1016
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:09,940
Which is what I mean all you basically have to do is lay down

1017
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,340
Because the air is poor, you know

1018
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:16,660
You just lay down and then kind of just be as straight as you can be

1019
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:24,180
Ultimately with your head up. I mean it weird kind of like yoga challenge. Yeah. Yeah, just being yes still and and like

1020
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:32,580
Centered which is what I blame any mishaps on with you mike is like I do feel like you just didn't catch like the

1021
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:40,180
The initial drifts correct and I don't feel like that was your fault you're saying that because because there is a person outside of the

1022
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,180
I've like controlling

1023
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,660
The speed in the wind speed of the wind

1024
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:51,460
So thank you for letting me off the hook because sure it is weird because you're not quite sure what you're doing

1025
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:54,820
Versus what they're doing because then there's a certain point where sometimes they'll turn it up

1026
01:23:54,820 --> 01:24:00,260
He'll be like, you know turn it up a little bit and then maybe that one knocked you down if you're not perfectly

1027
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:06,660
Like I think my issue was I where I was told I was like leaning too much into one of one of my hips

1028
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:12,820
But it was hard to kind of figure that out because you're also like on air. You can't like you can't it's hard to find

1029
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:19,460
Like that yoga pose because there's no ground. Yeah, are you ever?

1030
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,180
On your stomach. Yeah

1031
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,740
Like it's the rarest when I

1032
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:30,580
When I was at eye level the arms I had the hardest time going like oh, so yeah

1033
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,540
They are saying eye level but it's a little above eye level

1034
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:38,980
Yeah looking like and I would say like when I was on my back, which was an inadvertent moment for me

1035
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,780
Uh, it was way more fun

1036
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:46,340
Because because you're you're kind of scooped and you just kind of are letting it like

1037
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:52,660
Lift you and you're in this like zone. Whereas what they're what they're making you do is kind of like lay down

1038
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,660
lay down

1039
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:55,620
Flat, I don't know

1040
01:24:55,620 --> 01:25:01,860
It almost seems like it would be better if you lie down on your back on the metal grate and then you were like turn it up

1041
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:04,900
Yeah, like it feels like you go up a little bit and you just be like hey

1042
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:08,580
This is nice like that right to me like it might be a more pleasant experience

1043
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:15,220
Maybe it's harder to control your body that way tricky because like you're walking into a room where

1044
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:18,900
You're gonna basically fly up right?

1045
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:23,860
You know, so you have to like feel confident like that was scary to walk in and you were the first one of us to walk

1046
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:26,820
In scott made me go even though he was first. He was the next one

1047
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:31,620
He was in the wine thing. So we were in there with a group of children. Yes

1048
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:37,940
Children and I was right that children were much better than us

1049
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,100
It seems like and the mom was too

1050
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:45,700
And the mom was good. She went up pretty high for not having like the super high thing

1051
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:51,460
Uh, yeah, the kids were very good. There's like also here's the thing the eye for a little different size

1052
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:55,860
Like tunnels in different places because I fly is all over the country

1053
01:25:55,860 --> 01:26:00,180
So some of them like we even saw on the video have these like shooting up like, you know

1054
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:04,820
Cartier ship kind of things going on. I think this is a small one. This one

1055
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:09,620
Yeah, it's a tiny one. It's very tiny. I could have sworn in that video. You saw somebody flying through a hole

1056
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:11,620
Yeah, and then went to another thing

1057
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:17,140
I have like full like full like crazy training things like that. So like especially for me

1058
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:19,620
I was bumping into the wall. I'm six three

1059
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,260
Yeah, I'm a big guy too

1060
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,980
And I feel like I was bumping into the wall. There's a lot of like yeah

1061
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:25,620
So like well, yeah

1062
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:30,500
The kids were really doing well because clearly perfect for kids are tiny and

1063
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:35,060
They're getting hit by the right amount the right, you know ratio of air or whatever

1064
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:39,540
Yeah, so like they were that being that being said were just a bunch of adults trying to

1065
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:43,540
Make excuses for why we were so bad, but I think also at the same time just give us a little bit more time

1066
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:47,140
We only had two minutes. Yeah to do it and that was broken up into

1067
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:53,780
Segments. Did you see the chart inside? There's a chart on the wall that you could go back there to to study

1068
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:57,300
And it is as big as the periodic table of elements

1069
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:04,020
Yeah, all the courses that you could and can take. Oh, oh, yes. I did take a yeah, it is so complex

1070
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:06,580
You said when we want to be 40 of them, right?

1071
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:11,140
It's the levels of Scientology. Yeah, they're in Roman numerals. It was crazy

1072
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:15,620
I was like what is going on here because at this point if I'm gonna spend that much money at iFlight it was

1073
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:24,260
Which is it's kind of like for all of us with our universal discount. It was 190 dollars. Yeah, right. So 190 bucks

1074
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,620
Um, yeah, still that's a step down. Yeah, we know

1075
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:32,340
And if you were to do a package where you get more than two, it's really good. Yeah

1076
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:37,380
Yeah, that's crazy expensive flight and you can yeah, you can i'm just seeing how much that would be. Yeah, that's

1077
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:42,260
I don't know. It's like if you do why don't I just jump out of a plane? I guess is what i'm saying

1078
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:45,460
Yeah, especially when you there's something about seeing that chart

1079
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:50,820
Maybe that's like 50 bucks a person so seeing that like knowing knowing what you paid

1080
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:54,980
And then walking in and seeing oh wait, i'm level one of

1081
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:01,380
200 like literally that many little mini step outs. Yeah, what is going on here?

1082
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:04,500
Maybe you would hope that the class gives you a little bit more time

1083
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:07,460
In the air, but again is that skill?

1084
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:14,020
The transferable to jumping out of a plane if you are a skydiver, please let us know

1085
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:18,420
Claim that skydivers train in these

1086
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:25,140
I think tom did and I think probably did I mean no he definitely did in for the halo jump

1087
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,620
Like he did a lot of work in the halo jump. Okay, sure

1088
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:34,580
Uh, yeah, I wonder if he like did he do something where he had to restrict his oxygen because the halo jump is the is the very tall

1089
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:39,940
It's very high. He was having a tank so he had the tank so he could do fine in that tank. Oh, I see

1090
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:41,780
um

1091
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:46,260
Erin my wife who came with us she she went skydiving years ago and she

1092
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:53,220
She was passing by the sci-fi thing and saying I think it's weird because I think it's simulating like the most unpleasant. Yes, right of it

1093
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:59,780
It's not the part where you're just like gliding and it's like the most you're gonna hit in the face with the most like caustic

1094
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:06,100
Part, but I don't know. I also by the way to simulate skydiving indoors. I'm not gonna fault

1095
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:12,420
I think it's incredible technology. They figure it and I had a good time. Well, it's doing it. It seemingly is just a giant fan

1096
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:13,940
Yeah, yeah

1097
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:19,940
I had the preconceived notion going into that. I would feel a little unease of the feeling of falling which I

1098
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:23,640
recognize clearly is foolish because

1099
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,440
You mean I'm into the fan?

1100
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:33,080
Yeah, like I had that it was we were sitting there and I was like what if this is the one time that the metal

1101
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:39,240
Grading is gonna break. I do wonder they must have an emergency generator. Like if there's a power outage

1102
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:43,000
Or like an earthquake which actually happened while we were there

1103
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:51,880
I was a minor. I'm just yeah, none of us noticed but like there's got to be a backup generator that kicks in like

1104
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:57,600
Pretty that's it. We should eat it. You figure that out. Otherwise you're gonna hit flat on your face. Yeah, but

1105
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,760
Well, if you're the guy if you're doing the show

1106
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,480
Yeah, that would be a concern. But I think ultimately what you're talking about is

1107
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,200
So a fan shutting off is still rotating around so you would go down low

1108
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:18,720
I will say this I just realized it right now and never felt like I was really in the air and I was so that's

1109
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:24,600
Interesting thing for skydiving. I didn't I was never like I was worried about the height and when you'd see people go up and down

1110
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:28,480
It doesn't didn't feel like you had I mean we we all were off the ground

1111
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,160
We were all right really off the ground floating in air

1112
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:37,600
But didn't I never felt like I was I never felt like oh, I'm like, oh like I don't know

1113
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,200
I never had that feeling of such a height sensation. Yeah

1114
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:44,300
It's really they could he just as easily call it air swimming. Yeah

1115
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,440
There's a real presence of that

1116
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:53,040
Yeah, so much because so much of it is just trying to stabilize you

1117
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:58,280
So that is why it feels more like swimming than it does because you're taking your especially at this intro level

1118
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:00,280
You're trying so hard just to stay afloat

1119
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:08,840
We took an intro swimming class. Yeah, yeah, does anybody think that you might have looked cool or anything?

1120
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:15,980
I haven't really gotten to look at these videos. Well, I'm curious not to it won't be interesting trying to make your fun faces

1121
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:21,520
Sure, you're like here. I'll just throw yours. I know your direction. See what see what you generally think

1122
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:24,400
I mean, I don't think I look cool. No, ah

1123
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:31,240
It's interesting watching myself in the thing I'm like, oh interesting and I'm trying to see

1124
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:37,480
Where I'm oh, yeah, I'm tilting. It don't look cool. Oh, I'm there. I'm up a little bit. Yeah

1125
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:43,240
It's interesting. I can't even at two seconds as a victory. It was a really hard thing to maintain states

1126
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:48,360
It's interesting to see you can see yourself. You should almost get the video. Whoa. Wow

1127
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:53,940
Yeah, you should almost get the video right after you see it cuz I'm like I'm looking at myself and it's a totally different

1128
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,400
perspective and an understanding of what I

1129
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:03,120
Was doing versus what it looks like I was doing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you mean total disconnect, but yeah

1130
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,520
I'm like, oh, that's what I was doing. I have downloaded my video and

1131
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:15,000
The funniest part about it is just a man carrying me into the tunnel. That's very funny on Twitter, by the way

1132
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,280
Well, yes, there's a man just carrying me like I'm a

1133
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:24,840
Mannequin see that was a good that was a good fly there. Yeah, I had like good 20 sec 15

1134
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:29,560
I mean probably three seconds Margaritaville sign. Oh, I love it Margarita real sign right behind

1135
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:34,720
Yeah, so like I had a decent run right here and then like something hit me and I flew

1136
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,520
Mm-hmm, and then I kind of like lost but then I'm up. I'm up. I'm up

1137
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,680
I'm there then. Oh, yeah, so then okay, so

1138
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:46,800
At this point, I wasn't holding my arms out far enough

1139
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:52,680
So if you're a wrestling fan diamond Dallas page does the diamond cutter and that's kind of what they're trying to tell you

1140
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,840
It's like this, you know, it's like right kind of like this

1141
01:32:54,840 --> 01:33:00,680
So they're telling us to do that so they had a talk with all the four of us in between the first and second

1142
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,880
The children were not the children had done it perfectly the guys like all right

1143
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,800
Here's what you gotta do

1144
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:11,880
You gotta do and he's like explains it and like they're like all right cuz like they were so dissatisfied like these two dudes working

1145
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:15,920
We're like I feel like they were upset at us and then we asked how did we do and they were like, uh

1146
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:21,240
You know not not that bad. Yeah, you know, I think we were pretty I think what they were real

1147
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:26,600
I think what they wanted to do was really toss us up in the air and they were really hoping that on that second round

1148
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,360
they could get the

1149
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:31,400
You know, and I think we were all almost there

1150
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:37,400
More we could have maybe oh, I think I think yeah, we just needed like I

1151
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,200
would pay like a hundred dollars to be like

1152
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:48,960
Give me in there. Like let me just like kind of you know, you're counting down that minute. You're in a pressurized situation. Yeah

1153
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,800
Well, you go a little I think there's ways you could get six

1154
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:57,400
But I also feel like on the other hand it might have gotten boring after that, right?

1155
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:01,480
Maybe I was also ready to not be in earplugs and helmet and goggles

1156
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:05,760
yeah, the guy though we have a video of it the guy pulls me in the middle and

1157
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:11,320
Like truly like Tom Cruise throwing that guy through the window through the mirror in

1158
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,400
Possible he like throws me like up against the thing

1159
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:19,560
It didn't hurt or anything, but it's funny the video is funny and he's like no and he's like showing me higher your arms

1160
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:25,560
Have to be higher and he's like showing me like very aggressively cuz like the minute the seconds are counting down and I was like

1161
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:28,440
What's going on here? I know I was a bit intense moment

1162
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,200
Yeah, it looks like he's like screaming looks like I just did something

1163
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,040
Don't you threaten my wife?

1164
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:42,240
Green yes, it's like the first mission of house everything's like mission impossible. Let's be honest. We were just as cool

1165
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:48,520
Is that we're just cool. I felt like I was more confident with how mine went than than I thought

1166
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:52,360
But then I went and I have only looked at two seconds of video

1167
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:57,060
Right they told us to smile and I wasn't having fun. So I did successfully smile the entire time

1168
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,680
but what I thought

1169
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:05,320
Was like kind of a gentle glide. I when I looked back the wind was blowing my face back and what I and my

1170
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:12,240
Smile to me. I I think I looked exactly like Stan Laurel. I

1171
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,880
Look like a wax figure of Stan Laurel. I'm not super proud of this video

1172
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,860
But I'll throw it up. Anyway, I look like a good

1173
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:26,800
madam to so's wax figure version of myself that just says like a

1174
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:31,240
Neutral face and I don't even quite look like me because the wind is blowing

1175
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:37,440
And a man is throwing you into the garden a man is literally picking up the disposal of the girls

1176
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:43,000
Yeah wax figure if you yeah, you'll look at this video on Twitter and you'll be like, oh somebody put a dummy in there

1177
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
That looks like Mike

1178
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:52,520
Repeatability under what circumstance would you like set for some reason go do it where you could get more?

1179
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:57,780
Yeah, I would go back to I fly I would I thought the people were lovely there. They treat us really well

1180
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:00,200
I just think I do think it's something that you need to

1181
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:03,400
The from the first and the second time I felt very

1182
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:09,320
Different like I'm like, okay. I thought there's a couple of things you just get over like the idea of like I'm walking to this

1183
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:14,440
Thing I'm like and it's yeah, there's like I think you just get better exponentially. Yeah, I would do it again

1184
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:17,800
I would definitely do it again if I get tired imagine like making a point

1185
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:23,200
But if so if a group was doing it I'd be like, oh definitely and then I can kind of get to the chase a little more

1186
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,200
I also wouldn't mind

1187
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:31,520
Like it would be more fun to be in a group where it's all our group like we were four

1188
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:35,040
Mixed with four right so we don't get upstaged again. Yeah

1189
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,480
But he's a little kids. Mm-hmm, but the price tag is a little hefty

1190
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,200
Yeah, 50 50 bucks and that's with a discount for two minutes

1191
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:52,400
The fly time the way the thing is structured price wise is that to get like I guess like you can get a whole group together

1192
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:56,880
And it's so like a whole group together and you get like so many more minutes

1193
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:03,680
For like twice the price or something like like it like just spending double or something gets you so much more

1194
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,320
So it's structured to try to make you go

1195
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:12,800
I'm sure package with you know pitch more pictures and more time and I stuff so like

1196
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:19,440
Yeah, I think that would be the way you'd have to do it is get a big group together and like do the special

1197
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:24,640
Package or potentially. I don't know if I should say who but I guess someone who's been on the show

1198
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:29,920
Did it on mushrooms? Oh, no, I don't know how to handle. Yeah, I don't

1199
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,920
Yeah, I just like

1200
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:38,560
Yeah, that feels intense. But also relaxing. Maybe like, you know, if you if you got a view

1201
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:43,360
I don't know. Maybe that's the way that was the missing. Let's all

1202
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:46,160
Let's go back right now make the

1203
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:50,560
Bang on the door make them open it back up find some mushrooms on the way

1204
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,560
Yeah, this would be great

1205
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,560
4 a.m. Fire up that fan and go

1206
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,600
That's all it takes right? We're here. We're back

1207
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,600
Get it going

1208
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,440
We so the waiver you have to say you have to sign a waiver

1209
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:07,920
Which is like, you know if anything happens bad to you, it's not our fault

1210
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:08,560
Yeah

1211
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,960
And it tells you like if you have any heart trouble back trouble or your shoulder has ever been

1212
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:20,240
Dislocated and my shoulder has been dislocated. It was a casual dislocation

1213
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:23,120
Right. It was a car accident and it was like

1214
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:28,560
Hang in there for like a little and I was like, ah and like popped it back in

1215
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:33,440
And like sometimes if I'm like leaning on it or something or weird or honestly

1216
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:38,560
Sometimes if I sneeze into it, like it kind of goes like it can pop in and out a second

1217
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,560
And I'm reading this and I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm gonna die

1218
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,280
I'm gonna pop in and out a second and I'm reading this and I'm like, I hope this isn't a problem

1219
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:49,120
But you braved it for the podcast. I mean that's it. I'm a theme park journalist

1220
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,520
Content. Yeah

1221
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,120
Glory to content

1222
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:58,720
So yeah, so I was like I was a little worried going in and I was so tense the first minute

1223
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:05,440
I think that's really more what did it but I was like, oh no, my shoulder hurts after this first round

1224
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And then I was like, does it hurt or is it in my head?

1225
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,520
I can't tell and then that second time since I was so much more comfortable

1226
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:18,000
It my shoulder felt better right after it popped back in so it well that didn't pop out during the

1227
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,200
Yeah, so maybe but maybe it will never pop out again

1228
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:27,600
So I do think like yeah that like tense like just a first a minute of like getting your but I know you scott and jason

1229
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:33,520
Said they felt sued by it. Yeah, and I were saying we were tense afterward. Yeah, I felt like well

1230
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,360
I felt this thing of like

1231
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,480
um

1232
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,320
Like my body was just being I mean, I guess my body was being beaten by a fan

1233
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:43,520
so it's almost like my body was like hot from

1234
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:50,160
Like a very like intense. Yeah thing. Yeah, it was interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I wasn't relaxed

1235
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:53,040
So definitely wasn't relaxed. It was like my body had to kind of like

1236
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,640
Like chill out for a second. Yes, I felt like

1237
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,760
There was a time when I went on like a stressful hike and like yeah

1238
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:06,880
It was like it was going downhill and like I was like skidding on like dirt

1239
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,440
And I remember just being stressed out for like 15 minutes and I got down to the I felt like

1240
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,680
Like fucked up

1241
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:16,480
15 minutes and it was because my body is warm and I was like, yeah

1242
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:22,000
Yes for too long and like yeah, so it was similar to that but not as severe

1243
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:27,600
But yeah, the second time I was doing good tired afterwards and then we got back to the car

1244
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:31,760
I started to feel the like yeah, like I had had a massage

1245
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,960
Yeah, but now you're a so what would you say?

1246
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,280
Now I feel like honestly my stomach feels like I am dying

1247
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,920
Yeah, you know

1248
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:48,480
The the zen zone versus that massage. What oh, yeah sure. What what what is better experience?

1249
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,880
I fly or the zen zone

1250
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,000
uh

1251
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,960
I play as a more interesting experience. Yeah

1252
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,960
Yeah

1253
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:04,880
What if it's relax massage i'm just talking about the massage after effect, uh, I think zen zone zen zone was so generous

1254
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:10,400
They tossed in so much extra stuff. They were so nice. I fly they gave us free stuff too. They were also yeah

1255
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:15,440
They were very nice. Yeah, which you know what which helps make up for all of the other the city walk

1256
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,080
uh nonsense such as the

1257
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:22,320
The parking I know you had a slight tail of parking. Whoa, yeah too much money

1258
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:28,960
I thought it was a discount but still that only knocks off. There's a valet right and and the valet is a great

1259
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:36,400
uh addition to any big theme park, uh, you know like to be able to get your car quickly and get out and it

1260
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:42,800
Dumps you right into this heart of city walk. But one of the things that you have to do with that is

1261
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,440
You pay a premium

1262
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:49,200
And but you can get validated and I knew that we were going to be at margaritaville

1263
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:52,560
And I knew that was going to be a validation that I could definitely use down the past

1264
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:57,540
They lure you into this like idea that the movie theater can somehow validate

1265
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,320
But it's it's not it's a very complicated process. Give you five dollars in cash

1266
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,400
Yes, if you go up after the movie with your receipt. Yeah

1267
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:12,480
which takes off, um a little bit on a very expensive thing so, um

1268
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:18,320
Normally if you're there for over two hours, it's 45 dollars under two hours

1269
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:23,200
It's like 25 dollars. I think that's about the ratio. Um, I could give or take

1270
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:24,640
um

1271
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:28,480
And so when we went to sky fly or ifly they were like hey

1272
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:35,040
We can validate if you did valent as like I did he's like but you have to also make sure they see your certificate

1273
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:39,920
I was like really because we got a little diploma you missed it. So I I I went there

1274
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:44,880
They've already stamped it. They've rubber stamped the thing they in the valet center boom

1275
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,120
Give it to him. He goes do you have the certificate? I'm like, yeah

1276
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:54,800
so I had to unravel my certificate from my pants pocket and then put it up on the uh, you know,

1277
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,680
Glass window like i'm

1278
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:03,840
Hunter like, you know like robert denaro in the beginning of midnight run. I'm like boom. Look at those check marks

1279
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:10,000
stable body got up in the air listened to the commands, you know, and and he looked at he

1280
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:12,080
genuinely

1281
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,580
looked at it

1282
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:20,560
Examined it and approved it and then said okay, you've been validated. I've seen your thing

1283
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,880
$25 and it was still

1284
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:29,980
$25 with a validation like and that's the thing that I feel like back in the day

1285
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:36,480
Universal when you could get validated they would give you a reasonable parking rate now

1286
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:43,120
25 bucks is the most reasonable you're gonna get we did have the for I did dm you and say hey, so it's after six

1287
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:45,440
general parking's 10

1288
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:49,520
valet in theory will partially validate but we had a weird

1289
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:56,880
We had a weird experience with our pal jason. Walter. I'm looking here and I believe our problem was

1290
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:00,560
You would have gotten free parking if it was two and a half hours

1291
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:04,560
Okay, so because it was probably two hours 40 minutes

1292
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,720
Okay you which

1293
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:12,040
Yeah, this all there should be this is a farce you were a great

1294
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:18,440
You're a grown man showing another grown man a certificate up against a window that I'm flying

1295
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,320
They only give it to you they only

1296
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,280
Allow you to show your diploma on the first time flight. Did you hear what he said there?

1297
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,280
He's like they only will they only will

1298
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,240
Validate that first time if but meanwhile, it's more expensive than most restaurants

1299
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:39,640
It's a $50 ticket to fly like why are we not validating this like and also?

1300
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:44,880
What are you penalizing the students of the school, which I can only imagine are like in the dozens

1301
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:52,600
Like you know, it's not like you're not like it's not like thousands of people are using this loophole of like I'm a

1302
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:58,800
I fly students. Yeah, these indoor skydivers think they don't they're so entitled

1303
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,880
They think they don't have to pay $45 for parking every time and I will say

1304
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:07,520
You know and I saw that I could have parked in general parking

1305
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,680
I could have even parked it for free because I'm an annual passport holder at Universal

1306
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,320
But I have such an issue with their parking structure

1307
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:20,000
I was like by the time I park in that thing and then walk to wherever ever you guys are

1308
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,440
It's gonna like eat up another 15 minutes or something

1309
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,240
You don't know what garage they'll send you to

1310
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:32,240
I mean we're gonna cover this look where if you like what just happened if you want to hear more about all this

1311
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,600
We're going to be litigating all of this in the finale

1312
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,520
We haven't given away the full list, but the finale of all this

1313
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:45,120
We're gonna go out in a glorious blaze of a ton of discussion of this nature

1314
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:52,800
And we have got I here I'll start teasing it now and say I don't want to just this to be fruitless complaint

1315
01:45:52,800 --> 01:46:00,320
I want Universal to hear this discussion and I want these policies to change

1316
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,840
As much as I want our street names in Margaritam

1317
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:04,640
I agree

1318
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:09,120
Here's what I think I'm gonna give it out to like take it into your episode

1319
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:15,360
I believe that annual passport people should have the preferred parking

1320
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,760
I feel like that should be up on the thing

1321
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:18,400
Yes

1322
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:19,920
At the park you're already spending X hundred

1323
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,360
What does that cost them?

1324
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:26,640
Yeah, what does that cost you and then I also believe that if you are an annual passport member

1325
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:31,520
You should get a discount on valet a discount 10 percent 5 percent

1326
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,400
Okay, yeah

1327
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:36,640
Give me something because that that annual passport did really help us at iFly

1328
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:37,360
Yeah

1329
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:43,360
Just bringing it down bringing down the price from like 217 to 190

1330
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,200
They really worked with us. They were great

1331
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:45,680
Yeah

1332
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:52,080
Yes, but this but the parking Gestapo at Universal is will is non-negotiable

1333
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:58,400
I feel like it would be ridiculous to say annual pass holders should get something special at Disneyland

1334
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:05,680
Because there are so many I feel like the annual pass holder for Universal is a much much smaller

1335
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:08,240
You would think right?

1336
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:14,400
I also think that the general I don't know your read if you tell people you're going up to city watch

1337
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:18,560
I don't know if people are like really or if he'll make funny you've lived in LA for a while

1338
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:25,920
It's a kind of a joke to think that City Walk Universal is actually like a vital vibrant part of LA

1339
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:32,960
And I think a lot of the reason why people stay away from it up there is that parking situation is so terrible

1340
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:40,640
I think they must start bending these rules and then yes and letting you like if you're parking on the right

1341
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:48,000
If you're going to a restaurant on the right side get to park in the right side this thing where you have no choice

1342
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:55,680
It's also I mean look there's so many big ticket items there if I'm gonna go see an IMAX you gotta go

1343
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,160
I like that I like that IMAX

1344
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:58,960
That's our movie

1345
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:05,520
Yeah, that's where I hit it up all the spots so it's like I feel like let's just work out a better validation plan here

1346
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:10,880
Let's see now is it still handing you cash? Grubby cash dirty money

1347
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:16,640
Yeah, I think that we could not that I'm under the illusion that so many people listen to this

1348
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:23,120
But I think by virtue of that we're the only people talking about this issue on any platform

1349
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:28,480
I feel like we could affect change in real change and we're not negative. We're not naysayers

1350
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:33,280
This is a water cannon shot over the bow of Universal

1351
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:37,200
You know this is this is it yeah and also while we're at it

1352
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,920
Look, I know we're not in a time that's appropriate for this

1353
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:46,320
But uh if we're making changes at Universal we gotta bring back that Bill and Ted show I know

1354
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,320
Oh boy

1355
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:52,320
That's a whole other thing

1356
01:48:52,320 --> 01:49:02,320
It's something that I am conflicted about in many ways but I think you could bring it back and curb some of the overtly misogynistic and racist elements

1357
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,320
I would say curb it entirely

1358
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:08,320
This is a bizarre conflatings at the whip

1359
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:16,320
The idea that vice has attacked us so now we can't do our homophobic show

1360
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:24,320
We love that the pop culture characters are all meeting each other and dancing to Gangnam Style

1361
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:28,320
Absolutely let's just be a little more socially sensitive

1362
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:32,320
And this idea that like oh so I know everything's off limits now PC

1363
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:36,320
No just don't be a jerk to these people otherwise do whatever you want

1364
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:42,320
You just write something that's not so fucking base and I will say it got more and more base every year

1365
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:48,320
And I think that that's competing with Nots Very Farms which has another show very similar

1366
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:52,320
That's very like pushing the boundaries

1367
01:49:52,320 --> 01:50:00,320
When I first saw that Bill and Ted Excellent Adventure it was much more pop culture stupid like Kung Fu Panda eating

1368
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:08,320
Like Kung Fu Panda eating, Panda Kitchen and then farting and all those seats shook

1369
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:12,320
And I'm like that's a level of humor I'd like to see

1370
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:16,320
You just want to see the Ready Player One do the backpack dance

1371
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:27,320
Well you know there's this at UCB there's been a show that our friends Brad and Nick do that is the Bill and Ted show

1372
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:36,320
Well I think that we might have started that because many years ago we did it for a special comedy bang bang

1373
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,320
The Christmas comedy bang bangs

1374
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:44,320
And we did it like for three or four years straight and we would call in all these dumb favors

1375
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:50,320
And have Jonaham dressed as his mad man character Don Draper

1376
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:55,320
And we would put like Brett Gellman and I would play Bill and Ted and we did like

1377
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,320
Oh I didn't know all this

1378
01:50:57,320 --> 01:51:01,320
Yeah me and Scott Ackerman would write the scripts with Gellman too

1379
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:06,320
And it was like a 15 page script and we would do it before the Christmas comedy bang bang

1380
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,320
We did it for like three years

1381
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,320
Gotcha wow wow

1382
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:13,320
And it was really a challenge to write the stupidest thing you could possibly write

1383
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:20,320
Which but also but like this other show and probably what you guys did

1384
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:24,320
I imagine there were moments where like sometimes you're doing a snark version of it

1385
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,320
But sometimes it is just a genuine

1386
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:31,320
Like doing those kinds of jokes in a genuine fashion are pretty fun

1387
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:36,320
We tried to write the show that we actually thought they would make

1388
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:39,320
And not comment on the show that they were doing

1389
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:49,320
And when and the grand like payoff would be to go see it and then see if we got close

1390
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:56,320
And I remember one year we got very close to like three or four jokes and it felt really awesome

1391
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,320
It would depend on what you were doing at a manager

1392
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:06,320
But what if Universal Studios reached out and said we want you and Brett Gellman or whoever to actually do it this year

1393
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:13,320
And you would hire the writers but you would have to do all the shows

1394
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:17,320
Or a month and a half

1395
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:22,320
Do a residency, a Universal Studios residency in the park

1396
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:27,320
Take over in a genuine, in a hard comedy fashion

1397
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:32,320
One night only, like Hollywood Bowl, like Willy Wonka, I'm in

1398
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:36,320
Or you can have your script in front of you

1399
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:40,320
I'm not going to give you a good show, I'm going to memorize it

1400
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,320
Mild dancing, mild choreography

1401
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:50,320
I'll rehearse, I'm just not going to commit to the seven shows a night for like a month and a half

1402
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:54,320
I feel like, yeah I would do the seven shows in one night

1403
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:59,320
Or two nights, I would do a weekend at Universal, residency as a small residency

1404
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:02,320
Well maybe this is, 14 shows in two days

1405
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:05,320
They should do that in exchange for an overhaul of the parking system

1406
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:08,320
Oh yeah, if you, yes, look what you get

1407
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:11,320
You get Paul Scheer as Bill, or I don't know who you were

1408
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:17,320
I was, yeah I was always Keanu Reeves' character

1409
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:19,320
Oh okay, wonderful

1410
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,320
Yeah so it was a great, and look now they're coming back now too

1411
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:24,320
So there's a chance for them to come back

1412
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:29,320
This would be the time, how exciting, feel like when they did that Hell House show

1413
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:32,320
Where like, where big comedians participated in this

1414
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,320
Yeah, yeah

1415
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:39,320
The original thing, yeah okay, so the carrot on the stick for Universal Studios

1416
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:42,320
Falls in for 14 shows

1417
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:48,320
And just give me a call, and I'll say one other thing as we're wrapping up here

1418
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:51,320
If Margaritaville does close

1419
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:55,320
I say, get a Void

1420
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:59,320
Yeah, can they do that though?

1421
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:02,320
I think Void is all up in Disney's stuff

1422
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,320
So yeah, I don't think that they can

1423
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:07,320
Do you want a Void alternative, because there are other companies now doing it

1424
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:11,320
I mean look, put an escape room up there, put something, I think a Void would be

1425
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:13,320
I mean yeah

1426
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:15,320
There's IMAX VR too

1427
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:18,320
I've done that, it's like home, I have home VR and it's the same

1428
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:21,320
Void is way more

1429
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:22,320
It's good

1430
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:27,320
Yeah, but by the way, you know, get a Universal property in there, come on, you know, do something like that

1431
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:29,320
Yeah, there's a lot of games

1432
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:30,320
Kung Fu Panda

1433
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:34,320
Kung Fu Panda meets Mika and

1434
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,320
Yeah, Joe, yeah, sure, and Donny Deutsch

1435
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:42,320
Well, I think on that note, Paul Scheer, you've again survived Podcast The Ride

1436
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:43,320
Thank you so much

1437
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:44,320
And the City Hall edition

1438
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,320
I'm so happy to be back

1439
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:52,320
Oh yes, well, thanks for spending your evening with us in this multi-destination

1440
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:58,320
It was a real highlight, it was a real highlight to travel with you guys, to fly with you guys

1441
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,320
Hey, brothers in flight

1442
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:06,320
Yeah, we rocked out, we went to an island and we went up in the air, man

1443
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,320
It was a wild ride, bro

1444
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:12,320
Really did it, and oh look, the stone, the stone is descending

1445
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,320
The stone is coming, we have done it again

1446
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:24,320
It's in the shape of, oh it's Jason and he's indoor skydiving but not in a tube

1447
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:28,320
He's inside a Wetzel's pretzel cup

1448
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:35,320
And he's spinning around and there's pepperonis almost like air dancing around him

1449
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:40,320
And somehow that Jason looks even worse than I feel

1450
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,320
Than the Jason I'm looking at right now

1451
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:51,320
Wow, well add it to the collection and you know, Paul, you also by the way, this idea was really announced and born when you were here

1452
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:58,320
I know, I feel very honored that it's come full circle, you know, from Pleasure Island to City Walk

1453
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:02,320
I really feel like I'm carving out a place for myself

1454
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,320
If you ever want to talk about a ride, feel free

1455
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:09,320
No, I only want to do around like, part Jason

1456
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:12,320
So if there is a, if there is a

1457
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:16,320
Do you want us to, we could do the Knott's gift shop where they just sell the jams and stuff

1458
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:22,320
Oh yeah, I mean I'm down for that, I'm down for, you know, any of those boardwalks

1459
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:25,320
Oh yeah, sure, yeah, yeah

1460
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:29,320
Shop attraction adjacent to theme park

1461
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:32,320
Yeah, where you get close enough but not in it

1462
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:35,320
Yeah, no actual vehicle can move

1463
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:38,320
If there's a sunglass hut nearby, I'm there

1464
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:41,320
Lightly themed, but not too much

1465
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:43,320
Thank you again

1466
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:45,320
Well, see you in Sector 13

1467
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:46,320
If I live

1468
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,320
If Jason is still alive

1469
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,320
Okay, Jason's really not doing well

1470
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:51,320
Goodnight

1471
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:52,320
