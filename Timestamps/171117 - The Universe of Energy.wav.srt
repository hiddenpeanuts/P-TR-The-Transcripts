Feral Audio.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,660
Warning, today's podcast may include extreme amounts of oil industry propaganda, thrilling

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,540
live descriptions of comic book panels you can't see, and multiple references to Disney

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,360
Parks and Resorts head Bob Chapek.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,040
All this and twisting turning discussion of Epcot Center's Universe of Energy.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:49,240
Wrap in and enjoy Podcast the Ride.

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:01:18,480
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the only theme park podcast with very mild profanity.

8
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:48,400
And many other fine podcasts.

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Sorry about that everybody.

10
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:45,320
I'm scanning my head right now and there's four Disney parks so that doesn't work.

11
00:02:45,320 --> 00:03:14,360
So we're on to the second one.

12
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,320
Blue who's a little bird who's their mailman and then they have a friend named Gela Tony who's an Italian painter cat

13
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,400
Yeah, and then there's another character who's a rabbit that I'm forgetting

14
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,900
We're gonna do a whole episode on Duffy at a certain point, but yeah, we are

15
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,360
Whatever week that is Scott gets the flu this flu season

16
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,100
A lineage of Duffy the Disney bear feel free like parents going out of town

17
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:52,280
You guys do whatever you want. We just tank the podcast by talking about the stuffed animal universe

18
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,600
That is Duffy the seven and a half hour edition is entirely Duffy

19
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,440
Well, yeah, that's that's

20
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:08,560
Well one bit of dry arcania and we're talking about another one today the the universe of energy one of the

21
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,740
original Epcot attractions from 1982

22
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Shifted gears in 1996 and became Ellen's energy adventure and is about to shift gears again

23
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
and become the

24
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
potentially a Guardians of the Galaxy

25
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,360
Attraction that's the overall what we're looking at possibly the most insidious of the original Epcot future

26
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,360
world

27
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Yeah, well and for what reason?

28
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,540
For the sponsorship of Exxon like the the

29
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:48,240
How much fossil fuel industry talking points this ride is I mean for the time I get they they do talk in the original

30
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,120
ride a lot about like

31
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,560
Hydro power and solar power and with power they pay some good lip service to future things that they will lobby against

32
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,300
Yeah, it's basically what happens also like with this opening in 82 like Exxon was already doing

33
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:11,860
Research on climate change and like had pretty much figured out like all of the major oil companies had pretty much figured out the climate

34
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,640
Change was real. Yes, and I read 1978 they knew and this thing opens in 1982

35
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,820
so they knew and then they sponsored this right till

36
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:28,820
2004 and yeah, even on the second version of it. There's stuff like oh, isn't it fun to drill like drilling is fun

37
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:35,260
There is there is a part in the remake and we'll get into it with with Ellen and Bill Nye where Ellen says

38
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,260
Why don't we just make everything solar and Bill Nye says hang on?

39
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,160
Ellen Jesus today's like most one of the most prominent climate change activists Bill Nye the science guy

40
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,480
Like to what was that? I said we'll get into him later. Oh boy. Oh the gloves are off in this episode

41
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,360
Is there a way for this one of anything? We've talked about feels like a ride that

42
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,240
Potentially listeners might not know is there what's like the quickest way to explain?

43
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,440
So it's an opening day. It's an opening day action for Epcot Center. It's a moving theater

44
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,080
it's like you get into these cars that that essentially make a

45
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,280
theater and then they

46
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,520
Move like through dioramas and then they shift into like individual cars

47
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,320
They shift into a line and kind of come back to the theater

48
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,680
Set up at the end of the and in the middle you you go through this like kingdom of the dinosaurs

49
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,000
So if you have vague recollection of a Disney World trip

50
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,120
Yeah, you went through a dinosaur world that then might be what that's probably the only thing you remember is the dinosaur robots

51
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,320
And if you said all right, like if you looked at old Epcot Center maps

52
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,120
There'd maybe be a little cartoon dinosaur poking up out of the roof for the thing which was like the encouragement

53
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,000
for for kids to come in because they were not necessarily thrilled by discussion of turbines and

54
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,400
You know shale and said an 80s 70s 80s easy listening music that like

55
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,080
Tracked the ride that stuff is good though

56
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,600
And checking it out that's actually the best but it's my favorite part of the ride from re-examining it today

57
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,760
There's multiple there's still like energy like I feel like we should do a mystery science theater sort of thing

58
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,880
We're just throughout the ride. We just start off thinking energy. I

59
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,840
Have I downloaded like there's three different versions, right?

60
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,120
There are three different songs and they're all tremendous and we will get maybe I guess I'll play them

61
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,240
There's an opening at the opening day

62
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,420
Ceremonies a bunch of people come out dressed in all white and do a choreographed number and sing one of the songs

63
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:45,040
It's incredible cuz like Exxon employees and like CEO or whatever get up there and they speak about this and enjoy the ride

64
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,420
And then like a bunch of people in white jumpsuits and like a very like ABBA ask

65
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:55,660
Yeah, like dance medley start doing the song like a 70s variety show breaks out around like very stiff suit

66
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,780
Giant like butterfly wing type. Yeah. Yeah, it's a little bit more spare than that

67
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,660
They don't have a lot of production but but it is in that realm that isn't the in this area

68
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,740
This is an area by the way that I imagine you guys have watched a lot of these two like as theme park nerds

69
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:18,460
We were versed in the area of ride opening ceremonies and there's a lot of like really grainy bad

70
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,300
videos of these things on YouTube like here's like the

71
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,460
awkward little ceremony where like Mickey Mouse hands the keys to Star Wars to Star Tours over to

72
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,540
C3po and the Darth Vader tries to interrupt it, but then all the characters

73
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,840
I don't know ask him to leave and he does

74
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,100
There's a lot of great a little like there's a really good one for back to the future

75
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,460
The ride there's a very awkward opening ceremony for Guardians of the Galaxy mission breakout

76
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,580
Yeah, that's still certainly yeah still doing these like bad like awkward things

77
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,560
We're like there's you're like, oh is the collector gonna come on then?

78
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,220
It's just it is Benicio del Toro, but he's not in his costume and he's like, well you expecting someone and then everyone's kind of confused

79
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,060
Yeah, you're expecting collector Benicio del Toro and you got like three Heineken's deep

80
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,300
Toro like his other project wandered on stage

81
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,980
No one's quite sure what to do and then head of parks and resorts

82
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,340
Bob Chapick is up there and he's not the greatest speaker in the world

83
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:20,900
Yeah

84
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:27,660
They set up a story that like you are now in the story of the ride and then some executives talk to you

85
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,500
And then you get back into the story of the ride characters from Guardians of the Galaxy come out speak to you introduce

86
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:42,100
resorts head Bob Chapack and then and like all of the care all the real actors who played the characters next two

87
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,420
Iterations of the characters. These things are always so confusing

88
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,540
You never see like we're the deepest of nerds and we only sort of know about these

89
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,620
Like it's it's hard to tell it's not like they go viral

90
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,740
You know what? I mean, like you gotta see what happened at the opening of

91
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Luigi's flying tires

92
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,420
Local contest winners thrill is Bob Chapack takes the stage

93
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,580
I went oh I saw a really sad one for the opening of

94
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,700
So the reopening of soak city, which is the nuts very far

95
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:22,060
Oh, right theme park and there was a very stiff little ceremony where like the mayor of Buena Park shakes hands with us with the snoopy

96
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Walk around character and then you know a tiny amount of confetti goes off and

97
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:33,100
Snoopy gives as big of a thumbs up as he can and his constricted suit. I'm a fan of these

98
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,020
I know I watch all we should have we should review them all on a future of it

99
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:42,060
Well, I also really like and I don't know if they still I don't think they do these much anymore

100
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,940
But it was like a big thing on ABC in the Disney Channel in the 90s of like a special about the ride

101
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,620
We talked about the Indiana Jones one on that episode and like the Tower of Terror one with Kirk Cameron is also

102
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,940
something to watch

103
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,180
Living Seas with John Ritter

104
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,700
Yeah, they used to have enough like promotional budget to do an individual special for every single ride that opened

105
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,780
I'm sure they'll do one for Star Wars land, too. They'll probably be like an ABC special

106
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:16,020
Yeah, they did get Harrison Ford to introduce like footage of it at whatever whatever special that was

107
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,740
Oh, yeah, there's like a Disneyland thing on like ABC and we watched it and it was live from the Kodak theater

108
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
Whatever that's called now

109
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,820
You should enjoy the whole new galaxy opens of delight and fun

110
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,220
What will await you up in the galaxy's edge?

111
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,500
Assuming I do not perish in a flight in the near future. I look forward to look out for replicants

112
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh fuck wrong

113
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
wrong project

114
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,940
Wrong project. God damn it. Callista I need the copy

115
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
Why does Callista have the copy?

116
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:58,100
She was just helping out. She was just like got roped into helping. Print it in a bigger font next time damn it

117
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,220
I don't want to look at it on the iPad. I like a paper copy

118
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,980
So I learned my dialogue for witness and it's how I'm gonna do this

119
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,500
I think this is the second time we've done a riff on Harrison Ford's voice

120
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,700
I think we did it in the Indiana Jones ride to where he was announcing the holidays

121
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:21,860
The old Harrison we love him. So yeah, the ride video is something to watch for for the open

122
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,860
I mean the opening video

123
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,220
Energy. Oh, here's what I'm gonna say about this ride in general. This is the first time we're

124
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,420
Doing the research for the attractions that we talked about has felt like work

125
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,100
This was so arduous because there's two rides both of them

126
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,380
45 minutes long so long like a feature film to watch

127
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,220
These videos if you put them together it'd be about the length of this podcast

128
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,700
Yeah, I'll accept with like much more giant holes of silence

129
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,220
it's like the slowest narrator and then like a

130
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:03,020
15 minute little slow jaunt through dinosaur world with no dialogue no music

131
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:09,140
These things are such slogs both versions. Yeah, I think though the the

132
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:16,600
Attraction itself is like a great illustration of the evolution from like the original vision of Epcot to the

133
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:23,980
90sification of Disney to like the possible future of like an IP based Epcot. Mm-hmm

134
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:30,740
Yeah, it follows kind of the arc that some of the other pavilions have had world of motion into test track and journey into

135
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:38,020
Imagination like the Eric Idle journey into imagination like I feel like some of the stuff that Disney did in the 90s

136
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,660
They're like well, we got to make this contemporary and they weren't

137
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,940
Thinking a lot about the fact that it could be there for 20 years

138
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,060
Like well it starts Epcot starts out in a lot more of a dry like this

139
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,860
Especially more than anything is like a film strip you're watching in school

140
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:02,860
Like this is just a video that's supposed to explain something to you and then there's some robots and then they explain more things to you

141
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,380
So like they were realizing in the 90s like this is dry as shit. Like this is like, yeah

142
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,340
This is this is homework to watch

143
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:16,380
Let's just throw a care a person people love and then that'll make everything like that'll make the medicine go down easier

144
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,020
And what network are we thinking about acquiring?

145
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,060
And who is their top star Tim Allen?

146
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,540
We've already like used every favor from him every

147
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,180
Who is number two or three or four?

148
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,180
It would have been great if they got like Richard Karn or something to do. That's true

149
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,700
That would have been like Richard Karns energy adventure and then

150
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,920
2017 it was still there credit where it's due Ellen and Bill Nye are both in like culturally relevant

151
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:51,640
Yeah, they're still around so as Alex Trebek as is Alex Trebek who appears in the second

152
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,900
Why is it probably that it lasted so long?

153
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,340
It's cuz the kid those people are still people that people know well

154
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,620
There was enough time for Bill Nye the science guy to completely disappear from

155
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,020
relevance like because I remember going in the mid 2000s and

156
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:11,100
Thinking like do people have any idea who this is and now he is back with a Netflix series and

157
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,220
Constantly in the news and yeah. Yeah, he had enough time to disappear and come back. He was just in

158
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,980
Academia for a while. He was like the distinguished visiting professor at Cornell when I went to Ithaca

159
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,340
My mom is a teacher and got to meet him at a conference or something and she like it she lost her mind

160
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:39,140
Oh my eating a beetle for when you're a teacher mom my elementary school like fourth grade teacher like loved Bill Nye

161
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:45,440
We would watch Bill Nye stuff. She loves science. She loved teaching kids science and we'd watch Bill Nye like every other day. So like

162
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,320
1996 like yeah, sure. He should be in the right kids loved him and a very popular Disney

163
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,960
Product. Yeah, that's right Disney produce. He's currently suing them

164
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
like

165
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Profits like profit sharing it he missed out on

166
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
More of a Beakman kid

167
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:13,720
Beakman more it was more funny at a rodent sidekick. Yeah, Beakman was definitely sassier. Yeah, he was sassier

168
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:21,440
So yeah, anyway, I found Beakman like sort of caustic and unpleasant and he was certainly caustic broad costumes the wardrobe

169
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,840
Yeah, cool it guys. I mean, I'll be honest. I have not revisited Beakman in many years. Yeah

170
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,400
We'll catch up. I'm sure there is elsewhere on feral. There's a Beakman's world

171
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,960
Podcast we'll listen to that before we discuss Beakman's world

172
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:43,480
Me on whoever does that one it is crazy looking at this ride and seeing like

173
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,120
This hasn't necessarily aged super well

174
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,120
But then like looking at stuff from around the same time like Tower of Terror or Indiana Jones

175
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,840
So it's like these are still both terrific

176
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:01,420
and I don't know if that was just a team working on them or like that they were totally original creations or like

177
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:07,920
Well, because you well it because the the 96 redo has to like use the bones of the 80s. That's true

178
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,120
so but it is what this brings up a point of like all

179
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,320
The rides you almost all the original rides in Disney World and Disneyland

180
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,880
I can see where people were like this is gonna be fun

181
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,440
Maybe a little informative and like kids and adults are gonna like this

182
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:29,200
Yeah, and it does kind of boggle my mind that they put this in Epcot and we're like, yeah, this is great

183
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,720
This like holds up to all the other stuff we've got in the other park

184
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,200
like I get what they were going for but it's like

185
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,080
Wow, what a 45 minutes and most of it's just a film strip. I understand like big screens

186
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,440
I guess you the big screens are bigger they were thinking I loved spaceship Earth and I love

187
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,520
Like the seed where all the like fruit carts ran into each other

188
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,360
There's comedy there's like a audio animatronic comedy

189
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:03,820
Yeah, yeah, so I guess they were trying to with the with the update like trying to put some like, you know personality into the ride

190
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,360
But then if you don't if you don't know the history of it

191
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,480
If you don't know that it's like Ellen invading a pre-existing ride that was kind of dry like imagine the tourists

192
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,680
last year going into this seeing a

193
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,680
20-year-old

194
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,040
20 years out of date version of Ellen who takes you into a world of dinosaurs

195
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,400
It just doesn't like you need the context even understand what you were looking at and why you're going on

196
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,760
We I went on it three days before it closed forever. Yeah, and

197
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,840
People there was a man next to us an older man who fell asleep

198
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,820
During it Lindsay my girlfriend started nodding off in the middle of it

199
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,960
I mean, it's you know, it's hot out there and but still like it's such a boring

200
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,200
Experience it's hard to imagine anybody

201
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,320
like truly feeling great about this about this ride and like

202
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,800
Like what person walks out of it beaming?

203
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,960
and also, I found clips last night of

204
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,440
Both Ellen and Bill Nye in the recent past talking a little shit about it

205
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,800
Like like Bill Nye makes he doesn't like explicitly insult it

206
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,680
But he says and why is this a great ride air conditioning and then Ellen?

207
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,240
referred to the rides and removal she actually talked about it on her show and kind of was

208
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,200
side-snarking about it like she did like a hashtag

209
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,120
Educational as she's making little and she did a bit asking for animatronic back like yeah clothes

210
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,600
Which I think is a funny bit like can I have it now that you're done with it?

211
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,400
Can I just have it like I think that's a funny the truth is it's gonna be repurposed for Star Wars land

212
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,940
I like that was into a they just like put like a first-order

213
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,960
Uniform on it and then like put sunglasses over

214
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,480
You don't know that many robots that quickly Garner Holt just can't churn out that many animatronics and that's small of a time

215
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,880
So first order officer Ellen

216
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,360
Will make the command Ellen the death trooper

217
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:08,980
If you just kind of melt that skin and stretch it around enough you can turn it into an akbar fairly sure

218
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,880
She could be a Mon Cal Mari one of the Mon Cal Mari race sure I

219
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,960
I want I started to watch like because there's there's a good amount of ride through videos of the Ellen version

220
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,880
and

221
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,280
There is not a lot of footage out there of the original version

222
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,120
So I have to give a shout out to Martin's vids Martin's video

223
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,720
I found Martin's vid as well Martin God bless you

224
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,820
Mari you are like Martin makes these

225
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,760
Martin is this guy who makes these like hour-long tribute videos to some rides that are still open a lot of rides that have

226
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
closed and he finds like

227
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:53,160
footage and concept art and like opening day stuff and gets like source audio and makes these like

228
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,440
Ride through I don't even know what to call it documentaries because they're like really well done

229
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,360
They're really well researched and edited and some behind-the-scenes

230
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,680
Footage and in this case an overhead of how this this ride works

231
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,640
Which is like I actually I found that very fascinating watching the flow of it because you enter a giant theater

232
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,920
Which splits off into eight different cars which all slowly move around this entire building and sort of a sort of a hover fashion

233
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,240
I mean it was like this crazy ballet watching those cars move around in this overhead

234
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,940
It's it's a technical Marvel this ride if not a for sure. Yeah, Marvel

235
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,480
Yeah, it's I found this video too and there's some pretty good

236
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Footage of the actual original ride

237
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,360
Yes, and he like crowds. He does all this stuff for free. Like he doesn't charge for it

238
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,960
he like crowd sources all of this stuff and then cuts it together and like a

239
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,720
Coherent narrative and like yeah talks about it. Yeah the history a lot in the opening of it and so watch that

240
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,320
There's a journey into imagination one like there's all of these ones and they're like that's good

241
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,560
This is like we're all half researched and we're just goofing around

242
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,640
We have no visuals to show you yeah, we're gonna do we're gonna do a lot of descriptions

243
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,120
but yeah, it's kind of this thing where if you if you could just see it and sort of a

244
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,520
It's kind of a moving you just have to see it

245
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,200
But people weren't taking full VHS camcorders to tape a 45 minute ride through

246
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,840
I remember my mom me like making my mom like tape like I don't know

247
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,280
Mr. Toad or something on our video camera so we could watch it at home like as like

248
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:39,880
We would take these giant video cameras down and I feel like barely use them and barely watch what we shot when we were down

249
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:46,760
There but this ride is 45 minutes long. So people just weren't taping it. You need a SLP to fit that

250
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,080
I was gonna say tapes tapes weren't that big you'd have to switch tapes in the middle of that's right. Yeah

251
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,520
The so the basic the basic like way the ride is is like the first

252
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,920
Part of it is like the history of energy and how you know, yeah energy and oil and dinosaurs

253
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,480
Then you see the dinosaurs and then what's the future of energy?

254
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
right, it's like

255
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,000
Petroleum

256
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,640
Yeah, and I'm like just some even something like so a journey through inner space, which was a ride in Disneyland

257
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,360
The idea was like you're going to be shrunk down and you're gonna go see what's happening in an actual molecule

258
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,160
So and what is this is just like here's we're gonna show you

259
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,040
I guess there's sort of they might say well you go back in time, right?

260
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,120
We take you back to the days of the dinosaurs. Here's the dinosaurs while they were living before they

261
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,760
Turned into bone and muck under the earth

262
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,480
But it also doesn't really work because like it's about energy and now it's just some dinosaurs

263
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,460
I'm like, I'm really vague on what even energy if watching to entire ride through shouldn't I?

264
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,240
Understand the basic concept of energy. I don't think I do I think I know either

265
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,480
I know dinosaurs died and they became oil. Am I wrong? Yes, that's right. That's right. Okay, that is right

266
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,820
But what shouldn't we see the dinosaurs melted down on the ride?

267
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,140
Shouldn't they like all like a comet hit or something? We see like the melt and decompose and then turn into

268
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Raiders you want to see?

269
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,560
A live version of that footage of the Fox

270
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Decomposing and being eaten by maggots. Yes, you want that to somehow happen in audit you want like a living

271
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,720
a

272
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,840
Dinosaur that can like puff up and then slowly deflate and turn to bone. Yes, that actually that would be an incredible

273
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,960
It's like you would see you know

274
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:45,680
What happens over hundreds and thousands of years and it would actually make sense because really also these dinosaurs are just repurposed from two other

275
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,960
Like other rye like they were at the World's Fair and then they were at the World's Fair ones are still out here

276
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,420
Like I think they just copied the according to Max's vid

277
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,240
I'm pretty sure that some of them Martin Martin

278
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Whatever the man's name

279
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,360
Sorry, so sorry that some of them were from that from the World's Fair

280
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,400
I guess my most interesting thing I thought was that like from the very beginning

281
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,800
there was always going to be like a solar energy based pavilion and

282
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,520
Surprise surprise

283
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,960
The Epcot plan changed because exons like we'd like to sponsor that but we have some other forms of energy

284
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,200
We'd like to talk about in addition to solar energy. Is that the history?

285
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,960
That's I think that's what I said in the video. There were solar panels though on and there there has always been solar panels

286
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,800
And it's powered like a little bit harshly unclear how much it actually powers. It's possible

287
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,360
It's just for which we I would like to talk about in a second the VIP lounge. That's also in this ride

288
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,440
The VIP lounge it just looks like a lobby of a Holiday Inn a 1985 holiday

289
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,520
I guess we may sir and I guess we'll die

290
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,720
Well, we'll do a quick jaunt here over to the VIP lounge

291
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,800
So all of these different rides in future world have a VIP lounge for their corporate sponsors

292
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,300
Yeah, and this one has one that was for the exxon

293
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:12,080
It's like you were an exxon employee and you came to Epcot you were allowed into this lounge

294
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,920
But as you pointed out the only perk of being an exxon executive my yeah

295
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,600
That reminds me of like a childhood friend growing up

296
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,160
Her mom works for FedEx and FedEx sponsored space Mountain for a while and I feel like there was either

297
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Was there a lounge in space mountain?

298
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,280
But I feel like maybe they got front of the line payout. They got some sort of perk for space Mountain

299
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,680
And FedEx there used to be a FedEx diorama as you left space Mountain the like

300
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,600
astronauts

301
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,520
By the exit we used to be delivering FedEx

302
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,880
Yes

303
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,920
Corporate I feel like they don't is this maybe why there's so much IP going on in the parks because I feel like corporate

304
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Sponsorships going to happen as much these days. I would yeah that would make sense

305
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,400
I feel like there's less and less Siemens just said no that they're not gonna keep sponsoring spaceship Earth. Oh really?

306
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,280
AT&T does not sponsor Indian Jones anymore, correct? I don't think so

307
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,320
I think I think probably that signage that's sort of going away. I guess test track is still

308
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,040
Ford

309
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
right

310
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,680
No, it's it's Chevrolet Chevrolet. I think yeah, yeah

311
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
Honda sponsors Autopia

312
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,280
Because are they added awesome. Oh, they added awesome. Oh and the bird is the bird called like Birdo

313
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,480
Bird is named Bird. Oh, yeah

314
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,760
You're gonna be Autopia and bird always from Mario to oh, okay Birdo is the egg-shooting

315
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,520
Our engineer is nodding along. Yes, that is Birdo

316
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh if that were if you could avoid Birdo's mouth eggs in the Nintendo World's coming Universal Studios

317
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,280
That would be

318
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:02,360
Or painful or bad a bad idea. Yeah, there's a I found a website that says who can get into each different

319
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,640
Pavilion and or we to be excuse me VIP lounge. So for the Exxon lounge

320
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,920
The lounge used to be available only to Exxon employees

321
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:16,720
But then some of them are available to like the employee of the company that sponsors and like make-a-wish kids

322
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,780
And then some of them are still lounges and then some of them have been converted into just like offices

323
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,720
There's also a few lounges scattered about like every now and then it changes

324
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,920
It's like are you a chase Sapphire member? Are you an American Express card holder?

325
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,120
There's a vacation club lounge on the top floor of Journey into Imagination now. Hmm. What's in there?

326
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,760
It's the old image works into the old. Oh really? Yeah, but I don't think it's really working

327
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,440
I think it's mostly just outlets to charge your phone and couches

328
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,320
That's

329
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,600
Something high demand it. Yeah, you need that the GE for horizons

330
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,080
They used to have this like kind of secret thing here

331
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,320
We should put a link to this on the website, which would just be like if you're a GE employee this way. Yes

332
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,720
We're looking at the old GE logo and then three arrows all in 70s beige

333
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,000
Well, give that to you to ogle on your own time. Yeah. Yeah, I know you're dying to see it

334
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,320
It's funny how Epcot was when it first opened was a mix of these beautiful vibrant colors

335
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,460
But then also some of that 70s beige baby scattered here and there which I love

336
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,120
I mean this yeah entrance to the universe of energy as this awesome sort of

337
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,620
Gold and red tile tile mural. Yeah. Yeah, I'd also like to say aesthetically

338
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,240
I thought when when I was watching the ride through I thought from the beginning

339
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
I was gonna love it

340
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,420
Like I'd been under rating it this whole time because at the very beginning the Exxon tiger

341
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,400
Runs right at you and on five screens, by the way

342
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:55,800
It's the widest wide screen you ever seen a tiger runs right at you. It's really cool and scary

343
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
And I think he's got kind of like 80s

344
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:04,040
Old analog video effect trails behind him and then the title universe of energy flies at you and it is like

345
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,000
70s Superman it is such a cool

346
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,600
Opening title it might be like why I love old analog

347
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,800
Video effects so much. I probably like saw this when I was seven and it like freaked the hell out of me

348
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:23,360
So it's a step. There's some aesthetically amazing stuff early motion graphics stuff. That is pretty cool in the original ride

349
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:30,360
Yeah, and and that and then some of the music which I guess let's figure like do you were you listening any of these tracks?

350
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,680
Yeah, yeah. All right. There's a couple different ones here. I

351
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,720
Mean, this is great. This is but like this is everything you want

352
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
from a theme park

353
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Yeah, this is up my alley

354
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,040
There's gonna be a 10 minute here where I just play things off my phone

355
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,160
It's sort of a R.E.S. Speedwagon roll with the changes here we go

356
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,800
Universe of energy

357
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,840
See you glow

358
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,240
Well, that's a

359
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,800
Song's music were so goddamn earnest in the 70s and 80s

360
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,000
And then can you play the one where the guy makes it sound like he wants to fuck energy?

361
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,200
Yeah, that's this one. This is called energy. You make the world go round

362
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,520
And this is a little more melancholy. There's also some that video

363
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,040
We were watching there's a melancholy acoustic version of it that I could not find

364
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
Like sticks is lady

365
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,000
Forms in the faces nature taking its course

366
00:31:49,000 --> 00:32:03,960
Oh, it's a different time folks a different time lady energy

367
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Oh

368
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,120
Carpenters I'm tearing up

369
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,120
I

370
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:37,680
Found an instrument we won't play that there's an instrumental of just that first song like it's real. Those are great

371
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Those songs are great. Yeah

372
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,480
That song would be a wonderful song for like the first dance at your wedding if you were named

373
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,320
If there was a woman named energy one of the pot and we'll get to it at the end

374
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,360
But one of the positives I think is if you're doing a Guardians of the Galaxy, which is very much like retro

375
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,440
We playlist stuff. I think those songs got to come back

376
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,840
I think there's a decent I think so and put those songs back in and they were fit real well in the in the ride

377
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,680
Was there a rumor that the ride could be like a historical journey through old Epcot attractions?

378
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,080
Did I imagine that I think we've talked about that before? Yeah, it's

379
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
We're getting ahead of ourselves. But yeah

380
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,220
Supposedly, they're keeping the building the same they they're ripping everything inside out

381
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,840
But I don't know they're keeping the building the same which means maybe or maybe not ripping everything out

382
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
Maybe they're keeping the dinosaurs

383
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,640
But the idea of which a lot of people roll their eyes at is that Peter Quill visited?

384
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,920
Epcot Peter Quill, of course the famous Guardians of the Galaxy character Star-Lord for those of you have not seen the film

385
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,840
Is that he the not narrative of the ride is that he went to Epcot as a child

386
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:49,200
So that's it seems to indicate that the ride is gonna be very self-referential to Epcot Center itself

387
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,680
So there is people are speculating there's an opportunity to

388
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,960
Fit all the Epcot nostalgia from the 80s that you could possibly want in this ride

389
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,400
Which could either be really terrible or very fun because you get to like hear those songs again

390
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,680
You get to put like Horizons robots in the right like you could put everything in there and then the rest of the park just

391
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,920
Turns into IP potentially because potentially segment featured too great these days. Yeah

392
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:19,880
But does that I like that would the typical audience going we want a Guardians of the Galaxy, right?

393
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,920
I have any idea what I think going on if you get some Guardians animatronics in there and you make the ride go fast

394
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,520
Sure. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's just got a spin around in a circle. So people get a little dizzy

395
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,360
You hear a talking raccoon and then they can throw treats for weirdos like us

396
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:41,280
We're in the universe energy. We got to get out of here. What is this robot a drag purple dragon?

397
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,920
Get out of the way young Peter Quill. We got to get out. I gotta get old Peter Quill out of here

398
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,680
That's the other thing every every other Epcot thing was like three to five minutes long

399
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,760
And this was 45 minutes long like world of motion space of birth body wars. Everything was pretty quick

400
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:07,640
Like and in watching the ride throughs of these I like I stopped paying attention for massive stretches of time

401
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:15,480
That's one thing you can guarantee the Guardians of the Galaxy ride that replaces it will be like a tenth of the running time of the original

402
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,680
Oh, yeah, I would think so unless they really want to stay true to the spirit

403
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,300
Save the galaxy making a better world for me

404
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
There you go

405
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,360
That's probably that would be going to the top of the charts

406
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,120
So while we're still talking about the original one

407
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:45,560
Can we talk about the promotional Mickey and goofy explore the universe of energy comic book?

408
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,360
Yes, of course. I this I so we were trying to piece this together

409
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,480
Yeah, what because I think I had this growing up too and you said it was because they would hand this out

410
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,920
Outside the ride. Yes, they would give you this comic book like either at the

411
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,560
front of the ride or at the exit and I I

412
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,320
Still have a copy somewhere like this is probably the first comic book I owned like as a kid at like three or four years old

413
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,180
And it is pure propaganda

414
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,300
There's a cover where the Mickey and goofy are just pointing at the ride

415
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,660
Universe of energy presented by Exxon. It just says that on the front of the comic which oh, that's wait

416
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,420
I remember that the the famous that's why I know the Exxon Tiger. Oh

417
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,220
It's a bath from this comic. Yeah. Yeah, yeah Exxon Tigers walking down the road there

418
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:41,160
I liked this comic book a lot as a kid because before there was the internet there weren't a lot of ways to like

419
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,100
You know have a piece of Disney World in your home

420
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:49,540
It's why those the stockholder annual reports that I think of you as a kid

421
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,740
So I like it to look at like a really beautiful picture of the theme parks

422
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,180
it was this

423
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,860
Comic is cool because it has like animated depictions of the ride

424
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,820
But you beyond that it has a lot of weird scary oil

425
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
There's a crossword puzzle

426
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:16,980
Which has a little picture of Mickey and goofy doing a crossword puzzle and the crossword puzzle is on a big oil barrel

427
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,780
Like so bonkers to look at now stuff of dick Cheney's wet dreams

428
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:30,040
I would just look at this again and again as a kid probably before I could read would just like look at the pictures

429
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,700
And yeah

430
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:37,180
I I felt it a nice way to connect with the park in addition to our monthly Disney magazine the very dry

431
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,660
Yeah

432
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,500
Disney magazine yet, I don't know that we have Disney news

433
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:50,020
We got that and Disney adventures when I was yes, so you are the most we're not susceptible to propaganda anyway

434
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,980
So this oil thing so I mean the whole thing is like Mickey and goofy go through the

435
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
ride and

436
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:04,080
Mickey gives a lot of talking points about energy and then goofy

437
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,560
Goofy says like vaudeville jokes like goofy makes jokes

438
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,140
And I just wrote a note at a certain point that says goofy is a fucking menace in this

439
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:20,540
We're not taking our energy crisis seriously some sample dial with pieces of dialogue. Do you want to do?

440
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:30,020
Mickey what do you want to do? I can't do a great goofy. I can do pretty decent Mickey. I'll do goofy then all right

441
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:35,060
I'm ready for you. I'm mostly good my goofy is mostly just me saying gorsh

442
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,720
Okay, so Mickey starts here. No, I think goofy okay great

443
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,040
permafrost what's that gorsh?

444
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,800
It's a permanently frozen layer of ice and soil that can be thousands of feet deep

445
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,680
Wow, I bet no one is to worry about ice cream melting here yuck

446
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,460
So that's that's when like about halfway through this comic when I lost my well, there's also like

447
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,680
they're talking about how gas prices are going up and

448
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
goofy says

449
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
gosh, Mick that

450
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,720
Scares me a lot like yeah, this is your soil is getting scarce

451
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,640
Yeah, goofy, but it will help if we can find new sources of oil in our own country

452
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,080
This comic acknowledges the 70s gas crisis about like we can't

453
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:36,840
Great and we can always buy oil from foreign countries too. They're writing a camel riding in this panel

454
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:43,320
Sometimes we can't depend on other countries since 1973 our foreign oil supplies, but cut off

455
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,960
And it also did it out the the website I found this all scanned on scanned it in reverse order

456
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,360
So you're gonna be back together back together also you're passing by a very crucial panel

457
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,920
Yeah, so there is a panel where Mickey explains how Mickey and like a perca

458
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,960
pointing up to a map a map of Alaska that shows how oil goes from

459
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,400
Prudence Bay in northern Alaska to Valdez in southern Alaska

460
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,200
And you might remember Valdez from the being the site of the Exxon Valdez oil spill

461
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,680
only four years after this fun kids comic

462
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,680
There should be

463
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Without issue or spillage to Valdez

464
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,200
There's no panel where Gooby's like why are you talking about all this stuff?

465
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
What? What got into you?

466
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Oh yeah, here we go

467
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,600
There are they also talk about other forms of energy

468
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:51,240
There there sure are there's nuclear power in the future it can provide endless energy

469
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,240
Like this is right around three mile island, too. I think right

470
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,240
We love nuclear energy

471
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,240
CEO Rex Tillerson is doing a great job

472
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,240
So yeah, it's truly perverse this whole thing is perverse

473
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
It's very perverse

474
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
I mean look the drawings are great

475
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,240
They are do we know who did the art here?

476
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,240
I don't know it's funny

477
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:26,240
That's a whole interesting thing in Disney's history of like the Mickey and Donald and goofy like comics which

478
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,240
were popular in America because all the stuff with those guys are reasonably popular but in Europe like

479
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,240
They're huge like the Carl Banks and the Don Rosa stuff is like huge and are like

480
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,240
Which is why DuckTales has this like extra cult to it beyond the show

481
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Like adventure, adventure story

482
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:52,240
Yeah, so but like a lot of those guys at the height of their creative peak were not like really given the credit

483
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,240
They they were due until like, you know many years later and they were forced to slave away on oil industry

484
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
propaganda

485
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:07,240
Yeah, I don't think this comic has any credits in it. It's like well no one wanted everyone knew what they were doing

486
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,240
As with branded entertainment, you don't want your name on it

487
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Walt Disney Productions and a branch called Walt Disney Educational Media Company

488
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,240
Oh boy

489
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,240
Walt Disney Educational Media Company can be bought

490
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,240
Elsewhere in this comic also Mickey says makes a point of saying how coal will be around for a long time

491
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
And there's a general

492
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:37,240
Sentiment that runs through this comic as well as both iterations of the ride, which is solar power is a great idea

493
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:44,240
It's it'll be awesome. Once it's cheaper. That's what it's pushing like. Yeah someday we'll get to solar energy, but it's just

494
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
Yeah, you know

495
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
Look, it's cross-breed

496
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,240
Also wind is mentioned in the ride

497
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,240
But they didn't draw it in the comic and you'd think like giant windmills would be a nice little page of the comic

498
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,240
But like nope

499
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,240
Who cares?

500
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,240
That's for our children's children children to worry about

501
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,240
How are we gonna what if there's no wind it doesn't work?

502
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,240
What is this Holland fuck off

503
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,240
When you I did not I don't recall having this comic as a kid

504
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,240
I mean, I'm sure I went on this I have no memory also of going on this as a kid because it's obviously why would I remember

505
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:22,240
It yeah, but after you read this as a kid. Did you suddenly have an urge to pump gas?

506
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,240
Like help mom pump gas or something I remember

507
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
Only at Exxon

508
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,240
Only as long as it was at Exxon

509
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,240
We were a Sonoco family so we

510
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,240
We liked we were mobile we'd always go to mobile which eventually was obviously Exxon mobile

511
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,240
Yeah, mobile got a spin at sponsoring our favorite attraction the universe of energy

512
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:51,240
Well, you know, I guess well unless well anything else on the original iteration of the of the ride because while we're talking about the great

513
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,240
comedic possibilities that come from the combination of jokes and oil

514
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:05,240
Disney finally in the 90s went full-on comedy and transformed this dry ride the universe of energy into Ellen's energy adventure

515
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,240
Although it was originally called Ellen's energy crisis on the

516
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,240
Yeah, weird right? Jesus!

517
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,240
And then it was changed almost instantly like the day it opened they changed it with no explanation

518
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,240
Yeah, they were finally like a little honest about what was happening and then no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's an adventure

519
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:32,240
It's fun. I do like energy goof about I feel like some some evil scientists was there opening day and he was like

520
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we got to change this. This is real. This is right. There is a new adventure

521
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
Too real, too real

522
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,240
No, not crisis. It's fun

523
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,240
Ellen's prescient verbiage

524
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:50,240
This opened in 96 and then the episode of her TV show that

525
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:56,240
Where her character comes out of the closet and shortly after she had come out of the closet happened in 97

526
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:03,240
Mm-hmm. Just a few months after and this was I think I was maybe talking about this when we had Mike Mitchell here the

527
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
One of the weird things about this ride. It is like

528
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,240
It is an Ellen who is several Ellens ago

529
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,240
It was before coming out of the closet which if you can name anything about the show Ellen besides her coming out of the closet

530
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,240
I'm very impressed. I like that is like the primary thing that happened on that show and this ride is like

531
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,240
Whatever Ellen was in the early 90s

532
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,240
It is pre talk show. It's pre dancing. It's pre Oscar selfie

533
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,240
Like none of the things we like she's changed her look entirely

534
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,240
Yeah, it's it's an Ellen that is like unrecognizable to the

535
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,240
the public at large

536
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,240
Yeah, it's it's it is a weird time capsule

537
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,240
If for that really like when I saw when I was there in August like I was watching this and it is like

538
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:57,240
You are there you are in 1996. There's no then there's no this has to be at this time

539
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,240
This is not timeless at all. Like no she the clothes she's wearing. It's kind of this like 90s wide

540
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,240
Butterfly collar that makes her look like one of the Roxbury guys

541
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,240
She is the third

542
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,240
Oh, yeah, she's got like a suit on at one point and then she's got the like

543
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:20,240
khakis red shirt like open blue Oxford like which I believe is what the animatronic is

544
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, which so we've alluded to that this like mostly this was like

545
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,240
They replaced all of the movies in the ride

546
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,240
But you still go through the dinosaur kingdom just like you did in the previous edition

547
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,240
But with one big change there is an animatronic Ellen fighting a big snake monster

548
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:45,240
One of the strangest tableaus anywhere in Disney World and it was there and I mean, it's still there probably

549
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:52,240
But like up until this year you could have seen 90s Ellen fighting a snake monster. Although that like

550
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,240
I think they have trouble

551
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,240
I think they have to really pay attention with like the presidents when they make the decisions

552
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,240
For the Hall of Presidents, but like other modern celebrities

553
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,240
I feel like they've always struggled with and this Ellen is not particularly Ellen esque this robot

554
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,240
I wrote down that she looks kind of like Dr. Zayas

555
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:19,240
Sort of big like blonde mop and like white pants and a big tunic shirt

556
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,240
Celebrities they had the best

557
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:31,240
Luck with in the late 80s early 90s in terms of animatronics were like Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney because their faces are a little fucked up

558
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:42,240
Already so it's easier to mull when the robot melts a little bit. It's a dad's character. Yeah, like an attractive woman done via audio animatronics

559
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,240
Is there like like they did the witch in the great movie ride?

560
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:54,240
Judy Garland looks pretty good. Yeah, yeah Garland Ingrid Bergman. I guess both fair reasons. The Sigourney Weiner weaver. Did I call her Sigourney Weiner?

561
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:06,240
They messed up the robot. That's if you dress a dachshund like Ripley for Halloween. It's a Sigourney Weiner. And it's a viral sensation

562
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,240
Sigourney Weiner would get the dachshund would get invited on Ellen. I'm burning all over the place.

563
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:21,240
You just gave it away. You blew all the viral dough. Sigourney Weiner would be more popular than this podcast and like anything any of us ever do

564
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,240
10 million likes. Finally have something worth mentioning on our gravestone. Is she a dachshund dressed like Ripley from Alien?

565
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:38,240
Owner of Sigourney Weiner. Is Sigourney Weiner on fucking Dancing with the Stars this season with like Sean Spicer and Anthony Zapato Jr.

566
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:50,240
Fuck that guy. Man South Park said some really rude stuff about Sigourney Weiner. Whatever it's part of the zeitgeist I understand. Oh yeah.

567
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,240
They take on all. They take on all so nobody's safe. They're libertarians. Not Caitlyn Jenner and not Sigourney Weiner.

568
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:11,240
We may be burying the lead in terms of famous people in this ride because we mentioned Alex Trebek shows up. Also Jamie Lee Curtis as Judy.

569
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:25,240
Yeah the most maybe the biggest actress in this. Yeah major actress for Disney. But doing that thing where it's like a bunch of people are themselves and then one famous actor is playing a character which always kind of like drives me nuts.

570
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:39,240
Ellen's friend Judy who Ellen is watching Jeopardy and she gets bitter about it because her old college snooty friend Judy appears and knows everything about energy just because she's a scientist.

571
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:51,240
Yeah I don't know why she's so like Judy didn't do anything that bad. Like Judy just happens to be very smart. Yeah she certainly carries herself in a manner I understand you might be annoyed a little bit but Ellen didn't study science.

572
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:58,240
Ellen didn't study science. She didn't strike me as being like a villainous know at all. Not even a little bit. No she looks composed.

573
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:11,240
Ellen comes off very petty is what I'm saying. Yeah. And like yeah of course she knows. And she's watching her friend on Jeopardy from like the nicest apartment you've ever seen.

574
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:18,240
What's described as a New York loft that is just beautiful. It's a real winner of New York property. Like what do you have to be mad about Ellen?

575
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:30,240
Yeah this show establishes a universe where Ellen lives in this giant New York loft. Her and Bill Nye are neighbors. Her favorite show is Jeopardy and also Bill Nye comes over to borrow a bunch of stuff for an experiment.

576
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:40,240
I need some aluminum foil. And a candle and string and it's like wait he's a scientist but he's not prepared for his latest experiment.

577
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,240
There's some logic flaws. There's some logic flaws.

578
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:53,240
Well and they point out like he just walks in the door and then a separate Ellen pops up outside of the narrative to say you know how in New York everybody leaves their doors open.

579
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:00,240
Like why do you have to. You're deconstructing the thing you made that we're watching. Yeah.

580
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:12,240
There's a lot. I think that there's this could also this ride could also be just called like Ellen's adventure asides like Ellen's constant asides.

581
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:18,240
She takes a phone call during it and then hangs up on the person she's talking to.

582
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:27,240
Just like Bill Nye is like you know this is when the universe was birthed and she's like must have been a big delivery room. It's just like constant asides.

583
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,240
There's a side. Someday our oil supply might run out but Ellen's quips never will.

584
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:46,240
There's a very strange bit in this like after you go through the dinosaur scenes you go into a totally black room with a radio antenna and there's like a bit that's like morning drive time news radio.

585
00:51:46,240 --> 00:52:09,240
But it's about the destruction and extinction of dinosaurs and Bill Nye chimes in every now and then. But what it really is it's a pitch black room that they didn't have to dress like it's a set they didn't have to build like all they needed was just this black room and this one graphic like this one like fake neon projection that's like a radio broadcast tower.

586
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,240
And you're listening to Chris Berman and I believe another ESPN anchor.

587
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,240
Is that right? Yeah it is a tie in to the other recently acquired Disney property ESPN.

588
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:32,240
Yeah this is a theme about like Disney animation there was kind of a golden age in the late 80s early 90s and then it gave way to this very unpleasant messy time.

589
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:52,240
And that's that's true in the movies and I think it's true in the parks and there was a lot of bad shit in the late 90s early 2000s where they're trying to jam ABC stuff. This is one of them obviously this weird hamfisted Ellen thing like all that when they tried to do when there was the soap opera bistro where you can take on the sets of your favorite soaps.

590
00:52:52,240 --> 00:53:01,240
There was the live who wants to be a millionaire experience. That's right ABC mashup with the parks was such a boring disaster.

591
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:08,240
I found out something interesting recently the old stunt show at Hollywood Studios the lights camera or lights motor action.

592
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:19,240
Yeah. Which was a pretty cool show to like doing live car stunts and stuff that was originally pitched as a James Bond stunt show and the licensing didn't work out.

593
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:30,240
I think this came up on I think I'm probably stealing this from Jim Mills show. I feel like it's where I heard it. But it's like that would have been awesome if there was a full James Bond stunt show.

594
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,240
But they probably still would have bulldozed it to build Star Wars. Yeah I think at this point.

595
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,240
Huh. Crazy.

596
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:47,240
No they'd rather stick with properties like grace under fire and private practice stuff that's in house already.

597
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,240
The Louie Anderson sitcom. Oh yeah. Is that an ABC. Maybe.

598
00:53:53,240 --> 00:54:00,240
Also don't forget that truly one of the biggest in the deepest dregs of attractions sounds dangerous with Drew Carey.

599
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,240
Oh yeah. Of course. They would cut your hair in the dark.

600
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,240
You sit in a dark room with headphones on and you feel like you're getting your hair cut.

601
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,240
That's all I remember about it. It's like maybe there were bees and then you got your hair cut.

602
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,240
Yeah there were two like good headphone gags they could pull off. Bees and haircut.

603
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:26,240
Which is why there was a brief time where if you went on the great moments with Mr. Lincoln attraction you'd put on headphones and pretend that you were Abraham Lincoln getting your hair cut.

604
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,240
Is that true. Yeah. What the fuck.

605
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,240
For only like a couple years. Really. Here Mr. Lincoln have a seat.

606
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:39,240
We'll transform the I will pan the audio around I'd imagine and post on this so you'll feel like you're getting your hair cut.

607
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:53,240
That's insanely messed up because back then getting a shaver a haircut was like taking someone's like taking your own life at risk because like if you got a cut and it got infected like you might just die from a haircut or a shave.

608
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,240
Yeah I mean they also did dental work too.

609
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,240
If Lincoln hadn't been shot he eventually would have gotten infected by a haircut.

610
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,240
A dirty haircut scissor.

611
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:09,240
A razor would have sliced his neck. He was going to have it at some point. John Wilkes Booth was just doing the hobbyist.

612
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,240
How many people died of dirty haircuts.

613
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,240
I don't know.

614
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,240
Was that an epidemic.

615
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,240
Tenth of the population every year.

616
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,240
Walter passed away this summer.

617
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,240
He had a bad haircut.

618
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:33,240
Dearest Juliana I'm afraid I will perish soon.

619
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,240
There's a CGI flyover in this ride too that has not that didn't age well.

620
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,240
What's what's up with that.

621
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:52,240
It's either before or after the dinosaurs. It's like soaring over a prehistoric world and it's very like Sega Saturn level 3D graphics.

622
00:55:52,240 --> 00:56:06,240
That said there's one really I there's a great joke that I think it's a solid joke in in one of the Jeopardy sequences where like Jamie Lee Curtis is explaining to Alex Trebek like yeah Ellen used to be my college roommate.

623
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,240
Our nickname for her was stupid Ellen.

624
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:16,240
I think it's like a pretty funny non joke like like yeah I don't know. I'm amazed that made it in.

625
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,240
Yeah that's kind of nicely like clever in its non cleverness.

626
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:29,240
Yeah. Well so I mean the like not that you need to know the whole plot but basically Bill Nye comes over while Ellen is watching Jeopardy.

627
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,240
Then she has a dream sequence where she imagines being on Jeopardy and missing all of the questions that are all about energy.

628
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:43,240
Then she goes to see the dinosaurs and goes to see how solar power is not ready yet and that enables her to come back and win Jeopardy at the end.

629
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,240
Yes. That's what it takes 45 minutes to tell.

630
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,240
That's how it was pitched probably.

631
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,240
So I think it's a song with Jeopardy. I know Alex Trebek will probably let us in the studio.

632
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,240
Also we have not mentioned the fact that Michael Richards appears.

633
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,240
No lines. No lines.

634
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,240
Is he Einstein? He's a caveman.

635
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,240
Oh he's a caveman. There's also a wordless Einstein in the Jeopardy sequence.

636
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:14,240
And Ellen Cleghorn SNL cast member Ellen Cleghorn has a line. She's like a PA or a producer on Jeopardy at the end.

637
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,240
Oh. What really? I watched it.

638
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,240
Yes she's got one line.

639
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,240
Weird. Two Ellen's energy adventures.

640
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,240
But here's another thing about this ride. You're watching.

641
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:34,240
The first two or three minutes of it are just Ellen talking at you doing energy themed stand up.

642
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,240
And it is bombing. It is eating shit.

643
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,240
And Ellen is funny. I like Ellen.

644
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:47,240
Watching her be saddled with this bad material that has been dying every day for two decades at Disney World.

645
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:53,240
There is not a laugh in the entire thing if you watch any of the ride throughs of it until Michael Richards shows up.

646
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:00,240
Does kind of a half-assed Kramer getting burnt by the first discovery of fire.

647
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,240
And the audience loses it. Finally a laugh. 25 minutes into the whole thing.

648
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,240
Whoever's awake laughs.

649
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,240
Hopefully woke up others who are still asleep.

650
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:16,240
Yeah I think it goes to show that comedy in theme parks is tough.

651
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,240
Even if a line is funny once it will probably not be funny dozens of times.

652
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:28,240
And something as basic and simple as Kramer getting electrocuted is all you can do I think comedically in a theme park.

653
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:34,240
It's hard to because you have to pitch. You have to hit from 8 to 80.

654
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,240
You have to try and hit all demographics.

655
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,240
And lots of people who do not speak English.

656
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,240
There are people from all over the world at these parks.

657
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:49,240
So you can't really be doing flippant little jokes about 90's coffee shops.

658
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,240
Regional stuff.

659
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:59,240
I did watch one of the other Martin vids of the ride through for Alien encounter.

660
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,240
Which is one of my favorites.

661
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,240
I want to do that at some point.

662
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:16,240
But he had the original audio and when the alien breaks out of its container you can hear Disney put in some wild sound of stuff tourists would say.

663
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:22,240
That you think your fellow audience members are yelling out but it's clearly on the track.

664
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:28,240
And the alien explodes out of the thing and it's horrifying looking.

665
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,240
And someone goes what is that my mother in law?

666
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:37,240
That looks worse than your meatloaf honey.

667
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,240
That's another 96, 95 attraction I feel like.

668
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,240
I wonder if there were joke writers on staff for Imagineering.

669
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,240
Just your show show writers.

670
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:54,240
They're retired. They come into Imagineering one day a week to say mother in law jokes.

671
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,240
That's where all of the 3's company writers went.

672
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,240
All the Ropers writers was the only place they could get work for a while.

673
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,240
Energy themed jokes.

674
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:13,240
So when you're watching this or when I was watching it earlier it is again for as far as propaganda.

675
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,240
They're having so much fun talking about oil and offshore drilling.

676
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:24,240
And they're like did you know that one of these facilities that offshore drills is as tall as a building?

677
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,240
Like a skyscraper?

678
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,240
It's like wow can you believe it?

679
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,240
Goofy in the comic and Ellen in the ride fall into the same role about like oh what about this?

680
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,240
Could we do this? And Mickey and Bill die fall into the role of like calm the fuck down.

681
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,240
We can do it a little but not a lot yet please.

682
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,240
Okay? How many times do I have to tell you?

683
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,240
Look you're not a serious person Ellen slash Mickey.

684
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,240
Don't leave it to the experts okay?

685
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:04,240
Side note, Bill Nye when he's on these shows now arguing about climate change he's not doing a good job.

686
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,240
I don't know a lot about climate change.

687
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,240
I think he's eviscerating his opponents. I think he's devastating them. I think he's eviscerating them.

688
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:16,240
You're saying what headlines say and then I watch the clip and I go no that is not what just happened.

689
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,240
I say whatever Buzzfeed tells me to say.

690
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:24,240
Tucker Carlson just talked circles around him and embarrassed him. And I was like no this isn't helping.

691
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,240
If those two go up against each other the only way to know who wins is if one of their bow ties starts spinning.

692
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,240
And their head shoots up like a rock em suck em robot.

693
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:42,240
Both characters get a scientist on that actually has a master's degree in something. The guy's got like a bachelor's degree in engineering or something.

694
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,240
Come on why is he? He's an entertainer.

695
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:59,240
Yeah I haven't seen enough of them to know but he convinced many groups of tourists on the daily at Disney World to not invest in solar energy.

696
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:07,240
No I know. That alone should disqualify him. I'm surprised nobody brought that up on one of these Fox News shows.

697
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,240
Would have been a good gotcha. Yeah yeah.

698
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:15,240
We're saying though that like people like there's not a lot of last people aren't really like die hards for this ride.

699
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:24,240
But I started watching like one of the videos of like the final ride through of this ride and people were like talking along with the dialogue.

700
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:31,240
And that's when I went like oh nope like I can see if I was there. I'm sure I would have probably got like caught up in the fun.

701
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,240
Although the last ride of this I think was a walk off right. Like it stopped in the dinosaur.

702
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:42,240
The last ride ever of this ride broke down. Broke down. And the audience had to walk off of it.

703
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:49,240
But they let people like you know what you're here just take pictures don't touch anything but you can take pictures with the dinosaurs like take your time.

704
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,240
Like the cast members were also like you know into it too. Yeah.

705
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:00,240
And also no one cares what happens. So no one. There was not ultimately a final conclusion to the Jeopardy saga.

706
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:05,240
Yeah and I don't think anyone cared. I don't think that the audience was clamoring for the ride.

707
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,240
Could have broken every time. Like the search for energy. The story goes on.

708
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,240
There's no true conclusion.

709
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:23,240
There's no there's no last modern scene where it's like the answer is disgusting lithium ion batteries that will be in everything and never biodegrade.

710
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:31,240
Well so this this tale has come to an end.

711
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,240
Ellen's energy adventure due to be replaced by Guardians of the Galaxy.

712
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:50,240
A lot of fans don't dig this. This is people feel like this is a big betrayal of the Epcot Center model that to put IP intellectual property from the Disney movies into Epcot betrays the original vision of the park.

713
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:55,240
I don't care because this could be a good new ride maybe with old Epcot stuff.

714
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:03,240
I don't know. Do we. Is there anything to that. We are losing the educational component of Epcot. Does it matter.

715
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:09,240
No. Yeah no. I don't think so. I think the problem is this people will be mad at us for saying that.

716
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:19,240
But if you're certainly if I listen to other podcasts the party line is yes. Yes. But this is against the vision. And I like I love I I love Epcot so much. I love it.

717
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:36,240
Yes. They're wearing an Epcot shirt right now. Right now. I bought the Epcot prop at an auction. I've used the font and the aesthetic and a bunch of things I've done. I still am like as long as some of that aesthetic and vibe is around like take all the rides out like we need new better.

718
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:55,240
We need new better. We need new better rides. Yeah. The thing is like if they had kept up the original mission of Epcot like to make a futuristic like bleeding edge looking to the future park like sure I think I'd be more upset but you have to be constantly updating it.

719
01:04:55,240 --> 01:05:06,240
You have to constantly be racing the future to do that. And at a certain point they're like well the 90s are here and it's not going to get much better than virtual reality and your phones might get cool soon.

720
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:13,240
Like that's at a certain point they were just like this is very calm anyway even if we don't just constantly keep updating.

721
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:26,240
There's no acknowledgement of like really recently future stuff like if you could if there was like a Hyperloop attraction or something like you go to Mars there's a self-driving car.

722
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:37,240
If you like this so there's so many like exciting near future things going on and none of it is represented in the park. Yes because we're talking about like touch screen phones maybe will happen one day.

723
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:49,240
So at this point if you're not going to keep up the future thing there's no exhibit about like public utilities start transit transferring electricity wirelessly like you don't need power lines anymore.

724
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:59,240
Like that's a thing that people talk about. Is that right. And I didn't know that. I think it's kind of hypothetical but like the next iPhones you can charge on a little mat.

725
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:08,240
You don't have to plug it in. So like that's a baby step towards that very easy to convey piece of technology as opposed to 45 minutes of rambling about energy.

726
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:19,240
That leaves me more confused about what energy is but also like do what like do what the ride the best rides do like pirates or Haunted Mansion or the original figment like give us a robot.

727
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:28,240
Give us a character that we like in a robot that's new. Give us some personality on the thing and like make a fun dark ride and the thing could last for 50 years. Yes.

728
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:39,240
Like if you're just presenting it like that like this like yeah this thing's going to have to go. Like this is so dry like people will people do will not miss this ride even like the test.

729
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:50,240
Like the last time I rode the test track update that like it's kind of like blue and looks like Tron and like you know it looks like the obstacles are like generated out of the computer out of nowhere.

730
01:06:51,240 --> 01:07:01,240
Like I thought that was cool. Like that looks pretty good. Sure. I do think it's crazy though because I saw pictures from like the food and wine festival is going on in Epcot right now and it's like oh yeah.

731
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:14,240
The wonders of life pavilion is there and they just closed it like this just they didn't bulldoze it's all there and like they cleared out most of the stuff and they just kind of use it as like event space.

732
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:21,240
But it's like that whole pavilion did they shut that down after like 9 11 when attendance was like really low.

733
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:32,240
Is that when that happened. But it's like body world. I loved body world as a kid. I love the thing where you were like the brain of a 10 year old and like a Cranium Command.

734
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:40,240
Well that had characters. That's my point. Characters and personality. Body world was a thrill ride. Body world was like a Star Tours kind of simulator.

735
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:51,240
Like a great character Elizabeth Shoe the microbiologist. Oh yeah. Directed by Leonard Nimoy. Leonard Nimoy. Yeah. Remember that one at some point too.

736
01:07:52,240 --> 01:08:03,240
But like you use care like fine use the Disney characters and yeah keep some of the idea of Epcot. But like yeah like that's better than what we have now. Jesus.

737
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:10,240
Like I was there in future world and it is bleak. It is a bleak situation. Just like our future.

738
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:20,240
The world is a disaster. Yeah another total disaster. Infrastructure falling apart. It's all laid to waste.

739
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:28,240
I mean if we were doing our scale of would you have plus it up would you. What was it again. Plus it up. We always forget this stupid scale.

740
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:36,240
Keep it as it is. Plus it up. Burn it down for the insurance money. I'm going to burn it down for the insurance money and build a whole new thing.

741
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:45,240
Like I'm a little worried that they're not destroying the building quite frankly. I think that's a thing. I think people like the rainbow colored building and I think people like the mural.

742
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,240
That's what people seem to be more sad about. The dinosaurs, the mural and the building.

743
01:08:49,240 --> 01:09:01,240
At the very least build a giant like show building behind it to give us more room to give us some thrills baby. Let's let's get some fun because now as it is there's not that much room in there to kind of make a fun.

744
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,240
It could be a cool like slow moving dark ride which maybe that's what it'll be.

745
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:13,240
Well if that thing is the facade that that amazing entrance because I love that. I'd be sad if that went. I love that old Epcot architecture.

746
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:24,240
Sure. Yeah you open that up into a much bigger show building. Right now it's just two theaters and a tiny space for robots. So I would say like the only reason you would want to blow it up is just so we get more room for robots. More robots.

747
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:34,240
More robots you think? They have the rocket. People want robots. People want less screens more robots. The rocket animatronic is one of the best. Oh it's terrific. Yeah.

748
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:44,240
So I assume they'll make a duplicate of him a couple of him I'm hoping for this ride. Robotic versions of all the bands on the Guardians soundtrack. Robotic raspberries.

749
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:55,240
10cc in robot form. Oh man if Raga Raccoon could meet the singing animals from singing food from Kitchen Cabaret. That would be terrific. Oh wow yeah that would be great.

750
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,240
He'd probably eat him. He probably would. Look out peach boys.

751
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:08,240
There should also be a reference for no one. This whole show is a reference for no one. Oh pretty much yeah.

752
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:21,240
Hey if you get most of what we're talking about tweet at us and say I get it. You don't have to say whether you like it or not. Just let us know. I get it. I get it alright. Yeah carry on. Keep rambling fellas.

753
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:40,240
Anything else? Yeah I just I like the idea of the Guardians ride. I like it that this will be our little hopefully like our little place for nostalgia and then the rest of them just give us some new cool rides that just loosely tie into imagination or loosely tie into these original ideas.

754
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:54,240
And I think like you know keep up the because Epcot has like good merch like all the design stuff all the original Pavilion logo like they really have made an effort to bring back that kind of merch the last few years. Yeah.

755
01:10:55,240 --> 01:11:07,240
People like that aesthetic. You keep some of that aesthetic around and add some bigger better rides and I think we're I think we're good. I think so. Do we all agree it's a I mean hopefully what they're doing to some extent is burning the ride down. Yeah that's what I'm hoping.

756
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:12,240
For we all want it burned. Dark fresh. Cool. Alright well we'll be right back.

757
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:22,240
Alright we're back with more Podcast the Ride and today we're going to introduce a brand new segment that we like to call animatronic of the month.

758
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:40,240
You know folks the entire theme park industry runs on the backs of unsung mechanical heroes the audio animatronics audio animatronics are forced to thanklessly perform the same tasks over and over again every day for absolutely no pay as opposed to the human

759
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:48,240
workforce at theme parks who perform the same tasks over and over every day for something kind of resembling pay.

760
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:59,240
The point is the theme parks would crumble without audio animatronics and today we'd like to shine a light on a random underappreciated robot somewhere in the theme park world.

761
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:11,240
What lucky animatronic will be the animatronic of the month. We're all going to highlight a different animatronic and then you all will get to decide who is animatronic of the month.

762
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,240
So so here we go with with my selection.

763
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:25,240
My animatronic hails from Pirates of the Caribbean. He's a fellow I like to call striped shirt pirate trying to get the key back from the dog.

764
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:34,240
Since 1967 striped shirt pirate has led an unglamorous life squatting in a dank cell begging to a high status canine.

765
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:40,240
His daily duties include whistling turning his head slightly and dangling a rope in his hands.

766
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:47,240
Never once in the history of the attraction has this robot glitched out lassoed a park guest and yanked them back into the water.

767
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:58,240
His bulbous cheeks suggest a white dizzy Gillespie and his striped shirt is timeless enough to be found either on a pirate schooner or at a modern J crew.

768
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:05,240
Since he can never escape his seaside jail today we salute this audio animatronic with a hearty.

769
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:12,240
I messed it up. I didn't quite get that whistle at trying to do the pirate whistle. Wait here I'll do it without the music.

770
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:19,240
There we go. Yeah that's the whistle that the pirate does in the ride. That's what I was trying to do.

771
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,240
Okay that's my that's my robot.

772
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:28,240
Fellas do you have your own robot selection. Yeah I'll go ahead. Great.

773
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:37,240
My animatronic hails from Splash Mountain at Disneyland and I'd like to give a hearty well done to the man sized dog sitting in a spinning robot.

774
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:45,240
Buddy not only are you large as hell you also sit perfectly still as that robot spins forever and ever.

775
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:53,240
And sure sometimes I get a bit of a sinister vibe from you. Maybe it was from the time I rode the ride and the robot wasn't spinning.

776
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:58,240
So you were just sitting there in the darkest part of the ride totally motionless.

777
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,240
And the fact that you're the size of the man is a little upsetting.

778
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:08,240
Or maybe it's like you remind me of the man in a dog costume from that one shot in the shining.

779
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:18,240
But whatever it is that robot spinning at a cartoonishly fast speed brings me back to the more innocent peaceful place I was.

780
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:23,240
That is the Splash Mountain Holler. So keep up the good work.

781
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:28,240
Man sized dogs sitting in a spinning robot in Splash Mountain.

782
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,240
Thank you. Thank you Jason. Beautiful.

783
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,240
Ready. I'm ready. Yes.

784
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,240
Sure. Ringo stars Sheila E and Max Weinberg are great drummers.

785
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:46,460
But what are they missing. The answer is the

786
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:52,460
answer is quite simple. They are not robots and they are also not stereotypical Italian pizza chefs.

787
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:56,460
My nominee checks all of those boxes. He is Pasquale P. Pieplate.

788
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,460
Drummer in Munch's Make-Believe Band. The band that performs at your nearest Chuck E. Cheese.

789
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:06,460
Whether he's making the sauce or providing a steady back beat. This mustachioed man always delivers.

790
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:11,460
You haven't lived until you've heard him play the skins on one of Chuck E. Cheese's famous songs.

791
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:16,460
Like the Bon Jovi parody of Wanted Dead or Alive titled Wanted Big Pizza Pie.

792
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:20,460
Or the parody of Aerosmith's Jamie Got a Gun titled Kids Are Having Fun.

793
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:25,460
Also Pasquale is an aspiring comedian. Aren't we all?

794
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:31,460
I salute you Pasquale P. Pieplate. My nominee for animatronic of the month.

795
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:38,460
This time I'll fade it out gently. Ah that was a relaxing little segment.

796
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:43,460
I hope you found it as such too. So we've had three nominees here. Let's recap.

797
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:47,460
We have Striped Shirt Pirate trying to get the key back from the dog.

798
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:51,460
We've got a man sized dog sitting in a spinning rowboat from Splash Mountain.

799
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:58,460
And Pasquale P. Pieplate. The drummer for Munch's Make-Believe Band at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant near you.

800
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,460
The last name was news to me. I'm excited to know it.

801
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:07,460
Pieplate yeah. Born into a certain lifestyle with the last name Pieplate.

802
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:13,460
Background for it. Pasquale was discovered in the kitchen. He was drumming on the pieplates.

803
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:20,460
And Munch found him back there and then decided to put him in the band because he had such a great rhythmic.

804
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,460
He joined later like Joe Walsh joined the Eagles.

805
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:27,460
Not until Pasquale joined did it become a super group.

806
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:33,460
You know I feel like I have my winner in mind already but I don't want to tilt you the listener.

807
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:38,460
So here's how this is going to work. Go to our Twitter which is at podcast the ride.

808
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:45,460
We will set up a poll and you will determine who is the animatronic of the month.

809
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:49,460
Unless of course we forget to do any of this by the time this episode comes out.

810
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:55,460
Yeah so and if we do forget please yell at us on Twitter and we'll put it up.

811
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:59,460
And then we'll really know someone is listening to the show.

812
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:03,460
You forgot the poll. What else am I supposed to do with my day.

813
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:09,460
I was going to weigh all these options through with my significant other.

814
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:16,460
We nearly broke up in the argument that ensued trying to come to consensus.

815
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,460
Not realizing we could both vote individually.

816
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:25,460
No it's the road it should be the rowboat dog not the dog near the boat.

817
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:28,460
No the pirate is like ubiquitous it's a classic thing.

818
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:33,460
But the other one represents the old south.

819
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:36,460
What is this really about. What is this really about.

820
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:41,460
I haven't been happy in years. Oh there it is. There it is.

821
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:47,460
If you're interested in animatronics it's the only thing keeping us together and it always has been.

822
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:51,460
If our podcast was the catalyst for your breakup please let us know on Twitter.

823
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,460
Another thing to tweet us about.

824
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:57,460
Hey where else can people get a hold of us about things of this nature.

825
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:04,460
Oh you can email questions comments concerns at podcasttheride at gmail.com.

826
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:11,460
You sure can. So check out the poll. We'll post pictures of these robots so you remember who they are.

827
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:21,460
And hey follow us check us out individually at Scott Gardner on Twitter at Jason Sheridan and at Fat Carlson P-H-A-T-C-A-R-L-S-O-N.

828
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,460
The only one who did a thing that wasn't just his name.

829
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:29,460
So with that you have survived podcast the ride and we'll see you next time.

830
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:35,494
See ya. Bye.
