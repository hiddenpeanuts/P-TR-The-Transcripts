1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Warning, the following podcast contains a frank discussion of current hot button issues,

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,400
but also non-current references to Jimmy Stewart and the Moody Blues.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,320
By episode's end, one of the hosts may be replaced, while another may drive his significant other

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,120
away forever.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,520
Kick your socks off, we're discussing the Splash Mountain reimagining and answering your

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:51,600
questions on Podcast the Ride.

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,140
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, your virtual theme park fix during quarantine.

10
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,180
Think of us as your little audio Disney quest.

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,340
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:12,460
You know, I hope whoever makes like the Oculus stuff is making a virtual podcasting simulator.

13
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,460
You hope that?

14
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,460
I hope that.

15
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,020
I hope like you put on the helmet and then you see like a cluttered coffee table and

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,620
then you have to record like you got to do ads, you got to say everything, you got to

17
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,060
make sure to plug your social media accounts.

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
Yeah.

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,980
And they have like a little like haptic feedback thing you wear on your ankle and Edwin the

20
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,260
dog can hump you because he's so stressed out that you're podcasting.

21
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,260
That would be very realistic.

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,940
Let's bring Scott Gardner in also here to pitch on this idea of a VR podcast.

23
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,200
Well this is all assuming that there is anyone who would buy such equipment who doesn't already

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,600
have a podcast, assuming that there is anyone at all who doesn't already have a podcast.

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
That's a good point.

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,120
I think at this point, podcast penetration is about 90 percent.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Is that right?

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Is that is right statistic?

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Yeah.

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,760
And I think if you lined it up with the coronavirus curve, I think it shoots up at all the same

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,200
moments that the virus does.

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,720
We're trying to hit 99 percent podcast penetration.

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,360
I know that's a that's a weird way to put it, but I podcast penetration.

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,200
You seemed uncomfortable just saying the word.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Yeah.

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,200
I mean, I look, you know, this is not a body podcast.

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,320
I don't I don't think I have I ever said the word penetration on podcasts the right before

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,000
you're up to two now.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't think so.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think this is a first.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,680
I think whoever like whoever keeps our wiki, please tell me if I've ever used it before.

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,320
I think podcasting is in general a medium for people who are at some point have been

43
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,000
uncomfortable with penetration.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,920
I think that is an overlap for sure.

45
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Yeah.

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,720
But I'm not using it in a in a sexual connotation.

47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm using it in a sure, you know, penetrate penetrating.

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,000
No, this was all about like VR stuff and, you know, what's the one of the main applications

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,640
of that or will be at some point.

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,920
So, yeah, you're describing you want to create a VR scenario where people have sex with their

51
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
favorite podcasters.

52
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,040
That's not what I said.

53
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,800
And it's not what I was going for.

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
It's not what you it's what you meant.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
So it was in your heart.

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:30,440
That would be honestly that would be scarier than Nicodemus, scarier than a horror, any

57
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
horror VR.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,560
That would be that. Yes, that's the horror character in the void, which we'll talk about,

59
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,040
which is having some some difficulties lately.

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,720
But yeah, if you if then it was like now you have to kiss Nicodemus.

61
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,880
And then, yeah, you had like what I was saying, haptic feedback like like face mask where

62
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,560
like your lips would tingle when you had to kiss Nicodemus, the demon, the void created

63
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,920
original IP demon.

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,120
Well, that's just the first jump scare.

65
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,640
The ultimate jump scare that the climax of it is you have to be emotionally intimate

66
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,720
with Nicodemus.

67
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,720
Oh, my God. You have to like share with him about your like deepest childhood trauma.

68
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,520
Well, you had no you do. Yeah, you just have to be vulnerable.

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,640
You have to open up to Nicodemus.

70
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,760
I don't like that.

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,280
Do you really love your parents, though?

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,200
Have you really gotten over what happened to you as a child?

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,680
Why can't you just tell me what you're feeling?

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,280
Why is this such a rigmarole?

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Your eyes are darting all over the place.

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,640
Look at me. You're always deflecting.

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,760
Why are you always deflecting?

78
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,600
Stop by the way, that's what Nicodemus sounds like.

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,680
I think so. We haven't. Yeah, we're too scared to have done this virtual reality demon

80
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,640
thing that we're describing and now creating a scenario where you go to him as your

81
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,120
therapist. Mm hmm.

82
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,760
But look, they hopefully the void survives what we'll eventually start talking about.

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,760
But I think multiple updates to Nicodemus are possible.

84
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,120
So we just we could.

85
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,080
There's a main topic we're going to talk about.

86
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,200
We could just jump around and say that that's we're catching up on a little bit of

87
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,040
topical news. We're post the Fourth of July holiday.

88
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,760
One of the weird things we found is, you know, we've talked about this thing several

89
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,720
times in the podcast, the void, this VR experience, and they are it was even part of

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,680
our downtown Disney ordeal.

91
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,760
That was one of the topics and they're out of Disneyland, gone out.

92
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,560
Yeah, it's evicted.

93
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,840
It was like such a harsh way to put it, too.

94
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,440
Mm hmm. It seems like, yeah, it felt very landlordy.

95
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,240
So like, it felt like the void fucked up somehow.

96
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,080
And when was the last time downtown Disney evicted?

97
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,120
It's like won't like Sunuk didn't get evicted.

98
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,840
Basin didn't get evicted.

99
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,560
I think they were chased out with torches.

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
No, it's.

101
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,440
I yeah, I don't know.

102
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,760
Wait, yeah, and it was just like a it just seems like the Disney relationship is

103
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,280
severed because this is the the the place that does VR experiences of we've talked

104
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,240
about them Star Wars and Wreck-It Ralph.

105
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,960
Yeah, we did Marvel and Paul Sheer a few months ago.

106
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,000
But now before quarantine.

107
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,560
Yeah, right. Yeah, right before.

108
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,040
Is it one of the worst things you could have done, you know, the day before?

109
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,840
Yeah, yeah, because, yeah, it's.

110
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,440
You're putting on a lot of equipment.

111
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,200
You don't know where it's been.

112
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,640
They weren't cleaning things at the time because nobody knew we we had to.

113
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,440
Yeah, but it's like, yeah, drop all the Disney stuff.

114
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,320
You're done. I so harsh.

115
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,240
Just just a kick to the curb.

116
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,400
Well, yeah, it said it was a violation of the licensing agreement, which

117
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,240
I I guess the licensing agreement entails paying your rent on time.

118
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,000
But I can't say I've heard about any other downtown Disney businesses

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,920
that have been essentially served like there's papers taped to the window

120
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,320
like that you have to like publicly display this stuff, I think, for businesses.

121
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,400
It's it's very strange.

122
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,720
And it's just a creepy thing to see at downtown Disney, like the, you know,

123
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,480
as if like this place has lost their liquor license.

124
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,960
It feels such like I didn't know they did that kind of thing.

125
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,720
It's like a health board shut them down.

126
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,520
It's like if you build a bear, had like a big condemned sign or something.

127
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,680
Like, you don't expect to see sort of real world things like that in downtown Disney.

128
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,120
No bears will be built here anymore.

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,680
Yes. No, don't don't come and steal the stuffing.

130
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm trying to find the Forbes talked about it.

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,600
Are they are they going to be out of Orlando to just

132
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,600
Disney evicts the void, withdraws Star Wars and record Ralph licenses.

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,640
And and they as Forbes supposes, without its own IP, Nick Adidas.

134
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,800
Hello. We just did a lot of great Nick Adidas material without its own IP

135
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,200
saddle with expensive leases and no path to revenue revenue anytime soon.

136
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,080
It's unclear how this pioneering company will survive this.

137
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,640
So no, that's why we've like really liked some of these things.

138
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,760
So this is a bummer.

139
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,280
Yeah. And that's the those are the people behind Evermore as well,

140
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,200
which is that very immersive park.

141
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,360
Where is it again? I always forget.

142
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,760
Oh, and I'd like to know it's in Utah, nowhere close to an airport.

143
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,640
So that should they should survive.

144
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,360
It shouldn't be a issue.

145
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,760
So, yeah, I we don't have the full story here.

146
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,880
I'm very curious.

147
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,320
But it is a bummer because I like we were.

148
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,680
Yeah, we were very happy with a lot of the void stuff.

149
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,240
And it feels like I don't know what's going to happen.

150
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,640
Now that the actual location is a void.

151
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,680
That's true. Will Nick Adidas here?

152
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
I mean, I don't want to this seems like I'm already like

153
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,440
trying to like be a vulture or something.

154
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,200
But like, will Nick Adidas come up for sale as an IP?

155
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,800
Is that something we can add to our collection of characters?

156
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,680
Hearted, unwanted, right?

157
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,640
Like Muggle McFay or various other characters we've mentioned on the show.

158
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,200
Yeah, yeah, there's there's there's one coming up that we do.

159
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,320
I don't think we discussed buying it, but you'll hear something on the second gate.

160
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,160
You know, I mean, I want all of these.

161
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,000
I think we mentioned that one in tandem with Leonardo Columbus,

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,520
who I would like to own very much. Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,880
I think, you know, we talked about this like Disney traded

164
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,440
Al Michaels for Oswald, the Lucky Rabbit cartoon.

165
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,600
Sportscaster Al Michaels was traded for a cartoon.

166
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,160
So could we trade Jason for Leonardo Columbus or Nick Adidas

167
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,400
for these various like with Disney accept Jason for Nick?

168
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,040
Sorry for Leonardo Columbus, the character we discovered that was in the

169
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,240
and I'm forgetting the Millennium Celebration.

170
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,600
You have caught Millennium Celebration in 2000.

171
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,840
Wait, so we're we're selling Jason.

172
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm just this is hypothetical.

173
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,000
I live to serve.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
It's a trade. It's a trade.

175
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,920
Al Michaels was traded.

176
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,760
I mean, I guess, Jason, in this scenario, you don't get to be on this theme

177
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,200
part podcast, but you do like you are a Disney character.

178
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,800
So that's right. Better, right?

179
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
Sure. If it comes with three hots in a cot, you know,

180
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,360
three hots, three hot.

181
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,000
That's what they say about the army, right?

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,480
Three outs in a cot. Oh, meals. Yeah.

183
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,440
You know, I thought maybe you meant dogs, which could be the meals.

184
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,800
Oh, there are a number of.

185
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,960
Yeah, I'd get I'd have any number of dogs to hang out with.

186
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,560
Huh? I yeah, I guess.

187
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,400
I mean, hot dogs. But right.

188
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,240
I don't think it was hot dogs. Yes.

189
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,280
Yeah, lots of those do.

190
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,320
So I guess seems like you're open to the idea that we could maybe

191
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,400
trade you to some sort of giant company for one of their IPs.

192
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,440
I mean, you know,

193
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,120
we can see it's not like film and TV is rushing to get back to shoot.

194
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,560
Animation is the only viable into so if I want to be,

195
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,840
you know, put into some sort of tune world at Disney's behest.

196
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,720
You're going to be tunified.

197
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,960
Ah, you know, I'm just keeping all my options.

198
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,880
It's up to them to decide what to do.

199
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,360
Yeah, I guess maybe they might want to run you through the cartoon machine.

200
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,720
Plusified. Wow.

201
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,960
Which makes you immortal.

202
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,680
Maybe maybe you get to live forever once you do this.

203
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,520
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I look, we'll see.

204
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,720
I'll see if I can get in touch with some sort of a lawyer

205
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,200
and see what we can do as far as drafting up some some proposals for these companies.

206
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,680
And it's no offense, Jason, it's just that we would love to have Nick

207
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,760
Ademus host the show with Scott and I.

208
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,640
So now are the third co-host is the Voids Nick Ademus,

209
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,840
demon of a vanishment.

210
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,720
A vanishment of vanishment.

211
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,600
Yes. The demon of a vanishment.

212
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,840
A demon who, you know, we haven't talked to.

213
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,040
Maybe we don't.

214
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,240
I haven't said a lot of the context, and I haven't.

215
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,480
You didn't even know the story.

216
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,040
It's about a he comes from a demonstration at the World's

217
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,880
Colombian Exposition, like a World's Fair thing.

218
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,000
He's from 1893.

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,760
So he's like an electricity experiment gone awry

220
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,840
that brought a demon to this earth from the he's a steampunk demon,

221
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,560
I think is what he is.

222
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,360
So hosted by my childish

223
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,680
and his childless man in his 30s, one child, full man in his 30s

224
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,680
and a steampunk spirit, evil demon, steampunk demon of a vanishment

225
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,440
who of a vanishment, a demon of a vanishment who's like the second Darren.

226
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,120
Right. There were two Darren's on Bewitched Mike. Yeah.

227
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,600
Yeah. Mm hmm.

228
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,320
And look, you know, we're hitting your we're going to hit year three or four,

229
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,880
I guess, soon.

230
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,520
So this might be a kind of a cousin Oliver situation

231
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,600
where we need to do this to bump up the ratings.

232
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,040
Would he though give us Nickademus?

233
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,440
And I'm also still here.

234
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,600
He is just like cousin Oliver.

235
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,680
Oh, just a totally new. Yeah. Yeah.

236
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,680
Honestly, I think that's going to be too many.

237
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,240
Yeah, I think so. I got to agree with you there.

238
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,280
Sorry, Jason. It's K. I have four hosts.

239
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,520
I don't know. That's a time.

240
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,240
It's a three host kind of thing. We have guests.

241
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,960
Yeah, I kind of like though that maybe he because it, you know,

242
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,920
well, as with Darren on Bewitched, just keeping the name

243
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,240
just for consistency, I think it would make the audience more comfortable.

244
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,280
So it is Nickademus, but playing Jason.

245
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,240
And I'm just sure.

246
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,400
OK, well, you're starting to lose me now.

247
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,680
But what if I have an affinity for ice cream?

248
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,200
I love naps in the Orlando sun and humidity.

249
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,960
Yeah, the people won't maybe even some people won't notice.

250
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,080
I engage in marijuana use slightly more than you, Scott and Mike.

251
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,960
If I am made the subject of fun, your souls will be sent to the combine.

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,320
The electricity combine, the property of this earth, me, Jason.

253
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,200
I know youth slang more than you do.

254
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,120
Accept it or die.

255
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,640
Yeah, I look, I

256
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,640
a lot of big changes coming to the show, I think so.

257
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,280
Any of this stuff is on the table.

258
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,040
I keep it fresh, folks. Yeah.

259
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,440
So big, big things coming up.

260
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,240
Something else is undergoing some changes.

261
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Yeah, well, you know, from the the fairly sensitive topic

262
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,040
that is that we came here to discuss after having talked about changing

263
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,640
out one host for a steampunk demon.

264
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, isn't that the fun of this show?

265
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,840
The whiplash it gets now on to Disney correcting a 30 year oopsie

266
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,120
and easily correct it.

267
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,560
They really have to be adding that up at this point.

268
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,960
Like, why did why did a log flume

269
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,280
need to be about our most problematic film?

270
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,400
Yes, of course, we're talking about Splash Mountain.

271
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,960
And the Internet has been very normal about it

272
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,080
changing as expected.

273
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:19,120
Although, you know, I will say this, not as bad as I thought it could be.

274
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,000
No, I don't think it has been.

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,320
Yeah. Yeah, I don't think it has been,

276
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,320
but I have not been clicking Seymour replies under any tweets about it.

277
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,840
I've been actively avoiding it.

278
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,680
But for whatever reason, reading through people's remarks,

279
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,120
I feel like maybe it's like five to 10 percent better

280
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,800
than it would have been five years ago.

281
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,360
I think that's yes. Yeah, I think that's very true.

282
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,040
Yeah, as are a number of these kinds of, you know, I feel like this has been

283
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,600
a such an era of changes that were talked about four or five years ago.

284
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,400
And now they're just happening.

285
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,920
Changes like shoving a bunch of statues into the lake,

286
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,800
which has been fun to watch.

287
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,840
We of course are there's no way someone listening to this doesn't know this.

288
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,400
But Splash Mountain, which is a ride that is based as it currently stands,

289
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,880
is a ride based on Disney's extremely problematic 1940s film Song of the South.

290
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,320
They have announced a refresh, a plus up, as they called it in the actual

291
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,000
press release. They're going to re-theme it to the 2009 film Princess

292
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,080
and the Frog.

293
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,840
So which way and I guess maybe the bigger story here is that there was a

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,640
Twitter discussion about doing this very thing.

295
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,040
There were petitions going around suggesting this.

296
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,360
A gentleman had posted a Twitter thread proposing how this could be done

297
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,840
and how it might play out.

298
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,040
So somebody we know, we've met with Freddie Chambers, is that correct?

299
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,120
Got a lot of Freddie. Yeah, yeah.

300
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,600
Got a lot of traction off of that.

301
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,600
And so this was like the momentum was building on this throughout a couple of

302
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,360
weeks. And then suddenly one morning out of nowhere, seemingly Disney comes in and

303
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,400
says, yeah, that's exactly what we're thinking.

304
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,280
Yes, we're actually good.

305
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,840
Totally thinking the same thing.

306
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,760
Jinx. And here we go. We're doing it.

307
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,320
Totally. We've been thinking about it for a year, they said.

308
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,920
It's out of sight for like a year over a year, really like five years.

309
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,920
We're totally do you want to see?

310
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,840
Do you want to see what we were working on?

311
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,520
Because we have it all in behind us.

312
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,480
It's all there. That's kind of the I think we probably all agree that this that

313
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,880
the refresh is going to be good and we're excited about it.

314
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,600
And we'll talk a little about what we think it could be.

315
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,000
And I think the thing that's a little funny is this, the Disney like, OK, well,

316
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,680
so look, we're way ahead of you.

317
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,320
And the newest Jason's heart.

318
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,560
Go ahead. Oh, Mike, I was going to say, and Mike, you pretty early on called like

319
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,320
they must have had these plans in a drawer for a while.

320
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,040
Like you don't just have concept art overnight.

321
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,200
You know, I think that the probably the reality of it is that and I think Jim Hill

322
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,600
and there was a recent Disney dish podcast and Jim Hill talked about, I think,

323
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,040
especially after they changed red, they did the they changed the bride auction on

324
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,120
pirates. He says that they had a list of things.

325
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,960
Really? Through. Yeah, there's a list.

326
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,360
And, you know, there's plenty of stuff we all Peter Pan.

327
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,720
It's time to change the native depiction.

328
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,200
Yeah, Peter Pan. It's and get rid of the ride entirely in the character entirely.

329
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,880
No, there's a movie coming.

330
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,400
There's a coming.

331
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,080
And the good news is that on this podcast alone, we've got casting for a pan,

332
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,800
a smee and a very tall lost boy.

333
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,800
So sure, I think we're all set.

334
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,320
And I don't want to sell myself short, but some of us will work for scale.

335
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,360
We know Scott is pan. Yeah.

336
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,120
So let's make that cast me in it.

337
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,440
I have to do it. I have to wear the thing.

338
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,080
And I've got a number of tweets saying Jason is me.

339
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,240
Right. Which Mike, you know, we talked about it.

340
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,920
And I think you've been trying to will that to exist for nearly a decade, Michael.

341
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,080
So can I be a pan who says why?

342
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,040
In fact, I did grow up and I'm happy I did.

343
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,320
I still now I haven't turned my back on childish things.

344
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,360
I enjoy them very much.

345
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,960
However, I refuse to run around and mock little girls

346
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,400
and say, I'll be a little boy forever, because that's weird.

347
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,200
Unfortunately, the great Robin Williams already gave that performance.

348
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,240
No, no, no. What? No, because he turned his back on it.

349
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,720
No, because he

350
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,920
moved on. He's like, I'm a lawyer and I throw I'm on my cell phone

351
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,720
and I miss my kids baseball game.

352
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,640
This is a well rounded pan who, you know, is a well adjusted adult, but also,

353
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,080
you know, flies around as well, too.

354
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,160
I hear what you're saying.

355
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,720
And that's a good idea.

356
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,720
But could you just do the lines from the Disney cartoon

357
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,600
just for us right now that you did on the Peter Pan episode?

358
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,280
Just one or two of them.

359
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,480
What were they?

360
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,840
I don't know. You just did some pan impression.

361
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,640
Here I have my notes in front of me.

362
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,600
So I have to you like my take, but I'm going to do.

363
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,240
I have to do the same lines.

364
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,680
Just we want both versions to see, you know.

365
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,840
OK. All right.

366
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,200
I thought the only one I have written down is girls talk too much.

367
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,280
Well, get on with it, girl.

368
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,480
Tink says you're a big, ugly girl.

369
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,600
This is see, this is what I view.

370
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,960
Anyone who wants to make fun of me for saying Pan is canceled now,

371
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,600
do you like hearing these lines again?

372
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,560
Huh? There's a reason I have an issue here.

373
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,800
Right. Well, look, thanks for doing that.

374
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,040
We're still going to take it under consideration at the pan committee,

375
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,000
at the Peter Pan movie committee over here.

376
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,600
So, yes, so there's a list.

377
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,680
I will say Country Bears is on the list.

378
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,040
But as a bear, it is on the list

379
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,400
because some of those songs are like body by like modern children's standards.

380
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,560
Well, the one that Jim says is for body.

381
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,800
I don't know. Jim didn't say body.

382
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,360
Jim says mama, don't whoop little Buford,

383
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,760
which is a joke song about like hitting a kid.

384
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,160
So like stuff like that is going to go.

385
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,040
And like you're on the saddle.

386
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,800
I think one on the saddle might stay.

387
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,160
But but so I'm just saying, all my point is, is that there is a list of this stuff.

388
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,800
Yeah. The Disney knows.

389
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,320
I think, though, that what it seems like is Splash Mountain

390
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,400
might have been at the end of the list and is now at the front of the list.

391
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,720
Why would it have been at the end?

392
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,120
Because it's expensive.

393
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,720
Yeah, that. Yeah, that's true.

394
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,880
And that's some of what, you know, there's things that were like

395
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,040
out of our depths to talk about a little bit.

396
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,200
But one thing we can talk about is logistics.

397
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,640
And that's one thing that I flashed to.

398
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,640
I think this thing will be really cool when they do it.

399
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,200
But I'm also like, this is going to be the most expensive thing

400
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,480
because it is such it's a very long ride.

401
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,040
And it is a ride with hundreds of animatronics.

402
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,120
And assuming that they were going to keep it that way and not reuse animatronics,

403
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,360
although maybe they would if it was going to be entirely new.

404
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,120
Like, oh, my God, that is so much space to to populate,

405
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,960
which I, you know, a year ago, I would have felt like they'll do this.

406
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,600
No problem. Now it's I don't know if you've heard.

407
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,120
It's been a really rough time financially for the parks.

408
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,040
I'm just curious how it'll how it'll play.

409
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I just I want this to be like the full tilt version of what it could be

410
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,080
and not like full of screens and, you know,

411
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,280
how fast because it has to be.

412
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
I think of what Jim will.

413
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,960
So Jim has a full rundown of at least one of the plans kind of for it.

414
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,160
So I think it is sort of taking some of the scenes and just changing them around

415
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,200
and putting the alligator in where the bear was.

416
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,160
Like, there's certain things I think that they're going to

417
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,480
keep the bones of the actual ride.

418
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,800
Perhaps the like like literally the bones,

419
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,600
because the bear is kind of rotund

420
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,720
and then the alligator is kind of rotund.

421
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,920
So will it? Yeah, maybe they can just do some reuse there.

422
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,320
So I think that's probably part of it.

423
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,000
But I would assume Disney would put a lot of money into this

424
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,520
because this is not that's not a good idea if they they cheap out on this.

425
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,680
Well, I mean, clearly they, you know, they can't cheap out on this.

426
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,680
It clearly reached the point where it's no longer

427
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,960
a financial plus. It's a liability.

428
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,800
It's weird that they did this in the 80s.

429
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,360
I think the idea was maybe we can separate

430
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,840
some elements from a problematic thing.

431
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,120
And I assume it's also pre Internet.

432
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
And they're like thinking, well, we're not going to put this out.

433
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,080
And like at a certain point, people will come to know it just as this ride.

434
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh, again, as I said, the mind blowing stat, I said the first time around

435
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,600
that this movie was re released in the 80s.

436
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,720
Well, that's crazy. That was a test.

437
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,720
It was a test to see if people would be a gog at it.

438
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,960
And they went and saw the re-release and they're like,

439
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,680
I guess we can make a ride out of it.

440
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,440
Let's just make the TGIF stars ride it a lot.

441
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,640
So everyone associates it with our Friday night lineup and not the

442
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,240
weird historical artifact that makes people think that everyone was

443
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,120
a wacky character in Reconstruction RSL.

444
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,520
Well, and like yearning for the days before that,

445
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,920
the movie was so controversial at the time it was made.

446
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,000
It's not like in hindsight.

447
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,320
Yeah, big end OSP protests.

448
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,240
Monarch release. Yeah, it's bizarre.

449
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,520
So my assumption about the 80s is they were like, well, you know, we could.

450
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,440
It's the Mark Davis characters and it's nice and we can sort of take

451
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,600
these things out of context and maybe people won't know

452
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,880
because we're not going to put the movie out on home video, which is still crazy.

453
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,360
I'm not making excuses for people, but I'm assuming that's the logic.

454
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,880
But when you get to an Internet era, the Internet never forgets.

455
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,800
Yeah, this is the thing.

456
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,120
And if anybody's on the fence about this, I think it's fine to feel nostalgic

457
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,320
for this because we just grew up with this ride.

458
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,280
But like this is what I was imagining.

459
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,240
You imagine a kid who's like us, a weird nerd kid who's black,

460
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,920
who loves Disneyland, goes on Splash Mountain, loves it

461
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,240
and then goes home and Googles it like that sucks.

462
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,960
Yeah, that's what I've been flashing to is anybody like going on the ride,

463
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
having a good time.

464
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,800
So what's that right about?

465
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,520
Who are those characters about in the conversation that ensues

466
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,880
and that that conversation could lead you to a very like

467
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,040
grim film and some bad stuff.

468
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,720
And with this remodel, you will go on the ride, have the same thrills,

469
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,200
the drops in the same places, a bunch of happy songs.

470
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,520
And then you'll say, what were those characters from?

471
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,040
Oh, this like this nice movie that's very charming

472
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,880
with a lot of great black artists in it.

473
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,960
And that's a better conversation to have after.

474
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,200
And I think that's why you do it.

475
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,680
It'll make people feel good.

476
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,840
Yes, absolutely. Yeah.

477
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,800
I think if you feel like the ride was in a gray area,

478
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,240
it is based on a film that is not in a gray area.

479
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,240
And I think that's ultimately the reason to not. Right.

480
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,760
And the parks are different than movies, too, I think.

481
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Like there's a lot of debate, of course, about movies and censorship

482
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,960
and like movies, like they are like a document.

483
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,160
And you should put a thing at the front of them

484
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,640
explaining the context of the time.

485
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,760
But the parks are living things.

486
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,200
So I see a lot of arguments of like, well, it's been here for 30 years.

487
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,520
And it's like things change in the parks all the time.

488
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,160
That's what's going to happen.

489
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,720
And you should get used to it happening more because it's going to happen.

490
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,200
Absolutely. And in fact, if you think about it,

491
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,720
Splash Mountain 1.0 will have ended up having a longer run

492
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,920
by far than Jurassic Park, the ride

493
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,920
way before it switched to Jurassic World, the ride.

494
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,640
So, you know, it's like that's a gigantic ride.

495
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,880
That's that's longer than a ton of things get.

496
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,280
And I think it's fine to feel sad.

497
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,840
I mean, when you're 10 years old and going on this and have no idea,

498
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,520
you just get nostalgic for a thing that's a fun experience.

499
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,960
But as an adult, you go, yeah, it's time.

500
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,840
It's time for this to go.

501
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,960
Well, so you could be sad, I think, if they were going to take this

502
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,400
ride down and replace it with a lecture or like, you know,

503
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,480
or like, remember when there was some dumbass senator

504
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,720
who people chose to elect said something about what if they

505
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,200
are they're going to rename the Washington Monument, the obelisk of wokeness,

506
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,760
which a lot of people said is actually cool.

507
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,120
That's kind of a neat, neat, cooler name.

508
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,080
But also like, no, it's not.

509
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,520
If you were taking out a fun ride and replacing it with a bummer, perhaps

510
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,120
this is going to be the same ride.

511
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,280
It's going to be a happy celebration.

512
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,320
That is, I think, according to the official literature, like a Mardi Gras.

513
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,480
It's going to be like a happy party.

514
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,480
It's still going to make you

515
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,200
there's no reason to be sad.

516
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,440
I watched the movie last night, Princess and the Frog.

517
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,840
I hadn't seen it in a long time.

518
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,680
Very catchy songs.

519
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,560
There is a giant swamp gator playing a trumpet.

520
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
I mean, what else?

521
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,680
He's what else do you want?

522
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,320
I mean, that's great.

523
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
I'll say sorry, Mike.

524
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,960
I will say, I'm very curious

525
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,040
for a movie.

526
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,560
Uh, a lot of voodoo in that movie.

527
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,440
And I'm curious to see how that is.

528
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,360
Like, I'm curious how much they put of that in

529
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,960
because they just kind of use voodoo as like a catchall.

530
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,160
Sure. I mean, I don't know.

531
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,840
I think that the movie is taking.

532
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,000
Excuse me. The ride is taking place after the movie.

533
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,160
So they can sort of create a fully new narrative

534
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,120
and even put characters in different contexts as well.

535
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,120
So that which makes honestly, it seems cooler.

536
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,200
I mean, because it's being headed up by the woman

537
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,560
who did Runaway Railway, I believe.

538
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,720
I looked up some stuff about her.

539
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,360
Sharita Carter, the senior creative producer on this.

540
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,720
She worked in engineering for a long time, worked her way up from accountant.

541
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,640
She was an accountant for a long time, then moved over to the creative world,

542
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,400
managed a concept lab that was like testing out different technology.

543
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,040
And the thing that came out of that was projection mapping

544
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,280
and starting to deploy that in the parks, which is all over the parks.

545
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,480
And if you watch episode five of the Imagineering story on Disney Plus,

546
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,080
she talks about all that and implementing it on Mara in the Indiana Jones adventure.

547
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,360
I think she kind of spearheaded that project that now when you go up that ramp,

548
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,520
that, you know, Mara looks mad and the lightning flashes

549
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,040
and all those cool effects they do.

550
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,160
And then it seems that was I mean, imagineers do all this stuff.

551
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,400
You don't even know what it is.

552
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,720
You know, they aren't credited usually.

553
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,040
But she's associated with that.

554
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,880
And then Mickey and Minnie's runaway railway, which I haven't

555
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,080
I purposefully not watch yet because I don't want to spoil it.

556
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,280
I don't either.

557
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,200
It seems that people seem to love it.

558
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,200
So I think this this plus up is in very good hands.

559
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,440
So, yeah, I think you're doing you're using like the characters and they're

560
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,360
going to get to do a new story with them, which is cool and exciting.

561
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,000
And it's also like good that it's not the book report.

562
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,360
Oh, yes. So there I because I saw I maybe didn't read that initial

563
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,520
press release that carefully and I saw people saying

564
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,760
I just hope it's not one of those that just steps through all the events

565
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,040
of the movie. But quote the official press release.

566
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,160
We pick this story up after the final kiss, which implies that the main characters

567
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,880
are not frogs, at least when we meet them.

568
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,840
Perhaps they would be frogs again, but we don't know.

569
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,200
And we join Princess Tiana and Lewis, who's the alligator on a musical adventure

570
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,280
as they prepare for their first ever Mardi Gras performance.

571
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,600
So it is a it is a new story,

572
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,440
which I think will make this thing more fun.

573
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,760
And yeah, that'll I think determine is is the villain Dr.

574
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,800
Facilier in there.

575
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,200
He died, but he's like a magic guy.

576
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,360
So maybe he can come back like Farquaad, like the ghost of Farquaad.

577
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,080
I mean, it's a great performance from Keith David.

578
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,440
I mean, he's great. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

579
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,800
I think he'll probably I think I think Jim had a real a rundown of at least a version

580
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,440
of of it in their head, and I believe he was in it.

581
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,120
I think he's in the in the in the lift hill.

582
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,320
That's what you'd have to think.

583
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,320
And that was that was in Freddie's notion of it.

584
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,400
And that sounds really cool, especially I I Jason, you really watched it.

585
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,120
I had never watched this movie and I thought I should before we talked about it.

586
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,800
And it made me more excited about this whole thing, because I found it very charming.

587
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,840
I thought it was great.

588
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,160
And there's there's a lot of like crazy business with his shadow

589
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,240
and like big, scary shadows getting projected.

590
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,200
And that's sort of what happens already on the hill a little bit with rare Fox.

591
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
So you could do things in that spirit.

592
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,680
So you had the lift over and the drop being, you know, like the villains

593
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,280
rise before the the the sheer pleasure, as Tony Baxter

594
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,960
described it, that that follows after the drop.

595
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,480
Yeah. I mean, and then you go out of Mama Odie's house, I believe.

596
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,200
That's what the sort of the set piece of the ride is.

597
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,080
Or I guess what do you call it?

598
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,360
I guess that's what the that's what you're leaving the log and the big drop.

599
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,920
Yes. So that means so that because in the movie

600
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,600
they go to visit her in this big tree as it has a boat sticking out of it.

601
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,560
And in the concept art, they released.

602
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,360
That's what it is. So it is.

603
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,400
It is crazy how much overlap there is and how much they already had the bones

604
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,360
to do this, because that was a lot of the question.

605
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,120
Like if you were ever going to replace it with what?

606
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
Because are you going to find a thing with a big tree?

607
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,120
Oh, this. Oh, my God.

608
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,600
So that's cool.

609
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,480
It begs this question, though,

610
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,440
that in in current Splash Mountain,

611
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,840
it is a big like tree stump, essentially.

612
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,760
And that that it is also, you know, the ride is called Splash Mountain.

613
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,480
That thing is called Chickapin Hill.

614
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,960
In the movie, this is in no way a mountain.

615
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,480
That is purely a tree.

616
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,680
It's not on top of a hill or a mountain.

617
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,080
It's a tree.

618
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,520
So can you still call this ride Splash Mountain?

619
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,320
That is a question because Splash Mountain has nothing to do with Song of the South.

620
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,720
No, we can say definitely.

621
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,840
Yeah, Eisner name.

622
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,400
Yes, because of the mountains.

623
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,200
It's a good well. And after

624
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,120
Darryl Hannah, the Darryl Hannah film, that's really why it's called that,

625
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,600
which, as I texted to you, my the only sin of splash with Darryl

626
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,800
Hannah in Disney's eyes is its depiction of the dirty, dirty female form.

627
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,480
Well, of course, there I have to agree.

628
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,600
Disney Plus, of course, censored Splat.

629
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,160
They like put more mermaid hair and blurred her body.

630
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,480
This is one thing I don't understand about Disney Plus is the puritanical

631
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,160
nature of it and the creepy like getting rid of things.

632
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,720
And it feels a lot like when Blockbuster would scrub movies

633
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,120
because like Southern morality groups would make them up.

634
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm not keen on all that stuff.

635
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,520
There's such a tight leash on everything in Disney

636
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,160
where it's like it's just I mean, it's a struggle.

637
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,360
Like we obviously like all this Disney stuff, but we also talk about how crazy

638
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,920
and fucked up things are.

639
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,760
It's like it's just a struggle to get a gay character in a major movie.

640
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:00,000
Like it was like Black Panther at Marvel when Ike Perlmutter was in charge,

641
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,320
was like that was going to be hard.

642
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,520
Like that's not going to work. We're not going to do that.

643
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,640
That was a struggle for years to get made.

644
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,280
Cut to it, making so much money, being a massive cultural phenomenon.

645
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,600
So it's it's very similar.

646
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,160
I feel like where they're just like it's the most conservative.

647
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,880
We don't want to make anyone mad and we need to preserve.

648
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,480
And it's like, is really are people really going to be mad about

649
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,680
a little nudity and splash a side boob a little bit?

650
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,000
That really well, that's really

651
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,240
that's why Splash Mountain was so odd for so long.

652
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,480
It's a company that always has all its ducks in a row.

653
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,760
And then there is one very odd like this hugely popular ride,

654
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,760
partially largely popular because it's a water ride and the parks are in

655
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,200
very warm climates for the most part, at least in America.

656
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,120
And yeah. And if you say, well, so that's based on this

657
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,720
and that the Haunted Mansion's original, what's this based on?

658
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,720
Oh, don't worry about it.

659
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,680
It's great. It's based on the T-shirts you can buy at the gift shop,

660
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,160
which they are trying.

661
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,400
They are simultaneously like we're redoing Splash Mountain.

662
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,960
We also have a lot of back stock to sell off.

663
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,440
We have a lot of stuffed animals and little guys that sit on your shoulder.

664
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,400
And oh, yeah.

665
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,320
Well, look, yeah, it's not like completely virtuous or anything. Yeah.

666
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,920
And it's also it's going to be weird for a while because the, you know,

667
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,600
the Magic Kingdom is opening.

668
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,960
As you're listening to this, the Magic Kingdom is opening back up tomorrow

669
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,760
and it will be open with Splash Mountain as is.

670
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,640
And that's kind of one of the weirdest things about all that.

671
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,720
I mean, especially as is could be open for a really long time.

672
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,880
So this making this press release is kind of just it's like

673
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,160
getting their foot in the door. It's like, OK, so even if you go on the ride

674
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,920
and it makes you mad in any way, eventually some time from now.

675
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,320
But it's just going to be odd.

676
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,080
And you feel like, you know, it's the worst thing

677
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,440
it's going to happen is that the park's going to open back up in Florida.

678
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,280
And the worst people on earth will proudly go on Splash Mountain

679
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,880
and film it in a way it's like, see, it's fine.

680
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,320
And also not wearing a mask like see, it's fine.

681
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,240
And breathing in the splash air

682
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,760
to make a point, the sweetest smell

683
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,320
tried to stop me, please.

684
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,560
And you know what?

685
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,600
We'll come back to the idea, the name of it real quick.

686
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,960
I will say that water smell ain't going away.

687
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,760
Don't worry. Yeah.

688
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,320
I saw people saying like, it's just I'm going to miss the stuff, you know,

689
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,040
the you know, the the you know, the drop and the smell and like,

690
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,240
well, that's all not going to this.

691
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,800
I'm convinced it will have the bones of what we like a lot.

692
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,960
I like I swear there's going to be so much of the of the vibe.

693
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,280
I think like I really believe like 70 to 80 percent or more about what

694
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,360
like what you dig about this ride is still going to be intact,

695
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,680
mixed with up to date, like better technology and,

696
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,400
you know, been very good songs and all that. Right.

697
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,920
And it's like everybody.

698
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,040
There's a lot of people throw fits when stuff changes. But like

699
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,520
I want cool new stuff in the Haunted Mansion, too.

700
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,680
I want cool like everywhere.

701
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,920
And like, I'm sure they're going to throw a lot of money at this.

702
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,240
And it's going to be very cool.

703
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,560
I'm sure of it. Yeah, I am just I'm all for this.

704
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,880
I'm excited to see what they're going to do.

705
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,160
I think they give it six months to a year of the

706
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,480
old version of Splash Mountain staying open because people have not been able

707
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,160
to ride it. I don't know about that.

708
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,280
I'm curious. I'm I wonder if because people aren't like people

709
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,520
are going to trickle back to the park.

710
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,800
I don't I don't know.

711
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,840
Jim Hill was saying like, oh, there'll be like farewell events,

712
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,600
but I don't think that sits right right now.

713
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
I don't think they will do farewell events.

714
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,320
No, I granted I was wrong.

715
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,680
I said this I was guessing in our text, I was like

716
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,360
they will probably when people started talking about Splash Mountain

717
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,760
going away online of like they should maybe do that.

718
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,320
Like I said, I think Disney thinks they can probably get five to

719
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,960
10 more years out of it.

720
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,960
And I was wrong and I was happy I was wrong.

721
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,640
Yeah, I mean, I was I didn't think

722
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,000
it's partly because we've just lived with it so long

723
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
and it's just like, oh, yeah, that's weird.

724
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,960
OK, you know, like as opposed to like really sitting down

725
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,120
and thinking about it and going, yeah, of course, this has to go.

726
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,000
So I am I was surprised, too.

727
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But yeah, I don't think it doesn't feel right to be like and say goodbye

728
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,480
to all your good friends.

729
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,240
Oh, yeah. Any official art with that?

730
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,080
I think the thing that surprised me about it was, yeah, I yeah,

731
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,560
I felt like this won't happen just because, you know, less because they

732
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,680
they aren't sensitive to the issues and more just like they're not going to do it

733
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,880
because of Twitter.

734
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
I really didn't think that was the case.

735
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,040
And now, and did they do it because of Twitter?

736
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,680
I don't think so.

737
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,200
Did they get this announcement out of what they were doing anyway

738
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,280
because of Twitter? Absolutely.

739
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,400
So you do have to credit the discussion with shaping it

740
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,280
and forcing their hand, getting them to just come out and say, all right,

741
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,520
it's coming. Don't worry about it.

742
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,800
Right. And look, major media companies

743
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,320
and politicians, by and large, do things when there's pressure,

744
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,720
not because they're like looking to make the absolute right move

745
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,400
before the pressure comes.

746
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,600
So, yes, absolutely.

747
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,360
It's like it's a storm, a perfect storm of things.

748
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,760
And I'm going, yeah, it's out. It's done. We're doing we're good.

749
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Yeah, we were. We're we swear we're doing it.

750
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,280
I'll say this.

751
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,360
And this is just speculation right now.

752
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,880
This is just a rumor. Unrelated Splash Mountain.

753
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,680
All for Splash Mountain.

754
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,880
Can't wait to see it.

755
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,520
If after the job they did flipping guardians,

756
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,720
I'm just so excited to see what they could do with this.

757
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,840
I am begging them, please imagineering.

758
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,280
I do not think weird Al Jankovic and Lin-Manuel Miranda

759
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,120
can save the Hall of Presidents.

760
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,720
Please just demolish it and build a sleepy hollow thrill ride.

761
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,560
Build a headless horseman indoor thrill ride.

762
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,480
I am begging you, please do not try to make a fun

763
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,600
and funky Hall of Presidents.

764
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,920
We were did weird Al enter into the picture.

765
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,800
Weird Al, I get the Hamilton reference.

766
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,280
Well, why is weird Al in there?

767
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,040
That is just the rumor I saw going around.

768
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,800
Weird Al and Lin-Manuel Miranda possibly

769
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,880
fixing Hall of Presidents.

770
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,600
Why don't you?

771
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,040
I don't know that it's I don't know that it's sourced.

772
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,520
I think that's a fan fan service.

773
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
Full banking. Yeah. Yeah.

774
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,680
I mean, American Adventure is going to change.

775
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,920
I don't know if weird Al is going to go in there either.

776
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,000
I would like the I would like to see the hall of Lin-Manuel Miranda

777
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,920
talk show host friendship.

778
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,040
I I'm not convinced enough that Lin-Manuel is friends

779
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,240
with each and every person who hosts the talk show

780
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,640
and that you'd consider any of them those real bromances.

781
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,160
So I would like to see just a 20 minute show

782
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,400
telling me all about his individual relationships

783
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,680
with Jimmy Fallon and James Corden.

784
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,240
And, you know, do they hang out for real?

785
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,680
Do they text each other?

786
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,200
We need to know these ants and we can tell we can we can

787
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,240
reveal these answers via animatronics.

788
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,720
Scott, I like the idea, but I think I'm going to have to poke holes.

789
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,520
It's going to have to just be Jimmy Kimmel because of the synergy.

790
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,920
Oh, that's the only one that they would.

791
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,680
Yeah. Yeah.

792
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,960
You know, now that it now that I think about it, I don't

793
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,080
I associate Lin-Manuel less with Jimmy Kimmel, which is a shame,

794
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,200
because I think he's he should have equal

795
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,280
bromances with every single person.

796
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,320
Look, I couldn't agree more.

797
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,960
See them wrestling and play fighting and musing each other's hair.

798
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,480
Yeah. Can't get enough of that content. Right.

799
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,200
I will getting back to your first question, though,

800
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,080
I do probably think Splash Mountain as a name is gone.

801
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,120
I think it doesn't really make sense.

802
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,760
But I if it's a tree.

803
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,440
Yeah, I don't know that it's there is no.

804
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,400
Yeah, it isn't a mountain.

805
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,920
There's no the no the no way is what happens in the movie.

806
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,720
A mountain. But if I were on a board of directors,

807
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,760
I would cast my vote for keeping the name.

808
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,960
Why? For stupidity.

809
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,520
It's so silly of a name.

810
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,720
And I and as has been discussed on Twitter and, you know,

811
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,480
Jenny Nicholson was funnier about this probably than I will be.

812
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,840
But the Disney's names are so fucking complicated these days.

813
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,800
So if you're going to make it something simple,

814
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,040
do not make this a paragraph of a title of a.

815
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,960
That's the problem, too, I think, with calling a splash mountain

816
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,360
because they can't just call it splash mountain.

817
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,080
It will absolutely have 10 different words after that.

818
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,480
I'm OK with that.

819
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,360
Even an amended splash mountain.

820
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,200
The thing in the headline and I think this is wrong, but I think

821
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,240
in the headline of what Disney released and a lot of

822
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,360
scuttlebutt and blogs and stuff seem to believe that what

823
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,560
this phrase that they put out is the name or as a code name,

824
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,160
they're calling it right now, which is New Adventures with Princess Tiana.

825
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,680
And they they cannot call it that.

826
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,280
That is the dullest. That is not fun.

827
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,640
No, no, no, no.

828
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,560
Yeah, I I wonder.

829
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,000
I mean, it's like is it so a splash mountain?

830
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,880
But it's a parentheses, but it's a tree really.

831
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,360
And it's Adventures of Tiana.

832
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,560
Then the adventures are new.

833
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,120
Something like that is not quite that, but something like that.

834
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,440
Tiana's ultimate swamp.

835
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,280
Fantastic adventure celebration magic.

836
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,080
How about parentheses magic wish?

837
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,480
Like tree tree mountain.

838
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,800
Yeah, it's still a mountain mountain.

839
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,600
I thought Bayou Mountain.

840
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,040
That's a funny.

841
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,320
What about what about splash Bayou?

842
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,160
Oh, splash Bayou.

843
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,960
Oh, OK.

844
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,960
Has the simplicity.

845
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,000
I like that. Yeah.

846
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,640
And isn't the song on the bayou,

847
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,040
there's a song on the bayou, right in the movie?

848
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,760
Yeah. No, no, no, it's not.

849
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,520
It's not in the it's like it was just here down in New Orleans.

850
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,280
Down in New Orleans, they play a snippet of on the Mark Twain.

851
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,440
I think the big ending number will probably be dig a little deeper.

852
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,280
That's so catchy.

853
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,880
Oh, going down the bayou is going down the bayou.

854
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,160
Yeah. Yeah.

855
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,200
Jim Hill does say, I believe, dig a little deeper is the end is the big finale.

856
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,400
Sense to me, that sounds good.

857
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,760
Well, that's the thing we talked about.

858
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,440
The finale feels like it could be a lot, you know,

859
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,200
a lot of what it currently had.

860
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,240
And probably you could still reuse the riverboat.

861
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,760
There's riverboats in the movie.

862
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,480
I think that's right.

863
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,280
I think they're going to reuse some of the animatronics for sure.

864
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,840
I'm not sure the gym, the gym, gym, seem to have a lot of details.

865
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,840
I don't know where Jim gets the entire proposal.

866
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,200
Also, we got to have Jim on.

867
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,920
I don't know. He's not going to give up his sources

868
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,400
because he's a professional longtime journalist.

869
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,880
But I'm very curious because he has this whole proposal that he read off.

870
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,920
So I'm very curious.

871
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,480
But if you want to listen to Disney dish with Jim and Len,

872
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,120
if you want to hear more about the specifics of what's being proposed.

873
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,040
Is it now is it weird, you think, to reuse the.

874
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,320
Animatronics to, you know, listeners probably know this,

875
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,040
but the history lesson is all, you know, besides the Breyer characters,

876
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,600
most of the animatronics in Splash Mountain are from a defunct

877
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,880
attraction called America Sings that was in Tomorrowland for a long time.

878
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,760
More of a country bears style, like a little review with all these singing

879
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,280
critters. And so they were from another ride already.

880
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,720
They moved into a ride.

881
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,080
They they've all those animatronics have to feel like they just they got their

882
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,880
photo taken in the wrong place.

883
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,840
Like they didn't like we didn't know we did.

884
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,040
Like they have a photo of the guy that had racist tweets later.

885
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,400
Like we didn't know any of that at the time.

886
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,760
We just were in the wrong place.

887
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,440
And they should they, you know, they shouldn't be held accountable.

888
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,360
But are they too well, they just not matched.

889
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,400
Do they feel like too old of animatronics like are too unrelated?

890
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,280
I wonder. I yeah, I don't know.

891
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,440
That's a good question. I don't know. I mean,

892
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,680
like I know the vultures that are on their lift hill are not from the movie.

893
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,880
Those are from America Sings.

894
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,680
I assume. Yeah, it's interesting.

895
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,760
I just I've read a lot about this and there's a lot of, you know,

896
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,520
very interesting pieces

897
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,240
that maybe we could find that are linked to about like the different

898
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,560
what's from the movie, what is

899
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,720
like what's directly from the movie, what they like, just like

900
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,280
completely whitewash from the movie, which also is horrifying, too.

901
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,120
But then what characters and stuff is not it's just from America Sings.

902
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,200
So I think maybe all the stuff that has nothing to do with the movie

903
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,360
might still be on the table.

904
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,720
But I bet they're still figuring that out.

905
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,240
I bet this is still not really any of this. Yeah. Yeah.

906
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,680
And like, will you still see the

907
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,160
are the pigs dancing in a style like with like a petticoat or something?

908
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,520
Will we see them? Will they come back?

909
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,320
I think they read dress.

910
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,520
I mean, they had to rerecord all the audio.

911
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,280
They have to do new audio.

912
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,320
Yeah, maybe more more fun

913
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,400
like Mardi Gras outfits for the animals.

914
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,960
You could update the looks. Yeah.

915
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,000
If you look in the concept art, Tiana is in a boat

916
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,600
with a bunch of Mardi Gras masks and costumes and decoration.

917
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,400
That's kind of the only hint you get of what's common.

918
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,920
So that might make sense. Yeah.

919
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,920
Maybe you throw a bunch of Mardi Gras stuff on them.

920
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,080
And if you if you guys have any more thoughts about this,

921
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,240
I do have a proposal as well, and I shouldn't give this away for free

922
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,800
because I don't work for Imagineering.

923
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,360
But now the now the situation is such that critter country

924
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,280
has lost a large piece of real estate in Disneyland.

925
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,480
It's going to be New Orleans is going to extend out.

926
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,240
And now Poo is sort of in his own little spot back there.

927
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,440
Thoughtful.

928
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,520
In is. Yes, exactly.

929
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,880
And that's technically technically critter country.

930
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,080
And that Poo ride is fine.

931
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,160
It is not as good as the Tokyo one.

932
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,280
I think here's my proposal.

933
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,360
You get rid of Poo and you put in a bear show.

934
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,280
But it's a jazz band bear show.

935
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,760
Oh, huh.

936
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,160
So that's New Orleans Squares all the way back to the Poo area.

937
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,840
That's they're never going to do that, because I'm sure Poo makes them a lot of money.

938
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,920
But then you bring bears back into that spot

939
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,000
and you make it thematically all New Orleans.

940
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,480
With with Louie, Louie the Gator in there playing with the bears

941
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,240
and flip the restaurant to Tiana's place.

942
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,000
I feel like I've seen people speculating of like, well,

943
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,600
the movie ends with a character getting a giant restaurant.

944
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:11,200
So I feel like that's a missed opportunity if you don't use that.

945
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,560
Now, I've thought about this, too, because but I think maybe the issue is like,

946
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,880
isn't that like sort of a it's like a quick service restaurant

947
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,720
as opposed to Tiana's restaurant, which is like nice and good

948
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,160
and also not like

949
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,640
country fried, like it's more New Orleans City vibe.

950
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,400
So I feel like maybe the only issue there might be like

951
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,640
it might do a disservice to Tiana's place.

952
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,160
If it's like a place where you get shitty chicken fingers,

953
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,760
you could read theme one of the what's that one restaurant?

954
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,760
That's not it's pretty close to Haunted Mansion.

955
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,320
I can never remember the Riverbell Terrace.

956
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,000
Or no, that's sorry.

957
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,560
Cafe Orleans is next to Haunted Mansion.

958
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,200
OK, can you read them that?

959
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,080
I mean, that's still kind of quick service, but it's a little bit more dressed up.

960
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,560
It can be a little bit more.

961
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,120
Oh, wait, no. Cafe Orleans is table service.

962
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,920
French Market is like Buffeteeria.

963
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,240
So you can easily flip one of them. They're pretty generic. Right.

964
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,440
Maybe maybe that maybe that's the answer

965
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,320
because there's just not a lot of real estate around there.

966
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,040
Or you just demolish Poo and put the restaurant back there.

967
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,040
That would be a big hit if you made a fully cool themed

968
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,600
restaurant, almost like be our guest style with just like elaborate theming.

969
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,400
I mean, people love that stuff.

970
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,360
We love that stuff.

971
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,400
There's one candy store shop back there.

972
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,760
Sure. That you could easily, you know, rebuild.

973
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,200
You are well, you mean the Poo, the Poo gift shop, essentially.

974
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,440
Yeah, the Poo gift shop. Right. Sure.

975
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,160
I don't know. I don't. Yeah, there's not.

976
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,720
You're not losing too much getting rid of the Poo gift shop.

977
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,640
Yeah. No offense to Poo.

978
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,840
He can find a new home somewhere.

979
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,480
Yeah. I just wonder if they will do because I think it's good.

980
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,160
I think the pure ride is going to be so expensive.

981
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,040
So will they do?

982
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,120
Probably. I mean, I don't think, you know, I'm sure they

983
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,000
because all the imagineers are nerds like us and think about something like that.

984
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,640
Well, you know, critical country is only this small.

985
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,320
It's really not a full land anymore.

986
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,880
But is that that probably goes way down the list of changes?

987
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,960
I'm assuming maybe they all probably have it in their mind of like,

988
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,080
yeah, we got to make sure this is all one stretch of New Orleans

989
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,400
or whatever other ideas they have.

990
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,680
But I would imagine that, yes, that's going to go down the list,

991
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,840
especially when they're like getting bankrolled by Saudi Arabia

992
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,880
to keep them out of debt right now.

993
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,880
I assume a minor 500 million dollar infusion.

994
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,800
Yeah. So

995
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,440
so that I mean, is that a place to start transitioning to?

996
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,600
You know what the hell else is going on?

997
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,920
I because it's a crazy.

998
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,560
I mean, I, you know, I maybe found it sort of like a nice

999
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,680
arkening back to a simpler time to get just a story about a new ride

1000
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,360
that's coming instead of all the parks news being like, OK, so we are putting up

1001
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,800
partitions in the like the train will have plexiglass dividers.

1002
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,280
Every everything's been such a bummer.

1003
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,000
So it was nice to see a piece of art.

1004
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,320
It's like, look at that smile and alligator.

1005
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,760
Well, I'm sorry, I told you guys I had this beforehand.

1006
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,200
Unfortunately, you've set me up for the very dumb news story I have.

1007
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,680
This is from the Disney Food blog,

1008
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,360
a very thorough theme park website.

1009
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,840
Do you guys know about the blue wall?

1010
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,880
The Grand Floridian's brand new blue wall?

1011
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,080
I thought you meant politically.

1012
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,320
Well, no, that's a blue firewall.

1013
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,000
OK, so I saw the headline about this

1014
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,080
and I truly thought it was another Instagram thing.

1015
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,640
And it is not.

1016
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,120
I'm going to send you guys a picture right now.

1017
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,320
This is.

1018
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:09,160
So what this is, the Grand Floridian has been cut in half

1019
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,480
by a giant looks to be about eight foot blue wall.

1020
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,160
Bright, bright blue, right?

1021
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,320
Bright blue.

1022
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,640
Not in keeping with the theme of this like

1023
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,840
charming Victorian hotel whatsoever.

1024
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,320
Not at all.

1025
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,000
So this the hotel has essentially been bisected.

1026
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,440
The reason being half of it is for NBA teams

1027
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,720
and half of it is for guests who are staying there.

1028
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:41,520
And I don't know why these pictures of the like one of the most expensive

1029
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,640
and if not the most expensive hotel, the Orlando property,

1030
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,200
I just could not get over this massive wall

1031
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,920
that will probably be here for a while.

1032
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,040
And the blog pointed out

1033
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,960
the wall completely wipes out the view of the Magic Kingdom

1034
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,560
from the main building.

1035
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:07,640
Shh. We were we were able to just spot the tippy top of the highest spire

1036
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,880
of Cinderella Casper Castle from Gasparia Island Grill.

1037
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,240
Normally you have a nice clear view of the castle when leaving the spot.

1038
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,080
So the most expensive hotel now doesn't offer one of the main things

1039
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,200
you spend money for.

1040
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,200
No. And they were already there was already construction in back of this hotel

1041
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,560
because finally, after decades, they were completing a path

1042
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,320
where you could walk from this hotel to the Magic Kingdom.

1043
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,720
You have not been able to do that due to waterways.

1044
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,680
A whole time you've never it's that close and you've never been able to take a walk.

1045
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:52,160
Only the only the contemporary can you walk directly to the Magic Kingdom?

1046
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,720
You have to go the other way.

1047
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,240
So this will finally complete the loop.

1048
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,160
Only 50 years later.

1049
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,160
Only. So you know, a big wall.

1050
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,720
Look at this guy.

1051
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,360
Yeah, there's a lot of bummer stuff

1052
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,520
about the situation with the covid.

1053
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,800
And there you sent us a clip of a loudspeaker

1054
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,920
announcement of a cheerful person just telling you to wear a mask.

1055
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,520
Yeah. And that's that's Verhoeven ask.

1056
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,960
That's a very great fun.

1057
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,800
Well, yeah.

1058
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,600
Remember, wear your mask and keep away from each other.

1059
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,320
Oh, and have a nice day.

1060
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,000
And have a nice day.

1061
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,680
Your magic band guarantees citizenship of the Magic Kingdom.

1062
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,600
That is if you're hearing this today, this episode's coming out.

1063
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,840
And tomorrow the Magic Kingdom is reopening,

1064
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,160
which they're heading for and they've been doing cast member tests of.

1065
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,640
And the they're also heading for

1066
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,800
reopenings of Disney parks in Japan and in France.

1067
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,520
These are all the Japan plants.

1068
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,640
Japan is open. Japan is open.

1069
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,720
OK. Yeah.

1070
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,200
Well, I was just curious about a couple of some some numbers,

1071
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,960
you know, with if these are the places that they're trying to get back open.

1072
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,840
How is the disease going there in the country of Japan?

1073
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:29,200
They're hovering around 150 new cases a day, which they're they're very alarmed

1074
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:34,880
about. France has been spiking recently at about 1500 a day.

1075
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,760
It's sort of shot a little back up and they're trying to get it under control.

1076
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:43,880
The state, as opposed to the country of Florida, the state of Florida,

1077
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:49,760
10,000 new cases, the country of Japan,

1078
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,400
150 new cases, the state of Florida, 10,000.

1079
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,280
Anyway, have fun.

1080
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,800
Happy to play center.

1081
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,480
Yeah. Born down in a dead man's town.

1082
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,360
First step I took is when I hit the ground.

1083
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:10,160
Yeah, it's a it's very I'm I'm depressed.

1084
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,160
Let's just put it that way. I am depressed.

1085
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,320
I'm still scared.

1086
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,920
It's crazy what's going on.

1087
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,560
It is crazy. Like like China shut down,

1088
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,240
I think, like the city when there was like 50 more.

1089
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:34,280
And yeah, if you're going to do this in Florida, please mask.

1090
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,160
I don't want to.

1091
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,680
I don't think that's political.

1092
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,520
Just please mask.

1093
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,920
Mm hmm. Is there anyone listening to this theme park

1094
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,720
nerd podcast where we call ourselves good boys?

1095
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,600
Is there any is any listener an anti mask person?

1096
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,960
And if so, I'm not too worried about offending you.

1097
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,520
I think it might be only one right now.

1098
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,880
So if you the one person put it on, dude.

1099
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,920
I think you're opening up or, man, I think you're

1100
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,880
I think you're calling it out.

1101
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,960
Please tell us about this.

1102
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,720
No, no, I'm just saying.

1103
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,840
Don't listen to the show.

1104
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,160
Fuck off.

1105
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,480
Please tell us about the other doctors.

1106
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,480
You folks are always on about.

1107
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,760
I want to hear more about the other doctors.

1108
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,920
That's always so fun.

1109
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,440
Tokyo, Tokyo mask wise.

1110
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,000
It's like they were mad.

1111
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,880
That seems to be the difference is the masks.

1112
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,720
So I'm begging you.

1113
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,680
I'm begging you with peace and love, as Mr.

1114
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,880
Ringo Starr would say, please.

1115
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,680
Yeah, boy, because, you know, shit's going awry.

1116
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,000
And it's not just in theme park world.

1117
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,720
It's also in themed entertainment world in general.

1118
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,280
We discussed the voids issues.

1119
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,920
And one thing that we haven't talked about is the

1120
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,480
the recent bankruptcy declarations of two

1121
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:01,480
themed adjacent organizations related to the pandemic.

1122
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,600
The first one being Cirque du Soleil

1123
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:09,360
has declared bankruptcy and they are claiming that they're going to get things back open.

1124
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,240
And they they they claim actually that the Florida one

1125
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,440
because they've been working on a new show for Disney Springs.

1126
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,600
And they're claiming that that's not down for the count.

1127
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,520
And that'll be back open.

1128
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,880
And that, you know, claiming bankruptcy is a thing that helps.

1129
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,240
But who knows? It doesn't sound good.

1130
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,640
And this was apparently broken

1131
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,840
to the employees via.

1132
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,920
Let me just share my screen really fast.

1133
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,600
This is a this is just a still from a video.

1134
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:42,480
This is this this guy you're looking at is the CEO of Cirque du Soleil.

1135
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:48,440
I forget his name, but he delivered sort of a grave little address about how this is.

1136
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,320
Imagine you are fired via a video that's emailed to you

1137
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,000
where a guy in like a cravat

1138
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,720
and lavender tinted Bono glasses

1139
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,800
talks to you in front of a fancy abstract painting,

1140
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,480
which has even like a tag like telling you the artist, which implies it's like

1141
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,720
a expensive, nice painting.

1142
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,640
Anyway, this is Cirque du Soleil.

1143
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,840
This is who I'm very sorry.

1144
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,640
Your shit that I like.

1145
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,600
Yeah, I I am interested.

1146
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,760
What? Because how many shows the Cirque du Soleil have around the world,

1147
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,240
like 30 or something? Yeah, it's crazy.

1148
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,240
I mean, Vegas alone has like six.

1149
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:37,280
Something like that. So and it's and they involve a lot of performers,

1150
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,600
a lot of talented human performers,

1151
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,200
which makes it a more heartbreaking firing in some ways, although I

1152
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,480
whether that may that you guys can tell me how you think it compares

1153
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,240
and contrast to the other place that has had to declare bankruptcy,

1154
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,600
that being Chuck E.

1155
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,640
Cheese, which is affecting.

1156
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,320
I mean, certainly human employees as well, but on the entertainment

1157
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:06,040
and animatronic entertainers who have already had a very rough decade.

1158
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,840
And so true.

1159
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,520
I don't know where things stand for them.

1160
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,280
I was I was looking at a list.

1161
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,800
I actually this is on our somebody posted this on our Facebook group.

1162
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,080
There was a list of which stores are are closing.

1163
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,080
And I didn't have time to go through the whole thing,

1164
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,480
but there are five in California.

1165
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,360
And I thought this was important work to do.

1166
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,440
And I got that I crunched the numbers.

1167
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,400
Two of the five full munch, two of the five are stores with the full set.

1168
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,120
Original animatronics.

1169
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,000
Now, the other three, that's I say, that's what you get.

1170
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,040
You switch to Studio C where it's only Chuck.

1171
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,680
And, you know, that's what happens.

1172
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,120
But these ones are the full that still have munch and Pasquale.

1173
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,800
All right. I'm sorry to see them go.

1174
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,440
Yeah, I mean, they were on their way out.

1175
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,080
And this obviously sped up what was going to happen.

1176
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,520
I really think I don't know what's happening to the Chuck E.

1177
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,720
Cheese right over here, but that one already got rid of the full munch,

1178
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,200
I believe, which is a tragedy.

1179
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,840
But if it was going away, would I be hanging out in the dumpster?

1180
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,840
Yes, I would absolutely be hanging out,

1181
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,560
seeing if they just dumped munch's body in a dumpster.

1182
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,520
Yes. Now, would you attempt to go in there?

1183
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:29,080
Because is it the safest thing to go near a closed Chuck E.

1184
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,760
Cheese dumpster?

1185
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,720
Because it would be maybe your or all of our chance to have one of the robots.

1186
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,280
And you mean as far as COVID is concerned?

1187
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,280
Yes. Yeah.

1188
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:43,040
Well, I am not as concerned about touching because I would, of course, be masked up.

1189
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,000
I would probably, especially if it's a dumpster, I'm going to have gloves on.

1190
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,720
No gloves. And I don't I don't from what I've been reading,

1191
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,520
which is read it every night for two hours about COVID

1192
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,320
before bed.

1193
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,480
You know, Mike, I have an idea about that depression.

1194
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,480
No, no, no, no, no, no. I think it's fine.

1195
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,880
I think it's normal.

1196
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,200
I think that there's no way that COVID is going to jump off of munch onto me.

1197
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,680
I would take munch.

1198
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,760
I would rescue his robot body.

1199
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,120
I would put it in the car.

1200
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,280
I, of course, would not be touching my face the whole time.

1201
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,560
I would dump him in the little storage unit we have by the parking

1202
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,200
spaces in our apartment.

1203
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,280
And I'd let him sit there for maybe a couple of days to let the virus die.

1204
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,440
And then, of course, I would bring him in my house and treat him as my son.

1205
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,280
And then Edwin would stress hump for,

1206
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,560
you know, 10 months to a year.

1207
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,560
Right. That's true.

1208
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,920
No, well, Edwin, I think he would.

1209
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,320
Edwin would eventually see him as an equal, I think.

1210
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,280
Everyone eventually would sort of earn

1211
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,360
or munch would earn Edwin's respect, is what I'm saying.

1212
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,280
Sure, sure. They'd learn to coexist.

1213
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,640
They're they're fuzzy things and they should get along.

1214
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,840
My two sons.

1215
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,960
I guess Edwin and munch, you know, really, this list, this is in USA Today.

1216
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,360
Chuck E.

1217
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,200
Cheese.

1218
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,560
I don't know. It's I don't need to read the headline.

1219
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,640
Look up the article.

1220
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,040
And if you're interested in getting one of these robots,

1221
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,800
see if one of the stores is near you.

1222
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,800
If you're you live in Vernon Hills, Illinois, if you live in Natick,

1223
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,600
Massachusetts or Danvers

1224
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,880
or Lima, Ohio, there's many.

1225
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,880
This is this is your shot.

1226
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,200
Lima, it's your time.

1227
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:33,040
You might end up with a with a Helen or even just a just a ski ball.

1228
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,240
Right. You could take a whole ski ball home.

1229
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,960
A very difficult task.

1230
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,520
Take 10 ski ball lanes home.

1231
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,040
Someone did send us a photo of like the back area outside

1232
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,280
dumpster area of a Chuck E.

1233
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:52,480
Cheese and there was rotting games like I didn't see.

1234
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,760
I don't know that games that there were any animatronics,

1235
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,320
but there was definitely like a small carousel,

1236
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,240
you know, a quarter operated carousel and like a yeah, you know,

1237
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,320
whack a mole kind of thing.

1238
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,840
I bet the company is savvy enough to know they could like sell all those

1239
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,280
robots on eBay and make a lot of money, I would assume.

1240
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:15,400
Well, I think now is the time for a hero to swoop in.

1241
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,160
Go ahead. And the hero is.

1242
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,640
The man from showbiz pizza who has a massive warehouse in Orlando.

1243
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,480
Oh, yes.

1244
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,480
His name again.

1245
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,320
Aaron Fector. Right. Yeah.

1246
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,560
That that's that's an interesting idea you have, Jason.

1247
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:40,560
Factor and, you know, a group, a group of local businessmen.

1248
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,600
I thought you were going to say us and I was going to be fully on board

1249
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,760
to reimagine Chuck E.

1250
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,760
Cheese for a new generation.

1251
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:51,000
No, no, it will be a reimagining of showbiz pizza for a new generation.

1252
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,520
All right. Do you have both good ideas?

1253
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,760
Yes, both good ideas. I don't want to discount yours.

1254
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,760
You guys check your phones.

1255
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,720
Maybe we could do a little sudden flash version of

1256
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,880
souvenir smackdown.

1257
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,560
Sure. You're about to get a photo of I went to eBay.

1258
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,440
I haven't done this a long time.

1259
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,760
Went to eBay, searched for Chuck E.

1260
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,600
Cheese and went to most expensive.

1261
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,280
This is not the most expensive, but it is in the you know, there's a little hint.

1262
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,920
It's in the top, let's say, 20.

1263
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,480
And what you are looking at is Helen, the bird characters close.

1264
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,920
This these are clothes that were removed from an animatronic.

1265
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,680
It is, you know, kind of like some feather fuzz.

1266
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,560
It is like a hair scrunchie.

1267
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,560
It's a very like, you know, what a seven year old girl would wear

1268
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:42,120
to be fancy in 1988, like a fuchsia sparkly skirt.

1269
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,400
I mean, it's, you know, one of the main Helen

1270
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,680
wardrobes.

1271
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,400
So how much you think you're paying for

1272
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,720
Helen's clothes?

1273
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,040
Well, how much would I pay or how much do I think they're offering?

1274
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,960
Because money is no object for me.

1275
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:05,360
But what I think the eBay, what they're asking, I think, is.

1276
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,360
Seventy five hundred dollars,

1277
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,320
only five hundred, Jason.

1278
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,360
I'm going to go lower. I'm going to go one thousand dollars.

1279
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,440
Much closer is Jason.

1280
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,520
It is six hundred dollars.

1281
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,640
Wow. Oh, my God. Send me the link.

1282
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,840
I got to get these clothes.

1283
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,760
I hope they fit.

1284
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,560
Mike, not only do you win this auction,

1285
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,880
you win a spot on a list on a government watch list.

1286
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,320
Congratulations to Michael Carlson.

1287
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,640
Benzie, I brought you a summer gift.

1288
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,960
I brought you some clothes for summer.

1289
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,840
Now go ahead and get yourself ready.

1290
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,160
I'll read Reddit theories for two hours and in two hours time.

1291
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,480
I won't call you Lindsay anymore.

1292
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,360
You'll be Helen. You will be Helen from now on.

1293
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,160
Lindsay, pack a raincoat.

1294
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,760
According to Reddit, some sort of storm is coming.

1295
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,760
I don't know what that's about, but I'm starting to dig.

1296
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:12,440
Lindsay, here's our Helen as you are from now on.

1297
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,520
Here's a song. I'll just watch this video.

1298
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,920
I'll teach it to you.

1299
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,040
There's a little bit of it.

1300
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,880
How could he say that I'm just one of the guys?

1301
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,320
Listen to our Chuck E.

1302
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,720
Cheese episode if you want to know what that's all about.

1303
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,600
I've used this joke, I think, before in the show,

1304
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,720
but it's the scene in Vertigo where Jimmy Stewart is remaking.

1305
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,760
Oh, is it Kim Novak?

1306
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

1307
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,720
It's remaking her to look like

1308
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,880
the original woman he fell in love with.

1309
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,040
No, it's a you got to wear the Helen hair the right way.

1310
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,240
The dress is fitting all wrong.

1311
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,800
We have to go get it hemmed.

1312
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,320
Oh, there you are.

1313
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,520
There's the Helen I know.

1314
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,880
I fashioned a beak out of some old cups.

1315
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,640
No, it's not right. It's not right.

1316
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,160
I want to hear you say buck bucka.

1317
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:13,400
God, I'm like a week or two away from this actually happening.

1318
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,360
The way that quarantine is going.

1319
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,000
Lindsay, get out, get out, get out now.

1320
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,160
I texture.

1321
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,480
You guys keep riffing about something.

1322
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,280
I'm like, there is some very distressing information.

1323
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,800
Oh, it's not coming out until Friday, but I'm giving you a head start.

1324
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,840
He's joking, but we're not sure he's joking.

1325
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,960
And then his eyes looked on the zoom.

1326
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,320
She leaves and then you drive by in like a couple of months

1327
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,520
and it's just like Helen's in the window and it's me dressed as Helen.

1328
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,760
Coming mother.

1329
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,400
Hi, Scott.

1330
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,360
Hello, Scott. It's Helen.

1331
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,960
You're making Edwin wear the little bowler hat.

1332
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,640
Chuck's red bowler hat.

1333
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,400
When's he introduced me, Chuck?

1334
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,640
I want to do my song.

1335
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,680
One of the guys.

1336
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,840
What are they going?

1337
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,200
Oh, wow.

1338
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,160
Here you want to you want to do a little fake break

1339
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,520
that might even have nothing in between it.

1340
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,440
But when we come back, we'll answer some of your questions,

1341
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,200
which hopefully won't lead us to some of the creepy areas

1342
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:27,280
like replacing your girlfriend with an animatronic with an animatronic chicken

1343
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,080
and replacing Jason with a VR demon.

1344
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,080
It's all right.

1345
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,360
We all have a little shucky day sometimes.

1346
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,800
OK, we'll be right back.

1347
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,560
Welcome back to the show.

1348
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,280
Once again, it's time to open up the PTR mailbag.

1349
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:48,480
Post offices are very branding that we always remember.

1350
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,000
Our branding, we always remember.

1351
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,200
It's like souvenirs.

1352
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,960
I had to think about what souvenir Smackdown was like every time.

1353
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,800
Anytime I go like, yeah, I got this.

1354
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,880
I'll roll this back in.

1355
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,040
I always stub my toe very hard.

1356
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,560
And we always don't let it go.

1357
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,840
We always attack.

1358
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,240
You always the blood is in the water.

1359
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,280
Oh, and we love it.

1360
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,600
It's I'm only it's usually fine.

1361
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,720
It's usually all in good fun.

1362
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:18,000
But now I'm scared Nick Ademus will crave will smell that blood.

1363
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,480
His favorite beverage.

1364
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,560
It's your last chance.

1365
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,520
I do. I can bump it back in.

1366
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,120
No problem. All right.

1367
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,680
I know the names of all the segments like Jay Leno hiding in the closet.

1368
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,720
OK.

1369
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,440
This email comes to us from Taylor.

1370
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,640
I'm going to mangle your last name, Basabe Basabe.

1371
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:44,040
What's the one thing you want to get the most from downtown

1372
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:49,960
Disney when it opens and Disney or DCA, Merch, Feud, Merch, Food, etc.

1373
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,760
What do you guys think?

1374
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,160
Does anyone have that?

1375
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,040
That covers downtown Disney or the parks just in general.

1376
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,120
Yeah, I think it's an and or the parks.

1377
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,480
Anything come quickly to mind?

1378
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:06,200
Either you guys talked about with Mitch Ronto rap pops right into my head.

1379
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,280
Yeah, I just I just want to walk around with that plastic glass of wine.

1380
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,400
So bad. I want that more than Cartier because Cartier's inside.

1381
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,320
And I and you actually can't.

1382
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:21,240
You know, I've been making Cartier, Manhattan's once in a while.

1383
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,640
And you know, not the same atmosphere, but like,

1384
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:29,280
I just want to like walk that plastic cup of wine over the Ferris wheel

1385
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,960
and look at it.

1386
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,080
That will be the first thing that I do and maybe just that and then go home.

1387
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:40,200
I do like I of course talked about my my sprinkles cone,

1388
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,840
my sprinkle waffle cone with two scoops of ice cream.

1389
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:49,200
I think they'll hand it to me and I will just burst into tears when it happens.

1390
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,560
I'm pretty sure just like, oh, my God, thank God.

1391
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,280
I didn't know if it would happen again.

1392
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:00,200
So I think probably the old standard stuff I really like to begin with,

1393
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:04,720
I don't think there's unless there's, you know, whenever I decide to go back,

1394
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:09,560
unless there's some sort of new merch thing that I'm excited about,

1395
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,720
I think it's probably treats.

1396
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:16,320
Jason, I'm imagining I think I'm going to go a little out of left field

1397
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:20,800
and like, say, like trying something I had never gotten around to, like

1398
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:26,240
and maybe something that I can't easily make it home,

1399
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:30,840
like go to Katal and finally get some suckling pig paella.

1400
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,960
Whoa, that's out of nowhere.

1401
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:40,640
Well, I mean, because I'm not really doing fine dining right now.

1402
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,720
I mean, lots of nice restaurants doing takeout, but like it is a little,

1403
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,720
you know, warmer wilted when you get home.

1404
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,720
I'm also very excited to see Disney Springs in Florida.

1405
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,160
He's getting this place, Gideon's Bakehouse,

1406
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,320
which apparently makes amazing cookies.

1407
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,160
I've never had them.

1408
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:03,600
But a cookie based establishment in Disney Springs only just adds to the appeal.

1409
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,680
Interesting. So Scott's answer, wine, my answer, a big ice cream.

1410
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,440
And yours is suckling pig.

1411
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,880
OK, got it. Those those staples of theme parks. Sure.

1412
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:21,000
A nice glass of wine, an ice cream cone and suckling pig.

1413
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:26,280
OK, well, hey, we have to look forward to something to each their own.

1414
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,640
Yeah. Mike, you got one.

1415
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,120
I have one.

1416
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,280
Hold on. I've lost it.

1417
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,160
All right. Rubin at CubicsRube3 on Twitter asks,

1418
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,400
do you think we will ever get an original IP Disney right again?

1419
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,120
I think the answer is no.

1420
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,960
It's over, baby.

1421
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,240
Yeah, especially with sort of like risk assessment

1422
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:54,680
and in full swing way after a financial blow.

1423
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,320
Yeah, I know. I'll take it back.

1424
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,840
I will say if and when there's ever a new park built,

1425
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,440
I think we'll get maybe one original IP run.

1426
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,480
But I think that's truly what's going to have to happen.

1427
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,400
I think we'll have to get a full new park,

1428
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,640
which I don't think there's a new park being built for a decade at this point,

1429
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,720
as far as Disney's concerned.

1430
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,360
So the answer is no for a decade, at least.

1431
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,000
Does that like fucking spirit or whatever

1432
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,800
that's going to be in Spaceship Earth count as original IP?

1433
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,240
Oh, they've already cut that from the schedule.

1434
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,440
Oh, that's gone. Yeah. Yeah.

1435
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,080
I mean, yeah, that one's not too necessary.

1436
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:38,400
I just keep Spaceship Earth and its claustrophobic, bumpy, clunky glory.

1437
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,280
Weird video screens.

1438
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,920
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yes.

1439
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,400
Very, very out of date animation with your head.

1440
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,280
With your like, what's the what was the flash animation thing

1441
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,440
where you would like put your head on it and send it as a greeting card

1442
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,280
that people use to jib jab?

1443
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,520
Yes. So extremely jib jabby. Yeah.

1444
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,760
So, yeah, Spaceship Earth, it's jib jab technology.

1445
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,440
They're still going strong, baby. Jib jab still around.

1446
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,760
In parent world. Yeah.

1447
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,000
They're probably thriving right now.

1448
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,280
Wow. Patreon about jib jab.

1449
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,720
I guess. Yeah.

1450
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,880
Can I ask the question that if anyone just feel free to email or will I?

1451
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:20,160
Because I this I've I've added up how little original Epcot

1452
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,600
that we've done in Spaceship Earth to be a fun one.

1453
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,240
But I'm just curious, like, what is what the listener wants to hear?

1454
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,400
What are you like?

1455
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,760
What can you not wait for us to do in terms of like big Epcot?

1456
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,840
Because I'm like taking stock of everything.

1457
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,840
I'm shocked at how little we've never done living seas,

1458
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:38,840
never done Journey into Imagination, I've done Horizons, I've done World of Motion.

1459
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,920
So Spaceship Earth.

1460
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,120
So, I don't know, let us let us know that one.

1461
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,000
I'm turning the post office back on you.

1462
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,800
Oh, wow. Reverse post office.

1463
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,560
But now you're going to have to comb through all the people go in like,

1464
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:57,640
I don't wear a mascot to find like the nice things go in like

1465
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,160
to World of Motion, please.

1466
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,600
I like the overturned cart.

1467
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,440
Well, they don't get a vote.

1468
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:06,280
That's what you rescind the vote with your mask thing.

1469
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,280
I have a question that this won't take long because I don't have much to say.

1470
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:17,080
And in fact, the user or the Twitter really says it all themselves from Theme Park ASMR.

1471
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:24,920
Have any of you seen the film Characters with a Z by Hard Rock Park creator John Binkowski?

1472
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,440
If you think back to our if you if you heard our failed parks episode with Jason

1473
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:34,120
Waller, John Binkowski, one of the true tours of the park,

1474
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,480
world that you can credit him with this Hard Rock Cafe theme park.

1475
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:43,720
And he yeah, we discovered a little while ago that he also made a made a film,

1476
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,680
made a feature film.

1477
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,880
You can watch the trailer on YouTube.

1478
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,200
Let me let the park ASMR continue.

1479
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,440
OK, so can we have your thoughts on it about it?

1480
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,040
It's about a guy who wants to be a ride designer working in a theme park

1481
01:18:54,040 --> 01:19:00,360
and features an appearance by a member of the Moody Blues and it's filmed in Kissimmee.

1482
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,200
I have no more to say to that.

1483
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,640
I haven't seen the movie.

1484
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:04,680
You said it all.

1485
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,480
And I don't know.

1486
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,600
I have no good answer for why we haven't seen it because amazing details.

1487
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,080
Huh?

1488
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:09,800
It has to be.

1489
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,640
I mean, there's still stuff we've been teasing forever.

1490
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,760
We've been teasing Lance Burton's movie, Billy Toppett forever.

1491
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,320
We haven't done it.

1492
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,880
But characters we are aware of and we have not seen it yet.

1493
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,040
And of course, that's got it's a must watch.

1494
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,320
We're going to watch it.

1495
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,600
A great reason to have our friend, Jason Waller back.

1496
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,440
You know.

1497
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,080
Oh, yes.

1498
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,920
Well, I think it's a must watch.

1499
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:29,480
You know.

1500
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:30,120
No, yes.

1501
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:36,600
Well, himself a great director, so he can sort of come at it from the directorial standpoint.

1502
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:41,160
Maybe no jokes on that episode and it's just sort of a critical analysis of film.

1503
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,080
Sounds good to me.

1504
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,040
Like a French Cahier du Cinema.

1505
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,000
I like that pronunciation.

1506
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,800
How is it pronounced?

1507
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,680
I have no idea.

1508
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,800
Cahier du Cinema.

1509
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,760
Cahier du Cinema.

1510
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,360
I only ever have seen it written.

1511
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,640
I've never heard it spoken.

1512
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,960
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

1513
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,920
I'm like that.

1514
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,400
I'm sorry.

1515
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:04,280
This film was filmed and I'm seeing it being filmed in Celebration, Florida, even better.

1516
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,880
Disney, which was once owned by the Disney Corporation.

1517
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:12,600
It also says the main character in the movie is a big fan of the Moody Blues.

1518
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,640
And as such, the film sees several of their songs.

1519
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:22,440
If you don't recall, there is the Hard Rock Park that this guy built had a Moody Blues ride.

1520
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:26,520
So his partnership with the Moody Blues extended.

1521
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,160
Oh, wait.

1522
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,600
And we didn't talk.

1523
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,440
We text about this and never said it on the show.

1524
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:35,240
There's a bunch of different mascot characters with Z in this movie.

1525
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,560
And one of them is a punk bulldog.

1526
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,680
He's a holdover from Hard Rock Park.

1527
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,280
And is it the is it Winston the punk rock dog?

1528
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:50,040
This guy's described as just the punk bulldog, I think.

1529
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,000
I bet it's the same.

1530
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:51,960
I bet it's Winston.

1531
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,040
I think it's probably exactly the same.

1532
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:54,280
Yeah.

1533
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,400
So we're sorry to let you down.

1534
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:03,480
Thank you for jogging our memory and we will fix this error of not having seen this film forthwith.

1535
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:04,920
We will.

1536
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:05,880
We will get right to it.

1537
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,360
Jason, do you have anything?

1538
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,240
No, not yet.

1539
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,640
OK, I have one.

1540
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,880
It's from Ben Stryker at Stryker No Strikit.

1541
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,360
I don't know why I have to name that, but it's been Stryker.

1542
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,640
Hey, thanks for the question.

1543
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:26,760
On Twitter, he says, if you could do a mashup of two different rides, what ride would you make?

1544
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:31,800
An example is Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain into Haunted Mountain,

1545
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,280
which I think is a fun idea.

1546
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:39,000
I think we've talked before about just putting different ride cars on the different tracks.

1547
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:39,880
Yeah.

1548
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,000
For another ride.

1549
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,800
But a true mashup is an interesting question.

1550
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:51,240
If teacups spun around the deck of the Mark Twain, that'd be pretty cool.

1551
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,160
The Mad T Twain.

1552
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,040
The Mad T Twain is good.

1553
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:04,280
I would like, let's see here, like aesthetically, vibe wise,

1554
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,800
Space Mountain is so great and such a cool ride.

1555
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:15,240
But, you know, maybe the cars don't move as much as we'd want them to.

1556
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:19,880
So maybe you attach, and this is kind of technology I think is coming.

1557
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:24,600
Maybe you attach the Harry Potter Kuka arm to the Space Mountain track

1558
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,360
and then put a bunch of like space death eaters.

1559
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,400
I'm realizing I'm bringing up Harry Potter now,

1560
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,280
as Harry Potter, as far as I'm concerned, was created out of thin air.

1561
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,240
It's just a thing that existed.

1562
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,560
Yeah, it's been around for generations.

1563
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,680
Not sure who did it.

1564
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:46,360
It's like a Shakespeare, with Shakespeare, a bunch of people.

1565
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,440
It's who remembers even.

1566
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,320
Just don't even know.

1567
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,800
Yeah, you put the Kuka arm and then you put like

1568
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:58,040
death eaters hanging from, you know, around the Space Mountain track

1569
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,040
and you should see them pop up.

1570
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,320
And then you can sort of like the creepier aspects.

1571
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,840
I guess you could put the Weeping Willow also on Space Mountain.

1572
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,200
And now you have a ride that's like completely crazy.

1573
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:14,280
The arm is flipping around and now you get to see a little show scenes as you whiz by.

1574
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,360
And of course, this is called

1575
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:20,760
Forbidden Mountain.

1576
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,160
Space Journey isn't anywhere.

1577
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,800
Forbidden Space.

1578
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:31,960
Space.

1579
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,760
OK, we'll get this.

1580
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:35,320
Forbidden Mountain, I guess, is kind of cool.

1581
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,640
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1582
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,600
Yeah, I dig that one.

1583
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,000
So I think that's fun.

1584
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:41,800
Jason, what do you got?

1585
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:45,960
OK, I think I'm going to go real in my wheelhouse.

1586
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:52,760
I'm going to combine the train and the sourdough bakery bread tour.

1587
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,760
And it's a bread train.

1588
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:55,400
It's a red.

1589
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,360
It's a train you get on and it takes you through the bakery

1590
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:04,360
and the bakers wave at you and you're handed little pieces of bread to enjoy on the train.

1591
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,320
Wow, delightful.

1592
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,400
A pretty cut and dry bread train.

1593
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,120
There's a clip that's been going around, Scott.

1594
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:17,400
I don't know if you've seen of a movie called Money Plane.

1595
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,200
With Kelsey Grammer.

1596
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:20,840
Yeah, I saw that clip.

1597
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,920
Kelsey Grammer and WWE superstar Edge.

1598
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,480
And it's the bread train reminds me of Money Plane.

1599
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:31,160
Jason would be the Kelsey Grammer in that movie.

1600
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,320
That's the bread train.

1601
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,760
Now we're on the bread train, baby.

1602
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:35,880
Yeah.

1603
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:40,440
So sourdough loaves, sourdough croissants, sourdough

1604
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:45,640
puddings, any kind of bread you want, you can get it on the bread train.

1605
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,680
But at a price.

1606
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,040
That's a whole your soul.

1607
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,080
That's a whole IP.

1608
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,160
That's a whole franchise for Disney.

1609
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:59,080
This isn't why I don't have the answer, but this makes me think we should have an answer.

1610
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,560
Melissa, add lemon honey XS.

1611
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,800
Where can we send you physical treats?

1612
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,160
Not food, of course.

1613
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:05,560
Thank you.

1614
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,040
That's awful.

1615
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:11,240
I stitched this for you guys and would love to have a PO box or forever dog office.

1616
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:16,600
I could send it to and this person stitched us a little stitching.

1617
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:22,280
I don't know what you call it, what you stitch, but it's us in shirts that I very much recognize.

1618
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,880
It's so clearly a shirt that I have and you guys have.

1619
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,480
And then a little ghost.

1620
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:31,800
They make the sector keeper green, which is an adorable color, an old purple hat.

1621
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,600
And it says boys, boys.

1622
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,120
And it's just great.

1623
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,440
We all got nice, cute smiles.

1624
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,280
This is the most adorable things I've ever seen.

1625
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,080
So that's a good idea.

1626
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:41,880
We should figure that out.

1627
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,800
Is there a dog?

1628
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,680
We've done this before.

1629
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,120
There is.

1630
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:50,440
I don't have a close by, but I'll make a note to send it to this person.

1631
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,720
There is a forever dog office.

1632
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,400
I'm assuming someone's getting the mail.

1633
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,320
Very nice face.

1634
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,200
Very nice face.

1635
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,560
Only I have been to because two weeks later, everything shut down.

1636
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:01,240
That's right.

1637
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,880
I'm also going to put out a call.

1638
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:08,760
Someone made a replica of the Hormel sign, the Hormel glass side,

1639
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:13,080
from a very, very early episode that I found on eBay.

1640
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:13,640
What was it?

1641
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,080
I think from Main Street.

1642
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,360
Is it a stained glass thing?

1643
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:16,920
Yes.

1644
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,240
It's one of our listeners who has made stained glass.

1645
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:26,440
Is a stained glass enthusiast, I believe, has made some stained glass based items based on

1646
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,200
show stuff that he sold for charity.

1647
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:33,080
Can you email the show account and I will give you the address

1648
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,760
because I do want that stained glass.

1649
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,040
All right.

1650
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,840
Well, we'll figure that out and respond.

1651
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,160
But thank you for doing that.

1652
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,320
Anybody who draws a thing.

1653
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:50,280
I think I get a little greedy sometimes by just calling out like I'm a king for fan art.

1654
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,840
Create for me.

1655
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,640
Create for us.

1656
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,880
But thanks, Danny.

1657
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,560
That's that is very nice.

1658
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,200
Yeah, boy.

1659
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:59,880
Yeah, very sweet.

1660
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,320
And we very much appreciate it.

1661
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,800
I don't want to we can run Robin it certainly, but I want to call out one while I have in

1662
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:11,000
front of me because like the stitching and as a picture, this from Nick Hoffman,

1663
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Hoffbeast Efteling recently added a mechanism where fries are delivered to customers by a slide

1664
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
to allow social distancing.

1665
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,720
What whimsical additions to theme parks can you think of to brighten a pandemic day at the park?

1666
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,760
I don't know if you guys have this photo in front of you.

1667
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,080
Let's talk about this first.

1668
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,080
So it's a nice little wagon.

1669
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:38,840
And then, yes, this wooden ramp that's kind of charmingly just what a really handy dad would do

1670
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,640
and fries slide down it.

1671
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,800
And then it's there's plenty of plexiglass.

1672
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,880
And I mean, this is this is wonderful.

1673
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:53,000
I'm like distracted enough by this where I don't have my own idea at the moment.

1674
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,320
It's great, though.

1675
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:56,600
Good for you, Efteling.

1676
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,560
OK, here's my pitch.

1677
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:02,040
Every single cast member is in those Avatar mech suits.

1678
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:03,420
Yeah.

1679
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:10,120
And that goes if it's Haunted Mansion, they're in a big mech suit, but then they have like the outfit,

1680
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:13,560
the Haunted Mansion outfit, like stretched over the big mech suit.

1681
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,280
Massive.

1682
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:15,340
Massive.

1683
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,680
Size XXXXXXXXXL.

1684
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:23,560
Right. It's that great retro space mountain uniform stretched over a mech suit.

1685
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:25,720
Wow.

1686
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:28,200
That keeps the distance a little higher up.

1687
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,240
That keeps some distance.

1688
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,280
And then they can also if they have to take something from a guest

1689
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:35,000
or whatever, they have their robot arms to do it.

1690
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,500
Geez.

1691
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,060
Huh.

1692
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:45,640
What could you I'm trying to think of like I mean, a character still can't hug you even with giant arms,

1693
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:49,000
but I'm certainly flashing to well, if you gave they prove that it was

1694
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,920
they were disposable each and every time.

1695
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,560
What I'm getting at is many gloved characters and a lot of them are Mickey and Minnie.

1696
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:02,200
You know, since character, you know, they still come out and wave to us.

1697
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,080
And that's nice.

1698
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:08,440
But a kid wants a hug from Mickey Mouse or an adult wants a hug from Mickey Mouse.

1699
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:15,880
So I think big six foot long pipe cleaner arms on the characters

1700
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:24,840
and mixed with that, they have sort of an endless stock of disposable Mickey hands

1701
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:32,760
that they kind of with their big with their long arms, like pop those hands on in sort of a Lego

1702
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:34,760
change out manner.

1703
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:42,520
You line up and get a hug from like a bit, which this already, you know, kind of a freak of nature,

1704
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,400
giant arms.

1705
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:50,920
Mickey Mouse is cool in and of itself, but this sounds safe and also bizarre and surreal.

1706
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,760
So I want to see some extremely long Mickey arms.

1707
01:29:54,760 --> 01:30:00,600
I am picturing how they would do arms for the sketch on Saturday Night Live, ToonSys the Cat,

1708
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,680
where the cat would be there.

1709
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,000
And then the arms would just be these long things similar to how

1710
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,560
Triumph holds a microphone on Conan O'Brien.

1711
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:08,760
Yes, very much so.

1712
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:15,000
Long, odd looking straight things that you would tape whatever you're holding to it.

1713
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:16,520
Yeah, yeah.

1714
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:21,080
Yeah, autographs might get tough in this world.

1715
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,920
Now, autographs might have to go away.

1716
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,360
We can't have it all.

1717
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:29,000
But I think you could get some hugs, you know, albeit kind of sloppily achieved ones.

1718
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,320
Well, you know, what did you say?

1719
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,600
Maybe I've missed this.

1720
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,560
Maybe the person who gets the hug gets to keep the arms.

1721
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:36,920
Oh, sure.

1722
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:42,360
So or just or hands, you know, because the arms are tough to sort of slide in and out.

1723
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,720
But if you're just popping those little white hands on, so you get a hug and then you and

1724
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,040
then you keep those and you can fill them up with popcorn.

1725
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:48,440
Hug.

1726
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:49,320
OK, OK.

1727
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,280
Hugs change.

1728
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:51,320
Here's my pitch.

1729
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:55,480
Hugs change from like a full hug where, you know, you wrap your arms around the person

1730
01:30:55,480 --> 01:31:03,400
to what the what Jack Nicholson Joker does to Bob in Batman, where he just kind of grabs his shoulders.

1731
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,000
You know what I'm saying?

1732
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,360
Where he goes, you're my number one guy.

1733
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,600
He just kind of grabs you by the shoulders and that's it turns into that.

1734
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:13,880
So all the characters grab you sort of by the shoulders to show affection.

1735
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:18,280
And then the hands leave their body and get stuck to your arms.

1736
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:20,440
So you take the hands with you.

1737
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:24,920
And that's now a souvenir is that you have like Mickey's hands or Pooh's hands.

1738
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:31,160
And then, yes, you won't have to share a touch with another person because the hands leave

1739
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:31,960
with the guest.

1740
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,320
Wow.

1741
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:33,640
Wow.

1742
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,400
It's cool.

1743
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:35,880
Safe.

1744
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:36,680
Get a souvenir.

1745
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,520
There's something more meaningful than an autograph.

1746
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,080
I really love it.

1747
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:44,200
Did everyone know exactly what I meant when I said what Jack Nicholson does to Bob?

1748
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:47,400
I didn't know, but it's a nice scene to hear about.

1749
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:47,640
Yeah.

1750
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,240
It looms large.

1751
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:52,760
I made a joke that any time, especially I'm feeling depressed during quarantine,

1752
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:56,120
I basically just come downstairs and want to watch one of the four Batman movies.

1753
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:57,880
The original four.

1754
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:58,680
Yeah.

1755
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,400
So I'm just like, I'm like Batman forever again.

1756
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:02,440
OK.

1757
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,440
I would watch it like three times a week if I wasn't living with someone.

1758
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:13,000
So what you're saying is that HBO Max is essentially the bartender from The Shining

1759
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,400
and you are Jack Nicholson playing Jack Torrance from The Shining.

1760
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:17,640
Yes.

1761
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:17,960
100.

1762
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:18,920
Yes, completely.

1763
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:20,920
Another.

1764
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:21,880
Yeah.

1765
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,280
Let's see if the barkeep is like, are you going to watch Batman and Robin again?

1766
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:27,640
The usual.

1767
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,680
No, you would just say the usual.

1768
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,920
Slides Batman and Robin across the bar to me.

1769
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,000
Allow me to break the ice.

1770
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:41,080
Oh, it's just the greatest movies of all time, all four equally good.

1771
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:43,160
What else we got?

1772
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,440
Maybe we start winding down.

1773
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,120
I just have a silly one.

1774
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,560
What's the what's the most obscure?

1775
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,960
This is from Brendan Wadlow.

1776
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,480
Where's Wadlow 21?

1777
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:54,360
What's the most obscure Marvel character you want to ride based on?

1778
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,400
Not a realistic one, just your dream ride.

1779
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,160
I immediately think of Dazzler.

1780
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,080
Scott, are you familiar with Dazzler?

1781
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:03,320
No.

1782
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:08,920
Dazzler was sort of like and they've changed sort of what she does, but she's like sort of a disco

1783
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:13,080
roller skating pop star from another dimension or another planet.

1784
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,240
And it's very Xanadu.

1785
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,600
It's Xanadu all the way.

1786
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,480
Oh, here we go.

1787
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:17,880
All right.

1788
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,880
And yeah, I assume you're seeing classic, classic Dazzler.

1789
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,640
I think we've talked a little bit about this before.

1790
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,600
There was like a pitch.

1791
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,680
Was it Jim's shooter, Jason, who had a pitch for a movie?

1792
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,800
Yeah, I believe so.

1793
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:37,240
Kiss was in it and it was an insane like 70s, I think cocaine or acid trip type situation.

1794
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:42,200
And I would love some sort of a disco Dazzler ride or at least even like

1795
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:48,520
rollers like just a just a skating ring, obviously, where people could go roller skating

1796
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:53,320
and listen to like disco and then they would have you could have like a monster attack once in a while.

1797
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,840
I think that's good.

1798
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:02,760
I want to piggyback off that and go for another even more obscure Marvel Comics entertainer.

1799
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:09,080
Lila Cheney, the teleporting intergalactic rock star.

1800
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:11,960
She is a rock star.

1801
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:18,040
She is a very popular musician in the Marvel continuity in the comics.

1802
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:25,320
It doesn't show up that often, but her whole thing is that like she can teleport like large

1803
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,360
numbers of people.

1804
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:34,840
So I think that would be a good a some sort of show where they use that sort of scrim

1805
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:39,160
technology like at Knott's Berry Farm where you're going down a hospital hallway and

1806
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,160
lightning flashes and then you're in hell.

1807
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:47,480
Like you could transport like so you're at a concert venue and then she teleports everyone

1808
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,360
onto a space station and continues the show.

1809
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,040
Great.

1810
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:52,680
That'd be great.

1811
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,240
You could do a double bill with Dazzler and.

1812
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:56,360
Oh, sure.

1813
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:56,600
Yeah.

1814
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,280
I'm kind of a music zone.

1815
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:08,200
I'm no Marvel expert, but if you're talking obscure, I would love to see a live rocktacular

1816
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:15,640
based on specifically the David Hasselhoff portrayal of Nick Fury, Agent of Shield.

1817
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:21,800
Of course, we all remember that, you know, it was this role was originally played by

1818
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:29,160
Hasselhoff in 1998 in a TV movie, him in an eye patch and, you know,

1819
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:32,360
Only popular portrayals with Apple and Samuel L Jackson.

1820
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:33,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1821
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:35,560
I think they they land about even.

1822
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:39,960
So it's time to give Hasselhoff Fury his his do the only one.

1823
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:47,240
The only thing that pops into my head is because I'm furious and, you know, just the

1824
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:53,240
super enunciated Hasselhoff style of singing, I think would be a blast.

1825
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:59,640
Obviously, he wouldn't do it, but he'd supervise and pick, you know, a cast of six foot six men

1826
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:04,600
to sing in the most enunciate of manner ever.

1827
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:09,240
He should have his own, not his own X-Men, but his own six foot six men,

1828
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,960
his own super team of tall men.

1829
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:12,920
All right.

1830
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:16,920
This was we could do like a rock and roller coaster where you're trying to get to a

1831
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:22,120
triple bill concert of these three characters, you know, of list them off again.

1832
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:25,640
Nick Nick Fury, not Fury as a lot.

1833
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:29,320
Fury Lila Cheney and Dazzler.

1834
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:32,680
Yeah, so it sounds good.

1835
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,200
That's a dream, honestly.

1836
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:34,440
Yeah.

1837
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:38,040
And then, yeah, let have it have the actual one of the big complaints we have with rock

1838
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,360
and roller coaster is that you don't actually see Aerosmith.

1839
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:41,800
You don't see robots at the end of the ride.

1840
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,720
You see a little screen at the end of the ride.

1841
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,280
Let's have robots doing the concert.

1842
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:47,160
Oh, sure.

1843
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:50,440
And then you kind of round a corner and see the audience and they all boo.

1844
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,760
They don't care for it.

1845
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:56,760
Well, we really shouldn't rush to get here.

1846
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:57,880
This show sucks.

1847
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,320
And yeah, you leave feeling sad.

1848
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,480
Anything else you're having up?

1849
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:06,760
I think, yeah, I don't know.

1850
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:10,120
I don't have that was the last one I had I had noticed.

1851
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:16,840
Well, on a hard rock and note, you survived podcast ride part post office edition.

1852
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,800
Thanks for your questions.

1853
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:22,120

1854
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:31,640
You can interact with us at Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to address one that got a lot of likes.

1855
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:34,120
How big did Scott's head when he went viral?

1856
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,080
Obviously, extremely, extremely big.

1857
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:41,480
Very important crucial moment in my life.

1858
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:47,080
I think the biggest thing that happened to me in 2020 was that I had a viral tweet.

1859
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:51,160
I can think of no other no bigger changes in my life.

1860
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:53,160
I'm coming up empty, too.

1861
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:54,760
I can't think of anything.

1862
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,000
It's my pride and joy.

1863
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:04,280
And sometimes I late at night just stare at that tweet and the amount of likes and just think how lucky I am.

1864
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:08,760
I did a tweet about shooting for the July thing and a bunch of weird, you know,

1865
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:10,840
Chrissy Teigen retweeted and stuff.

1866
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,760
It was very bizarre.

1867
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:18,360
And obviously, I'm in I've ascended to another plane of humanity and you can look at that on on Twitter.

1868
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:25,720
But but also I just in the plugs list, I also just want to say I got to be part of a very

1869
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,800
wonderful story this week.

1870
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:30,600
It's a story called Is Anyone Watching Quibi?

1871
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:37,320
And that was on in New York magazine by Benjamin Wallace.

1872
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:45,640
It's I legitimately feel very, very lucky because I'm the first thing in the article,

1873
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:50,840
which an article that then contains the best quibi anecdotes of any quibi hit pieces,

1874
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:53,880
which is saying a lot because there's been like 50 of these.

1875
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:00,360
And while I'm proud of my own participation, I'm really just I'm just a pre show.

1876
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:06,360
To the wild roller coaster that is the rest of the squibby article, please, please go.

1877
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,720
Just put that in the plugs list.

1878
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:08,200
Please read.

1879
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,400
Is anyone watching Quibi?

1880
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,400
Oh, yeah.

1881
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:18,040
If you love the old Eisner anecdotes, you'll love some of the anecdotes about what one of

1882
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:23,080
person on his what I'm assuming is a mutual enemies list is up to today.

1883
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:30,280
I guess I hadn't put together really that I am I am I have this outlet where I'm so actively

1884
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:34,200
pro Eisner and then I've gone out of my way to be anti Katzenberg.

1885
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:39,880
I mean, if that doesn't help butter up Eisner to be on the show, I don't know what else will.

1886
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,400
Well, please.

1887
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,640
We may need to do a big groundswell at a certain point.

1888
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:46,520
Now is not the time.

1889
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:51,480
But if he reads that article, maybe maybe that'll be it.

1890
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:57,880
Who's this young buck getting into the getting into the game of slinging mud at Katzenberg?

1891
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:00,040
It reminds me of a young me.

1892
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,480
I wonder if he has a podcast.

1893
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,560
You know, with no questions asked, I will just go on it without listening to anything else.

1894
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,080
That's how I think it'll play out.

1895
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,600
How long is an average episode?

1896
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,960
Two and a two and a half hours.

1897
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,480
Whatever they need.

1898
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,200
I like this.

1899
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,240
I got a feeling about this.

1900
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:21,960
Scott Gardner.

1901
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,480
Hey, and speaking of long episodes, you know, we let me just also as always,

1902
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:30,360
plug the second gate, patreon.com slash podcast, the ride.

1903
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,120
And we've we let's just say we have three of these in the can that I think fucking rule.

1904
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:37,720
I think we've got really good ones.

1905
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,080
And that's always true.

1906
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:42,280
But just especially you guys knowing what we've done recently,

1907
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:46,280
extra employer people go check out the second gate.

1908
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:47,560
We could tease.

1909
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,600
We could do a little quick tease.

1910
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,480
It's a there's an episode coming up about a villain that we really enjoy.

1911
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,400
Let's say that not Jeffrey Cassidy.

1912
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:59,240
Not Mr. Katz.

1913
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,320
So, yeah, that's on soon.

1914
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:04,440
So get ready for it.

1915
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:05,640
Awesome.

1916
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:07,560
Well, that'll do it.

1917
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:08,600
Fun stuff.

1918
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:13,240
And look at the calendar of what day it is next next Friday.

1919
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:14,760
And I might give you a hint what we're doing next week.

1920
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,440
Every special episode that should be fun.

1921
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:19,960
So stay tuned and thanks for listening, everybody.

1922
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,680
