1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Bright Light City, gonna set my soul,

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
gonna set my soul on fire.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm Jason Sheridan, here as always with Mike Carlson.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm here, Viva Las Vegas indeed.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And Scott Kierdner.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm leaving Las Vegas.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How does that, that's a Sheryl Crow song.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not really a big one.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Switched it up.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't know any lyrics beyond that, but I did what I could.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What other Vegas songs are there?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A lot, I think.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, probably.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This Viva Las Vegas is if you ever rock Vegas.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Right.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So you're freshly back.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Freshly back from Vegas.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Vegas vacation.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A Vegas vacation.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Of course.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So did you end up feeling more like Rusty Griswold,

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
scoring big on all the tables,

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
pretending to be Nick Papagiorgio,

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
or did you feel like Sid Caesar having a heart attack?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, that's interesting.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Like Vegas, you know, it's the highs to highs

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and the lowest to lows, you know?

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So a little bit of both.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So you're saying you were up like $5 million

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and then you were like, you know, like strung out with a hooker

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
in a $5 hotel room?

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, not quite, not quite.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A little uncomfortable and grumpy.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Before we get to the main topic, let's just go through the trip.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Tell us how you got there, all that type of stuff.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How I got there.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay, so because this is, we're going to talk about the M&M store

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and the 3D movie within the M&M store.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But I lost my M in Vegas.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The primary.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Rolls off the tongue.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just hits the ear like a beautiful symphony.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But yeah, this is also a little travelogue.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Like my adventure on the Queen Mary.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Right.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What did you, what were you?

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I said just a little bit.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What did you do?

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You flew out there.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I flew out to Vegas.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, I went to Vegas for a few days.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You were not alone.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was not alone as you guys and I've been seeing someone

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
for a little while now.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, a while, yes.

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And we went to Vegas together, went on a little trip, flew in,

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
flew in and out, beautiful McCarran Airport.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Meant to look up exactly what crimes McCarran did.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
McCarran, a notoriously corrupt Nevada politician

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that the airport is named after.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Right.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's okay.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There's plenty of corrupt people that airports

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
have been named after, I assume.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And full credit to her because she, you know,

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
we stayed at the Park MGM, which you have stayed at before.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Two times, yes.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And she, there is, so there are these apps,

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
these slot machine apps you can play on your iPhone

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
called MyVegas.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And she had been playing these for a while and had enough

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
that we like got a free night and I would like claim

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
two free drinks somewhere and a free appetizer.

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I mean, this sounds like heaven.

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This sounds like the perfect setup for a vacation.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I love it.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, but, you know, so we went and most importantly,

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
she also picked great seats for David Copperfield,

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Live the Impossible.

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And if you don't recall this, then we did an episode

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
about David Copperfield's insane show at the MGM Grand.

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Mike and I had seen it and we were mainly describing it

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to Jason who had not seen it.

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Now you have seen it.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You've experienced Live the Impossible.

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And kind of I've been talking about like, oh, we should go,

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
we should go to Vegas.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
She had never been to Vegas before.

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I've been a couple of times.

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But that kind of lit the fire under my ass.

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I was like, well, if we go, we have to see Copperfield.

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah.

103
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Of course.

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And as I was saying, because I, that's, that's where my

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
response video was filmed.

106
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Right in front of the Copperfield Theater in the MGM Grand.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Next to the Blue 32 statue.

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah.

109
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
To the Chay Pack.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Succession news.

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And Jason Willner texted me after he saw that and he said,

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
what did you think of the show?

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And I said, it was the greatest theatrical experience of my life.

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It is really, so I don't think I was fully prepared.

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Even with you heard beat by beat.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Beat by beat.

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But I, and I have to give the man credit because it's a very

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
interestingly paced show.

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It is, I mean, I kept saying the whole thing.

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I was reminded about Vegas.

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A couple of things.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
One, they, there are parts of Vegas.

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Uh, like our main chunk of this episode is like, if you build a

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
theme park infrastructure and went, okay, we will come back to

128
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
check on this.

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Never.

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Uh, and then there are other parts where it's design elements that

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
you kind of, you kind of recognize that this is art.

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh, David Hockney did this, but he drew it on an iPad and now it's

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
rejected on a screen and a lot of it, um, where it's like, oh, the

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
aesthetic is all aesthetics.

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There's a lot of hanging glass everywhere.

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There's a lot of hanging silver rock.

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Like you recognize it, but it's, it's just overwhelming.

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It looks good in the concept art, but once everything's been barfed on

139
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and there's like, you know, plastic yard glasses littered everywhere.

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What people say theme parks are the simulation of reality, like

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
simulation.

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, it's so fake Vegas kind of it.

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And I don't mean that like as a derogatory, but it is, it is very

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
overwhelming.

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I mean, I got back in two days later, we were at fries doing the fries

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
event and I was still mentally like, we were questioning this because you

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
were there and you were like, look, I'm just still exhausted.

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I've been to vape, but it was like this two day.

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's a lot of days to recover from a no time zone shift.

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You seem like you're still recovering now.

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm still a little grog.

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But why, why I think it was just, there's just so much mental stimuli.

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There's so much sound and lights.

154
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There's so much of everything lights.

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
There's too many lights.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah.

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you not think Las Vegas is overwhelming?

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It is, but I'm I bounce back the next day.

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm not like, oh, it is funny.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I mean, I got back from Vegas the week and a half ago.

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The, I don't know when, which episode will come out first.

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You were saying though, you napped immediately in Vegas.

163
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, I didn't feel very, we took the first flight out.

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And so I was like, seven AM, something like that.

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And so like, I was like, I'm not going to do this.

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And so like, I was up to like, you know, get dressed and like,

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
get in a lift and every like four 30 in the morning and stuff.

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Sure.

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You flew out of Burbank.

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It did fly out of Burbank, which is a smaller airport.

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And it's very cool because you get to walk on the tarmac.

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Like, it's very, yeah.

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Pan Am or something.

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah.

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So getting into Vegas at like nine 30 in the morning, checking in,

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
dropping the bags and making a beeline for the M and M store.

178
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You went, that was the first thing you did.

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Very first thing.

180
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And I have a suspicion here.

181
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I have a suspicion that in a more relaxed state, you would have enjoyed this

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
experience a little more.

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, I did enjoy a chunk of the experience.

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I mean, I had a great time in Vegas.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I had a great time.

186
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I just did not sleep.

187
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I prefer, I read,

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I like a lot better because you just kind of like zonk out on the flight,

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
but like I never sleep well if I have to get on like a seven AM flight.

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I just feel awful.

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And then I, it's the same time I were like, well,

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
maybe a cup of coffee will make me feel bad.

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It just makes me feel a hundred times worse.

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I would completely understand what you're saying.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If I hadn't seen evidence, the contrary, when we went to Orlando,

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Orlando is a different animal for you.

197
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I slept like a baby at your house.

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We only slept for like five hours before we had to get up.

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah. But we were, you know, you have that juice, that show juice,

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
that positive vibe.

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That makes me more tired because the adrenaline's going from the show.

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And then when you wake up in the morning, you're like, ah, now I'm like,

203
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm depleted.

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I mean that, I mean, that might also just be that like Orlando,

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the Orlando magic, you know, as they say,

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
it's just interesting.

207
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He said as a basketball team,

208
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm like, oh, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
As a basketball team says, it's interesting because you're saying I got up early

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
for a flight and it devastated me. And I had to take a nap.

212
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Did not feel well.

213
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And but in Orlando, we slept for our excuse.

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
In Schomburg, we slept for about five hours.

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We got on a I mean, not as quite early, but it was still like,

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the turnaround was like five hours we were up and then we were going.

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And I think I just knew I was going to Orlando.

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll get a nap or two in.

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And don't get me wrong.

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, I and I like Vegas, but like it was also cold.

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And that's true.

222
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
A little cold.

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Like I don't the desert isn't my fell last a few days in the desert,

224
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
but it's not my favorite.

225
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Right.

226
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Vegas doesn't give you strength.

227
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Orlando gives you strength.

228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's my hypothesis.

229
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I did walk like seven miles a day in Vegas.

230
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like you walk a lot.

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You walk so much in our land.

232
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We check phones and it was like twice.

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We all walked a ton and you walked like double amount and you were fine.

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You were rare and go like you were, you know,

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that Orlando feeling that's what I'm I'm just it's interesting because I think

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
just Vegas, the feeling exhausts you in general.

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Whereas Orlando, I think you're like, you are just energized.

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I mean, look, I found some very relaxing.

239
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It was a little too cold for the pool, but like half of the Bellagio is just

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
nice alcoves with couches like pleasant views into the courtyards and like

241
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
artwork everywhere.

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So you take a seat, you know, you have some slushes.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We kind of did the we did the slot.

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
A lot of places doing the night like slushes in Vegas are very popular,

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
but like best friend, we went to the Roy Choi, LA celebrity chef,

246
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Roy Choi has a restaurant and they have like nicer versions of the classic

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
like Tuesday, like a green apple slush in a little cup.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We had like a ginger and Jameson one and we had a Hennessy and Coke one.

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Did you like the food?

250
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The food was great.

251
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah.

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I mean, I was I thought it would be different, but it's like his hit.

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's like kids like Korean barbecue tacos, rice and sure.

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It was very good.

255
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is all nice, but I'm a little when are we going to get to the fireworks

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
factory?

257
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I think that's my favorite.

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I love this thing.

259
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I have a feeling you guys don't love this thing as much as me.

260
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm just saying I want to get to it someday.

261
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No, it's fine.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I know we'll get to it.

263
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So I hit the hit the quick highlights and then we'll do a little copper field

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and then we'll get to it.

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Sure.

266
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Thank you, Mike.

267
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're welcome.

268
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Thanks.

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
A great hotel clearly going for younger people.

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Italy.

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I mean, incredible.

272
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Scott, you you eat Italy.

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's amazing.

274
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Italy is like how would you describe it?

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's like a block long Italian market with lots of stalls and everything's very

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
free.

277
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You can get a big pile of pretty cheap food, like really good meats and cheese,

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
but like for pretty cheap and cheap stuff started to find in Vegas.

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, it's not hard to find, but it's like garbage.

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is like quality food for cheap.

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And when you are like have a meal where it's like, oh, let's just go eat at the

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
hotel.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
When your options are like pizza and fresh pasta places stay open pretty late.

284
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There's one stall that's just doing pizza slices and 3 a.m.

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
if you want.

286
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah.

287
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And the tell us stuffed fried dough like on the night.

288
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Were you up?

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
How late were you up every night?

290
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Two or three one night we went to on the record, which is like the speakeasy kind

291
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
of yes.

292
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I've been I've been multiple times.

293
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Tenders told us like, oh, it's not a club and it's like after 10 minutes it's a

294
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
club.

295
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a night.

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's too.

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll ask about 30 minutes because it was just so much.

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, there are there are little areas that you can go and then aren't as intense.

299
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
There's like an outdoor ish area there.

300
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, it's not really.

301
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay.

302
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Maybe it was a very crowded night.

303
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And then there's the secret room there as well.

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Very cool.

305
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's where there's a wall.

306
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's a fake thing.

307
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And it's a door and you go in and it's a little speakeasy room.

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm just watching my beloved red and yellow melts.

309
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
They're just melting in the desert.

310
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh, hey, hey, private room or do this is the thing.

311
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It was very, very, very, very, uh, yeah.

312
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Uh, Italy.

313
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hi, Marks.

314
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Uh, is very funny because it's across the street from the MGM Graham.

315
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What's very nice hotel.

316
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Park MGM.

317
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Nice.

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Clearly going for a younger crowd.

319
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There's no buffet.

320
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The food's all pretty good.

321
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah.

322
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
A reasonable size, casino floor, not overwhelming.

323
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
A tram, a free people mover, a tram that'll take you up to the Bellagio.

324
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That is great.

325
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And gambling.

326
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah.

327
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Slots.

328
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Uh, we really liked, uh, my girlfriend won like 80 bucks on the Britney Spears slot,

329
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
which is so fun.

330
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's got the bass vibrations.

331
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's blasting clips.

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So the music video, I won $80 and I'm like, show my slot machine.

333
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We saw that was always occupied.

334
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Cause it's now they have a fun thing where like there's a computer console and you can

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
play a fake video game while you're doing the slots.

336
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So there's like extra elements of just then the normal, like you pull the slot and you

337
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
don't understand what the amounts mean.

338
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Now it feels like you're actually doing something else.

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're probably, it's just a fake thing, but still it's fun.

340
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We were both kind of up and down on the virtual blackjack where it's like the fake dealer

341
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and sure no one's yelling at you.

342
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Uh, that's fun.

343
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Uh, I don't know.

344
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I probably broke even.

345
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, we, I don't know.

346
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
All right.

347
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I just put a little in the slots or, um,

348
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You did not see Aerosmith and the deuces are wild tour.

349
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We did not see and Gaga was not there.

350
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Uh, neither of them were there, but we saw Copperfield.

351
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

352
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Now do I have some Copperfield observations written down and I have some questions and

353
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I was thinking you guys could ask me some questions of like, did he still do this, that

354
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
sort of thing?

355
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Because I feel like,

356
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I think he does most of the things.

357
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I think it's just the order in which he does it.

358
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Are we still shaking your tail feather?

359
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Do we still have a duck that is walking around to shake your tail feather?

360
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Uh, no.

361
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Tail feathers are not being shaken.

362
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There was no duck.

363
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Whoa.

364
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay.

365
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Duck is out because it was really a fragment of a previous thing.

366
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah.

367
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah.

368
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think that didn't make sense already.

369
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So that's probably a good trim though.

370
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I missed the duck.

371
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
All right.

372
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Skeleton, the skeleton of the dinosaur.

373
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Of course.

374
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's a big fan.

375
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Of course it was not in our show.

376
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That was not in yours.

377
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Not in mine, but in Scott's and on most people that go see the skeleton.

378
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It was probably broken that night.

379
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The skeleton is after he waves to his, does the symbol to his father.

380
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Right.

381
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So we are back to it.

382
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It culminates in, in skeleton.

383
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I think because he, that is clearly just video editing.

384
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Like that's just a trick.

385
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's just, you edited a movie and I think he was like, and one last thing, one last

386
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,600
bit of the impossible, because that is what I was really impressed by in the show.

387
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,600
The first half is kind of a standard magic show with a lot of like, Oh, wow.

388
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,000
Like he makes, he appears on a motorcycle and then he appears on a Lincoln.

389
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
How checked out was he?

390
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,800
I, I was hard to tell cause he was doing kind of like the snide delivery, the like toss

391
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,960
off like Jesus Christ, come on.

392
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,880
Like he, that's the persona and I, I want, I have to go back and watch a TV specialist

393
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,960
cause I was like, I don't remember him being the sticky and the TV specials cause he was

394
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,840
kind of like winking at the audience a lot.

395
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,800
Like were there people from out of town that didn't speak English that he would goof on?

396
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,240
I think one person maybe from Albania.

397
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,160
Of course.

398
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
They're all plant.

399
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm convinced they're all plants.

400
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:55,880
I was convinced the person blue 32, which incredible RC.

401
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,520
We were maybe 10 feet away from blue 32 coming out of the case.

402
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
You don't know.

403
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,800
And you hadn't heard the other patron episode blue 32 is a little blue alien that met David

404
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,120
Copperfield's father when David Copperfield's father worked at area 51.

405
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,680
And there's a lot of story that we got into on that other episode.

406
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,840
But if you're behind this paywall, you can go back and listen to that.

407
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,360
He is a being of pure love.

408
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,920
His message is love.

409
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,000
And he also loves fucking poon.

410
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,440
He is a big old horn dog.

412
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,680
As I was watching the show, I forgot he is crass and horny in addition to giving a message

413
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
of love.

414
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
She likes hot.

415
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,480
She's hot, David.

416
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,720
But watching him like wiggle around and then they put some on the box and he's like a little

417
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
robot.

418
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Still get lucky.

419
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
We changed the song.

420
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Does it get lucky?

421
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:53,080
Uh, I, I think when he's like the mayor Pete dance, they made it topical.

422
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,680
Is that what he taught?

423
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:00,160
He does this thing where he's like, oh, my old flame, you still stripping and it's an

424
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
old lady.

425
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

426
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm convinced.

427
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,720
I'm convinced they're a plan.

428
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,040
The lady's not there.

429
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
There's no lady.

430
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
It's just a shot.

431
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Okay.

432
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
That's what I was trying to figure out too.

433
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,200
Cause I realized at a certain point, cause he did the like turning a tissue into a rose.

434
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Yeah.

435
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Six feet behind us.

436
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,920
Like we were front row center.

437
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,040
Like we were almost underneath the UFO.

438
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Yeah.

439
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,360
And get good seats for this is not the priciest thing to get really good seats.

440
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:34,120
It's on par with other Vegas shows and cheaper than like big musical acts.

441
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,000
Uh, I realized watching that though, like the cameras have a monitor on the front so

442
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,680
he can see what in theory you would think what's being filmed, but I'm trying to think

443
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,920
if it's, if he is seeing what's on the screens.

444
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Cause I think sometimes that's a live feed from those cameras.

445
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,840
And sometimes I think it's old video.

446
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,760
It's like shot videos and he's just so precise with his movements and where's the same outfit

447
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
every night.

448
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Yes.

449
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Yes.

450
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
He does.

451
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
He's filmed in advance.

452
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Uh, when you guys saw it, did he play a clip of the Meek Mill Rick Ross song, black magic?

453
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,320
I don't think that goes David Copperfield, David Copperfield.

454
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
No, no, no, no.

455
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,760
Maybach music track that they sample.

456
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Wow.

457
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,760
In between what, uh, Oh sugar sugar.

458
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,960
You can't hurry love.

459
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,480
Um, what were the, I'm a believer he's playing all of these songs and then it cuts to an

460
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,600
excerpt as people are filing it of the Maybach music song.

461
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Wow.

462
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
You got to see this again to see the updated version.

463
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,640
It looks like there's a video where Rick Ross brings out David Copperfield to this song.

464
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,360
Copperfield is hung out with Rick Ross.

465
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Wow.

466
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,360
Whoa.

467
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Oh boy.

468
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
That's crazy.

469
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
This is exciting.

470
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,280
Uh, uh, Ooh, Hey here.

471
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,920
Just, just, just so you see it, just to see these folks together.

472
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Oh my gosh.

473
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Yes.

474
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Very good.

475
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
This is excellent wrapping.

476
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Yeah.

477
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
I have to say this is some of the best wrapping I've ever seen.

478
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Haha.

479
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
What's your name Rick?

480
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Okay, Rick.

481
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Okay.

482
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
So Rick and Rick has a beard.

483
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
All right.

484
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Rick with the beard now.

485
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Why keep your hands on the handkerchief and uh,

486
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,120
So I should say after the show, we went out into the lobby and asked, and I feel like

487
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,120
one of you also asked this, is that statue of blue 32?

488
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,720
Cause there's blue 32 above the bar and the merch stand.

489
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,320
Is that for sale?

490
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,080
And we were told, no, that's from David's private collection.

491
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Whoa.

492
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,160
Or David's personal collection.

493
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,880
And I said, do you get asked that a lot?

494
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,040
And she just nodded yes.

495
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,400
The only merch besides a t-shirt with his face on it and the blue 32 fanny pack available

496
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,080
for sale was like a logo t-shirt for the Island.

497
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Musha K.

498
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Yeah.

499
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,640
Oh, you can buy Musha K merch.

500
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,640
You can buy a Musha K merch.

501
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
Wow.

502
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,920
And also if you haven't heard the episode, yeah, this is, well, it's his, it's his Island

503
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,960
where monkeys someday will do things for you.

504
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Yeah.

505
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,320
They'll hug, they'll hug you.

506
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,120
I believe they'll crawl over you and give you love.

507
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Wow.

508
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Yeah.

509
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Love.

510
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Love David.

511
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,880
Monkey love David.

512
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
That's exciting.

513
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Wow.

514
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,840
But I mean, you were in, even though you knew it all.

515
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,280
So this is good because if listeners listen to our episode and they don't want to go to

516
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,280
the show, so they think it's spoilers that maybe it doesn't matter.

517
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Maybe the experience.

518
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Yeah.

519
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
It's all other thing to see it in person.

520
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,240
Because again, like this sort of stuff, even if you see like a touring magic act, like

521
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,560
It's a pretty, I was surprised by how kind of intimate the theater was.

522
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,120
It was smaller than I was expecting.

523
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,880
Everything was much closer than I was expecting.

524
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
It's not a room you expect a UFO.

525
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,960
You expect a goddamn UFO to be in.

526
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Jesus Christ.

527
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,760
Like he kept, he would give like an instruction real fast.

528
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,200
And when someone didn't get it, he would go, Jesus Christ, come on.

529
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,280
Like, and it was the right amount of body for like that kind of out of town audience.

530
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
But it's either all plants.

531
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
I'm convinced they're all plants.

532
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
And he goes, Jesus Christ, come on.

533
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,760
And like it's the same bit with almost everybody where they don't know what he's doing and

534
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
he's making fun of them.

535
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,840
I mean, it's all Mr. I mean, halfway through the first half is a traditional magic show.

536
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,840
And then halfway through he turns to like, and this is a magic inspired story where it

537
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,000
becomes much more play like.

538
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
How is that?

539
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,480
How great is that moment when you realize, oh, here's the turn.

540
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Here's the turn.

541
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Sit down everyone.

542
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:42,720
I imagine my father's warehouse, my father's secret warehouse and the things he left me.

543
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
I mean, it's just so you're like, oh, you're not.

544
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,400
This isn't quite magic.

545
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
That's a puppet.

546
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:55,040
Although blue 32 does appear, you know, I mean, it in and of itself is magically realistic

547
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
electronics.

548
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:02,720
A guy, an audience, a person helps with the thing whose sister had passed.

549
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Was that in your shows?

550
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
That's always there.

551
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
They're always helping.

552
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
Fake.

553
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Yep.

554
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Yeah.

555
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Fake.

556
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Is it possible?

557
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Oh, what are you playing?

558
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
This is black magic.

559
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
OK.

560
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Hmm.

561
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,040
I'm going to have to plug that into the episode there.

562
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Yep.

563
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Yes.

564
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
The idea.

565
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,240
So so he has a fictional scenario where someone's sister died and they get to do magic.

566
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,920
The brother gets to do magic in honor of the sister, but it happens every show, every show.

567
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
So ridiculous.

568
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,800
A lot of siblings die.

569
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
You get the email.

570
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Yes.

571
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
So we all have the email now.

572
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Yes.

573
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,840
And mine, of course, had the skeleton in it.

574
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
They didn't even take it out.

575
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Oh, wow.

576
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
They didn't even.

577
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,280
Because, yeah, so basically before the show, you put your phone in a box.

578
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,840
They say like, you'll get an email and it's like they send you an email already and they

579
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
said, don't look at it yet.

580
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,360
And then when at the end, it'll say it says everything that happened during the show.

581
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,580
So it has all the specifics and it has everything that happened.

582
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,540
But they didn't bother to take the skeleton out of our email.

583
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,220
So it's just in the email.

584
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,220
Right.

585
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,180
So I'll be honest, the illusion was a bit broken for us when you're reading a letter

586
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,180
that's describing what you saw.

587
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,180
Right.

588
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,300
It is not what you saw.

589
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
Yes.

590
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
I forget.

591
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,580
There was one moment where I was like, I think that video is not a lot like I would.

592
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,580
There's one or two where we caught.

593
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,580
I mean, we're close enough.

594
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,260
Jane was like, I think I see a drone holding up the UFO.

595
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,740
Like the like, oh, is that what it is?

596
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:35,300
Or that like there might the corners might be the propeller like, but we weren't sure

597
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,020
we weren't 100% sure.

598
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,700
Regardless, it does go pitch black.

599
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,580
And then suddenly there's a giant UFO.

600
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,980
No matter how it's operated.

601
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
It's very, very impressive.

602
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,060
Sad though that blue 32 has to see his family one last time to say goodbye.

603
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,340
I don't know that that part was thought out very well.

604
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,340
Well, he died.

605
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,180
We can't rehash this, but I'm going to, he's going to die.

606
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,180
And then he doesn't die.

607
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,180
I guess he's going to die.

608
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,500
David, David, a time stone.

609
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,780
Yeah, the time stone.

610
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,980
Once you get time stones involved, you only get so many.

611
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,740
And if your hearts, if your time stones start failing or you give some away to a friend

612
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,820
and that's the end of you, then your clock, your clock's running out.

613
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,820
Very simple, David.

614
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,820
David, very simple.

615
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,900
I used to have 10 time stones and eight of them.

616
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,240
I gambled away and one of them, I just drink too much and it's shriveled up.

617
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,600
Thus you're getting my last.

618
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
So that's the end of me.

619
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,800
I should have been smarter about all this.

620
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,960
You know, I know about love, but I don't know about time stone management.

621
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,200
This is if this sounds crazy, this is the show.

622
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,840
Like this is basically the show.

623
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
Only in Vegas.

624
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
Yeah.

625
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
You know, only in Vegas.

626
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,880
He's cradling him like the Christ child.

627
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,520
He does cradle him lovingly.

628
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,520
As he does, he intones about love and they didn't listen.

629
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,620
Only you loved me.

630
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,940
You cocoon me in your arms.

631
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,580
And David is like tossing the lines off as if he's just doing the rest of the show.

632
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,420
Sorry, they've danced to you.

633
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,420
Human beings are heathens.

634
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:12,780
You never know the depths of cruelty that the human race can sink to and they crucified

635
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
you.

636
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,580
You're thrown in the trash pile of life.

637
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,780
Soon you'll be a corpse.

638
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
Oh, well.

639
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
La da da da.

640
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
And here we go.

641
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
You got to give him credit.

642
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,940
Kind of predicted Baby Yoda before Baby Yoda though.

643
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
It is very Baby Yoda.

644
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,260
It's protecting a child.

645
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,260
Yeah, the child.

646
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
An important mission.

647
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,260
Yeah.

648
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,260
He probably got pissed when he saw the Mandalorian.

649
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,580
I pitted through something through the TV.

650
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,460
And you're telling me everyone in the world loves this.

651
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,460
And yet no one.

652
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,260
I don't know.

653
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,580
They just, you know, reveal it all at once.

654
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,060
It's just available everywhere.

655
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,060
Everyone's watching it.

656
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
There's shirts of it.

657
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,060
There's there's no suspense.

658
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,060
I've kept blue off of merchandise.

659
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,440
I've made it.

660
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
You can't see his picture anywhere.

661
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,140
That's the way to build suspense.

662
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,380
You don't have to be an M life member to see Baby Yoda.

663
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
Check the records.

664
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,420
Mr. Mr. John Favreau must have been in the audience for one of my performances.

665
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Check the record.

666
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
He must.

667
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,420
He must have stolen this from me.

668
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
He's of course saying that.

669
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:18,060
He's of course saying that to monkeys on the island of Muzhike.

670
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,060
Fetch the tapes.

671
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,380
Monkeys are going through trying to figure out if John Favreau ever was there.

672
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,500
It's the wrong night.

673
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:32,380
No, not the political speech writer, John Favreau, the swingers guy, the other one,

674
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,380
the heavier one.

675
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,540
He's lost a lot of weight, but he's still a little.

676
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,540
Come on, Roy.

677
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,020
Joy's best friend.

678
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,220
Don't you monkeys know how to scan footage?

679
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:50,260
God, how am I ever going to unleash you to give love to my customers?

680
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,180
And you didn't settle my lawsuit.

681
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,020
It's the last time I hire monkey attorneys.

682
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,100
It's a pretty good show, honestly, of Copperfield on an island with all monkeys.

683
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,100
Only monkey cast.

684
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,140
It's sort of a cast away where he's the only one talking.

685
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,540
Yeah, you know, you do get emotion out of the monkeys.

686
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You fall in love with the monkeys and they're not treated well.

687
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,740
They got to get him on Quibi.

688
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,500
You know, we got to get some more magic on these.

689
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,900
I think Netflix is one or two magic things, but they don't promote them a lot.

690
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,860
Well, if they can't get him, they get Lance Burton, who's already a content creator.

691
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,660
Well, yeah, like his restaurant.

692
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,220
Just slide it down to Lance Burton.

693
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,540
Lance, I don't know. Lance Burton.

694
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,620
Yeah, Lance Burton is made, of course, the movie Billy Toppett.

695
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,140
Anyway, really, we got to go.

696
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,620
We got to do it soon.

697
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,420
Yeah. Well, so I mean, that was that's kind of the long and short of it.

698
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,180
Yeah. I'm glad you're part of the club now.

699
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,900
And if we're if we're talking about nonplussed performances,

700
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,100
then that is a perfect segue into the realm of the professor,

701
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:57,180
which is the M&M's store on the strip in Las Vegas.

702
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,020
And it's mainly the 3D movie within.

703
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,300
I lost my M in Vegas.

704
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,620
And that's where you're in the store and you're watching the movie.

705
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:10,580
But within that, also, you're in the M&M's lab, M&M's laboratory.

706
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,020
I you know, but before that,

707
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,700
so if you if you've never been to this thing or if you don't know where it is

708
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,300
or how to get to if you're so if you're staying in Vegas, it's close to the MGM.

709
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,500
MGM is probably the main hotel that is close to it's part of something called

710
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,740
the Showcase Mall, which is an incredibly confusing complex.

711
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,300
I was trying to find a movie theater there and got way lost.

712
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,660
I'm on a sky bridge that leads to nothing.

713
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,260
And the Coca Cola store is part of that.

714
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,700
Yeah, the Coca Cola store is a few doors down.

715
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,700
The landmark is a hundred foot tall Coke bottle.

716
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,220
Right.

717
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,140
This this mall is pretty in general.

718
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,500
This is like a hub of the kind of dumb nonsense that we like with that.

719
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,340
With like, OK, right now, 100 foot Coke bottle.

720
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,860
There's Denny's in there.

721
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,620
Yep. There's a hard rock cafe.

722
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
You know, still now let's hold on there.

723
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,380
I you can't undersell that part of the complex.

724
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,820
Because you go over if you go from Park MGM, the other side of the street,

725
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,980
like where New York, New York and Park MGM are.

726
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,940
You cross a bridge over Las Vegas Boulevard.

727
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,260
And the first thing you are greeted by is a three story building.

728
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,340
Denny's on the bottom floor.

729
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,740
Hard rock on the top to kind of a fall from grace for the hard rock.

730
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,580
Like kind of the upstairs neighbors to upstairs neighbors.

731
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,260
It's kind of obscured the sign by the sky bridge.

732
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,420
And like it's competing for attention for like a sketchers

733
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,860
logo and a marshal and Ross Marshall.

734
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,980
It is the boringest.

735
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,140
Or this they have this this amazing real estate and it's just a Ross there.

736
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,500
That strip was like that was the first thing we did after we dropped our bags

737
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,100
was go over to the M&M store and I'm like, it's nine in the morning.

738
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,580
Like, this is too much. This is too much.

739
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,780
I was like, this is sad.

740
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,940
Our hotel is so nice.

741
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,300
And MGM is nice.

742
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,820
I was like, this strip is so odd.

743
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,740
And then we walked into the M&M store and that smell.

744
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,940
Oh, my God. You warned me.

745
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,420
But I was not feeling very good.

746
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,620
And I was like, we got to see this movie.

747
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,220
We got to get it.

748
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,180
And then you're rushing through the smell like it's like it's carbon monoxide.

749
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,980
The smell is like trying to breathe it in.

750
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,540
Hurry. Where is it? Fourth floor all the way up.

751
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,740
Oh, God. I mean, by the time I got out to the fourth floor, I was like,

752
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,740
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

753
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,940
I was going to tip out of the fourth floor down on fall down onto the strip.

754
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,900
I was a window.

755
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,660
It's like whatever canister smell canister they were using for their fake

756
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,940
chocolate smell in the M&M store.

757
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,980
It's like mildew started growing.

758
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,380
Like it's it's just it's like off.

759
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,060
It's like something's wrong with the smell.

760
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,660
It ran out in 2000.

761
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,780
And now it's just like the specks of chocolate and Legionnaires disease.

762
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,380
Or it's like if if like

763
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,940
somebody does left a pile of M&M's behind like a heater in there

764
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,740
and no one's found it.

765
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,260
And it's just like it sort of made it the smell part of the heating system.

766
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,100
No, it's yellow's corpse.

767
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,100
Yeah. Yes.

768
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,500
It's running away for years.

769
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,180
Yes. The M&M's 5000 couldn't find them.

770
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,900
No one could hear his high radiator.

771
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,460
Constant screams.

772
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
Now, the theater does not smell.

773
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,060
No, no. It does not go into the theater, which is a godsend.

774
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,180
Yes. So you're I mean, there's not a lot to say about the M&M store itself.

775
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,260
There is a fund.

776
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,500
Once you get to the fourth floor, this is where the attractions are,

777
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,460
because it also forget if it's still there.

778
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,540
Maybe you could tell if there's like a race car that's M&M's branded.

779
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,580
And I have pictures with M's who are in like NASCAR racing gear.

780
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,100
So that's potentially something that's happening up there or used to.

781
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,940
I don't recall.

782
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,300
I think there was more like put your face on M&M's.

783
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,500
Sure. I mean, obviously, personalized.

784
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,660
Yeah. Which I think the cheapest thing you go by was like twenty two dollars

785
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,700
because you have to fill a contraption with the personalized M&M's.

786
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,220
And it only makes sense.

787
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,780
Buying two candies.

788
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,220
Yeah, that's that should be.

789
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,420
That should only cost me but 15 cents.

790
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:21,380
The one floor is just like fill up a thing like big tubes of M&M's that you could fill.

791
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,260
I mean, it was a very it's a very thorough story.

792
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,060
If you like M&M's. Yeah.

793
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,940
And I'm a big peanut M&M guy.

794
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,900
Mm hmm. Really?

795
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,700
You like your top?

796
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,340
I think that's my top.

797
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,740
Like, Crafts are if you're on set, if I'm on set, like there's

798
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,940
I'm there's a very good chance I'm wired on coffee and peanut M&M's.

799
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,740
Just way to way to ground to shoot.

800
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,460
Wired.

801
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,220
Scott, what's your preference?

802
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,220
I think I like, I mean, regular, but then within that holiday,

803
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,780
the holiday ones make me happy.

804
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,940
Interesting. I like just a red and green.

805
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,300
OK, but like the norm, those are the normal flavor.

806
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,380
But you like the festive, the festive nature.

807
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,780
Yeah. I feel like I go regular or peanut butter.

808
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,500
Peanut butter is solid.

809
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,700
Peanut butter is very good. Sure, sure.

810
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,820
So you're you're heading up to this movie theater.

811
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,780
I didn't know about any of this.

812
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,220
Now it's a thing I tell everybody.

813
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,060
Oh, you're going to Vegas.

814
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,340
You got to go to the M&M store movie.

815
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,740
But I didn't know.

816
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,020
We just stumbled into it.

817
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,980
I just saw some signage that said free 4D movie.

818
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,380
Yes. Oh, man.

819
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,340
You're kidding me.

820
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,380
I read that the first time we went to, I was on such a high

821
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:31,220
because the strange in I had, I was able to get a free meal,

822
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,620
including drinks at the Fat Burger on the strip.

823
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:39,260
Well, I had a big old beer and the Fat Burger people could not have been nicer.

824
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,100
I was just on the high from this experience.

825
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,980
Sandal and a nice little beer buzz.

826
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,860
So I was I was having a great day.

827
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,980
This is what I think might factor into because you're there.

828
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,540
You're stressed out early in the morning.

829
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,300
You're sleepless. Me, I'm like, I just had a beer.

830
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,180
I'm I'm feeling fine.

831
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,140
I'm in heaven.

832
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,420
I took a quick nap.

833
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,780
Bye, biker resigned.

834
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,300
And then we had pizza at Italy and I felt like a million bucks.

835
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,300
OK, so my thing about the thing I like about Vegas,

836
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,860
you can do whatever you want at any given time.

837
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,180
You can probably find where and whatever your heart desires.

838
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,660
You can nap.

839
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,420
You can nap on the other side of the bed.

840
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,020
You can ride a free tram just back and forth.

841
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,420
So it goes to insane real estate.

842
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,340
Now, the largest, the largest

843
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,340
privately funded real estate project in the country,

844
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,460
the city center area.

845
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,140
Oh, that'll be interesting.

846
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,340
I like it in there.

847
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,180
Yeah. So yeah.

848
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,180
So in my way, like 40 movie.

849
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,020
Oh, my God, I got it.

850
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,100
I don't think I even noticed the smell to the degree that you guys.

851
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,980
That's what's interesting.

852
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,900
We've talked about this before.

853
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,820
It doesn't seem like you registered the smell.

854
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,700
I think the way Jason was in Orlando where he's ignoring any problem that exists,

855
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,820
I think I was I'm maybe a little more I was

856
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,340
I was pretty psyched in Vegas.

857
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,700
Also, give me a beer and I'm I'm I'm a thousand percent.

858
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,980
I'm feeling great.

859
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,580
It's not rushing up the stairs.

860
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,140
I don't notice this at all.

861
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:07,100
The smell was so bad, I'm sure it knocks down my enjoyment of anything in the store.

862
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,980
I know is horrible.

863
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,740
Horrible. OK, you were it was very early for you.

864
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,180
Beer for you was I did I have a beer in me or anything?

865
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,260
Yes. No, I know.

866
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,540
I think it was in the middle of the day.

867
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,020
I don't think we had anything to drink.

868
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,420
This is, I think, the crucial.

869
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,340
You have to be a little bit buzzed to love.

870
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,900
And because also the same day after that, I had a bunch of time to kill.

871
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,580
I never been to the movie theater there.

872
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,860
And we ended up seeing in that same complex Jurassic World.

873
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,620
And I think from that good mood, I didn't think Jurassic World was dogshit.

874
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,620
Oh, I remember this. You were like, we liked it.

875
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,460
We had a good time. You got to have fun.

876
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,340
Yeah, I don't know.

877
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,420
And I think it was all I think it was that beer talking.

878
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,580
Wow. That was more fun.

879
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,700
It was more fun to be in a loving mood.

880
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,740
Sure. Yeah, I liked it.

881
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,220
I liked it more when I watched it, like with the Christmas tree

882
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:59,620
on with the whole family like that was that was fun. Sure.

883
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,300
So, you know, I'm racing up the stairs and on the on the way up,

884
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,580
you're seeing movie posters because you're going to see M and yellow

885
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,580
or M and yellow, red and yellow, who you love from the commercials.

886
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,580
And they're going to be in their own movie, their own non feature length film,

887
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,620
their own nine minute film.

888
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,980
Sounds great to me.

889
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,260
And then you get a little taste of like what other movies would be that they're in,

890
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,060
including M's in Black,

891
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,060
which has the tagline protecting the earth from the scum of the candy bowl.

892
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,940
Not to be confused with women in black, too,

893
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,100
which we found at Fry's Electronics with the tagline, skip ahead,

894
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,900
protecting the earth from the come of the universe.

895
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,740
I might still prefer women in black, too,

896
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,940
but still happy to see a little men in black nod.

897
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,700
I and you know, and this is also a good reminder that you're going to see

898
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,540
you're see, you know, the characters from this Christmas ad

899
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:01,300
that is the perennial Christmas ad that will never go away.

900
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,660
It's this and the Cadbury Easter.

901
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,460
Yeah, for that, they will never refilm. Yes. Right.

902
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,340
But that one with Santa where Santa faints, he does exist.

903
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,860
I do exist.

904
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,300
And I think you always forget about that.

905
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,340
Who the you guys know offhand who the M&Ms are.

906
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,820
I do. Yes. Yeah.

907
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,220
Voiced over great Billy West, one of the greatest ever.

908
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,300
And J.K. Simmons is yellow.

909
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,380
I forget that fact a lot.

910
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,660
It's so it's it's so not his usual character.

911
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,940
But he has done like he was in Guys and Dolls in the like 90s

912
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,660
revival with Nathan Lane.

913
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,820
Was he? He was one of the supporting guys.

914
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,820
Yeah, he's one of those guys.

915
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,740
Now you go back and see him and like, you know, little character.

916
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,860
It's like it's like when you go back and see Giamatti in smaller roles

917
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,980
and you forget like you didn't think this guy would be the main star of movies

918
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,220
at some point in time.

919
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,620
If you add up that he's that he's in this Christmas

920
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,380
bad that will never go away.

921
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,420
And he's farmed. He's the farmer's guy. Yes.

922
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:09,300
I mean, I wondered this about somebody, Seth McFarlane, in a recent episode is

923
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,580
does J.K. Simmons have one billion dollars?

924
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,100
It's possible. Yes. At this point.

925
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,060
And not not for that reason, but I was going to ask you this, Mike.

926
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,900
Do you consider J.K. Simmons an enemy because he's farmers

927
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,180
and you are team Allstate from your.

928
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,260
Well, I'm not look, I'm not under I'm not getting paid by Allstate anymore.

929
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,620
So I'm open to the highest bidder.

930
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,060
I'm willing to flip now like the spring like spring guy.

931
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,020
If they want, they should just refilm the Allstate commercial

932
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,460
I was in for progressive.

933
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,100
Well, let's do it.

934
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,980
Let's stick it to Allstate for not keep continuing to pay me free money.

935
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,180
You turn the camera.

936
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,740
It's me, the guy who the Hayes Burt voiced woman.

937
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,140
Right. Bested.

938
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,340
Yeah. So now I'm here for progressive.

939
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,020
It'll be just as big of a campaign because that's spring.

940
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,220
I still go and they're still they're doing that.

941
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,580
He is truly firmly the face of sprint.

942
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,820
It's wild. Yeah. Yeah.

943
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,780
So now let's flip, Mike.

944
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,340
Let's put any insurance company. Yeah.

945
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,940
Geico's revisiting old ads.

946
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,460
Why not visiting revisit?

947
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,300
Not there. Yes. Yeah, I agree.

948
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,020
So no, I'm well, I'm willing to get on the farmer's team.

949
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,780
Yeah. Yeah. He needs a sidekick.

950
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,180
And it's me.

951
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,260
His bumbling like your your your papers, sir.

952
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,020
Yeah. And then he's always like tour, looking around a museum or something.

953
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,860
Yes. And you like trip the floors to slick and you slip and fall.

954
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,380
Yeah. You can be mean to me. That'll be funny. Yeah.

955
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,140
I wanted to go full whiplash on the other insurance company.

956
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,100
Not by tempo.

957
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,380
No, I don't.

958
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,180
Oh, so you wait in line.

959
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,740
And one thing I will say, was it a little crowded for you for either of you?

960
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,860
Well, I went to the first show of the day and we were the first ones in line

961
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,940
where we're like, when is it? Oh, thank God.

962
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,140
It starts in 10 minutes.

963
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,740
Are you saying there was a crowded in the theater? Yeah.

964
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,620
No. See, I've been and my friend,

965
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,140
Siler and Kio just went the pacts full room and we'll go with a full room, too.

966
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,700
Like there are times I think depending on when you go who again, maybe I've just

967
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,620
I'm just glass half full on this thing. Yeah, I've seen packed psyched audience.

968
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,700
Psyched to be there.

969
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,580
There were like six, seven people in with us.

970
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,500
Maybe there was like 10 other people. I mean, there was a decent.

971
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,300
I've done it with less, but I've definitely done it where they can't like

972
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,340
people have to wait for the next show because there's so many in there.

973
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,300
My memory is that there's a child screaming before we started.

974
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,620
Yeah, that was a child screaming.

975
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,060
Oh, yes. I think there's a fourth floor that I kept going.

976
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,220
The smell is oh my God.

977
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,660
The smell is insane.

978
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,780
And there's a child screaming.

979
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,980
There's like a couple of people in line.

980
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,780
People would I feel like we there were people wandered up and like

981
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,500
they would explain to them what the like this is a 40 movie and they'd go, OK.

982
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,020
And they turn around and didn't go in line.

983
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,380
They want to pass down mad.

984
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,620
You got to if you went in Rome, you got to check it out.

985
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,100
Hey, I agree.

986
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,420
So you're you get into the theater and realize this is more than a movie theater.

987
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,940
This is a laboratory.

988
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,940
You're you're at the M&M's Academy, not unlike the farmers.

989
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,580
Yeah, this is this is a place of education.

990
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:17,940
It's like the X-Men's Mansion, the Xavier School for Gifted Candy.

991
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,140
Oh, so this is officially the M&M's Academy.

992
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,660
The room that you're in.

993
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,140
Yeah. Is the M&M's.

994
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,540
I don't know if any of the rest of the store is the M&M's Academy. Right.

995
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,940
And there's no pre-show to lead you in or a sign that tells you

996
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,140
you're in the M&M's Academy.

997
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,740
Yeah. And it's that's just in that space is where that reality exists.

998
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,860
Because I think it's right outside that they have this big like

999
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,620
3D sort of display of the M&M's and like suits.

1000
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,460
And it's like Las Vegas plastic.

1001
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,220
They're they're like the Rat Pack, what you're showing.

1002
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,260
Yeah. So it doesn't.

1003
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,780
And that's me. I went with them.

1004
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,740
It doesn't ease.

1005
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,980
It doesn't ease you into the narrative.

1006
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,940
No, not really. You just go in there.

1007
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,140
Then pre-show. There's no world building.

1008
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,660
Yeah. So it's a shock that you end up at an academy,

1009
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,380
which is a science lab primarily.

1010
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,780
And even when you walk in the room, you're not sure what you're looking at

1011
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,220
because there's like computer panels and flashing lights,

1012
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,260
especially this one little space on the side with kind of a

1013
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,340
it looks like a test tube or a big, big tube or door or something.

1014
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,500
And, you know, full, big, bright light bulbs all the way around.

1015
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,180
And that's the space that your host steps into.

1016
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,100
And this is where I felt this is mainly the movie.

1017
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:33,020
I could take her leave parts of it, the story or it smells whatever.

1018
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:39,540
But I just fell in love with when it begins and it and, you know,

1019
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,220
there's a range of who you could get as part of this experience.

1020
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:48,220
But when we saw the first time, the most nonplussed teenager walks in

1021
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:53,260
in a lab coat and and says, Hello, welcome to my laboratory.

1022
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,540
I am the professor.

1023
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,860
And seeing a teenager declare that they are the professor

1024
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,580
just made me so happy.

1025
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,740
And you could see videos where people are giving it a little more.

1026
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,500
But even giving it more is just so no one.

1027
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,780
No one doing this looks like they would be called the professor. No.

1028
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,660
My professor seemed like he was about to cry.

1029
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,740
I was not sure if he was supposed to be.

1030
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,540
I was not sure.

1031
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,180
I saw he was wearing a lab coat, which he immediately ripped a pocket.

1032
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,420
Like the pocket lab.

1033
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,620
He went, no, it's my pocket.

1034
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,860
I hate that.

1035
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,220
It was like, what?

1036
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,060
I think you might have gotten the professor.

1037
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,340
Sounds like your professor was the best.

1038
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,900
But he wouldn't put the headset mic.

1039
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,700
He just had it like around his neck.

1040
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,380
So we couldn't really hear him that well.

1041
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,380
Like it's one of the headset mics can be rough in general.

1042
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,300
They could sometimes just be faintly attaching to the to like

1043
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,380
the quietest speaker ever. Yeah.

1044
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,780
And that's that's the case here.

1045
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,700
Yes, a professor in a headset mic.

1046
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,340
Do you do you have a recollection about your professor?

1047
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,860
I do. He he was fine.

1048
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,340
It wasn't it wasn't anything.

1049
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,260
It was neither here nor there.

1050
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,260
It was neither here nor there, which I think did color our viewing of it.

1051
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,380
Because it is fun that a guy in a lab coat comes in, but he wasn't like

1052
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,660
he wasn't an Emmett Brown type.

1053
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,340
He wasn't like a 15 year old who couldn't deliver lines.

1054
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,380
So it was just like, oh, yeah.

1055
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,060
Hello, I'm the professor.

1056
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,980
The last time we went, I took a video and the guy really had it.

1057
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,060
The guy was really good.

1058
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,100
Aside from the age being wrong, he's probably like 22.

1059
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,380
It just is not enough time for someone to be a become a professor unless.

1060
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,380
Yeah, you need the house or type.

1061
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,900
Yeah, you need someone who looks like the guy who played Professor

1062
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,500
Keane being from the Richie Richie Rich movie is that in one of those films,

1063
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,020
that is Eugene Levy.

1064
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,820
It's not in the first one.

1065
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,820
I believe in the straight to video Christmas wish.

1066
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,660
That's Eugene Levy.

1067
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,020
It is Eugene. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1068
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,900
I forget the guy's name.

1069
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,540
You know, I'm talking about in the first and the Macaulay Culkin, Richie Rich.

1070
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,980
It in the in our call.

1071
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,740
I don't know. But yes, he's got to be like he's got to be stately.

1072
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,180
He's got to be stiff. But this guy was definitely gay.

1073
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,340
And there's like clearly a range where they can do a bigger like,

1074
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,140
allow me to introduce myself.

1075
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,060
I am the professor.

1076
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,380
But the main dialogue and I'd prefer to do it as the first one I saw.

1077
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,460
Yeah, please. You never forget your first professor.

1078
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,100
Hello. Welcome to my laboratory.

1079
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:23,980
I am a professor and I'm here to introduce my brand new invention.

1080
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,820
This is a truck and look at Eminem's all over the world.

1081
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,660
It's been very like that's that theme park voice.

1082
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,460
That is like announcement theme park voice when the person doesn't have like a take on it.

1083
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,380
It's similar to I'm sure I've said this before the show before.

1084
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,900
But when I the maybe the only time I ever saw the movie Golden Dreams,

1085
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,740
that was in the this what is now location of Little Mermaid,

1086
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,780
that a nonplussed teenager said, please gather our belongings,

1087
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,100
including your dreams and exit as a writer of the theater.

1088
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,540
Didn't register as a joke or anything.

1089
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,260
Just said so dead inside.

1090
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,900
Oh, you got a custodial here.

1091
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,700
We got a dream clean up some other dreams.

1092
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,220
I'm not telling you, please.

1093
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,700
Spilled especially high.

1094
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,860
I'm not going to make it to Broadway.

1095
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:07,860
I'm not going to make it to Broadway.

1096
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:08,860
I'm not going to be a dancer.

1097
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,500
A lot of dreams got spilled in that Chippendale Acorn Treehouse in Toontown.

1098
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,940
Our kids have some so many dreams in here.

1099
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:22,060
So, yes, so this is the premise that you are in the academy

1100
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,460
and there's an invention that it's called.

1101
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,300
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I give you the M&M's 5000.

1102
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,860
The M&M's 5000, which has the ability to locate any M&M,

1103
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,940
right, wherever it is in the world.

1104
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,820
So it is like X-Men.

1105
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,820
It's like Cerebro, which is Professor X computer

1106
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,820
that he uses to track all the mutants in the world.

1107
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,660
And he puts it on. That's his helmet.

1108
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,660
You've ever seen Patrick Stewart with the helmet like thing he puts on.

1109
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,500
That is Cerebro, which tracks all the mutants in the world.

1110
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,940
This is all. So there's a lot of X-Men.

1111
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,980
Yes, I believe. Yes, it feels like that.

1112
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,820
When did the first X-Men movie come out?

1113
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,820
2000.

1114
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,780
Yes, well ahead of it.

1115
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,140
I believe this experience opened in 1999.

1116
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,260
It opened in 99.

1117
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,020
It won a FIA in 1999.

1118
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,180
Good. Yes.

1119
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,380
It could. I mean, Cerebro is all of the mythology has been around.

1120
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,620
This could be a comic. Yeah.

1121
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,460
And there's the animated series was on very much around the same time.

1122
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:16,820
Huge in the 90s.

1123
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,580
Probably was. It could have been or not.

1124
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,820
Before that, you know, Red and Yellow were supposed to be here today,

1125
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,980
but I can't find them anywhere.

1126
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,380
So let's get started without them.

1127
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,700
So then they power up a machine and you're watching kind of like,

1128
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,580
you know, early, you know, rudimentary 3D animation

1129
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,660
showing you this lab and this big it's

1130
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,260
just generic sort of zips and zaps kind of machine.

1131
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,260
Once they tap into it, there's a big scan of the world.

1132
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,300
And we're going to find Red and Yellow and get them in here

1133
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,420
because that's who you're there to see.

1134
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,260
Of course, how's Red and Yellow?

1135
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:51,660
And it happens to track them to elsewhere in Las Vegas at,

1136
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:57,500
you know, at a generic casino, the Casino Generico.

1137
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,220
It's unlabeled.

1138
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,460
I've been blown up by this point.

1139
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,460
Yes, it's been long, long since demolished.

1140
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,900
Yeah, yeah. Exploded.

1141
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,940
And they are at a

1142
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,660
roulette table there.

1143
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,340
Yeah, yeah, it's a roulette table.

1144
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,300
They're placing bets that you get a shot.

1145
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,300
And I forgot this to last time I went.

1146
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,220
You get a shot of the dealer.

1147
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,340
The dealer is played by an actor named Dave Rubrick,

1148
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,660
who is the host of Supermarket Sweep.

1149
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,140
Yes, we squealed with delight. Yeah.

1150
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,380
Yes, we were very that was maybe the highlight of the whole thing.

1151
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,820
Yeah. I'm glad you're equally fond of Dave Rubrick.

1152
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,740
Yes, he's like he's not as human as Regis,

1153
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,220
but he's still got his charm.

1154
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,220
You know what I mean? Is that right?

1155
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,700
The kind of yeah, Regis type.

1156
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,020
He's like sort of an inoffensive host kind of guy.

1157
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:53,420
There's like nothing going on there, but that's I don't mean that as an insult.

1158
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,460
No, I don't mean it as a pleasant.

1159
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,260
Yeah, I could not tell you any characteristics of him.

1160
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,020
Nice, good. He seems nice.

1161
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,980
And I like him. Yes, but he's good, likeable.

1162
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,540
Yeah, but he doesn't have any personality.

1163
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,700
Really? But I mean, more personality than some of these actors

1164
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,220
may be playing the professor.

1165
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,260
I guess. Yeah, I guess.

1166
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,900
I take that back. There's personality there.

1167
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,300
I'm very fond of Dave Ruprecht.

1168
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,900
I'd love to have Dave Ruprecht on the show.

1169
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,620
You know, it might be fun to talk to who is the writer of this film.

1170
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,740
Do you know who wrote this film? Yeah, I did.

1171
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,380
That was what surprised me.

1172
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,620
Yes. A person not that far a person, a fairly reachable person.

1173
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,980
Here to fill us in. Yeah.

1174
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,580
David Cobb, whose current title is principal of creative development

1175
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,780
at the Thinkwell Group, who you've mentioned on the show before.

1176
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:40,940
She's on Twitter, very active theme park Twitter person.

1177
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,340
Yeah. Who I was looking up other credits,

1178
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:49,460
wrote the Borg invasion at the Star Trek experience elsewhere in Vegas.

1179
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,780
Got a Thea for that.

1180
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,780
Well, yes. Multi Thea winner David.

1181
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,660
David C Cobb wrote the pre show for T2 3D, which if that means the thing

1182
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,300
where Shaq gets the free throw and the claw and the doctor

1183
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,500
performing the surgery on the beach, that's a if he wrote that.

1184
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,660
Oh, my God. Just that.

1185
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,580
And it's a legend.

1186
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,460
And the short in Men in Black Alien Attack.

1187
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,180
The Goofus and Gallant sort of thing. Right.

1188
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,460
Yeah, that's a hell of a filmography.

1189
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,020
So he was working on Warner Brothers, Dubai.

1190
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,780
Yes. Warner Brothers recently.

1191
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,420
OK, OK. Also got a Thea for Caesar's Magical Empire,

1192
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,700
which I think was the show Fountain Show.

1193
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:31,500
I think it's the fountain show, which I get running because I walked by it

1194
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,100
and I couldn't tell don't do as much as they used to.

1195
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,260
The statues come to life, but I think there used to be a more involved show

1196
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,540
and maybe even like then you went into a room and there was a bigger

1197
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,460
40. OK, yeah, I believe.

1198
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,340
So, God, this guy was the king of Vegas.

1199
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,380
They entertainment now the king of Dubai themed entertainment.

1200
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,620
We have to talk to this man. Let's try to talk to this man.

1201
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,380
So the M&M's 5000 turns on, they find Dave Rubrecht.

1202
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,780
Red is trying. Red's up, I think, and they're ignoring

1203
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,500
their responsibilities back at the lab.

1204
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,980
They're not saying hello to us, which they should be.

1205
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,340
Red is getting greedy.

1206
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,180
They're being like kind of lascivious, like they're a little bit like

1207
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,380
they're a little routier than they are.

1208
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,180
Really? Also a little more textured.

1209
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,100
Yeah. Footage.

1210
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,500
The texture looks nice.

1211
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,940
The film quality, it's like rich film.

1212
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,860
It's clearly film. Yeah, we film.

1213
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,460
And I have some thoughts on that, but I'll keep describing the plot.

1214
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,300
Yeah, I keep going. Why it was so.

1215
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,980
OK, OK. But the.

1216
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,540
Yeah, they are pretty jerky.

1217
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,340
I was realizing, like, if I if I try to talk like him,

1218
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,060
what's that line from there?

1219
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,100
Like, I don't know. I never met the guy. Right.

1220
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,220
It's just going to be we Chuck and Leno and the

1221
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,100
blue 32, 32.

1222
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,980
That's that's that book voice.

1223
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,340
But he is pretty sleazy because he's like he's gambling instead of working.

1224
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,140
And then this is the height of his sleaziness.

1225
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,340
This is like putting your baby on the table.

1226
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,380
This is like a precious watch your grandfather gave you.

1227
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:07,100
You gamble with that.

1228
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,100
He takes his only belonging.

1229
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,180
I imagine if you're the writer of this, if you're David Cobb, you're like,

1230
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:18,260
what do I have nothing to what do the M&Ms have that I could draw from?

1231
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,700
Well, there's one thing on their body and it is the M.

1232
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,020
So he peels off his M and puts it on red.

1233
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,900
Put it on red.

1234
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,260
And they spin the wheel and it is black and and he loses his M.

1235
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:39,180
His M is cruelly, callously shoved into that little slot where all the money goes.

1236
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,740
Yeah, it's kind of upsetting.

1237
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,220
It's like taking your nose off your face and putting it on the table or something.

1238
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,340
Like it feels like a part of him. Like, yeah.

1239
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,260
Yeah. It's not just a shirt.

1240
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,180
He's like, yeah, I got to get that back.

1241
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,420
He doesn't seem like it is to get it.

1242
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,020
Yellow seems more concerned about getting it back.

1243
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,900
Like he knows the rules of being an M&M better than red does. Right.

1244
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,060
Yeah. Yeah. That's your soul.

1245
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,460
You can't go more than 30 minutes without that.

1246
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,380
God won't be able to find you.

1247
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,620
He'll melt. He'll disappear like back to the future.

1248
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,820
You've forgotten.

1249
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:21,220
So then the entire time the professor is protesting all this and like, no, red,

1250
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,700
what are you doing? No, I shouldn't be doing that.

1251
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,700
And then beams them to the lab, beams them in the lab.

1252
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,020
Now they're upset. They're in an addled state.

1253
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,180
And then we got to get that M back.

1254
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,220
So they has this work.

1255
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,540
Oh, I think the professor says you look like a skittle and then says, I'm out of here.

1256
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,780
You guys figure it out.

1257
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,100
Leaves the rest of it. You're just watching a movie.

1258
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,340
There's like wind in the theater.

1259
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,340
There's some effects like that.

1260
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,460
Yeah, that's pretty fun.

1261
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,820
It is fun.

1262
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,500
It does feel like 4D right there.

1263
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,780
They just turn the air on like real powerfully.

1264
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,100
Pretty much.

1265
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,100
I mean, it's still good.

1266
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,060
I know. Get me wrong.

1267
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,700
That's why the chocolate smell won't leave is that all the ventilation in the building

1268
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,580
goes straight to the right.

1269
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,380
Right. The Academy is sucking up all that.

1270
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,820
Literally sucking it up.

1271
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,060
Literally sucking it up.

1272
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:14,260
And then then I get Aaron and I were talking about this, how, you know, an alcohol

1273
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:17,060
might factor into this, but we're seeing every time we've sat down to do this,

1274
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,900
we don't remember what happens.

1275
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,060
We're very fond of it.

1276
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,860
But yet we're surprised by Dave Rubrecked every time.

1277
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:27,820
We do not remember that it becomes about going to the Department of Lost and Found.

1278
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,900
I can't get this out of my mind this night.

1279
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,340
I meant to look up.

1280
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,460
Yeah, because then they go.

1281
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,100
Then they're kind of they sucked out again.

1282
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,460
Yes. I get fuzzy on why or.

1283
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,780
Yeah, they go to like a limbo ask hell.

1284
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,820
It reminds me honestly of like the Minion Mayhem

1285
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:52,300
ride at Universal in a little way, not aesthetically, but in the same

1286
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,900
like there's stuff happening and they have to like dodge it.

1287
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,260
And it's it's all coming at you so fast and furious.

1288
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:02,020
You don't know what. Yeah, I probably couldn't tell you what happens in Minion Mayhem.

1289
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,500
Well, you go through Groo's secret.

1290
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,820
I know that because I know the broad strokes of it.

1291
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,940
It was a fart gun, but it smells like a banana.

1292
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:14,100
And I know you bump into them at one point and they all become a big minion thing at once.

1293
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,540
Yeah, which actually kind of happens here.

1294
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,620
Similarly, is there is a similar thing to that, right?

1295
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,540
There's a similar thing in this. Oh, yes.

1296
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,540
Yeah, so that's why I think it's yeah, there's a few similar beats.

1297
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:30,820
So we're at the we're at the Department of Lost and Found.

1298
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,460
That's where he has to go to find his M.

1299
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,700
And it's like a scary guy.

1300
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,740
This feels like a very 70s movie.

1301
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,460
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang kind of thing.

1302
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,020
Yeah, a guy in big glasses and he's very judgmental.

1303
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,500
And yeah, a lot of doors that lead to different lost things.

1304
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,380
And he says that he asks, what do you need?

1305
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,300
It's an M like, well, that's not animal, vegetable or mineral.

1306
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,660
That's not classifiable.

1307
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,980
So where so that means that it has to go to the scariest place of all.

1308
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,460
Lost causes.

1309
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,820
And then there's a big, gratingly loud scream.

1310
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,900
They make a runner of playing this so many times, so many.

1311
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,100
And it's yellow. It's yellow screaming.

1312
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,020
But it's also extremely like sound effect.

1313
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,540
Like that. I think that's I recognize it from sound effects library.

1314
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,060
It is like a will. Is it the will?

1315
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,020
It's not. It's not.

1316
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,540
But it's like a famous.

1317
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,620
It feels more like a woman's shriek.

1318
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,420
OK. Yeah.

1319
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,300
Which I believe is supposed to be the running joke.

1320
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,260
It's like yellow. He has a very good voice.

1321
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,020
But then, yeah, really, I don't even want to attempt one.

1322
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:29,460
I don't want to blow out the mics that they put a lot of if I have a criticism.

1323
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,700
It's a big if I think they lean on the screen.

1324
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,180
They lean on the screen and it's very loud.

1325
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,300
It's very, very loud.

1326
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,140
Then they had to walk through the hallways from like the crazy bureaucracy

1327
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,780
from Brazil, like they're in the Brazil building.

1328
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,500
There's like some good set pieces in this.

1329
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,260
That is what is impressive about it.

1330
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,220
The sock bar, the horrifying socks.

1331
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,540
Well, that's where we go.

1332
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,780
We're looking at different.

1333
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:58,220
There's different rooms, lost sheep, lost boys, lost time, lost sleep.

1334
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,500
And then we end up at the lost sock lounge.

1335
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:01,980
Right.

1336
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,220
Is where all the single socks that came out of the dryer go.

1337
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,580
And they're single and ready to mingle.

1338
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,460
Yes, they're all really thirsty.

1339
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,740
Thirsty socks.

1340
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,660
Oh, yeah.

1341
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,100
Yeah.

1342
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,580
And that's where we end up with a love interest for yellow.

1343
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,060
A yellow sock.

1344
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,540
Jason seems like you're pretty fond of this component.

1345
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:27,580
I I was just where these CGI were these stop motion.

1346
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,660
I was trying to figure out.

1347
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,340
I find that a little interesting.

1348
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:30,860
Yeah.

1349
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,620
You can't quite tell what's going on.

1350
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,020
This is an interesting 40 movie.

1351
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,860
The movie looks better than most movies in the last 10 years, I feel like.

1352
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:39,260
Yeah.

1353
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,580
Yeah, it's like a more good CGI and film.

1354
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:47,860
Yeah, it is like a much more distinct style than most like mainstream movies.

1355
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,060
And with that, we as Brazil and Chitty Chitty Bang.

1356
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:51,820
It is right.

1357
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,540
Yeah, there's like something like visually and setting wise going on here.

1358
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,340
There's like a vibe, like stuff.

1359
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,500
Mainstream movies are missing oftentimes, like a vibe

1360
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,140
or like it's like a specific.

1361
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,540
I'm glad I totally agree.

1362
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,700
There is a distinct vibe of I lost my image.

1363
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,340
Yes.

1364
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,380
And you know, the kinds of the visual language.

1365
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:10,700
They.

1366
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,380
Yeah, yes, for sure.

1367
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:12,900
Hell, yeah.

1368
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,260
Did did Roger Deakins?

1369
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,420
Does he the DP on this?

1370
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:17,940
Do we know?

1371
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,660
Well, I can tell you that I'll tell you about the DP.

1372
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,420
It's a it's a pretty impressive DP.

1373
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,700
The guy's name is Isadore Manic Mankowski,

1374
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,860
and he is one of the strangest DP filmographies I've ever heard.

1375
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,700
The Muppet movie, the original Muppet movie.

1376
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,940
So that's the guy who shot that.

1377
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,460
Jazz singer, the Neil Diamond version.

1378
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:39,940
Oh, wow.

1379
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,420
Sevenies was this guy.

1380
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,620
He shot the TV movie Ewoks, the Battle for Endor.

1381
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,340
Yeah, uh huh.

1382
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,060
He is a Star Wars guy.

1383
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:48,700
Wow.

1384
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,580
Uh, in that respect, better off dead.

1385
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:57,380
He shot the Harry Anderson absent minded professor for the magical world of Disney.

1386
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:01,620
He shot a movie called Skin Deep with John Ritter that I'm very fond of.

1387
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:02,260
I've never seen it.

1388
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,540
It's I really like it.

1389
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,420
A little kind of hidden gem.

1390
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,620
Blake Edwards, I believe.

1391
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:10,820
And the movie She Cried No, a TV movie of the week where Candice

1392
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,380
Cameron is being harassed by Mark Paul Gosselaar.

1393
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,140
Wow.

1394
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:18,980
That's like a top tier good lifetime movie, like really watchable.

1395
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,460
Watching him play dark is really interesting.

1396
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:22,900
Right.

1397
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,900
So crazy lineup.

1398
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:30,180
But also, I think the reason he's part of this, he was not the credited DP, but a

1399
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,260
he lent 3D expertise or I guess,

1400
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,060
mainly more Muppet expertise to Muppet Vision 3D.

1401
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:42,980
They got a very light like they actually was a 3D expert and then he has done

1402
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:47,540
Muppets before, so they kind of worked in tandem to shoot Muppet Vision 3D.

1403
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,060
Wow.

1404
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:51,980
He acts and I know all this because there was a book about I just in Googling his

1405
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,460
name discovered a book about 3D filmmaking where it seems like the

1406
01:00:55,460 --> 01:01:01,380
interviewer wants to keep it on track to I Lost My M in Vegas, much like me with

1407
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,140
the episode.

1408
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,380
He's like, let's go back to the Vegas movie, though.

1409
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,580
And it seems like he does not really want to talk about it.

1410
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:09,420
The interviewer had probably had a beer at Fatburger before.

1411
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,820
It has to be that.

1412
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,860
Putsy in the mood for M's.

1413
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,300
Which I didn't remember.

1414
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,940
This is the very first thing I did in Vegas.

1415
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:20,260
The next day we went, we realized we were across the street from the Taco Bell

1416
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,100
Cantina.

1417
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,700
Oh, I didn't realize that.

1418
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,660
That was fun.

1419
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,620
It was, I mean, it was pretty empty all the week.

1420
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,020
So that was like, oh, now you're saying this.

1421
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,300
I'm like, oh, we should have gone there.

1422
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,580
And then go.

1423
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:35,340
I did last time I went straight Italy to that.

1424
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,540
That's like ups and downs.

1425
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:37,540
For sure.

1426
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,660
Nice food.

1427
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,180
And then this fun, stupid thing.

1428
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:46,740
There was a funny story about shooting the first Muppet movie where they have to

1429
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:51,020
build all the sets up really high because of the puppeteers.

1430
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:54,340
And then they have to put actors up on these elevated risers.

1431
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:58,220
But don't forget that the Muppet movie ends with an appearance from Orson Welles.

1432
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:58,740
Yeah.

1433
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:05,060
And thus they had to super reinforce that set because they were worried he was

1434
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,060
going to fall through it.

1435
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:12,060
I know this should have been on our fries episode, but I'm remembering now the

1436
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:17,860
manager told me of fries that Marlon Brando, speaking of actors of size,

1437
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,940
Marlon Brando was in the Burbank fries and they had to shut it down.

1438
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:21,740
What?

1439
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:23,260
So he could walk around.

1440
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,740
They privately closed down.

1441
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,140
That's what she told me.

1442
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,980
Because he wanted to look at the monsters and everything.

1443
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,460
I can't believe I forgot to say that.

1444
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,460
Yes.

1445
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,740
But we've got to figure out if we can find.

1446
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:34,900
I just remembered it now.

1447
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:35,540
It's got to be pictures.

1448
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:37,300
And that thing is like motorcycle, dude.

1449
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,300
It's like young Brando.

1450
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:39,900
Yeah.

1451
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:40,980
Oh, my God.

1452
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:41,780
We got to figure that out.

1453
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:42,580
Thank you for.

1454
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:45,220
I mean, I love that you're springing this on me.

1455
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,740
Yeah, this is delightful.

1456
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:53,620
This DP also has some bones to pick with Frank Oz because he picked up shooting

1457
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,260
after Muppet Vision 3D.

1458
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:55,900
Right. Right. Right.

1459
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:56,380
Yeah.

1460
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:02,020
Henson died and Henson was very specific about it's going to be long shots,

1461
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:05,180
continuous shots like the lab we've right commented on that big deep.

1462
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:08,220
And this guy was like, then Oz came in and shot everything close.

1463
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:12,340
He just like threw this guy who just passed visions that vision out the window.

1464
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,380
So he's a little mad at Frank Oz for changing Henson's plan.

1465
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,580
Interesting.

1466
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,940
I'll come back around to this guy a little bit, but we'll keep moving through this movie.

1467
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,860
But that tells you a really good DP.

1468
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:24,140
Excellent.

1469
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:24,740
Yeah.

1470
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:31,220
So a sexy yellow sock is hitting on Yela with all that expertise.

1471
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,820
Then he films a sexy yellow sock.

1472
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:38,220
This is fairly disturbing because she gets really flirty.

1473
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:41,220
Yeah. He has a just full on love interest.

1474
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,940
And he and then Red's like, hey, come on, love a boy.

1475
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,020
But it's all her.

1476
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,780
She is just she's pursuing.

1477
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,460
It doesn't pay off, though.

1478
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,220
No, they don't end up together.

1479
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:54,700
You don't watch them do anything, which would it just consist of him

1480
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,900
climbing into the sock?

1481
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,420
What happens in the lost sock?

1482
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,300
Var stays in the lost sock.

1483
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:06,500
It is. I would like to say my favorite quote of this thing is the way where they

1484
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,980
reveal that like, oh, we're not socks.

1485
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,580
We're colored candy.

1486
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,060
And then there's a record scratch and it gets very quiet.

1487
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:17,580
And then his socks scarily stares straight down the barrel of the camera and says,

1488
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:19,660
You're not socks.

1489
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:22,820
I like that very much.

1490
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,900
She oh, she her name is Bobby, by the way.

1491
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,740
OK, Bobby Sox.

1492
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,860
She shows him the way to an elevator.

1493
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,620
They I'm lost here now.

1494
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,580
I'm lost in this lost movie.

1495
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:36,580
They have to go to the sock bar to find out where the M would be.

1496
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,780
Yeah, this all is very confusing.

1497
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,500
Yeah. Yeah. It gets a little fuzzy from here.

1498
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,540
And then they they kind of self reflexively.

1499
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:48,220
They kind of know that there's just the beats that they have to hit because they

1500
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:53,420
go up and see a big scary furnace thing, which they call a big scary furnace thing.

1501
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:56,460
It's like an alive monster that's chomping.

1502
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:57,660
Right. It feels very well.

1503
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:58,900
This is where it would end. Right.

1504
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,420
The M's going to go into a furnace.

1505
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,780
Yeah, it's it's like Toy Story 3. Of course.

1506
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:04,940
Much later, the M's on a conveyor belt.

1507
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:08,180
That's when you discover that they have a they were given a device

1508
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,620
earlier that makes time stand still.

1509
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,860
So they're they're clock stoppers also.

1510
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:14,060
Yeah. Yeah.

1511
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,580
The M's are clock stoppers.

1512
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,700
The M's are clock stoppers.

1513
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:18,740
So that's helpful.

1514
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:21,940
But they also have another weapon up their sleeve.

1515
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,900
A weapon of mini destruction.

1516
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:32,740
It's time for the secret weapon, the minis, and they fly out towards camera.

1517
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,660
And this is wonderful product placement and new product at the time.

1518
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,900
At the time, still around.

1519
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:41,500
I mean, they're still around, but I remember them pushing it a lot.

1520
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,420
Yeah. Yeah.

1521
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,140
Late 90s, minis are at the top of their game.

1522
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,060
I like the minis.

1523
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,260
Yeah. Sure.

1524
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,980
Delicious. You like them as characters?

1525
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:57,060
They're more like a swarm or a hive, kind of a collective entity.

1526
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,860
There's no individuals. Yeah. Yeah.

1527
01:05:58,860 --> 01:05:59,700
Yeah. Yeah.

1528
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,300
It's like the fish in Finding Nemo make the shapes.

1529
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,580
You're right. The minions do it at some point.

1530
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:08,980
They're so small that they're able to form like they all together

1531
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,340
form like a helicopter and that helps red fly around.

1532
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:16,020
They form a bugle like to do it.

1533
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:21,940
And they, I don't know, then they get the M back.

1534
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,420
What happens? He gets it back and he seems indifferent.

1535
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,140
Yeah, he never cared.

1536
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:31,220
And also, there's one shot where I especially like where I think the animation

1537
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,860
is good and the texture of the M is also good flapping around.

1538
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:37,060
Yellow is sacrificing himself.

1539
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,380
He stretched out on top of a pipe and he's

1540
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,060
blowing the M to try to stop it from falling into the furnace.

1541
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,980
Yeah. Not his M.

1542
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,180
Yeah. Yeah.

1543
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,420
Did they? I forget.

1544
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,980
Do they actually set something up in it that like he's going to die if he doesn't

1545
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,340
have the M? Not really.

1546
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,380
It's just like he's like lost a shirt.

1547
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,340
Yeah. Yeah.

1548
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,780
And it's like a shirt that didn't even care about that much.

1549
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,180
And do M's.

1550
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,700
Can you repaint one?

1551
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,940
Can you have a fake one installed like it's a tooth?

1552
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:03,820
Yeah. Right.

1553
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,660
Or do you can you grow one?

1554
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:07,740
Like, will it eventually?

1555
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:09,540
I just like grits his teeth.

1556
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:10,420
Will he grow one?

1557
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:15,420
But maybe it's more like a finger and you don't regrow it.

1558
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:18,580
But then I don't know, get a prosthetic.

1559
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,620
I mean, that's that's complicated to do with a finger.

1560
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,020
But you would have to think with an M prosthetic M.

1561
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:24,820
That shouldn't be.

1562
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,940
It already looks very fake in and of itself.

1563
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,500
Well, you would think they were in the academy and the professor.

1564
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,420
The professor has to have a solution to this.

1565
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,140
It's got to be some kind of stem cell.

1566
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:33,860
Yes.

1567
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:37,580
Yes. Can we are we able to grow like beyond meat?

1568
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,260
Can we grow M's artificially in a lab?

1569
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:44,420
Whatever that clinic that Swedish clinic that Quincy Jones goes to

1570
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,220
that he talked about in the interview where he said they were going to keep

1571
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:51,580
them alive till 120, the go to that, pull that version of the M&M,

1572
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,460
like a clinic for M&M's in Sweden.

1573
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,100
In theory, though.

1574
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,060
Well, but is it on American soil?

1575
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:02,860
That's the problem because medicine isn't approved as fast in America.

1576
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,940
Because that's why you have to go like to Brazil for certain procedures.

1577
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:08,100
Or if you want to get your stem cell injection or mechs.

1578
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:08,420
Yeah.

1579
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:13,740
Wherever Sweden, all these places, they have a little more advanced technology than

1580
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:18,100
we do, but Q should fill him in because he's friends with the M's.

1581
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:21,260
I mean, yes, he knows all the major players in the world.

1582
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,660
He's like good friends with the Obamas.

1583
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:24,300
Yeah.

1584
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,860
So any you know, he parties with the M's, of course.

1585
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:28,380
Yeah.

1586
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,460
So, yeah, there's got to be something.

1587
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:30,980
Yeah.

1588
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:31,940
Help help him out.

1589
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:33,980
Come on, Q.

1590
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,420
So then we yeah, we end.

1591
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,860
Yeah, you're right. We end up back.

1592
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:37,700
We did it.

1593
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,500
M doesn't really care.

1594
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,540
And then we're back in the lab where we started.

1595
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,420
The professor comes back in.

1596
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,340
All right.

1597
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,420
Wait, let me take it.

1598
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,220
All right.

1599
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,620
What's all this noise in my lab?

1600
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:54,060
And what have you guys been doing?

1601
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,140
They say they found the M.

1602
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:56,900
That's good, Red.

1603
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,020
But how did you do that?

1604
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:03,540
We just hit a few buttons and then they do hit buttons again

1605
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:07,460
to demonstrate how they turn the machine on to go have their adventure.

1606
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,180
They hit the wrong button.

1607
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,420
The wind machine starts blowing again.

1608
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,820
And then there's a pretty fun gag, not unlike the special effects stage

1609
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:18,180
that we talked about, where there's like a little blackout thing.

1610
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:21,740
The professor flies through a big flash of light.

1611
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,900
Professor flies through a door disappears.

1612
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,060
They like obliterated the professor.

1613
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:31,820
Oh, professor dies at the end of the show or there or he's just like he or she is

1614
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,020
just like in a limbo state.

1615
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:37,300
So our professor, I have to give him credit because that flash happened

1616
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,500
and he was gone and then the exit doors opened and he was there.

1617
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:42,500
Cool.

1618
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:46,140
So I think maybe that's where he puts his panache.

1619
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,460
That's where he puts his spin.

1620
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,060
Runs around real fast.

1621
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,460
Yeah. Good for him.

1622
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:51,220
I like that.

1623
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:56,940
I watched a video on YouTube and at the start, a walk around Red.

1624
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,860
The professor was like, get out of here, Red.

1625
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,260
We got to start the presentation.

1626
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:04,300
Walk around Red in the lab and he walks out.

1627
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:04,740
What?

1628
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:09,740
Professor's like, then the professor goes into like, all right, well, I can find

1629
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,820
any man in the world.

1630
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,260
Let's find Red and Yellow.

1631
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:16,860
And that in that presentation, that the implication to me is that Red walks out

1632
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,100
of the lab and then immediately hits the tables.

1633
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,460
He just like slides down a chute in the MGM Grand Floor.

1634
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:26,340
Human size, human size.

1635
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,100
Well, big size.

1636
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:28,620
Yeah.

1637
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,620
Yeah.

1638
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:30,460
Wow.

1639
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,860
You know what they do say?

1640
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:35,460
Should we look for the professor right after we hit the buffet?

1641
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,900
So again, he doesn't care.

1642
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,100
He's so self centered.

1643
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,140
But that implies that the professor doesn't die.

1644
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,380
Yeah, that's true. You're right.

1645
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,300
You're right. The professor might they might have like.

1646
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:49,740
They have a device to locate any academic in the world.

1647
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:52,020
I remember when he went.

1648
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:55,140
When he disappeared, I remember when they kill him off.

1649
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:56,540
They killed the professor.

1650
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,900
It's true enough that I think a sequel is required and demand.

1651
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,380
Well, it certainly it certainly should be.

1652
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:06,300
We should have David out and see if he can talk to the right people.

1653
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,580
Boy, if we could talk to him.

1654
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,220
Crispy. I mean, you can have Crispy in there.

1655
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,860
You can have Carmel in there.

1656
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,420
They've had it so many.

1657
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:19,380
And I think this is I think the female care, I think like Brown is.

1658
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,820
Let's get Brown in there.

1659
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,500
Is Green is a female.

1660
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,700
Green and Brown.

1661
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:24,340
Well, yeah.

1662
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:26,140
Well, why are we only dealing with the two?

1663
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,500
It's time to flush out the ranks.

1664
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,780
Let's get everybody else in there.

1665
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,060
Right. I mean, this is green.

1666
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,900
Green is they're in the store.

1667
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:33,460
They're in the store.

1668
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,700
They're represented there, but they're just not in the film.

1669
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,140
Right.

1670
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:41,860
And if if they're going to plus this up or refresh it, they might need to do

1671
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:46,580
some things to be more to the liking of DP Isadore Mankowski.

1672
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:50,300
Of course, again, in this interview, that's all the interviewer wants to talk about.

1673
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,100
Tell me about the M&M's film.

1674
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,620
Well, that film all together.

1675
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,300
Well, that film is not very impressive, frankly.

1676
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,540
It was shot with stereo vision and I didn't

1677
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:03,620
particularly care for the quality or the of the lenses or the system.

1678
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,100
So he's not happy with that high on it.

1679
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,380
And he says, I don't get that voice through this whole quote.

1680
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,780
He says, I didn't see the finished film

1681
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:11,940
until a number of years after it was completed.

1682
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:13,420
I went to Vegas to see it.

1683
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,300
When I went to see the M&M's film, I was

1684
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:20,980
absolutely horrified because if a 3D film isn't projected properly, it's a waste of time.

1685
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:25,180
I went in there and got a headache right away because the images were out of focus.

1686
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,580
I won't disagree with that.

1687
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:29,220
I had a bit of a headache while watching it as well.

1688
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,700
That's not a credit you would give it.

1689
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:35,180
That's not. I like the spirit of the movie and the spirit of the professor,

1690
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,980
but it's not the best circumstances to watch.

1691
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,340
Not the highest optimum viewing.

1692
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,580
It was just complete chaos as far as projection is concerned.

1693
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,700
I went out and talked to the manager of the theater.

1694
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,260
Beyond the fact that I had shot it, I was concerned.

1695
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,420
I told him about the fact that it was being projected atrociously.

1696
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:51,900
And it had to be lined up again.

1697
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,260
And the audience would not get the full benefit of the production.

1698
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,580
He apologized and said he would attend to it.

1699
01:12:56,780 --> 01:13:01,140
I don't know if he did that or if the film is even still being shown.

1700
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,620
The interviewer says, I believe it still shows.

1701
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:07,340
A friend of mine who went a little while back told me they didn't even take the house lights down.

1702
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,100
Oh, no.

1703
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,780
Poor Zador.

1704
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:11,940
What a bummer.

1705
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:15,820
I can only imagine as a DP how much that and that's something you're you know,

1706
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,500
they aren't still showing the Muppet movie every day.

1707
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:21,220
Right. The jazz singer every day.

1708
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,940
This is his only chance to have something playing forever.

1709
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,180
And they're they're fucking it up.

1710
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:28,500
You know, get get it a little.

1711
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:37,980
I say give all the professors a little bump, give them a little bump in pay and give them like, hey, guys, let's just run this.

1712
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,900
Let's, you know, give them give them a little,

1713
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:47,660
you know, help to be the best professors they can because they clearly have invested in the store.

1714
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:52,580
I mean, you can get any and every color or variety of M&M merchandise like this.

1715
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,780
It is very thorough.

1716
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:56,900
But the professor is the ambassador of the Academy.

1717
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,900
Yeah. And you walk out of there thinking about your professor.

1718
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,180
And yeah, they have to be they got to notch up their performance.

1719
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,700
Let's get the guy who played Keen Bean.

1720
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,780
That's all I'm saying.

1721
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:06,980
Let's just get him in there.

1722
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,140
McShane, very interesting.

1723
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,500
Was also in the Tower of Terror movie.

1724
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:12,980
I'm a director.

1725
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,140
He's a who's lines anyway.

1726
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:14,820
Yes.

1727
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,580
And originally in the British.

1728
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:21,420
Yeah. But if they were to happen, I do think that I miss the general tenor of the current

1729
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:26,660
professor who has that up and down the actual kittens and that I wanted to go

1730
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,860
through it as quickly as we possibly can.

1731
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:31,300
Could you do all of our now announcements like that?

1732
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,980
I would I would love to

1733
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,380
if that's what we're doing.

1734
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:37,780
All right. You survive.

1735
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:38,900
I think so.

1736
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,300
Listen, Sean, we'll be back with more of those very soon.

1737
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,700
Be sure to check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

1738
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,100
And for more,

1739
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:50,500
send a podcast or pitch on dot com slash podcast.

1740
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:51,620
Right. Thanks.

1741
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:52,820
Thanks for being here.

1742
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,620
Have a podcast day.

1743
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:58,940
There is something so comforting, honestly, about that rhythm from doing all these

1744
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,700
experiences over our lives.

1745
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,100
Yeah. It feels very nice to do.

1746
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,220
I feel relaxed.

1747
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:07,340
Yeah. And I don't have to put that much energy into it.

1748
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,780
No, not having to enunciate.

1749
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:13,660
I feel like I have a particularly I try to enunciate when I speak and I end up

1750
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:14,820
feeling exhausted.

1751
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:15,380
Why?

1752
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:18,940
Maybe from now on and all the rest of the episode, should I just take it down?

1753
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:19,740
Not now.

1754
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,140
Worry about hitting those T's and F's.

1755
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:26,260
Just kind of try to breeze through those words as smoothly as I can.

1756
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,180
One whole episode just to try that.

1757
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:28,740
That whole.

1758
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:31,180
Arbitrary. It's not about this or anything else.

1759
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:32,980
No, no, no. Of course not.

1760
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:34,020
Yeah.

1761
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:37,060
Similarly, that was one of the reasons I think it took me a second.

1762
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,300
Then I realized it.

1763
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,140
Park MGM is pain it

1764
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,140
inadvertently.

1765
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:47,460
The color they have chosen for a lot of it is similar to Disney's Go Away Green

1766
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:50,980
that they paint on things that they want you to just pleasantly

1767
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,500
fade into the scenery and to the background.

1768
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:57,780
What if the plot of the next one is that green ends up in a place with a lot of

1769
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,940
Go Away Green and they can't find her?

1770
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:01,660
It overpowers the machine.

1771
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:02,380
That's good.

1772
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:02,940
Yeah.

1773
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,460
And she ends up feeling bad about herself.

1774
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:07,340
Like, why do I have the color that everyone wants to go away?

1775
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,460
Yeah.

1776
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:11,260
I mean, look, we're going to make the sequel to this.

1777
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,260
We'll just get it then.

1778
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:17,140
We will hire Isadore and we'll make sure to shot to his liking on the perfect.

1779
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:17,620
Oh, yeah.

1780
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:21,140
Old film, not on this stereo vision that fucked him over.

1781
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:22,660
So right.

1782
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,060
Well, thanks.

1783
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,500
Thanks for listening, Jason.

1784
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,220
Glad you had a good time.

1785
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:28,060
Glad you're part of the Blue 32 family now.

1786
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,140
I love it.

1787
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,460
Yeah, to go back.

1788
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:33,540
And thanks for watching this film that I care about deeply.

1789
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:36,460
And next time, do it with one fat burger beer.

1790
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:38,940
One fat burger beer, a good night's sleep.

1791
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:41,060
In fact, that's what Isadore should have done, too.

1792
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:43,460
He would have given a shit about the alignment.

1793
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:46,180
So Isadore, grab a beer.

1794
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,300
See you next time.

1795
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,140
Bye.
