1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,080
Warning, the following podcast contains an ice cream train, seed talk, a horrific batch

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,320
of fonts, and spin city era Richard Kind, all part of the troubled stew that was Disney's

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,120
California Adventure 1.0.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Come reminisce with us today on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,560
Greetings from California.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the show where we love to San Diego to theme parks and spill

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,440
the Yosemite about our favorite rides.

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,880
I'm Scott Golden Gatener, and here's a guy who Fres knows his stuff about theme parks,

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,540
and you can take that to the Burbank.

12
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,600
It's Mike Carlsbadson.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,640
Hi there.

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,000
My name is Mike Carlsbadson.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,240
I am thrilled today to be joined by my two best sacram-bud- sacrament-buddies.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Sacramento buddies.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
Right?

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,160
Yeah, that works, but it makes me have to change my next one.

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,040
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,840
Because I Hollywood like to introduce the other host of the show.

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,160
His favorite movie is Mr. Mulholland's Opus.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,480
Jason Sand Louis Abispeden.

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
That's right.

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,440
Also, would have taken Mulholland Drive.

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,120
Wait a minute.

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,600
Cleaner, smoother, yes.

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
That's better.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
You punched it up.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
How about sacrament bros?

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,440
My sacrament, yeah.

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,200
We're the three sacrament bros.

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
Yeah, that's good.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
That makes sense.

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,440
Could also be San Louis Abis-bros.

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
You could really change.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
That's true.

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,320
You could interchange all of the Sans.

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,080
If you don't know why I did all that, it still might not add up.

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,840
But if you don't know why all this is happening, then you didn't get to experience the original

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,600
Disney's California Adventure, which I feel was like walking around what I just did.

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Yes.

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,840
Is that accurate?

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,560
You mean the most jam-packed theme park ever, right?

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,280
As the LA Times was hyping it up.

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
They said that then?

46
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:53,000
That is the headline to the soft opening roundup article of January 14th, 2001.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,840
The most jam-packed theme park on earth?

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
What?

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,840
What do you mean?

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,960
Oh wait, maybe DisneySea wasn't open yet.

51
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,440
When did DisneySea open?

52
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,080
Because if it was open.

53
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,880
DisneySea opened later in 2001, didn't it?

54
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
I believe.

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,680
Well, then that's the problem.

56
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,920
But the reason they described it that way is because the contents of this article is

57
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:26,720
all about how we are expecting folks come early in the morning or late at night, because

58
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,600
we're going to be turning people away from this place.

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,840
We're expecting 7 million people opening year.

60
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,000
And that did not happen.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,880
Do you have any idea where it ended up?

62
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,800
I'm going to put you on the fact spot.

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,560
I saw some numbers that were not good.

64
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
I just don't remember them.

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,080
They were expecting.

66
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,440
So for they were expecting for the original for Classic Disneyland Park, they were expecting

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,840
13.3 million.

68
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,040
And at DCA, they're expecting 7 million.

69
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,960
What they got was 12.3 million and 5 million.

70
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,520
Oh, man.

71
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Wow.

72
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:12,800
Well, yeah, and in general, just like the day to day crowds were not what they thought

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
they would.

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,600
It was like they thought they were going to like they kind of scared everybody away with

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,480
the high, which is similar to what happened a little bit with various points of this of

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
the Star Wars.

77
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,840
I mean, I mean, Star Wars is always pretty jammed.

78
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,440
But like, I mean, remember the rest of that day of Galaxy's Edge opening were just like

79
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,080
everywhere else at Disneyland as a ghost town.

80
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
It was so nuts.

81
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,960
Yes. And we thought we were like going to get tasered if we didn't immediately like

82
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
run out.

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,800
Yes. Oh, yes. Yes.

84
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,480
I was very worried. I was like, oh, well, they told us we have to leave by two o'clock

85
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,960
and if we don't or noon and if we don't get out by noon, you know what happens?

86
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,240
Jail is 12.03.

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,720
We're standing on an largely empty wooded pathway at the other end.

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,440
It can't be in this park anymore.

89
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah. If we had if we hadn't gotten out in time, we all would have been dead.

90
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,040
We would have been put into slave Leia costumes.

91
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,280
That's yeah, that's right.

92
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,840
Shamed up and been on Chepex barge and put on Chepex barge.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,280
We're going out into the desert.

94
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,800
You mean Chepex actually, two tons.

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,040
They just they Photoshop him to look like that.

96
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,280
He's actually a hulking worm monster.

97
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,480
Chepex is the hut.

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,760
Chepex is a hut.

99
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
That's our real Chepex the hut.

100
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,880
That's why they they cut the banter ride is they had to pay for his barge.

101
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,520
That that is some lame joke

102
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,640
that's been made by some theme park account, right, or some theme park

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,520
like not journals, but commentator.

104
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,560
That's one. Oh, this one.

105
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,440
Sorry, the current one talking.

106
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,720
Yeah, I really we really need to check, check ourselves when we act like

107
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,240
we're so much cooler than the other theme park media.

108
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,400
To to give you an idea of that.

109
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,880
That so these numbers and again, you can find this L.A.

110
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,760
Times article, they are it's the most big dick energy you've ever.

111
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,920
They're like walking around on top of the world.

112
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,160
The park is not opened yet, but they're like, get ready, get ready for this.

113
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,200
So in 2019, the rough attendance numbers and this is all coming from like L.A.

114
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,760
Times and Orange County Register, Disneyland, 18.7 million,

115
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,800
DCA, nine point nine million.

116
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,840
And that year they were like, the numbers are kind of plateauing,

117
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,520
even with Galaxy's Edge.

118
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,960
But in theory, that's a decent year.

119
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,920
Like that's that's a much higher increase like than 18 years ago.

120
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,720
And it's just over half at the second park on a good year.

121
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,640
It's just over half as many people.

122
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,880
Right now, which especially they were like framing the park initially.

123
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,040
Also, like still they wanted those numbers to be as high, but they were also saying

124
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,720
it's maybe, you know, it's not as much as Disneyland.

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,320
Like they still would kind of like hedge their bets.

126
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,240
Like, you know, it's it's a 75 percent Disneyland, but that's good.

127
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
Right. You're OK with that. Right.

128
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,640
And no one was OK with that.

129
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,040
We're talking here about the episode.

130
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,880
It's called DCA one point.

131
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,680
And we're doing this because this very week,

132
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,640
California Adventure will be celebrating its 20th anniversary.

133
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,160
February 8th, to be exact, is when the park opened.

134
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,960
So so 20 years of California Adventure.

135
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,200
And could we celebrate the the the the wonderful part,

136
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,720
the many great things that there are to do there now or not now,

137
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,080
but were to do when it was open, you know, that the incredible park

138
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,440
it's become. We could do that or we could flash back to the bizarre,

139
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,440
spare, annoying version

140
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,000
that we got some some 20 years ago.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,440
What does it sound like listeners we would do?

142
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,640
You know us. What do you think it sounds like?

143
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,720
You had to guess.

144
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Well, yeah, I think it's I think it's clear what we're going to do.

145
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,200
And I think I think it's a good

146
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,960
it's a good area for us and a good like what I'm excited about here

147
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,240
is that so many of our episodes are about a specific

148
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,320
ride or or place or or area of a park.

149
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,200
And this, I feel like and I, you know,

150
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,000
this is one of those titles that's open to interpretation DCA one point.

151
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,000
But to me, it's about a vibe.

152
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,320
This is like it's like a general

153
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,040
just like aesthetic and a thing in the aesthetic that manifests in

154
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,160
in signs and fonts and odd architecture and

155
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
very limited music

156
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,240
collection that was played in this place.

157
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,200
I'm just I'm excited to swim in the vibe of DCA one point.

158
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,360
Oh, and to that end, I think maybe a good thing to talk about is that

159
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,320
in one of our very first episodes, we were talking about like

160
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,040
maybe controversial theme park opinions that we have.

161
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,320
And Jason's was that he he kind of liked the vibe

162
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,440
that you do in some ways miss

163
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,680
what California was like in the very beginning.

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,400
Well, you know, I was talking to my dad about this the other day

165
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,440
because I told him we were doing this episode and he's like, you know,

166
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,120
and let me be clear that the first time

167
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,600
I went there was like 2006.

168
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,960
So some adjustments had already been made,

169
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,520
but a lot of it had not been changed yet.

170
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,560
The first time he would have seen, I think, would have been like 2007, 2008.

171
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,600
So, again, even more adjustments.

172
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,560
I think he first came out and saw that park

173
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,640
maybe 2008 right before like Toy Story Midway Mania.

174
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,080
So but there was still a lot of it hanging on.

175
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,240
And I think the thing, one of the things we liked

176
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,040
was, you know, Disneyland's really jam packed with stuff to do.

177
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,000
But DCA, even in its transitional, like years in between the like

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,880
very original and then the gradual changes in the mid to late 2000s, early 2010s,

179
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,520
I it was kind of like nice that you didn't have like there were less attraction.

180
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,880
Like you could go a little slower.

181
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,280
You could have a beer.

182
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,720
You know, it was a little like leisurely pace.

183
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,400
We liked, you know, the Grizzly Peak recreation area.

184
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,320
You know, we like the Fisherman's Wharf, the bread tour,

185
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
the tortilla factories and some kind of different stuff.

186
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,360
But you could still have a slow day, even if there was more to do.

187
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,400
You know, you can have a slow day now and a beer now.

188
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,640
It would prevent you from.

189
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,040
I mean, that's true.

190
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,680
Now I think it does occasionally suffer from the problem

191
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,200
they were concerned about early on of like with less attractions.

192
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,960
If one or two goes down or one or two are just really backed up,

193
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,320
you can get in that like, oh, what do we do?

194
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,040
Like, where do we go?

195
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,560
Here's my.

196
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,240
It's like blockbuster driven.

197
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,080
Yeah, yeah.

198
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,040
I was just going to here's my theory for what you're actually is going on in your brain.

199
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,400
And I have some of it.

200
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,200
I believe that just because it was 10 years ago, we're all nostalgic for being younger

201
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,600
and being in the past when we had less troubles and less cares.

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,880
And now you have that annoying Calliope music with

203
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,520
with the like sparse California adventure, like

204
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,680
theming and the sort of genericness of it.

205
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,120
So now it's associated, you know, 10 years ago,

206
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,960
you were a carefree man in his 20s.

207
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,120
You were a childless man in his 20s.

208
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,080
You know, I, you know, that that's not wrong.

209
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,000
I do very much remember the first day I went in college with my roommate, Jack.

210
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,200
And we got there bright and early at 8 a.m.

211
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,560
because we were going to try to do both parks in one day.

212
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,760
And we did pretty much all of California adventure by noon.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,880
Yeah. And we're like, well, guess we're going back to Disneyland.

214
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,320
Yeah. So because like it could have been Disney, like Disney in 2001

215
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,200
opened up Disney's Toilet Park and it's a toilet themed theme park.

216
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,640
And there are no rides.

217
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,360
It's just a series of bathrooms.

218
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,160
And even though you knew at the time it was bad, I think 10 years later,

219
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,440
you'd be like, you know what? Toilet Park wasn't all bad.

220
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,760
There was some interesting stuff at Toilet Park.

221
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,680
Well, but then there's also some fun to be had for making fun of Toilet Park.

222
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,120
We're going and going and of course, a little on on parts of it.

223
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:13,680
And, you know, I, I, I do think a lot of stuff I like in California design.

224
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,200
There's a lot of good California kitsch.

225
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,760
So and I can see them like with a limited budget or a budget

226
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,600
that was like, you know, kept getting scaled back.

227
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,440
It seems like there were some stuff they tried to do kitsch.

228
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,560
And some more successful than others and some just outright horror shows.

229
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,040
Yeah. That line of kitsch and cheap is just you got to be you got to be careful.

230
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,560
You have to be so careful or else you end up with the SS Rustworthy.

231
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,880
Oh, boy. Oh, we're going to have some fun here.

232
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah. I think if California Adventure, the original and I yeah, there's obviously,

233
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,760
you know, there's there's Soarin, which is a great ride and it's lasted.

234
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,920
And there's other stuff we like, obviously.

235
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,320
But but California Adventure 1.0

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,840
feels like it's the aesthetic of that City Walk gift shop

237
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,160
that sells the fake celebrity IDs.

238
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,240
It's like just it's like as gaudy in places as the sock market

239
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,840
or like any of those other like in your face retail store, like retail shops.

240
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,280
And with that air of like, because we're a little funky here.

241
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,440
Well, welcome, visitor from California.

242
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,120
We do it a little different.

243
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,360
You might have just a plain box and one font,

244
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,000
but we have nine fonts and they are all spinning and yelling at each other.

245
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,160
Yeah. And what you said about the vibe, like the vibe of it is actually,

246
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,400
I think the issue, because I was thinking earlier, I was like, all right,

247
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,680
if you really look at the opening day rides for all the parks, like,

248
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,160
you know, Animal Kingdom, MGM Studios, Epcot,

249
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,640
it's not that there's a lack of like five e-ticket rides,

250
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,880
because that isn't often what happens when a theme park opens.

251
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,480
They have like maybe one like MGM Studios opens and it's got.

252
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,840
Great movie ride. That's like the big showstopper.

253
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,400
And that's a catastrophe canyon in the tour that they have a tram.

254
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,760
Right. Ready to go.

255
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,640
But that's obviously there's precedent for a tram tour,

256
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
and I'm not saying they didn't do a good job. They did.

257
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,320
But it's like it just why was an MGM Studios considered a flop

258
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,160
if they only had a couple big new things.

259
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,040
It's like Soren's a great ride and the other rides are fun.

260
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,640
It's what you're saying is what I'm saying.

261
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,520
You're you've got to the point.

262
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,240
I think it's it's the vibe and it's the aesthetic that made people go,

263
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,880
this isn't this isn't worthy.

264
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,600
Well, yeah, but also like, yeah, you're right.

265
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,480
I was younger and like I had less, you know, worries and stuff.

266
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,240
And I was there with my friends or college classmates and family.

267
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,720
And we were having a nice time.

268
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,160
It's why you look back on like movies and you're like, yeah, I don't know if that

269
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,640
I need to rewatch that movie ever.

270
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,520
But like I had a nice time when like XYZ Blockbuster came out

271
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,840
and went with my family and we all went out to dinner.

272
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,440
Of course. You know, of course.

273
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,760
There's no shame in that, by the way.

274
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,600
I'm not trying to shame you for that.

275
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,520
But I think you might be doing some historical revisionism because MGM 1.0.

276
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,840
I think a lot of people forget that it was the great movie ride

277
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,080
at a two hour tram tour.

278
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,560
And that was it.

279
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,080
Yeah. Right. But it was but it was, I think, well received.

280
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,520
I think that was the difference.

281
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,160
But I think that people did like it and were just like thirsting for more.

282
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,120
California Adventure felt to me like we do not want more.

283
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,120
You do do a lot more or I'm never coming back.

284
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,320
Yeah. That I think was the feel.

285
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,240
That is true.

286
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,360
I mean, I think it had a lot riding against it, which is too.

287
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,880
I mean, in the previous years, you had seen Animal Kingdom open

288
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,680
and Islands of Adventure open.

289
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,640
And both pretty well received.

290
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,040
Alamo Kingdom kind of doing a different vibe, a different, different stuff.

291
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,680
A little light on attractions in the early days.

292
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,800
I think very light. I think very light.

293
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,160
Yeah, very light, but very beautiful.

294
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,200
Of course, to counteract.

295
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,000
It's all about the adventure.

296
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,560
Yeah, it's all about the vibe.

297
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,760
Islands of Adventure packed with big roller coasters and very popular

298
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,040
like e-tickets right out the gate.

299
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,520
And then the other thing that was riding against it was the unbuilt

300
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,760
parks, the Westcott and then the Disney Sea that would have gone in Long Beach.

301
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,920
Yes. Yeah, much better sounding.

302
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Definitely. Yeah.

303
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,160
Yeah. And after all that, like if you got any taste of Westcott

304
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,320
and there was enough like I certainly was not like,

305
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,600
you know, I'm in middle school is all this is playing out.

306
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,680
But I still like I remember looking in the newspaper and seeing a

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,360
seeing concept art of Westcott and it just looks grand.

308
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,480
It like it looked pretty epic and you knew they were going to

309
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,840
pull it off in a very stately way. Yeah.

310
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,840
I did, though, like concept art of this, too.

311
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,200
I think there was an early California adventure

312
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,480
that would have been better than what they did.

313
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,440
And clearly they just like winded it down and winded it down.

314
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,560
Yeah. And I was, you know, as a younger, I was not aware of the history

315
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,840
of Westcott and the Disney Sea in Long Beach.

316
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,480
And I would assume what?

317
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,720
Ninety eight percent of guests were not aware of any of that.

318
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,880
That's got it right. Yeah. Maybe less. Ninety nine.

319
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,520
It depends. Yeah.

320
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,600
It depends on how local they were.

321
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
And I think if they read the newspapers a lot,

322
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,280
because my parents were very aware of like Disney's America and

323
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,600
the Disney Quest in Philadelphia projects, just because that's true.

324
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,040
It's got like a lot of play in the local paper. Right.

325
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,000
But I think you're right, though, Mike, that it's like the average person

326
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,400
is just like, oh, Disneyland. I like Disneyland.

327
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,600
Oh, there's a new Disneyland. I don't like this Disneyland.

328
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,400
Yeah. What is that?

329
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,120
I'd say a degree of knowledge there.

330
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,160
Yeah. It's more of just like initial. This doesn't feel good.

331
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,400
I don't like this feeling like that's what it is.

332
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,360
It's like this feels this feels different.

333
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,200
This feels like this feels, yeah, tacky.

334
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,760
Disney doesn't like if you think about

335
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,880
like a second gate, which we which we call our Patreon.

336
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,800
You know, there weren't that many of them by this point.

337
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Like if you think about, I mean, there were now like several parks at

338
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,640
Disney World, but like there's a lot of pressure on number two.

339
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,760
In a way, almost there isn't as much on number three or four.

340
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,240
And like, what's OK?

341
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,800
Animal Kingdom didn't have as much to do.

342
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,160
Like we know how this goes. They're going to get it there.

343
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,040
But being sort of having to be Disneyland to whether or not that's what they're

344
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,040
whether or not that's fair.

345
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,520
Like when you think about what's the first second gate, it's Epcot Center.

346
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,200
And that's massive.

347
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,640
That opens massive and with extremely ambitious things.

348
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,000
And then Islands of Adventure.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,040
And yeah, that's like completely different vibe than Universal Florida.

350
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,720
And so much to do and really grand stuff also.

351
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,560
Both Epcot and and Islands of Adventure, you have like

352
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,920
technology you can't figure out.

353
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,840
Like they like stepped up.

354
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,600
They they like stepped up a game, essentially,

355
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
somewhere in the course of the park.

356
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,000
And then you get what's Disneyland to its

357
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,240
bunch of like sunglasses puns.

358
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,920
It's puns. It's a lot of puns.

359
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,160
A lot of puns.

360
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,440
It's a lot of like postcard humor.

361
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,960
You know what, though, I this wasn't a thing that really dawned on me

362
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
until very recently, but.

363
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,760
I think in current DCA,

364
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,880
it would be awesome to just walk over and get a Big Mac.

365
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,640
You cannot undersell how good a Big Mac hamburger is.

366
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,240
And the building looks like shit.

367
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,880
Oh, my God. Oh, the building.

368
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,960
I'm curious what everybody's like least favorite, which that's a candidate for me.

369
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,080
But yeah, like we start getting into specifics here because

370
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,600
there's so much to tribute.

371
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,840
There's so many odds and ends to call out.

372
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,040
It's something that I want to say at the top, just to acquaint

373
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
the listener who doesn't totally know.

374
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,040
So, yeah, but you probably know to some extent that California Adventure

375
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,280
opened a little disappointing and there wasn't a lot to do.

376
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,120
And that major things have been added.

377
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,960
The big things being turning the entrance area into Buena Vista Street

378
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,720
with the very the classy Carthay Circle restaurant,

379
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,160
not only as a cool restaurant at the end of the street, but as kind of

380
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,240
the castle that they didn't have before.

381
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,840
So that was a lot of that was one of the big renovations was making that

382
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,000
that street really nice and like the, you know, the

383
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:45,240
not the I guess the is it 20s or 30s like the Hollywood that Walt landed in

384
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,800
and and Cars Land, obviously, is the huge one.

385
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,000
But that got added.

386
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,480
But besides that, just to acquaint you that in 2001,

387
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,760
what did they not have at California Adventure?

388
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,360
They did not have the Tower of Terror, probably the big

389
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,120
the biggest, quickest save that they were able to do.

390
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,840
They did not have a Bugs Land,

391
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,440
which is now they don't have any more and it's becoming Marvel.

392
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,720
But just all that was, you know, less.

393
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
And we'll talk about that.

394
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,960
No Cars Land, no, no Little Mermaid.

395
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,160
There was the Pier area and California Scream and the roller coaster.

396
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,480
But there was not Toy Story Midway Mania.

397
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,280
So you're now you're talking like so many of the what are now

398
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,320
kind of the tent poles of the park are not there.

399
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,040
And obviously, we've talked about this plenty and we just talked about it.

400
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
But what is now the Monsters Inc ride was Superstar Limo,

401
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,720
considered the worst attraction.

402
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,800
And and really, we got we've we've covered that plenty.

403
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,120
But Superstar Limo, I feel like jumped out.

404
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,720
I think you didn't have to be a theme park nerd to know about Superstar Limo

405
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,640
and be like, yeah, that sounds awful, because like newspaper articles

406
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,800
would call it out and say, are you wondering what that second Disneyland is?

407
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,560
It's got this. Yeah. Maybe reconsider.

408
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,760
Well, you even compare that to just what a great movie ride,

409
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,360
which I some I've heard critic good, like legit criticisms of great movie.

410
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,160
Great movie, right?

411
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,920
Has tons of show scenes, tons of robots.

412
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,360
You're on a car. They're impressive robots.

413
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,720
They're human size.

414
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,640
And then you just like years later, it's just like tiny little creep robot,

415
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,720
like not even robots.

416
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,440
And it's like, yeah, if you heard about it, you go, oh, that sucks.

417
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,000
But if it was like, I guess there's a version of Superstar Limo

418
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,240
where it's like on the scale of great movie ride, where you maybe go,

419
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,920
oh, well, that was like a big show scene where you saw Drew Carey holding tickets

420
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,640
or whatever. It was a better robot of Drew Carey.

421
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,080
And like even the concepts in that ride could be done better. Right.

422
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,160
You know, I almost said and then and then did not.

423
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,480
When we were talking to Oscar about Monsters Inc.

424
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,320
that I was something occurred to me about that.

425
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,320
I think the I think the vibe, the aesthetic of Superstar Limo

426
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,680
is like the animated intro to the Anna Nicole Smith reality show.

427
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,120
Oh, man.

428
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,360
You are in a ride that looks like that.

429
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,160
We know exactly what you're talking about. Yes.

430
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,080
That is like almost like the nanny.

431
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,880
I don't want to.

432
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,720
I don't I don't dislike the nanny opening as much, but right.

433
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,760
I don't know that I want to go into a ride that looks like the nanny intro.

434
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I think it's using the nannies intro style

435
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,600
as an excuse for a lack of budget.

436
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,320
I think you're you're using that to try to hide and go, well, that's just

437
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,560
there, the aesthetic of it as opposed to like, we don't have that much money.

438
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,520
This is what we got approved.

439
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,000
We're sorry.

440
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,200
Like we did our best. Yeah.

441
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,040
But if if they had like you're saying, Scott, if they had made like

442
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,600
Drew Carey's superstar, like Superstar Limo starring Drew Carey

443
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,040
and it's Drew Carey picking you up at the airport and showing you Hollywood.

444
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,320
Yeah, that could be something. Sure.

445
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,280
Had a popular show on the air.

446
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,440
They could have done like the ball. Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,440
Yeah. If it's like the scale, like closer to the scale and scope of

448
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,040
great movie ride, yeah, like why like you go, that's kind of odd.

449
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,320
But all right. Like I like that.

450
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,360
I like this scene.

451
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,120
Like as we've said before, like IP and stuff

452
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,160
and even sometimes concept doesn't really matter.

453
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,680
It really just it's like execution and and I would of course say intimacy,

454
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,400
but that's not what everyone would say if you if you wish.

455
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:30,200
I mean, like, well, now now imagine the exact same series of events

456
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,800
of Rise of the Resistance, but do them as squiggle drawings like Superstar Limo

457
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,920
and like animatronics that are like, is that Kylo Ren?

458
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah. I don't know if is that like John Boyega?

459
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,240
They all look like slightly larger ventriloquist dummies

460
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,200
or like like puppets, like lonely goat herds,

461
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,800
sound of music puppets with like Kylo Ren.

462
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,240
And he's he's like two feet tall and like his arms are just moving up and down.

463
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,800
Floppy mouth. Yeah.

464
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,440
And then the 80 80s are like flat cardboard cutouts

465
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,520
and they're five feet tall.

466
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,280
And then and it's not John Boyega taking you through it or Lieutenant Beck.

467
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,480
It's like, there they are, everyone, the famous.

468
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,200
Take a picture. Smile.

469
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,800
Yeah, I can't imagine that.

470
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,640
It's interesting if stuff had worked out, there might be a version.

471
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,760
If Lucas had sold, say, Lucas decided not to make the prequels

472
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,440
he sold to Disney back then,

473
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,560
maybe because of the budget and the situation at the time,

474
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,040
that would have been the big new Star Wars ride.

475
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,360
You know, I know that, like, of course, we're landing in this

476
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,680
this kind of general opinion of that the the prequels were underrated.

477
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,040
And but like I was always and I like Star Wars too.

478
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,480
I like Star Wars Adventures Continue.

479
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,120
But I remember how like when you were here and they were going to try to do that

480
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,480
in like 2000, like, thank God it took a little longer.

481
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,880
Like, think about how bad those graphics would be.

482
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,840
And they would not have changed it.

483
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,000
I mean, it'd be fascinating if there was like a sub prequel

484
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,440
because it wouldn't have looked as good as the movies even.

485
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,800
It would have been like a lesser version of the pod race that's still there.

486
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,960
Like they certainly would not have changed it in 20 years.

487
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,880
Yeah, because some of the I mean, the prequels still look pretty good.

488
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,640
And he's touched.

489
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,880
George has touched up a lot, had touched up a lot.

490
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,120
And maybe that will continue.

491
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,600
But yeah, I can imagine that the theme park tech version of that

492
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,520
in 2000 would have been bad, coupled with the fact that they weren't spending.

493
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,840
They weren't in a good spending mode.

494
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,880
You could imagine what that would look like.

495
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,080
The first thing I thought of was because for whatever reason,

496
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,240
Instagram suggested I watch a clip and a clip of the red chili peppers

497
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,960
Californication video, which is like sub crazy video game.

498
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,800
Yes. Sub crazy taxi graphics.

499
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,640
Well, that's kind of the idea.

500
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,680
I don't think they meant for that to be photorealistic.

501
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,520
Yeah, no, but it looks awful.

502
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,080
It looks really bad, like much worse than I remember it looking.

503
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,880
And maybe crazy taxi looks that bad, too.

504
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,760
And I'm forgetting.

505
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,400
But that's my first thought is how a star tours would have looked.

506
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,320
Is that level? But that was yeah, that was that was 99, I believe.

507
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,920
Ninety nine or 2000 is when that video came out.

508
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,840
Something like that. Yeah.

509
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,720
I mean, you're you're again.

510
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,160
These are all things, like I said earlier, that I have such

511
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,920
fond memories of warm feelings at the time.

512
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,080
It is hard to divorce myself

513
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,240
from like, I mean, I think I told I told the story about Mike

514
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,880
and me like hanging out with people and putting

515
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,520
Phantom Menace on on a giant TV.

516
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,840
And maybe it had motion smoothing on and that was part of it.

517
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,000
But it looked like like a Windows 2000 screensaver

518
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,960
kind of playing in the background.

519
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,040
But I like a lot of those actors, you know, from the prequels.

520
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,240
And I like a lot of the actors and the new ones, you know, so you

521
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,360
it's it's you have more.

522
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,680
And again, you go see it with people you like.

523
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,240
And so it can be hard to divorce from the quality of something.

524
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,000
I would have replaced Rex in start in Star Tours 2000.

525
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,280
That's a good question.

526
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,320
I mean, yeah, so Phantom Menace is just coming out.

527
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,960
I mean, is it does Jar Jar go in there?

528
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,200
It's got to be Jar Jar.

529
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,480
George definitely was like,

530
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,000
Jar Jar is going to be the biggest character of all time.

531
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,800
Like he was he told Ahmed best that he was not anticipating any

532
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,520
any sort of backlash.

533
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,640
So I could see George being like, well, you know, we're going to want to have Jar Jar

534
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,120
because everyone's going to want to come see him.

535
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,720
We my brother and I had T-shirts had toys before the movie came out.

536
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,840
And Jar Jar was front and center of those shirts.

537
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,440
Yeah, yeah. So excited.

538
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,640
We were I had all the I had all the toys from Phantom Menace.

539
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,600
They are this is how sick I am and how sick the collector community is.

540
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,200
They are just releasing bigger versions on the car

541
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,960
on the same Phantom Menace card and their best, which means that backing of a figure.

542
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,320
So it basically looks exactly like the toys you're talking about.

543
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,400
Phantom Menace, that red card and only it's like, you know, six inch, six inch

544
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,720
figures now, not like the shorter ones we bought.

545
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,560
And I want them. I want the Mace Windu.

546
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,680
I want the Jar Jar. I want I've bought many of these different retro toys this year

547
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,800
that have the same backing card as I had when I was a child.

548
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,440
So, yeah, I we were all hyped for all of those.

549
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,920
And Jar Jar was definitely part of it.

550
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,040
And so maybe it's maybe it's Jar Jar or is it a

551
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:00,280
is it little Anakin, but rendered at the time in Superstar Limo quality?

552
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,960
I'm going to fly it. I'm the pilot.

553
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,880
So like a little ventriloquist dummy of Anakin Skywalker,

554
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,120
essentially like that quality, big wide mouth and very dead eyes.

555
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,840
Yes, you could like you wouldn't have.

556
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,080
It would have made complete sense to like just replace Pinocchio with him

557
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,440
on the Pinocchio ride, and no one would have even noticed.

558
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,480
They'd be like, oh, yeah, the top on Pinocchio got a new haircut

559
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,760
and he's wearing like a robe now. OK.

560
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,240
Yeah, that's an interesting.

561
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,160
Yeah, I think we would have had a lot more boss Nass.

562
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,400
On on it. I wish there was more boss Nass now.

563
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,720
I love almost all the prequel characters and it's turned.

564
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,360
It's not even ironic anymore, I will say.

565
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,000
But I am fast.

566
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,520
I would have loved it if that had happened.

567
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,280
And then we've got an updated version.

568
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,560
But as you're saying, you're correct.

569
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,480
It would not have happened if it was.

570
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,880
Yes. Although some people would be ardently arguing

571
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,400
and that it's the best ride in history.

572
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,680
There would certainly be that.

573
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,200
Yes, that is true.

574
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,920
That is true. Yes.

575
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,640
Darth Plague is the ride.

576
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,520
Uh, I'll bring it back to California Adventure.

577
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:17,040
So the one phrase I kept seeing come up and I didn't quite do the math on.

578
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,600
I think it's about right, but it depends on what you consider an attraction.

579
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,120
When California Adventure opened, it had the same number of attractions

580
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,680
as Disneyland did in 1955. Yes.

581
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,040
Did anyone else come across that?

582
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,560
Yes, because I watched the opening day special

583
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,720
hosted by Richard Kind, Barry Bostwick,

584
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,920
Colin Mockery, like a lot of different people.

585
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,880
And they say Brad Sherwood.

586
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,200
Thank you.

587
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,280
Or Burton in there.

588
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,200
And of course, Eisner at the end.

589
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,160
But they say that early on, and that's they're very proud of that.

590
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,400
Yes. As if that means that's not acceptable.

591
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,320
Yeah, that's bad. That's not good.

592
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,760
Yeah, our standards have it's kind of similar to how like sometimes somebody will.

593
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,480
You'll you'll see a comforting stats.

594
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,480
What's supposed to be a comforting stat about how actually the pandemic is playing

595
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,680
just about just like the Spanish flu.

596
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,600
Like, oh, and these things happen, these things happen.

597
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,520
So this is kind of how this thing is supposed to go.

598
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,240
You're like, no, it's not. That was 100 years ago.

599
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,680
Yeah. Yeah. Should be way better than it's something 100 years ago.

600
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,280
It's it really feels like that Disneyland stat is an excuse.

601
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,200
It feels like they're already hedging a little bit and go, well,

602
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,320
it's the same as the original.

603
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,000
So I don't know what you're complaining about.

604
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,840
And you're like, I didn't complain yet. I don't know.

605
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,040
Why are you so defensive?

606
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,600
Why are you arguing with me in this special?

607
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,920
It's like when they did the Hong Kong Castle exactly like the Disneyland Castle.

608
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,960
That's like a trap.

609
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,640
Like, yes, instead of doing a giant ornate castle,

610
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,480
which now they're having to go back and do, they did exactly a Disneyland castle.

611
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,160
And they're like, well, that's not good enough for you.

612
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,840
You seem to like it at Disneyland.

613
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,000
Why don't you like it here?

614
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,120
Because we our expectations are higher now.

615
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Yeah, you clearly you just did it because it's cheaper to build this

616
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,040
and you have the design.

617
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,120
So that's what you're doing.

618
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,440
You're pretending it's like some sort of homage

619
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,480
when it's not because I looked at the Disneyland stat and then I looked at

620
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,240
I go, OK, what was open Disney Disneyland opening day?

621
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,200
It's like, first of all, you have to put yourself in a different context.

622
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,600
This type of crazy theme park did not exist yet.

623
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,640
Yeah, it is inventing a thing.

624
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,000
It's inventing a thing.

625
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,760
But there's a number of mule based attraction.

626
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,160
There's a lot of mules.

627
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,960
There were no mules in DCA.

628
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,120
Mules, multiple trains, you know, trains, mules,

629
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,760
and then a couple of dark rides, which were very ambitious for the time.

630
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,000
And then the theming, of course, which.

631
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,480
Almost all of it. Yeah.

632
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,600
If you were to if I'm trying to think, what would you describe it?

633
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,560
Is it like inflation, like themed inflation?

634
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,840
We're like, you know, that and, you know, when Disneyland opened,

635
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,840
that was worth three animal kingdoms at the time.

636
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,240
But now we're sure that's what I'm trying to figure out how to explain that.

637
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,880
Like, just that they like had a flag.

638
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,280
Like, here's a medieval flag.

639
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,560
Well, it's just like it would look in the movie.

640
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,600
And now you're you kind of expect because they stepped up their game.

641
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,440
You have to judge people by post 1955 standards.

642
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,080
Yeah, I mean, people probably like saw the car,

643
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,160
the Snow White and the Seven Dwarf cars that had the name of the dwarves on it.

644
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,800
And they were like, holy shit, those are the characters from the movie we like.

645
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,720
Oh, my. They were getting so excited about it like that.

646
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,160
That made so much like that was so much of a bigger impact,

647
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,640
probably on those guests than. Yeah.

648
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,280
Then then.

649
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,080
Honey, give me a Benzo and a cigarette.

650
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,440
I need to calm down.

651
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,840
Hold on. I'm getting harassed by Bob Cummings.

652
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,760
I have to. Yeah.

653
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,280
Hold on. Help. I need I need to get away from this crazed man.

654
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,120
There are so many mules and you could make out with a big star from TV

655
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,280
who's hopped up on sheep's sperm.

656
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,160
There's so much to do here.

657
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,280
Yeah. Oh, Jason, go ahead.

658
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,560
Oh, I was going to say, meanwhile,

659
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,000
here's another thing from that L.A. Times article.

660
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,400
They quote Barry Braverman,

661
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,000
Disney's chief creative supervisor of the project.

662
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,960
And the setup is that, you know, well, there's less rides.

663
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,720
So a couple go down, you know, that could be dicey.

664
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,800
And his response is, quote,

665
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,800
we'll just have to count on the live entertainment being good.

666
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,040
And I think we it wasn't right.

667
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,600
I don't have a lot about all of this stuff, but I have these phrases in my head

668
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,880
like Eureka!

669
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,240
Or there'd be, I don't know, like people banging on trash cans.

670
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,640
What was the live entertainment?

671
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,640
There was a bad show called Steps in Time.

672
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,560
I don't remember much about Steps in Time.

673
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,400
That was kind of like a not a jukebox musical, like a variety of review.

674
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,240
I think was big songs from the movies and stuff.

675
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,440
OK. And that was eventually replaced by the trash can thing.

676
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,200
Eureka! was the California parade, right?

677
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,560
Yeah, that's right. Right.

678
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,480
Yeah. Do we know what Eureka! was like?

679
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,920
I did not go down the Eureka! rabbit hole.

680
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,080
Some of this, you know, we got it.

681
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,720
We've got a three hour Bountiful Valley Farm episode.

682
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,360
We got a Eureka! episode.

683
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,080
You know, the bigger bigger fish to fry the opening special alone.

684
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,920
Yeah, we're going to plant seeds for future things.

685
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,800
Oh, like the seeds you would find at Santa Rosa seed and supply.

686
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,920
Roses. That was something in the park.

687
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,400
Santa Rosa seed and supply.

688
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,280
Yeah, it was by San Andreas Shakes and Bountiful Valley Farmers Market.

689
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,400
Oh, and the Bountiful Valley Farm. Yeah.

690
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,680
Oh, boy. Well, we got so much.

691
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,480
This is going to be a two parter.

692
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,520
Here, I just want to show you what I found just googling the parade.

693
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,240
Oh, yeah. This is terrible.

694
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,520
So Disney's Eureka! California Adventure Parade had a guy dressed as a fortune

695
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,960
cookie and somebody dressed as a box of noodles.

696
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,720
And his legs are bamboo and his legs are still legs are big bamboo shoots.

697
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,400
That's the big float.

698
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,480
Oh, God. The stilt walkers is the Golden Gate Bridge is horrified.

699
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,320
So there's two guys dressed as the Golden Gate Bridge.

700
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,320
Yeah, here's just like

701
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,000
just an ugly version of the entrance and the sun.

702
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,240
No, that's a that's Pixar Play Parade.

703
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,960
That is not that there's that woman like the spirit of California.

704
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,720
I don't know. There's a lot of like generic mystical element,

705
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,240
like spirit of California and and some questionable indigenous representation.

706
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,320
Like, it's just.

707
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,960
I don't quite know what it I don't even know how to describe it.

708
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,160
Well, we'll be doing that eventually.

709
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,600
Yeah, there's yeah.

710
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,080
The the I'll pull up a video that is the

711
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,760
did you guys watch the opening ceremony?

712
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,160
The like the little like play that happened out in front.

713
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,320
We're way Disney talked and Eisner talked.

714
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,840
I mean, we I think we have to do an episode all about

715
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,400
opening ceremonies at some point, as we've talked about.

716
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,240
Yeah, we're like that.

717
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,520
They make Benicio del Toro do it with a little skit.

718
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,000
I mean, these things are great.

719
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,160
This is definitely its own thing.

720
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,720
But let me try to find this part, because this is kind of the vibe that

721
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,000
you were showing with like vaguely mystical elements,

722
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,600
as Jason was saying.

723
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,920
And this is what I so they put up a bunch of like

724
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,960
blue tarps in front of the park.

725
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,320
There's an audience of seated guests.

726
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,040
There's this I don't know what character this is.

727
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,680
If this is like a something related to Khalifa or Khalifa,

728
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,280
the whoopie Goldberg character, and we'll deal with that later.

729
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,360
But the, you know, there's some kind of California Queen comes out.

730
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,480
And it seems like it's all these dreamers essentially like here's gold people

731
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,920
and blue people, and they're all chasing something with streamers.

732
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,680
They're dreamers with streamers.

733
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,680
But what is it? What do they want?

734
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,040
Oh, a big golden California.

735
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,960
There she blows.

736
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,000
And then the guy waves it in front of them like here.

737
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,080
Isn't this what you were dreaming of?

738
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,960
And then a banner goes by that says, imagine.

739
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,680
And one says culture and most you can't read because they aren't angled

740
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,920
to face the audience.

741
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,640
I like this is chaos.

742
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,440
And also, what is this like?

743
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,960
All right. The things you can do in California, that there's beauty

744
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,640
and there's Hollywood, I get all that.

745
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,800
But like who cares about the shape?

746
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,280
Like as if the shape came to you in a flux capacitor dream.

747
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,200
There's a place and it looks like this.

748
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,240
It's straight at the top and then it squiggles down to the right.

749
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,160
It haunts me each night.

750
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,440
Well, you make fun of it, but you had the video muted.

751
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,440
You couldn't hear the assembled crowd going shape, shape, shape.

752
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,600
Best state shape.

753
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,960
That looks like other than the size, that looks like a thing I made

754
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,280
in elementary school for like a project, like a home project

755
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,560
that I put off until like nine p.m.

756
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,440
Nine p.m. the night before the night before,

757
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,120
which is how I usually did my projects.

758
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,880
And it would just be like, well, I don't my mom.

759
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,320
I don't know. We have cardboard.

760
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,640
You could there's a goal.

761
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,440
We have a gold pen.

762
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,560
And I'd be like, oh, yeah, OK.

763
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,840
So we'll like just cut out California and pan like draw gold on it.

764
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,480
It looks I mean, I'm sure it's not paper, but it looks like shit.

765
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,880
It looks awful. Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,800
I mean, it's big.

767
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,080
That's the only thing is that the only thing I could give this

768
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,640
to them over you and your mom is that maybe you couldn't have fit this

769
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,920
in your house. No.

770
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,760
Besides that, the quality is exactly

771
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,400
exactly the school project.

772
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,040
Give it some shading or something so the audience can see it a little more.

773
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,600
Something suggesting dimension, perhaps.

774
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,240
It just yeah, it looks it looks bad.

775
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,560
The whole thing is rough.

776
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,920
And, you know, yeah, we'll deal with this in an opening ceremony thing.

777
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,080
But, you know, Mickey comes out and Eisner sort of justifies the the premise.

778
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,880
This is a whole I don't know that we super need to go into this.

779
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,200
And it's covered in the various documentaries and such.

780
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,840
But, you know, there was a retreat in Aspen where they got everybody together to

781
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,520
let's crack that idea, that second park.

782
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,320
What's something we can do?

783
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,240
And they put a lot of ideas up on the board.

784
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,600
And it sort of was like cherry picking a few.

785
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,080
And the idea was like, if you were being not cynical, you would say, well,

786
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,840
these are themes we've always wanted to tackle, like the charming seaside

787
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,600
amusement park or the nature of Yosemite and that kind of thing.

788
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,120
And of course, you're doing a new Disney MGM studios would make sense.

789
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,400
But if you're being cynical about it, it's like, well, what are our main

790
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,200
travel tourism competitors?

791
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,440
Like, all right, people, what do people do instead of Disneyland?

792
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,400
They go to nature and they go to Hollywood and they go to,

793
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,040
I don't know, Santa Cruz, the boardwalk there.

794
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,520
How do we let's do a fake one of all those and then we'll cut in all their money.

795
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,840
That is, I mean, I guess, yeah, now that you say that, it's like that was sort of

796
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,400
a very strong Eisner philosophy.

797
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,520
MGM studios is that.

798
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,280
Animal Kingdom is like, well, let's make a better zoo than the zoo.

799
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,880
Let's put Busch Gardens out of business.

800
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,360
Yeah, right.

801
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,560
So it's like we can do everything better.

802
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,040
So like, it does seem like that is a big part of him, even in the parks that we

803
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,960
like and were more successful from the get go was, yeah.

804
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,120
I think it's that he could like that sort of cynicism mixed with a ton of money

805
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,720
could sometimes produce some great results.

806
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,840
But then here you didn't have the ton of money.

807
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,160
Well, but what you said, something that runs me the wrong way, I was like,

808
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,680
wait a minute, why did they transport all these people to Aspen, Colorado

809
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,600
to figure this out?

810
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,960
I mean, if you wanted to get everyone out of town, like Santa

811
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,120
Barbara's two hours up the road, like, well, they maybe didn't have

812
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,720
their California idea yet.

813
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,120
Yeah, right. Maybe the thoughts.

814
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah, they maybe it could have been a totally other idea.

815
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,600
No, no, I don't even mean like the transporting the park.

816
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,960
I mean, like for corporate responsibility, it's like,

817
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,880
oh, it seems like you put more thought into the this retreats

818
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,960
vacation aspect than you did the actual work, you know, potentially.

819
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,480
It's that maybe where they their head was at.

820
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,040
Yes. What's a nice trip we can do.

821
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,800
Do you think if Eisner was still in charge, we would have like some sort of

822
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:51,200
Lego type land in one of the parks to make sure people like kids

823
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,800
didn't go to Lego land.

824
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,320
I don't know if he would have like block partnered with block place or something

825
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,880
like block. Yeah.

826
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,880
California Adventure would have a block place where you would play with connects.

827
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,680
Connects. Yeah. Is that Lego Lego owned?

828
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,200
I forget. Oh, as it might be Playmobil.

829
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,720
He's just like looking for, yeah, adjacent properties.

830
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,360
Or they just make their own.

831
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,760
They just make their own Disney Mickey Mortars.

832
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,560
They build a building with Mickey Mortar. Mortars.

833
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,720
Yeah, like like what you.

834
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,960
Oh, yeah. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

835
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,440
Not the yeah, that's the bomb.

836
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,880
The projectile. Yeah, you're right.

837
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,840
That's what my brain went to is like, we're making Bob.

838
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,640
We're making bombs now.

839
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,680
That's that's for dismal land.

840
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,600
That's for Banksy's dismal land.

841
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,680
Yeah. Oh, Disneyland. Yeah.

842
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,280
I maybe to start stepping into some specific things.

843
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,160
And some of the big stuff that I'm sure we want to talk about is right at the front.

844
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,000
So why don't we do kind of let's let's head into the park.

845
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,960
Let's imagine that those blue walls at the opening ceremony went down,

846
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,240
because that's what happens after they find California.

847
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,680
Thanks to the sun goddess or whatever.

848
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,040
Then one layer comes down and you see those big California letters.

849
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,240
There you I think people probably remember this.

850
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,440
This was still there up until fairly recently.

851
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,760
Big letter spelling out California.

852
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,720
I think this is among the less egregious things that they they did initially.

853
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,480
Yeah, I think it's a clever idea.

854
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,040
I don't know that a lot of this park, it's like, oh, I can kind of see

855
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,600
the kernel of a clever idea.

856
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,080
The execution or the like the reach was not necessarily there.

857
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,560
But yeah, this is this is less egregious. Yeah.

858
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,440
And I think this is a food. I will give this credit.

859
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,520
This is a these are letters that were taken like photos in front of a lot.

860
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,400
I believe everyone, everybody has photos of these.

861
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,080
So like pre Instagram, they had made like a very Instagramable thing.

862
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,360
And like, I believe, I don't know, I'm using a newer way,

863
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,520
a newer philosophy to think about success here.

864
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,560
But I think that you could say, well, that was fun.

865
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,600
I liked taking it. I like going up in front of that sea.

866
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,400
Now, the problem may have been a lot of people did the photo

867
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,720
and then walked away from this.

868
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,160
Is it to Disneyland?

869
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,800
Yes, to Disneyland or to the pizza restaurant.

870
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,120
Yeah, yeah. That'd be fair.

871
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,040
Yeah, you know, I liked I think the letters ended up looking nice

872
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,560
when they did like they made it look like the world of color.

873
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,480
And there's a slow gradient to the letters.

874
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,040
They look nice in the holidays.

875
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:39,400
Like they were able to like on DCA 1.0 these that like they

876
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,680
they didn't look like trash. And then the font is good.

877
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,280
I'll give it up for the font because I have a lot of font problems in this park.

878
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,200
They eventually got rid of these.

879
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,320
Though they lasted a while longer.

880
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,560
They now it all got moved up to Sacramento

881
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,280
to a place called Cal Expo, which is where they do the California State Fair.

882
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,800
So it's cool that they found another home.

883
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,440
Gavin Newsom has given some very stressful press conferences

884
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,040
in front of these letters and which I remember like infuriating.

885
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,360
I think he like announced restrictions on theme parks

886
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,400
or failed to address theme parks or something in front of the letters.

887
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,880
And people were like, but he's right in front of the letters

888
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,280
and he's making theme parks suffer.

889
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,800
So a dark use of the letters.

890
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,680
And then, by the way, now that thing Cal Expo,

891
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,160
because the state fair sites just kind of sit dormant most of the year

892
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,960
and all year in this case, because there's no state fair,

893
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,360
it has become a mega vaccine site.

894
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:46,680
And it is apparently doing among the worst of any of the mega vaccine sites.

895
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,680
Disneyland is which has a vaccine site now is up and running

896
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,680
and doing way better than the place it gave the letters to.

897
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,040
Toy Story lot is where that vaccine center is.

898
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,160
Yeah, which, you know, there I was I was going to tweet about this,

899
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,520
but maybe this is it.

900
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,280
Do we do the three of us and therefore

901
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,760
parking garage expert Nick Weiger, do we have to wait to get the vaccine

902
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,640
and apply to do it in a different county so that we can do it

903
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,360
in the Toy Story lot so far unaddressed on podcast?

904
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,880
Well, that's a very good question.

905
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,400
I have thought about that question.

906
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:33,520
Yeah. But then also apparently Six Flags is a vaccination site as well.

907
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,920
Yes. Closer is L.A. County.

908
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,440
Yeah. And we apply for we are we qualify for that one.

909
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,400
But yeah.

910
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,400
So here's the thing.

911
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,440
This is a great idea for a bit.

912
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,840
But the reality is we should probably all get a vaccine

913
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,440
as soon as we can and maybe not hold out for a bit.

914
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,440
But the reality is if someone broke into my home

915
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,120
and was screaming that a needle that they have out is the vaccine,

916
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,640
I might let them stick it in me just in case.

917
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,720
I'll take anything resembling a vaccine.

918
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,200
It's worth the risk.

919
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,920
So if it if it happens, if there's some sort of serendipity

920
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,280
where we can do it in one of these places, I would love it.

921
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,960
But yes, I agree with you.

922
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,600
If like the mailman goes, hey, you know, I have an extra vaccine.

923
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,240
You want to take it? I would say, oh, yeah, sure. OK.

924
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,080
I would probably do it.

925
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,240
So it's a great idea, though.

926
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,440
I mean, we would get a great three hour episode out of waiting in the vaccine

927
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,240
line and say, like, how did they you know, how's the theming for the vaccine line?

928
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,520
And we've gotten we've talked about so much less with the parking garages.

929
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,080
And now we could go get cured of the disease of the century in the parking lot.

930
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,320
That's probably that's so much more dramatic than anything

931
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,040
we ever thought would happen in the Disneyland parking lots,

932
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,520
especially the one that is nothing that is just a pavement.

933
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,320
Could we get the first dose in Toy Story and the second dose at Six Flags?

934
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,880
If we're doing Moderna or Pfizer,

935
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,360
just so we can get this whole spread.

936
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,960
I don't think City Walk is out.

937
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,880
Yeah, I don't think City Walk is doing it.

938
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,640
Because it's too confusing.

939
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,560
Yeah, yeah.

940
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,560
People, they'd waste vile after vile

941
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,840
because of the confusing universal parking garages.

942
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,800
Where's King Kong? Yeah.

943
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,040
Oh, no. I got the disease now.

944
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
I died.

945
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,360
And Mike would end up with a comically large thing of vaccine juice

946
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,440
that he's like, I don't want to drink that.

947
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,920
I got to go.

948
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
I don't want to throw it out.

949
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,200
Just dump it in a bush.

950
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,560
You don't want to dump it in a bush.

951
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,040
Yeah, yeah. I guess that makes sense.

952
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,280
It would want to do that at City Walk.

953
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,400
Well, so that's I don't know.

954
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,520
Let us know what you think.

955
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,600
If you really want us to do it and if you work in the medical community

956
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,120
and can help us do it.

957
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,320
Oh, yeah, we're willing to cut.

958
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,120
We're willing to cut a line in front of people that need it more.

959
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,840
I will start doing spin kicks on strangers.

960
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,440
Yeah. And why is for sure in?

961
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,880
I mean, oh, yeah, yeah.

962
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,480
Yeah, we'll just assume for him.

963
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,560
Right. Definitely.

964
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,920
He'll hear. Yeah.

965
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,160
OK, so we keep moving past the letters and the letters are part of a greater

966
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,160
tableau, and that is the postcard

967
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,120
introduction to the park.

968
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,200
The is it was it just called?

969
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,120
Is it called anything?

970
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,600
Is it called sort of greetings from California or something?

971
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,760
You mean is it like that's called the world's largest ceramic mural is what it is.

972
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,880
It's the largest at the time was the largest ceramic mural in the world.

973
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,600
That's cool. That is cool.

974
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,400
The postcard.

975
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,480
Yeah, the postcard didn't go anywhere, right?

976
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,080
I didn't see anything about that.

977
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,280
Do like, did it move the mural?

978
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,640
Yeah, I'm not sure.

979
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,680
I feel like I might have.

980
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,280
Maybe they did try to take it somewhere, but I don't really know.

981
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,400
But this whole idea, I don't think that I knew exactly that this

982
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,760
that was the idea.

983
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,920
It just kind of looks

984
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,160
chintzy, despite being like, it's certainly amazing ceramic work.

985
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:10,000
If you're just judging it on the the ceramic quality, but the

986
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,440
that you're in a postcard, I don't think I got it.

987
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,800
Yeah, I guess I didn't get that either, really.

988
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,960
I guess that doesn't really play so strongly.

989
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,320
This is also another thing about and I should as we criticize

990
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,080
some things about California Adventure 1.0, if you look at something,

991
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,440
you might actually go, well, that looks like it took a lot of time

992
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,280
and artistry to make it.

993
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,000
I just don't find it pleasant.

994
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,400
Mm hmm. Yeah, yeah.

995
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,280
Totally. It's like that sort of.

996
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,240
Yeah, you can actually appreciate sometimes where you go, man,

997
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,440
a lot of work went into that thing that I go, oh,

998
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,360
just show. Well, how about just how do you guys feel about the

999
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,040
Golden Gateway, which is what I believe what they call the Golden Gate Bridge?

1000
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,520
You know, the miniature Golden Gate that the monorail goes over,

1001
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,560
because that's still a bridge.

1002
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,960
They made it that bridge and that water village that you take

1003
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,520
if you're going to Dunkin Donuts.

1004
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,120
I think like a bridge we use.

1005
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1006
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,160
I think that's I honestly I think that's OK.

1007
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,960
I don't find that so egregious.

1008
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,440
Yeah, it makes sense.

1009
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,560
It's a pretty what are the more recognizable,

1010
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,320
you know, things I think they reproduce?

1011
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,400
I liked the idea.

1012
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,040
But yeah, I think it's chintzy.

1013
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,400
They hit it in that they're just saying it in the Imagineering Story

1014
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,560
documentary, and I was like, good. Yeah, let's and I can't tell you why exactly.

1015
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,720
The idea I remember thinking, oh, and the monorail goes over the Golden Gate

1016
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,040
Bridge, that's pretty neat.

1017
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,520
And then it just what is wrong with the bridge?

1018
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,800
Is it is it the wrong shade?

1019
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,240
Is it too small? It does.

1020
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,360
It looks legolandy to me.

1021
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,440
Yeah, I think it's a little cartoony.

1022
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,920
And then and then shortly thereafter that you hit this ornate Grand Hotel,

1023
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,040
which is very detailed.

1024
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,600
Of course, you do not stop at it.

1025
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,760
No, no, you can't get off her on there.

1026
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,880
No, no. So, yeah.

1027
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,320
I think it's I think that if the if it wasn't just like flats

1028
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,280
with mountains around it when you're looking at those Golden Gate Bridge

1029
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,160
things, I think it would have looked better.

1030
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,200
I think just the nature of it, it does it like when those things juxtaposed,

1031
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,160
it just gives you a sense of cheap, like cheap.

1032
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,520
It just doesn't feel grand.

1033
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,480
And I think you could probably keep the bridge things the same.

1034
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,080
And if just the stuff around it was better,

1035
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,640
you might actually go, oh, yeah, well, it looks cool.

1036
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,880
That's pretty cool. Yeah, yeah.

1037
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,000
There's so many rivets.

1038
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,080
It was just like so studded.

1039
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,840
I felt like it seemed like too many.

1040
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,040
Maybe they maybe they bought me.

1041
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,200
That's what made it look like Legos to me.

1042
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,320
I this this might be a good

1043
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,040
because this is this is how I found this this little rabbit hole.

1044
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,320
I you know, if you want to see pictures of early California adventure,

1045
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,160
it is so well archived on the site.

1046
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,520
Yes, your land that does a great job of.

1047
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,920
Yeah, just keeping track of things that used to be there.

1048
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,400
And they're a California side of the site is just packed.

1049
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,400
There's so much.

1050
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,880
And they were talking about things about this Golden Gate Bridge.

1051
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,360
And well, you know, one thing about it is it was a great place to hang

1052
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:25,040
banners and to advertise events that were coming up at the park,

1053
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,760
because they were they one thing about early California adventure.

1054
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,480
They tried to do a lot of odds and ends events.

1055
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,840
They had the X games come in, which led to some very ugly artwork.

1056
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,800
They had a concert series in the first band ever to play it.

1057
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,320
Of course, America's band, the Beach Boys with Mike Love

1058
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,680
and Bruce Johnston and no one else who matters.

1059
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,320
So there was lots of garbage like that.

1060
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,480
And they did a thing called and there's a big banner hanging off

1061
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,200
the Golden Gate Bridge advertising ABC Primetime preview weekend in 2004.

1062
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,160
So I wondered what that was.

1063
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,600
And it seems like it was basically an up front.

1064
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,520
And if you don't know the up front, it's where a network trots out

1065
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,800
all their new shows to show to advertisers.

1066
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,400
And wouldn't you, a regular person who paid to go on some rides,

1067
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,920
love to be advertised to about, you know, hope and faith

1068
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:25,760
or and or eight rules for dating my teenage daughter

1069
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,520
or whatever shows were on ABC at the time.

1070
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,440
Is this thing? Oh, yes, I was just going to say, is that the same event

1071
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,160
where Jim Belushi played blues on stage?

1072
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,120
You are correct, sir.

1073
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,920
I'm sorry, I probably I jumped the gun.

1074
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no.

1075
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,920
No, this is because this is great.

1076
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,000
Yes. Among the like you're looking at a list.

1077
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,800
I mean, there's great stuff all over the list.

1078
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,120
You know, there's going to be a reunion of growing pains with Kirk Cameron

1079
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,320
with a new some defying

1080
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:03,320
Christmas spirit carrier and covid carrier Kirk Cameron.

1081
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,960
Uh, so a lot of lots of dumb stuff.

1082
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,920
And then it all culminates.

1083
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,320
That seems like the peak of this event was a live Saturday evening performance

1084
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,600
by Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts introduced by Jimmy Kimmel.

1085
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,240
Jimmy Kimmel, eventual host of the Oscars, kind of America's host

1086
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:27,040
at this point, was just the opening act for Jim Belushi.

1087
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:33,000
I feel like this restaurant tour, this guy's got a barbecue place down the block.

1088
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,960
Oh, does it? I haven't been.

1089
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,440
Oh, what's that?

1090
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,040
You're. Wait, wait, wait, wait, hang on.

1091
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,840
Who's who's a restaurateur?

1092
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,880
Yeah, Belushi.

1093
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,560
Yes, a barbecue.

1094
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,080
Isn't he part of House of Blues?

1095
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,000
House of Blues was.

1096
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,640
He's not part of House of Blues.

1097
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,120
He would certainly play at it, but he was not.

1098
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,200
I don't believe was a like at least like not a major partner.

1099
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,160
He might maybe that maybe he got in there as an investor or something,

1100
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,960
but I don't think he was like one of the mains.

1101
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,160
I see. OK.

1102
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,560
I don't. You guys are the Belushi experts.

1103
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,840
I got to leave it.

1104
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,200
Proudly so.

1105
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,040
Yeah.

1106
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,800
But should you discover anything I don't know about this?

1107
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,760
How this sacred performance?

1108
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,240
No, and I'm trying to remember which episode we talked about this before.

1109
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,280
It's been like two years, but there were two.

1110
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,640
We did talk about it. We did.

1111
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,840
There were two years in a row that Jim Belushi and the Sacred Hearts played,

1112
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,280
and I was looking desperately for footage, but I could not find any.

1113
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,760
I just found some pictures of him with like the DCA backdrop.

1114
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,480
And I want to say he was playing like a harmonica, but.

1115
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,640
Sounds right. Yeah.

1116
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,160
So, yeah, there's no I mean, if somebody in the audience has video of Jim Belushi,

1117
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,160
please send it to to us or point us in the right direction.

1118
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,840
If it's your private video, even please

1119
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,680
up raise or capture it and send it our way,

1120
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,440
because I would like to see this.

1121
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,120
Mm hmm. But yeah, I don't know.

1122
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:58,000
Look, I'd love to see Jim Belushi perform at Disney's California Adventure now.

1123
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,520
I think that that should still happen.

1124
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,400
I think it could happen.

1125
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,880
It would have been great if he like did a guest spot at the Mad Tea Party

1126
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,880
where like he just kind of spinning.

1127
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,920
Yeah, he could have dressed up like one of the Alice characters or not.

1128
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,680
It doesn't matter.

1129
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,800
Some like and now the Cheshire cat, Mr.

1130
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,520
Jim Belushi to play Cheshire blues cat.

1131
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,560
Yeah, he's a cool cat. We know that.

1132
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,240
I like Jim Belushi, by the way, on Twitter lately has been killing it.

1133
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,880
I will give him that. You know, he gets he's got.

1134
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,600
Yeah, you're kind of funny in his like weed guy.

1135
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah, he's got a lot of shit over the years, but it feels like he's in a nice,

1136
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,960
comfortable place where he's just growing weed and like being nice to people on Twitter.

1137
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,640
Hmm. I tried to get us some, but it's only being sold, I think,

1138
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,000
at the Pacific Northwest right now due to licensing and interstate trade.

1139
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,440
Oh, man.

1140
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,880
Is Jim Belushi's weed farm themed enough for us to do an episode on podcast?

1141
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,840
I think the strains are Blues Brothers oriented,

1142
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,440
so there is theming in the weed itself.

1143
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,080
God, yes, we have to.

1144
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,080
We really should do that.

1145
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,600
Yeah, yeah.

1146
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,400
Oh, boy. Yeah.

1147
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,760
What is this? It's just Belushi farms.

1148
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,000
What is he? Because I it's like I think it is just like it's not even clever.

1149
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,800
It is like Blues Brothers weed.

1150
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,640
Oh, yeah, it's just the Blues Brothers.

1151
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,160
And then Belushi's secret stash.

1152
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,920
Wow. So do you think Danny Danny Ackroyd gets a cut?

1153
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,040
Do you or he just kind of gave him his blessing to make it?

1154
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,280
Because obviously weed is a big business.

1155
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,800
And I think like Danny, Danny's a big business man, as we know.

1156
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,440
I wonder. I'm interested.

1157
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,840
Was it was he cut out as revenge for not being part of the House of Blues?

1158
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,080
That's a good question.

1159
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:53,080
Or not being featured prominently in Blues Brothers 2000.

1160
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,360
Or is he in it at all?

1161
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,160
Doesn't make an appearance or my crazy.

1162
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,920
I'm just thinking, I don't know if he's in it at all.

1163
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,240
He just shows he sometimes plays as the Blues Brothers on tour with Dan Ackroyd.

1164
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,040
I just found an old performance.

1165
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,680
I was thinking about the especially the area where there were three of them,

1166
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,360
where it was Ackroyd and John Goodman and Jim Belushi.

1167
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,320
And I saw a performance from the House of Blues where they have the actual of Sam

1168
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,680
and Dave. Sam is performing Soulman with them

1169
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:26,040
uncoordinated dancing in the background, like not synced up.

1170
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,880
And he does the first verse of Soulman, he being a

1171
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,080
African-American performer.

1172
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,840
And then for the second verse, Jim Belushi, a white man,

1173
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:42,040
grabs the mic forcefully and takes it over to sing Soulman.

1174
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,960
And just like the hearing.

1175
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,280
All right. Here's the original.

1176
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,760
And now Jim Belushi, who seems to do his choices to scream it.

1177
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,920
That's his take on the blues is screaming.

1178
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,600
I'm not sure any of those three men, Dan, Jim or John,

1179
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,080
are the greatest singers in the world.

1180
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,760
That's not what I would say.

1181
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,840
No, Sam and Dave great, like fantastic singers from

1182
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,480
you know, Sam's there. Maybe you let Sam do it.

1183
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,240
Is Belushi the one that we talk about the story about the DVDs?

1184
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,640
The Christmas gifts and the car? I'm not sure.

1185
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,080
I'm not sure where I heard this. I think it's Belushi, but.

1186
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,640
It it was Christmas time

1187
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,280
and the show was taken, whatever it would have been, according to Jim,

1188
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,440
was his show, right? Mm hmm.

1189
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,640
And usually when you're working on a long run TV show like that

1190
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,520
and it gets, you know, everyone gets very close

1191
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,000
and either the production company or the studio gives out Christmas gifts.

1192
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,640
And sometimes like I've had friends get like bikes like for the Christmas gift.

1193
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:57,440
The Christmas gift on that show was the season, the previous season on DVD.

1194
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,440
And I believe the story goes that Belushi had, you know, he had the

1195
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,400
primo parking spot right by the soundstage.

1196
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,920
But his window was like left cracked just a little.

1197
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,840
And he came out at the end of the night and the car had just been filled

1198
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:19,520
of the DVDs, like people just shut the boxes through the window and filled the car up.

1199
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,160
Wow. I've never heard this. Is this a secret story?

1200
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,400
I don't know. Wow. I don't know.

1201
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,680
I have no idea where the bridge is being burned.

1202
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,640
Is it our bridge to go to Belushi farms? Yeah.

1203
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:35,000
Yeah. We'll have to figure it out if we have to leave this in, you know. Yeah.

1204
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,680
Hmm. Yeah. How bad too much do we because it is a themed environment.

1205
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,880
Or are you thinking like this happened to Kevin James?

1206
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,040
Like, you know, is there another? Oh, yes.

1207
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,560
It also could. Yeah, it could have.

1208
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,080
Now that you say that, it could have been Kevin James.

1209
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,120
It did it. I like the story.

1210
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,480
It's a great story. Yeah. The source of it.

1211
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,640
I also just want to say really fast that I'm on Belushi's farm dot com.

1212
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,680
And there's like a big I almost feel like acroids involved because the

1213
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:04,040
the the text and specifics could not be thicker than the copy

1214
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,680
that I am reading about these marijuana strands.

1215
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,320
And listen to this.

1216
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,320
As with music, we are naturally wired and set up with tetrahedronal shaped

1217
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:17,600
endocannabinoid receptors that are organic to all of us.

1218
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,640
Jeff Sessions included.

1219
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,000
God, if whenever you have that set case closed,

1220
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,080
that's a that sounds like a real acroid.

1221
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,440
Yeah, yeah. Maybe he maybe he helped.

1222
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,800
He punched it up.

1223
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,280
And then we'll topical bunch up several Trump,

1224
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,800
several generations of Trump villain ago.

1225
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,320
And which sort of brings me to

1226
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,520
the second thing I was going to say about this event,

1227
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,720
about prime time preview weekend 2004.

1228
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:51,120
There was also among the many things, come see the stars of the show.

1229
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,400
And you can also see a little preview and meet the star of the show.

1230
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,920
The benefactor.

1231
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,400
Do you guys have any idea what the benefactor was?

1232
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,640
Show in 2004, was it their version of the apprentice?

1233
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,440
It was their version of the apprentice and it was starring this beefcake.

1234
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1235
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,200
Do you even recognize him as young, hunky Mark Cuban?

1236
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,600
This is like what who is he trying to look like?

1237
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,280
He's like trying to he thinks he's Freddie Prinze Jr. or something.

1238
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,960
Chris Klein early to. Yeah, yeah, totally.

1239
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,280
The CW's Frankenstein.

1240
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,800
He's in a bright blue shirt.

1241
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,800
They didn't shop out his nipple.

1242
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,760
It's poking through and also in front of a blue background.

1243
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,600
They got Cubans look.

1244
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:43,240
They engineered it a little better on a ventral shark tank and shark tank,

1245
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,760
obviously much more successful than the benefactor.

1246
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,200
The benefactor did not do so well.

1247
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:52,000
And in the wake of the show going away, Mr.

1248
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,400
Cuban received a letter.

1249
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,320
And I'd like you to guess during this letter who wrote the letter.

1250
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,120
Oh, dear Mark, if you have any suspicions.

1251
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,280
I might know.

1252
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,520
Bet a lot of money on your opinion on this.

1253
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,960
Dear Mark, I am truly sorry to hear that your show has been canceled

1254
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,600
for lack of ratings when I initially called you to congratulate you on the benefactor.

1255
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,080
Little did you or I realize how disastrous and embarrassing

1256
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,920
it would turn out to be for you.

1257
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,160
If you ever decide to do another show, please call me and I will be happy

1258
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,880
to lend a helping hand with best wishes.

1259
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,440
And then I'll narrow it down.

1260
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,840
The writer of this letter is a future president of the United States.

1261
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,400
So that gets you down to three and you can guess which one.

1262
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,280
Ron Paul. Yeah.

1263
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,360
We don't need to say it.

1264
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,520
That's yeah, that's right.

1265
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,440
That makes sense. That makes a lot of sense.

1266
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,240
It's on gold letterhead that might have helped you figure it out.

1267
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,600
This this is what this guy's doing in 2004.

1268
01:07:53,600 --> 01:08:01,000
And we we must elect him to the highest of this guy has to take control of the world.

1269
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,200
Yeah, no, that may it makes after having seen it for four years,

1270
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,160
it makes total sense that this it all makes sense.

1271
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,440
It had to happen. It was great that it happened.

1272
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,520
We all the America was made great again.

1273
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,720
So that's that's all my thoughts about this is how this is.

1274
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,360
This is quickly becoming that we're just going to have to do a part two of this

1275
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,360
because boy, oh boy, yeah, we're just going to have to do like land by land.

1276
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,040
This is only the street.

1277
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,040
Right. And then we'll do Paradise Pier 1.0.

1278
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,040
And maybe genuinely a solution because man, we're there.

1279
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,000
We got a lot here.

1280
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,680
Well, and we haven't even talked about my favorite part of Sunshine Plaza.

1281
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,360
Yeah, yes.

1282
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,880
I'm talking about Burbank Ice Cream.

1283
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,880
Maybe you threw me.

1284
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,440
I thought you were going to go for the sun.

1285
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,800
The sun's fear.

1286
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

1287
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,360
Oh, I think about Burbank Ice Cream, please.

1288
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:58,560
So Burbank Ice Cream was the like, you know, the the Sunshine Plaza.

1289
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,000
This is the equivalent of Main Street.

1290
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,560
So it's got to have an ice cream parlor to get people coming in

1291
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,840
or going out of the park at the end of the night.

1292
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:11,000
And it you entered through a California Zephyr like train car.

1293
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:16,640
And it's a it's a real like, you know, two sides of the train.

1294
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,080
I just think it looks great.

1295
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,760
It's a shiny like restored train car.

1296
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:28,520
And you went in and you got any any number of Disney's six ice cream flavors.

1297
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,480
They have not updated in, I don't know, decades.

1298
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,480
Like whatever the dryers relationship.

1299
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:38,120
I think when when Disney when when Disneyland opens back up,

1300
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,960
we need more ice cream flavors.

1301
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,840
It's it's the same flavor, the same seven or eight flavors.

1302
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:48,080
I know I I I wouldn't mind more flavors,

1303
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:52,880
but I do find the dryers flavors comforting that they don't change ever.

1304
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,680
There's something I like about the stability.

1305
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,400
And maybe I'm being a hypocrite when other things that I say.

1306
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,040
But I I'm not saying take any way.

1307
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,440
I'm saying, like, let's get it.

1308
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,000
Disneyland, it's supposed to be.

1309
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,400
Yeah, it's expand.

1310
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,120
And like, especially back then, they had four Sundays.

1311
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:07,840
Like, I don't know.

1312
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,520
It just seems like kind of all of the ice cream,

1313
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,240
except the ice cream at Paradise Pier, where you would pick a flavor ripple.

1314
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,720
Yeah, like everything is just chocolate vanilla in this part.

1315
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,800
Everything's what are you looking for?

1316
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,680
Yeah, like Blue Sky real quick here.

1317
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,800
Five, five to ten more flavors that they need to have.

1318
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:30,120
OK, well, I I think mocha almond fudge is an interesting flavor,

1319
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,760
but I found the almond overwhelming.

1320
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,560
I think they need a simple coffee flavor.

1321
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,680
OK, I think they need a rocky road.

1322
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:41,560
OK, OK, they have chocolate chip, which I think people think is crazy.

1323
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,440
A crazy like I love chocolate chip because you get the creaminess of vanilla,

1324
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,680
but then actual crispy chocolate. Right.

1325
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,840
Let me see some sort of caramel.

1326
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,160
OK, some sort of caramel.

1327
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:59,400
What else we get on the fruitier side or getting towards the gelato territory?

1328
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:05,320
Yeah, maybe a raspberry sorbet or a you get a sherbet.

1329
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,920
Mike, you get a I am.

1330
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,640
I got a sherbet, a rainbow sherbet,

1331
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:14,040
and I often get a double scoop with a cookie dough as well.

1332
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,120
That's good. They do a good cookie dough.

1333
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,080
And is cookies and cream on this list?

1334
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,760
They have cookies and cream, right?

1335
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,600
I guess they have cookies and cream.

1336
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,360
There's there's a big one that I feel like it's some sort of peanut butter thing.

1337
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,360
OK, yeah, that's good. I hear you.

1338
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,920
I think I just think more variety.

1339
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,400
I mean, I looked up the menu of San Andreas Shakes, too,

1340
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,080
which is a different part of the park.

1341
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,920
That was pretty much just like two kinds of blizzards

1342
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,800
and two kinds of milkshakes, chocolate or vanilla.

1343
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,080
Yeah, like that's that's kind of boring.

1344
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:55,840
Well, you can get date shakes there, I thought, like all on the way to Palm Springs.

1345
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,480
I forget the name of that date shake place, but I definitely at some point

1346
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,120
in time had a date shake in California Adventure.

1347
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,160
See now that I like I must have been looking at a newer menu where they scaled back.

1348
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,520
But I think like, yeah, date shakes. That's fun.

1349
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,840
Yeah, for sure.

1350
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,520
I don't know if it was there, but I definitely had one in the park.

1351
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,000
Does Ghirardelli do anything for you or do you want to do your land?

1352
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,000
OK, because we always go to Ghirardelli in California Adventure.

1353
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,760
Now, do they have enough? They're right.

1354
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,040
Does Ghirardelli have enough?

1355
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:30,200
Yeah, they have a lot of varieties of like parfaits and sundaes

1356
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,520
and maybe just one or two more ice cream flip.

1357
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,680
But they have they just have a lot and they have a lot of mix ins

1358
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,920
and they have a lot of toppings.

1359
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,560
So you want to just a little more convenience, essentially,

1360
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,240
because if they have it in California Adventure, you will.

1361
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,760
You just want something else on Main Street switched up.

1362
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,360
Yeah, I guess I guess on.

1363
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:53,080
Yeah, I don't I don't need it in California Adventure because there is Ghirardelli.

1364
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:57,200
But yes, at Main Street and at California Adventure now,

1365
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,360
they have the hand dipped ice cream bars, which that's fun.

1366
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,800
That's very nice. I like that.

1367
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,640
That's that's a huge two.

1368
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,080
I agree with you. Burbank, the Burbank.

1369
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:09,000
What is what is called Burbank ice cream? What was it called?

1370
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,240
Like so Burbank, Burbank ice cream.

1371
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,600
Burbank ice cream. The train cars were cool.

1372
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,800
I do miss getting ice cream in the train cars for by like that.

1373
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,560
But that area is, I think, the thing I miss the most of all.

1374
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,760
I think they pulled that off.

1375
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,080
If you're going to keep anything from this opening zone. Yeah.

1376
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,280
I remember being on the train.

1377
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,440
Yeah. A little disappointed when I went the first.

1378
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,000
I was like, oh, they got rid of the train cars. Oh, oh.

1379
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,000
Yeah. And that seems like something they easily could have moved

1380
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,880
to the Hollywood backlot area. Yeah.

1381
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,960
But yeah, I assume they were still.

1382
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,080
I think that the Hollywood backlot, yeah, they we've talked about it before.

1383
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,680
Like it's obviously going to be changed eventually.

1384
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,880
And I think they were probably assuming they would do something sooner

1385
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,960
rather than later.

1386
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,160
And they probably didn't see a pandemic slowing everything down either.

1387
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yes. We're stuck.

1388
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,800
We're stuck with it.

1389
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,320
I well, OK, you want to talk about, by the way,

1390
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,440
Disney's got to hire you for to be an ice cream consultant.

1391
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,720
Of course. That was so concise.

1392
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,360
Like great ideas. Just flying.

1393
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:14,040
You didn't even prep that. That's just off the dome. Yeah. Sure.

1394
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,240
Just walk around. Yeah.

1395
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,680
Like walk around like you would walk around with a team of people at Disney.

1396
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,040
And you would just sort of be giving your thoughts like very free.

1397
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,160
They'd be like kind of all have a notepad and they'd be hanging on every word.

1398
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,680
And you would just be shouting flavors, flavor every every different food

1399
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,720
stand in a restaurant.

1400
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,200
I think you would just shout things out and they would write it down

1401
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,680
and that you could fix a lot of problems that way.

1402
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,960
I feel like I was shouting a lot like looking at the map,

1403
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,440
like looking at the original DCA maps.

1404
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,800
And I was just then I would go look up what they had.

1405
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:50,400
And and I was just like, OK, the the will was not the thought was there.

1406
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,640
The will was not there.

1407
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,400
It's like like we want this to be a park for adults.

1408
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,400
We want then don't serve like dog food, like

1409
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,040
college, like food you would have thrown together in college.

1410
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,680
You know, food wasn't good there, was it?

1411
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,040
For like you think that's one of the main things and probably why I'm so

1412
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:13,120
for why I consider it like the park of my the park of my 20s

1413
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:17,360
in my early 30s is like you go there for good food and good beverage.

1414
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,760
Yeah, I don't. Yeah, it was kind of junky to begin with.

1415
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,320
I think Pacific Wharf was always interesting.

1416
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,200
It always had a variety of stuff.

1417
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,200
It was bread and it had some freshly made stuff.

1418
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,480
And then I I honestly have never eaten at that.

1419
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,600
Winery restaurant.

1420
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,000
The sit down restaurant, I don't recall loving.

1421
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,360
I'm I love the terrace and I love the walk of the walk away wine bar.

1422
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,960
But the yeah, it's kind of like generic Italian, I feel like.

1423
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,960
OK, she can get in a lot of place.

1424
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,200
I could be wrong if I'm if I'm way off on that place.

1425
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,360
I was just disappointed the one time I did it.

1426
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,120
I'm sure it's changed the menu like a million times at this point.

1427
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,200
So who knows? Yeah, yeah.

1428
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,680
Rough food, seemingly.

1429
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,000
The also the shout out to the restaurant was called Chips.

1430
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,960
It's strips, dips and chips.

1431
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,880
Yeah, strips, dips or chips.

1432
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,880
No one rides for free.

1433
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:19,520
That kind of the fried mozzarella and the chicken strips and fish fillet.

1434
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:25,640
So, you know, you know, it's I think, yeah, the train is good,

1435
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,240
but you know, it's egregious and I'll share the screen so we can be reminded.

1436
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:35,080
Engine ears, toys, city walk, real gaudy logo.

1437
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:39,800
Yeah, yes. Yeah, extremely city walky, extremely sock market sock market.

1438
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,880
You know, I think extremely build a bear and the bear went in

1439
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,560
not too long before this.

1440
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,080
And you can have that outside a theme park, but, you know, you need something.

1441
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,240
You know what else is this a lot like with that, like brightly painted

1442
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,720
corrugated metal this and forgive me for the local reference,

1443
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:02,040
but this is the Burbank Empire Center Big Time.

1444
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:06,680
Oh, yeah. Good functional place because they have a target and things.

1445
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:12,400
You need an REI and the sharkies, which I'm fine with, but ugly to look at

1446
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,040
and kind of gaudy off the five freeway.

1447
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,640
It's like at the most like like that's just a junkie.

1448
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,760
That's the most like kind of outlet mall.

1449
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,280
All right. Let's put up five tiny planes and that's enough. Right.

1450
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,400
And then this like real bright, like metal painted.

1451
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,320
Yeah, I don't like it.

1452
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,760
The only thing that caught me off after this Empire Center talk,

1453
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,560
the only thing I kind of like about the Empire Center is the light.

1454
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,080
Some decent lighting at night.

1455
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,800
Does it really? I'm rarely there at night, so I might not know this.

1456
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,160
Jason, you know what I'm talking about?

1457
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,080
I do know what you're talking about, and I think there are touches.

1458
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,080
They've they've painted over the the because that's where

1459
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:57,320
the Howard was it Lockheed Martin or Howard Hughes's aircraft factory was?

1460
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:02,840
So there's little touches of like this of like air airplane,

1461
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,920
airplane specifics, you know, the history of Burbank.

1462
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,480
But it's also it all sun faded over the years.

1463
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,720
It's so hard to tell.

1464
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,920
And then they just painted everything gray.

1465
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,200
So you can't really see anything now.

1466
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,120
That's their DCA two point.

1467
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,960
It's Empire Center to point out.

1468
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,360
Yeah. If you want us to cover this entire mall, let us know.

1469
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,520
Yes, we're fairly willing.

1470
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,320
Who are these? This place, we go back up.

1471
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,240
Who are those characters?

1472
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,560
They're not that they're generic toy.

1473
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:37,000
Like if you look up toy and like a visual dictionary, you see that.

1474
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:42,040
Right. There's a blue deer and not Raggedy Andy, a different

1475
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,040
red hair and not raggedy.

1476
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,160
Oh, it's a boy.

1477
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,560
Maybe a very generic just overalls that could be either way.

1478
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,600
A little like red dot cheeked

1479
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,760
top hat. No, it's a conductor bear.

1480
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:58,960
I don't like any of these guys.

1481
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,720
It is original theme park IP, I suppose, but I'm not not fond of them.

1482
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,880
I don't want to dig deeper.

1483
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,080
I well, if anybody knows if the engineer toys have names, please let us know.

1484
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,600
I am interested to know.

1485
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,880
It could say further in this article, I don't know.

1486
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,520
And then inside is just like this is what they had to do.

1487
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,800
They had to do the state like the classy 30s vibe on the way in

1488
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:26,480
because it just like, I don't know, it's like now it's like a beautiful overture

1489
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,400
before the film starts.

1490
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:33,560
And this is like a like the fourth generation AMC

1491
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:37,600
candy band where the graphics are getting actually worse with time.

1492
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,000
And they're they're more annoying.

1493
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,480
The little pre movie little little feature ads.

1494
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:45,960
Yeah, gross, right?

1495
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,240
Oh, and there's there's puns in here.

1496
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,960
El there's a clock.

1497
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,360
And when it's noon, it's not just noon, it's El Nuneo

1498
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,840
referencing the killer storm that this palm swings for some reason.

1499
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,560
Why swings? What's that?

1500
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,480
Rancho choo choo manga.

1501
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,720
This is where now we're getting into pun worlds.

1502
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,080
This really big bear lake.

1503
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,240
The lake looks like a bear.

1504
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,240
I mean, that's kind of cute.

1505
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,160
The lake looks like a bear.

1506
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,640
Some of these things, though,

1507
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,120
there's a lot of cute puns everywhere in every theme park.

1508
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:23,720
But it also often comes down to just what does the presentation look like?

1509
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,880
Like if this map was subtle

1510
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,840
and you really had to like look at it for like 15 seconds and go,

1511
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,920
oh, there's some funny things written on here.

1512
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,760
I don't think it's nearly as offensive as looking at this

1513
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:39,160
like barely graphic designed train map

1514
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,440
and seeing these like aggressive puns,

1515
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,240
seeing these aggressive, like lame jokes.

1516
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,840
Bad font. That's a stock font.

1517
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,760
That's maybe a copperfield black.

1518
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,360
No good.

1519
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:54,600
Now, I want luxury fonts when I go to my Disney parks.

1520
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,120
Yes, I agree.

1521
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,600
Blue ceiling. Look at this.

1522
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,480
I mean, this is just the ceiling here.

1523
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,640
They just painted all of the pipes and vents and everything bright blue.

1524
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:06,440
This absolutely is the Walmart in the Empire Center.

1525
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,240
Yeah. Yeah.

1526
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,960
Demand better out of your your Disney parks.

1527
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,080
Mm hmm.

1528
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:17,440
Now, I pulled up that website too, and it does not have one thing that I do like

1529
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:25,640
from DCA 1.0, which is they made replica little miniature toys

1530
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:30,440
of some of the, you know, simple attractions.

1531
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:37,120
And these toys in box still go for like two hundred or a hundred dollars on eBay,

1532
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,200
because I don't think a lot of people bought them.

1533
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,720
I would get one of these.

1534
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:47,400
I can see having a little orange stinger, the hollowed out orange ride.

1535
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,000
Maybe I'd buy this. I don't know.

1536
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,040
They're like a hundred bucks.

1537
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,520
Hmm. That's not crazy.

1538
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:56,600
I found one that I well, I was going to get it.

1539
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,600
And then it said like broken does not work.

1540
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,320
Parts may fall off.

1541
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,760
And I was like, OK, well, if you glue it, if it's cheap and you can glue it.

1542
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,840
I guess so. I'll see if it's still up for sale.

1543
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,680
Yeah. You want to talk about the sun?

1544
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,720
Not the sun wheel.

1545
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:18,960
The Ferris wheel used to have a big scary sun on it, not Mickey. Right.

1546
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,840
And that was the sun wheel.

1547
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:27,200
But when you come into the park and Sunshine Plaza is the sun icon.

1548
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,400
The creatively you've got the Sleeping Beauty's castle,

1549
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,720
you get Spaceship Earth and you've got the sun icon.

1550
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,840
And this was intended to be there.

1551
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,800
Here is the big landmark.

1552
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,120
When you go into that opening street and what is it at the end of the road for you?

1553
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,480
It's a big tin sun.

1554
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:50,280
This is where they really, really messed up bad.

1555
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:56,640
Yeah, it's it's just not I would even say it's not memorable.

1556
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,520
I like I'm sure the first five, ten times I went.

1557
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,960
I might not have even like go, well, what was the icon you saw?

1558
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,520
And I go, oh, I'm not sure.

1559
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,440
Didn't do one. I think they didn't do.

1560
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,760
And yeah, they didn't do that.

1561
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,080
Must be. They didn't do well, isn't.

1562
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,720
But they had the sun thing and then the wolf like the big stone.

1563
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,880
Like they kind of had two icons. They got to split the difference.

1564
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,120
It's not a we've been.

1565
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,480
Yeah, it's not a wolf. Oh, it's a bear.

1566
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:28,000
It's a grizzly. I had a thought I had it reversed.

1567
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,960
I was like, and remember, Jason, it's not the thing you think it is.

1568
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,320
Not a bear. It's a wolf.

1569
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,160
I was like, was there a stone wolf

1570
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,160
bear howling at the sun under it?

1571
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:38,400
And I was like, maybe there was.

1572
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,840
And I like scrambling the look, I go, oh, shit, I forgot.

1573
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:44,920
There was a stone wolf that was like, I always thought it was a wolf.

1574
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,360
I thought the squint to see the bear.

1575
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:50,640
Well, yeah, we we are the grizzly river rapids episode.

1576
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,240
We all there was some confusion about what it looks like.

1577
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,120
Yeah, which is a price that was also supposed to be kind of their icon.

1578
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,040
And you're not sure what it is.

1579
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,480
Yeah, it was kind of painted worse when it opened to.

1580
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,320
I feel like, yeah, this is a mess.

1581
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:10,960
But the sun icon clearly could not have been the the the

1582
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,320
main thing that you draw from the park.

1583
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,560
Here's the big thing you see when you come in the park.

1584
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,960
It doesn't work.

1585
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,360
Also, the whole idea is that it was going to reflect the light of the sun

1586
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,280
and make it nice and warm and glowy in this area.

1587
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,200
Through all through Sunshine Plaza.

1588
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,560
I don't remember any of this that but they they it was painted.

1589
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,480
There was pointed the wrong way, like to where it wouldn't get the sun

1590
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,800
where how it was supposed to to make it glow.

1591
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:42,400
So they had to use big reflector machines

1592
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:47,400
that were up on poles to hopefully bounce the sunlight off of the it.

1593
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:53,360
It bounces off of that and bounces on to the sun, which it did not do.

1594
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,600
This never worked.

1595
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,680
So it just kind of looked flat and bad here all the time.

1596
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:01,640
Yeah, I did not know that's what they were trying to do.

1597
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,760
That didn't I see now those the things I think the things that was trying to reflect.

1598
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,720
Yeah, no, that never read to me at all.

1599
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,800
This thing isn't also for all the other icons of Disney parks.

1600
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,360
This isn't even that big.

1601
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,640
It's really small.

1602
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,920
Yeah, at least do something big like if it was, you know,

1603
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,040
you know what the story there is, is this this is from this is a Westcott

1604
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:28,360
holdover that they were not going to do Spaceship Earth again.

1605
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:32,640
They were going to do a big golden spire, and that was going to be extremely tall,

1606
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:37,120
probably as tall as the Tower of Terror.

1607
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:41,280
Guardians is now, but because it was going to be really bright.

1608
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,840
And I think maybe the relationship with Anaheim was just not good at the time.

1609
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:48,080
And the neighbors were like, no, no, no, we're not going to have a big pointy light.

1610
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,320
That sounds terrible.

1611
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,960
So they're like, all right, well, we got to do something small then,

1612
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,840
because that was even that was going to be in Westcott

1613
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,400
and it was going to be in California Adventure.

1614
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:59,600
Like the big point, the golden point was still part of the plan.

1615
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,200
Right. And instead it became what a lot of people called the hubcap.

1616
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,280
It was a cool little hubcap.

1617
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,600
Yeah, it's it's yeah, it's just

1618
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:12,360
I'm trying to think like, say it was say it was the exact same design,

1619
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,720
but it was five times the size.

1620
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,640
I think at the very least, I think we would all be saying

1621
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,600
if it would have been gone away by now.

1622
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,080
Well, you know, it was kind of cool because how big it was.

1623
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,400
I think we would have given it that praise.

1624
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:28,200
Like, oh, well, you know, it was impressive that this giant sort of sun thing.

1625
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:32,080
It's not aesthetically pleasing to me, but at the very least, like, wow,

1626
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:36,320
it really impressed me when I'd walk in and go, wow, that is that's huge. Wow.

1627
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,240
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1628
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,400
Just make it big. What are you doing?

1629
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:46,480
Yeah, this is all what really it's just like a really tepid, flaccid way

1630
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,760
to start your day in the in the park.

1631
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,920
And I will also add, because I'm seeing this in the photos of sunshine

1632
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,880
Plaza that you also then are.

1633
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:03,360
So you can turn to the left and go over to the Hollywood area.

1634
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:07,480
And at that time, it said Hollywood really big at the top.

1635
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,360
And then there were these big elephants.

1636
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,400
And the elephants are there because you're like,

1637
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,800
why giant elephants on top of pedestals?

1638
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,320
Well, that, of course, is a reference to D.W.

1639
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:24,280
Griffith's film, Intolerance. Yes.

1640
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,920
What? Why? Why?

1641
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,800
And of course, those elephants also appear at, let's all say it together.

1642
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:33,520
The Hollywood and Highland Shopping Complex.

1643
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,760
Yes. Which will open, I think.

1644
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,600
Well, was it before this or after?

1645
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,880
I was right around the same time.

1646
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:43,600
So you're like, why are there two two things felt the need

1647
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,440
to tribute D.W. Griffith's Intolerance?

1648
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,720
I want to say Hollywood Pictures.

1649
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,240
So not Disney Studio.

1650
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:53,960
This is a fake back lot called Hollywood Pictures.

1651
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,840
Hollywood Pictures back lot.

1652
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,200
Yes. Which seems like something you would get on a T-shirt

1653
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:03,720
at Hollywood and Highland for like three T-shirts for twenty dollars.

1654
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,200
That's truly the tribute.

1655
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:10,240
The tribute is gift shop at Hollywood and Highland at City Walk

1656
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,840
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1657
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,240
That's really the true inspiration for California Adventure.

1658
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:18,440
Is that tacky tourist trap garbage?

1659
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,400
Yeah, yeah.

1660
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:25,880
I think that whole I mean, you know, Hollywood is sort of its own thing.

1661
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:29,400
You could almost devote a whole episode to, but that then you just

1662
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,360
you just keep staring down that way.

1663
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:36,520
And I boy, I've always hated that fake sky backdrop

1664
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,320
with the forced perspective where the city gets smaller and smaller,

1665
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,880
which is weird because I really liked it in MGM Studios.

1666
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,640
I remember thinking that was so neat as a kid.

1667
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,960
Oh, you mean so they all like to make a street look really long.

1668
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,400
They'll make the buildings get smaller and smaller.

1669
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,880
And I wanted pictures in front of it.

1670
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,120
I thought it was so cool. This one's worse.

1671
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:55,840
Why is it where it's still to this day, I think, is just too

1672
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,240
executed and too tacky of a way.

1673
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,760
Yeah, it just stands out.

1674
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,640
It's like almost it just stands out more.

1675
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:07,080
I think I really like it's I'm trying to think the MGM one isn't so.

1676
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:09,640
I don't know. This one's just in your face.

1677
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:13,080
The one in California is just in your face and your brain doesn't get

1678
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,400
tricked at all ever.

1679
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,000
No, no, no, no.

1680
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,680
Yeah, there's never a second where you go.

1681
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,240
That's sky. That's real.

1682
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,600
Like it never happens. Yeah. Yeah.

1683
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,320
So it's just odd. It just looks odd.

1684
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,000
You also in in this neck of the woods, this is pun central,

1685
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,920
and it still kind of is this way.

1686
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,680
There still is a lot of this isn't like is schmooze is still there.

1687
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,560
Yes. Oh, yes, it is.

1688
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,320
Exist. Yeah, okay.

1689
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:39,960
Yeah. War.

1690
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,400
War. Winners certainly.

1691
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,240
Where do we go there? Yes.

1692
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:48,720
Yeah. But there's other stuff they got rid of because I think there I think

1693
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,200
there were like 10 times the puns.

1694
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:54,520
Yeah. In this neck of the woods, if anybody has any of them.

1695
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:59,240
The thing that they got a lot of trouble with was there was a sign of like

1696
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,440
about like a casting couch joke.

1697
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1698
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,280
2000. What are like?

1699
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,720
What are you doing?

1700
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,320
I missed this 100 percent when it happened.

1701
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,280
I found out about this today.

1702
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,360
Philip, a couch casting agency.

1703
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:19,320
It is a casting couch reference and it is on a sign that looks like a penis.

1704
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,520
It is. Oh, yeah.

1705
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,760
Do you guys do you remember that?

1706
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,120
I don't know. That's intentional.

1707
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:25,400
I remember that I remembered.

1708
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,760
Oh, my God. You're right.

1709
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,160
Yep. There's a little tip at the bottom and there's two little swirly's up at the top.

1710
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,000
Damn. Yeah. Yes.

1711
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,800
That is not a stretch at all, by the way.

1712
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,880
Sometimes you see the Disney's phallic imagery and you go, well, kind of.

1713
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,560
That one, there's no mistaking it.

1714
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,840
That is a dick sign.

1715
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:47,640
Yeah. About a casting and then this was they put this in in the era

1716
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:52,600
where they owned Miramax and worked closely with Harvey Weinstein.

1717
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:57,200
Yeah. There's so much stuff as you go through, like old clips of late

1718
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:01,520
night talk shows and stand up monologues and stuff where people are making jokes,

1719
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:05,760
stuff like that. And then if you really like analyze it, you go, hey, that's fucked up.

1720
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,440
I don't know why we were all just like, oh, the casting couch.

1721
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,440
Oh, we all know it exists like that was.

1722
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:17,440
I might have been kind of conditioned by seeing like Oscar monologue jokes like that.

1723
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:22,400
And I think as a like ignorant 15 year old, I'm like, oh, that's where the producer

1724
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:26,400
wants to give you a smooch. And then you get I don't I really don't think I was aware

1725
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,640
of like what that actually means.

1726
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,320
And I don't know.

1727
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:32,400
You know, I don't think anyone knew the truly the extent of it until.

1728
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,800
I mean, obviously, it's it's so crazy and horrible.

1729
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:39,720
But yeah, how insane that that was like cutified for so many years.

1730
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,160
And it's not even like hidden.

1731
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:44,760
I would I would actually give it like I would give like the Imagineers like credit

1732
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:49,760
for like really sneaking one in if I go, oh, I see if you combine the last letters

1733
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,320
of each word, then it forms casting.

1734
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,960
I go, well, they really snuck it in there.

1735
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:56,440
So there's no way you like you would know if you just walked by it.

1736
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,720
Not this sign.

1737
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:01,760
This sign is just casting advertising a penis.

1738
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,920
It's wild. So crazy.

1739
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:07,000
Yeah, this is kind of underratedly one of the craziest things

1740
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,800
it's ever been in a in a park and the even if it was different words,

1741
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,720
the very blatant penis shape.

1742
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,520
Yeah, yeah, really. Yeah.

1743
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,680
It should be award winners. Let's be honest.

1744
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,200
It should be right.

1745
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,400
If that was a penis shape, I don't think that would.

1746
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,400
Oh, my God. I would love it.

1747
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,600
I go, you know, the award winners, we can get a hot dog.

1748
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,160
The sign is shaped like a giant dick.

1749
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,040
And I'd be like, that's funny. That's good.

1750
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,560
I like that.

1751
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,120
Good work, Imagineers.

1752
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,320
Is there anything else worth calling out in this neck of the woods

1753
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,560
in terms of the puns?

1754
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,120
Yeah. Dial M for muscle.

1755
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,240
Ben hair.

1756
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,640
I do. I've said this maybe three times now on the show, but

1757
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:51,880
I do maintain if the place looked less tacky,

1758
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,080
those puns would be less egregious.

1759
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:58,000
This is one of the tackiest looking places it still is.

1760
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,040
A lot of the fonts are bad. It's very dated.

1761
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,360
I mean, you go around Tokyo, Disney Sea and Tokyo,

1762
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:08,640
Disney Sea is so much subtlety in their theming and jokes and puns.

1763
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:13,120
Like there are just dense paragraphs full of jokes

1764
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,440
on the side of like the where you pick up the train to go around the park

1765
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,400
and even in the different eateries.

1766
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,040
Like we were finding just so much information

1767
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:26,000
that was just all jokes about where we were.

1768
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,360
But it's so subtle and it was not and it was, as you're saying, a classy font.

1769
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:35,040
And really like just fully developed immersive environments.

1770
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,760
Yeah, you'll go to Jungle Cruise in general.

1771
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,800
You will go with grown worthy stuff. Right.

1772
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:43,360
And if you.

1773
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,280
Hey, everything is context, you know, jokes don't need to be so clever.

1774
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,400
It just needs to be in the right context.

1775
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,120
That's my comedy lesson.

1776
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:53,960
Yeah, you're welcome, everyone.

1777
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,200
Pretend you're in the car next to Jerry.

1778
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,400
Yes, yes, he would.

1779
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,400
And that's the West End.

1780
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,800
Yes, make fun of waitresses more.

1781
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,800
It's interesting the way this area is presented on the map.

1782
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,240
It's like one of the attractions and ventures.

1783
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:17,880
It just says Hyperion Theater, Magnificent 2000 seat theater.

1784
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,760
That's it.

1785
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,640
Like, what's in it?

1786
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:24,600
Yeah, that's good for you guys for building a place

1787
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:28,960
where you can do corporate events that no one will ever see.

1788
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:33,000
Where you can make a confusingly cut out front of a stage

1789
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,520
that Kelsey Grammer can very easily fall into.

1790
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,160
That's right. Yeah.

1791
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,360
It was waiting to happen.

1792
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,960
It's not Kelsey's fault.

1793
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,640
No, at all. No, no.

1794
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:46,480
It was a very specific, specifically designed stage.

1795
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,960
They did have the Muppets back here.

1796
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,960
And I used to really like that kiosk outside of it

1797
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,760
that had a ton of Muppets stuff.

1798
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,400
And I was just kind of like swing merchant, like whatever merchandise

1799
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,480
they want to shove in there.

1800
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:02,080
Yeah. Oh, and this Christmas thing, it's so many spider bots

1801
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,560
that nobody's fighting on. Oh, no.

1802
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,080
Just tons of spider.

1803
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:09,800
They better hope we fall in love with the spider bots when that ride opens.

1804
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:13,720
Because they, I bet there's like the ninety nine cent stores

1805
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,360
have spider bots at this point.

1806
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,800
They made so many.

1807
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,120
They're just selling them to any different store.

1808
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,480
As legacy pass holders, are we gifted a complimentary spider bot?

1809
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,040
Thirty percent off.

1810
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,840
Thirty percent off Monday through Thursday, Monday through Thursday.

1811
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,640
Not every day.

1812
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:33,600
Parking is not included on the high end passes anymore.

1813
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,880
It's it's a hundred dollars each time you come.

1814
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,440
But you get a 30 percent off spider bot.

1815
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,560
Yes. Thank you, sir.

1816
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:44,840
May I have another shape and shape back the hut?

1817
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,360
I have a general pitch for what we do here and now.

1818
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:51,720
And it is this.

1819
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:54,200
I think I have a plan because this episode could go for

1820
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,760
the full amount of time that we've already done.

1821
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,040
What if maybe the way that we section off, what if we what if there's

1822
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:05,400
a an episode that is about you call it DCA 1.0 to Paradise Pier?

1823
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,160
We leave Paradise Pier.

1824
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,360
That's our general tribute to what Paradise Pier used to be,

1825
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,920
because there's so many rides over there.

1826
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:15,160
Yes. Yes. I think there might be enough.

1827
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:18,560
So maybe that's where we that's the cutoff.

1828
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:23,000
But we try to, you know, let's cover Hollywood and then let's.

1829
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:24,880
I mean, what a beautiful.

1830
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,480
What more beautiful ending than Bountiful Valley Farm?

1831
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,200
Of course.

1832
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:33,040
So so for this episode, we will try to conquer.

1833
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,600
Let me if I have this correct.

1834
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,680
Not Paradise Pier, Golden State.

1835
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,960
I suppose. Well, is Golden State where what's Golden State?

1836
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:50,040
OK, Golden State is one of four districts.

1837
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:54,440
That's how the Anaheim Tourism Board described it in the early days.

1838
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,080
It's not lands, it's districts.

1839
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:00,440
But it's a district, but it's got six different areas.

1840
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:05,200
What's the difference between a district and an area?

1841
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:09,760
So Bountiful Valley Farms,

1842
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,320
Pacific Wharf, Golden Vine Winery, Condor Flats,

1843
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:21,320
the Bay Area and Grizzly Peak Recreation Area.

1844
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:28,600
So that's a lot to explain to someone, I feel like.

1845
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,560
I agree. Yeah, very complicated.

1846
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:36,480
And a lot of those things you just described are like, you know, 20 feet wide.

1847
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:39,840
Those aren't that's not big enough to be an area.

1848
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:42,400
Yeah. So yes. All right.

1849
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,120
So what are we doing?

1850
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:46,120
So, yeah, I don't know where we're going now.

1851
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:48,920
We're as confused as if we're looking on an original map.

1852
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,040
I don't know what's going on.

1853
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:53,880
I think.

1854
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,120
Wait, is this is this behind the scenes or is this?

1855
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,200
No, I think this is on.

1856
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,960
Oh, we're on the air. We're on the air.

1857
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,920
We're live. We're live.

1858
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:03,400
This is live. Oh, no. Yeah.

1859
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:08,640
I think I'm getting in a Bountiful Valley Farms tractor and getting the F out of here.

1860
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:13,080
I mean, maybe it's that maybe because there's so like so many of the puns remain,

1861
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:19,200
I feel like in in the you know, I think we have to leave Route 66 out,

1862
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,960
which is a shame because that's where so much the rust with the SS

1863
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,080
rust worthy burger invasion.

1864
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,480
But that's that's good.

1865
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:27,440
You know, those are good.

1866
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,480
We need to lead you into the next episode.

1867
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,600
Are we done or are we do have more?

1868
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,880
I'm good. No, no, no. I think we do Bountiful Valley.

1869
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,040
Oh, OK.

1870
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,440
Bountiful Valley Farm. And then we're done. Got it.

1871
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,520
I think so.

1872
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,680
How long have we been going?

1873
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,600
I think I'm going to collapse if we don't.

1874
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,120
Yeah, yeah, I'm good with that. OK.

1875
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,680
I'm good to be there. I don't care.

1876
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:49,680
Well, we'll do DCA one point

1877
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:54,000
oh dot two like a software update.

1878
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,280
Yes, yes.

1879
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:59,680
Like a software update that a great California visionary like Steve Jobs

1880
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:05,240
would give you covering much of Golden State and Paradise Pier.

1881
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,680
But yeah, that's a good way to do it.

1882
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,440
OK, OK. Good.

1883
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:11,280
And so but yeah, let's talk about Bountiful Valley Farm.

1884
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,960
Oh, yeah, we got if you go if you go past

1885
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,000
the sun item.

1886
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,400
This is the first thing you see on your left is Bountiful Valley Farm.

1887
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:30,000
And now this yeah, and this really tripped me out when I was watching the

1888
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:35,200
in general, very difficult to watch opening special with Richard

1889
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:38,760
Kind and Barry Bostwick right around the same stretch of time.

1890
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:42,000
I for the first time, embarrassingly, had not seen before this

1891
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:45,320
a serious man, the very good. Oh, yeah.

1892
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:46,760
Like one of my favorites. Yes.

1893
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,240
Really, really liked it. Yeah.

1894
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:53,600
And then and so going the whiplash of wow, Richard Kind is wonderful in this.

1895
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:58,240
And then he's also in like a bright yellow Hawaiian shirt

1896
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:03,040
bumbling around with Barry Bostwick and convincing us that the amount of rides

1897
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:08,240
is fine and the Bountiful Valley Farm is good enough to be an area.

1898
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,640
But I think of all the things

1899
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:13,200
like some things are burning in my memory.

1900
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,440
Of course, I know there was a big orange.

1901
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,720
Of course, I knew there was a big, scary sun face.

1902
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:20,120
But when they are walking through this farm zone and I'm like,

1903
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:22,280
oh, my God, no, Bugsland.

1904
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:26,480
I did not like because then there was kind of an in-between.

1905
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,280
There was there was some farm and then Bugsland.

1906
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:33,480
But oh, my God, when there was no Bugsland, what was even happening?

1907
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:37,840
What was this park? Yeah, I thought Bugsland was opening day.

1908
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,160
I if you would have if you would have asked me like five days ago,

1909
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:44,440
I would have said, oh, yeah, Bugsland open opening day. Right.

1910
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,040
But no, like a long time ago.

1911
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,920
And it felt like still for being an addition,

1912
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,760
chintzy enough that they had to take it out eventually.

1913
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:55,920
Like it felt like temp or expendable or something.

1914
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,880
This is like as good as like all the stuff in here is like as good as like

1915
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,440
this place, Gobert's Pumpkin Farm that I used to go to as a child.

1916
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,280
And that's a good point, because I was going to say as a child,

1917
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:13,280
I love trucks and tractors and trail like I loved all that stuff.

1918
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:17,200
So getting to climb on one of those again, the instinct is correct.

1919
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:21,320
Children like climbing on construction. Right. Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1920
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:24,840
But it's it's not enough. It's just not enough. What is it?

1921
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:28,760
Yeah. What is it doing here? Why was it here before?

1922
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:32,200
And they built around it like that's the way it feels to me

1923
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,200
when I look at these pictures like there was a farm.

1924
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,400
They bought up all the land.

1925
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:43,360
But there was just this one miniature farm where they like wouldn't really.

1926
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,760
So like you have to still let us raise some crops.

1927
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,960
That's the only way we're going to kind of give you the rest of this.

1928
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,920
Like living with the land in Epcot, there's crops, but it's, you know,

1929
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,480
we're in a facility of some kind and there's windows and there's, you know,

1930
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:58,520
experiments going on and you're in a boat. It's themed.

1931
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:04,000
This is truly like they built an OK theme park around a little plot of land

1932
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,480
where they're growing lemons.

1933
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,640
Yeah. What are the crops?

1934
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:13,240
Let's I see some some Valencia oranges.

1935
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:16,680
Those look nice. Some nice, beautiful flowers.

1936
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:22,640
There is they don't there are no cattle there, but there's some plastic

1937
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:27,240
cows. Maybe be helpful to just maybe we'll all screen share this yesterlain

1938
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:33,600
page. You know, it's extremely it's a

1939
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:38,280
state fair display and you would love to see it there, but in a theme park.

1940
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:41,080
What do you mean? It's so strange.

1941
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,560
Yeah. And it's like they had, you know, when they had the pettings,

1942
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:46,080
they have a petting zoo at this point in Disneyland.

1943
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,560
They have a petting zoo.

1944
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:50,960
They have real animals in the back of Disneyland.

1945
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:55,360
So like you come over here and you go, oh, there's some shitty plastic cows.

1946
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,360
There's two shitty plastic cows. I just saw a goat. I just saw.

1947
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:02,680
I saw a horse. I just saw what's the they would.

1948
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,880
They have a cow as well. Or what was the big?

1949
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,000
Sometimes there'd be a cow.

1950
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,960
Yeah. I'll lift my hand once. Yeah.

1951
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,880
A cow like Jason's hand.

1952
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:12,400
You can't get that over here with these plastic cows.

1953
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
But what you can get is the Bountiful Valley Farmers Market.

1954
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,280
And you know what they have?

1955
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:22,960
Healthy wraps, the healthiest food of the 1990s.

1956
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,440
Wraps. Yeah.

1957
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,400
We get convinced on wraps.

1958
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:31,080
And why did they why did everybody pretend they were OK to eat,

1959
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,720
that they had any taste?

1960
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:36,720
I haven't had a wrap in so long, and it makes me feel great.

1961
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:42,040
Yeah, I I liked like buffalo chicken wraps if they were freshly made,

1962
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:45,320
because if you wrap a wrap up and put it in like an airport

1963
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:49,800
refrigerated cooler thing, nothing congeals faster than a wrap.

1964
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,640
That's it. It's like a it's a mayonnaise trap.

1965
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,680
It like it's a way to like hide it and condense it.

1966
01:43:55,680 --> 01:44:00,200
So then once you bite into that reserve, that spoiled reserve, everything,

1967
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,800
everything switches texture like 10.

1968
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,680
Everything's entropy is reverse.

1969
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:08,960
It's just like, oh, no, it's transforming.

1970
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:12,840
No, I feel like this is another one of the things where I've talked about

1971
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:16,720
a vitamin water trick to me, like a number of things trick to me.

1972
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,920
And like wraps, I go to Togo's and get like what Jason said,

1973
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:23,640
some buffalo chicken wrap and I go, this is healthier.

1974
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:25,600
I'm eating pretty healthier.

1975
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,680
If you really looked, it was like the wrap was like 70 less calories

1976
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,440
than the bread.

1977
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,600
Yeah, exactly. So fine.

1978
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,720
Less carbs.

1979
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:36,320
We were all tricked by whole wheat.

1980
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,400
They're right. Oh, I never went all in.

1981
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,040
I did. I was wheat for years.

1982
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:40,920
You did. I was.

1983
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:43,600
You gave me for buying white bread and sourdough bread.

1984
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,880
I'm so sorry. I was wrong.

1985
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,320
Wheat is bad. I didn't know.

1986
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,640
It was like that was something I would get wheat

1987
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:53,840
and I would get a little spring in my step and be like, well, healthy boy.

1988
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,000
Look what you did today.

1989
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,560
And they're just shoving molasses or corn syrup in there to make it like.

1990
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:03,040
Monsanto is killing us slowly with their wheat.

1991
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,120
Got it. Unbelievable.

1992
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:08,240
We all know we look we all watched Super Size Me 2, Holy Chicken.

1993
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:11,320
Of course we know what the industry is doing.

1994
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,320
A DCA exclusive.

1995
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,440
It could have been that could have been a theme for film. Yes.

1996
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,440
But, you know, they don't forsake that you can go, as you said,

1997
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,800
you go get on a tractor.

1998
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:29,520
They did work with they got Caterpillar

1999
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:33,400
tractors involved in.

2000
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,960
You learn about in signs about

2001
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:39,400
tractor makers, Benjamin Holt and Daniel Best.

2002
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:43,960
Mommy, I learned about Daniel Best today.

2003
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,280
I don't can you get on the track now?

2004
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:48,920
I'm questioning this.

2005
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,720
I don't see any pictures of kids in a tractor.

2006
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,640
Yeah, I swear you could at least get in the cab, but maybe.

2007
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:58,760
I'm misremembering or maybe that was all they would let me do.

2008
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:01,440
Because I'm a 20 year old college student.

2009
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:04,680
You're young enough. We'll let you do it. Yeah.

2010
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,080
No, no, no. Wait, wait. Climb into the cab. OK. Yeah.

2011
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,760
Yeah. Like Trump in the big, big.

2012
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,120
You know, lots of unhappy memories, but, you know, it's nice to think about

2013
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:21,280
the trend, the truck part.

2014
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,320
The one nice day.

2015
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:26,680
Boundable Valley, it was the home of San Andreas Shakes.

2016
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,480
And that is another thing.

2017
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:32,880
I think it is sometimes hard in theme parks, not at this one,

2018
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,640
because a Ghirardelli, you can get them.

2019
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:37,600
But every now and then I'm like, I want a milkshake.

2020
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:41,360
And it's not as easy to like dig one up as you think.

2021
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,960
And if you. Yeah. Yeah.

2022
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:46,400
Because you can eat, you can just drink it, drink it and walk.

2023
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,520
But I think I was there in like 2015 or 2016.

2024
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:52,600
And I was like, is San Andreas Shakes still around?

2025
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,320
And I'm like, no, what are you talking about?

2026
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,040
Like, what is the mountain now?

2027
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:56,720
I've had the same.

2028
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:59,240
I too recently have thought those were there.

2029
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:00,640
And you're right. They were good.

2030
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:04,280
And I looked it up and it is date was like a topping.

2031
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,280
OK. You know, of course, it's the oh, you know what?

2032
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:12,800
It's in its Sam Andreas because it's a guy or at least the sign says.

2033
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,200
Yeah. So we're even deeper into pun.

2034
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:17,080
The pun extends deeper than we thought.

2035
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:18,960
And they're called shakers.

2036
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,080
And then there's.

2037
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,120
Wait, this is Tim Blore talk.

2038
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:25,160
Oh, well, Tim Blore, that was their blizzard.

2039
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,760
That was their version of a blizzard.

2040
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:29,240
Not tremble or Tim Blore.

2041
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,760
I don't quite understand that pun.

2042
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,520
I think it's wordplay and it's just missing the mark.

2043
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,640
Yeah, I can't even just misspell it.

2044
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,400
That would be funny if they misspelled it.

2045
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,720
I got to give it a guy, Selga, in his like recap.

2046
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:47,520
I think he was the one who posted like the very old map on touring plans

2047
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:52,560
a blog referred to this area as the worst land Disney has ever done.

2048
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:57,520
I mean, yeah, but now I'm worried somebody out there is going to be like,

2049
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:00,440
wait, I love Bountiful Valley Farm.

2050
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:02,960
I like watching the crops grow out there.

2051
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:09,120
You I'm so like shy to be insulting to crops at this point that I.

2052
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:11,080
Oh, yeah. I don't want to step in it again.

2053
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:12,120
Well, let's see.

2054
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:15,880
If you're a big stand for this part of the park, please let us know.

2055
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:16,680
And you know what?

2056
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:19,600
Don't tag our show account, tag Scott's Twitter account.

2057
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,120
We don't need to see it.

2058
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:24,960
Just send it to Scott.

2059
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:28,000
Look, I became I'm no longer Scott Gardner anyway.

2060
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,640
I'm Mr. Viral Questions.

2061
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:32,520
My account is devoted to asking the questions

2062
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:35,200
that the most burning questions that go the most viral.

2063
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,160
So I can't even respond.

2064
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:39,040
That's not what my account does anymore.

2065
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,520
OK, so you won't get nothing out of me.

2066
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,040
I'm not afraid of you.

2067
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,760
I'm Mr. Viral Questions now.

2068
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:49,760
OK. So, yeah, just I'll

2069
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:53,880
DM me, I'll send you Scott's physical address.

2070
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,520
Shit. No, no, fine.

2071
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,600
All right. Do whatever you got to do.

2072
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,000
Mike's going to do it, I swear.

2073
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,600
We'll do it. Yeah.

2074
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,560
I yeah, this is bad.

2075
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:11,720
You know, and then they kind of tied it into Bugsland and made it

2076
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:14,080
like they put Heimlich run around.

2077
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:17,240
And then there's kind of a slow gradient into Bugsland.

2078
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:20,960
And that was better, but still weird.

2079
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:25,400
I now I want to I didn't look at the yesterlain page for Santa Rosa

2080
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:27,320
seed and supply.

2081
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:30,400
This is did you look into this before?

2082
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,760
Do we have to discover Santa Rosa?

2083
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:35,080
I knew you get like seeds and stuff, right?

2084
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:38,040
You could buy seeds in the theme park.

2085
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:42,480
I think so. I think you can still get seeds at a grizzly peak at that.

2086
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,920
Can you still buy seeds?

2087
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:50,120
I think that like one one of their displays, like a couple of years ago or so,

2088
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,360
when they were leaning into the national park motif.

2089
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:54,720
No, I will give them credit.

2090
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:57,000
Buying seeds in the park is cool, I think.

2091
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,760
That's the only one of those 1955.

2092
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,000
Yeah. Yeah.

2093
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,200
Something you shouldn't need to buy at a park or like there's no reason for it.

2094
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:09,520
I like it when they sell it in a park and in only maybe one or two areas,

2095
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:13,560
especially if it's high, like specialized to one theme from theme gift shop.

2096
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:16,000
See, I can always use seeds.

2097
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,360
I've mostly just been planting those seeds that showed up in an Amazon box

2098
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,480
a couple of times and I just played at those all over California.

2099
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:24,600
Wait, what is that?

2100
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:28,640
Oh, that was the there was an oddly enough news story a while back,

2101
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:32,840
I think last year that like people who had placed Amazon orders,

2102
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:35,240
it was like some sort of drop shipping bullshit mix up.

2103
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:39,080
We're just getting like there would be a bag of seeds in with their like

2104
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,560
Oh, yeah.

2105
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,920
What are the seeds?

2106
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,520
Stay away from the seeds.

2107
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:45,640
God, that was feels like forever ago.

2108
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:49,680
Yeah. And the FDA was or whoever regulates that was just like,

2109
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,720
do not plant the seeds, please.

2110
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:53,760
Did I?

2111
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:55,720
We really were too late.

2112
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:59,680
But have I told the Neil Young story about the concert with the seeds before?

2113
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:01,480
I feel you might have.

2114
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:03,000
I'm worried. It sounds familiar.

2115
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,360
But maybe it was it on air or other.

2116
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:05,720
I can't remember. Real quick.

2117
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:07,680
I saw Neil Young. He played at the forum.

2118
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:12,200
The first four songs he plays like after the gold rush, Old Man.

2119
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,080
He sounds fantastic.

2120
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,560
These songs are like you're getting chills are so good.

2121
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:19,840
And then all of a sudden, after four songs, he has people in hazmat suits

2122
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,160
come out and like spray down the stage.

2123
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:26,000
And then it's like he brings out Willie Nelson's sons who he was playing with.

2124
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:28,760
And they're like great players and they're playing new stuff.

2125
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,520
And then Neil hands out like seeds to the audience

2126
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,800
because he's trying to make an environmental message.

2127
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,240
And the rest of the show had like a theme.

2128
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,560
And you were like, man, I appreciate what you're doing, Neil.

2129
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:42,200
But God, this is lame.

2130
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:45,880
We are the seed man.

2131
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,880
Yeah. It's like the first four.

2132
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,440
All bow to the seed man.

2133
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:54,520
Like just Neil on the piano after the gold rush, which is one of my favorite songs

2134
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,880
ever. And it's like, oh, this is incredible.

2135
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,480
And then it's like a themed experience about seeds.

2136
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:02,840
It's like women with like baskets handing out seeds like, you know,

2137
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:06,680
there's a law against seeds now and we're trying to circumvent.

2138
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,360
And I'm like, this is great, Neil.

2139
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:11,200
Give me a pamphlet. I'll look into it and I support what you're doing.

2140
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,440
But back to the good stuff.

2141
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:19,480
And the women for like grabbed you by the hand, forced your hand open,

2142
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:22,040
shoved the seeds in your hand, made you hold them.

2143
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:25,760
Yeah. And they checked on the way out to make sure you didn't throw them away.

2144
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,400
They kept calling and saying, did you plant them?

2145
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,960
Checking. Hey, it's Neil's the seed girl.

2146
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:34,040
This is Cynthia from the Seed Girls.

2147
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:37,560
Just if you had a chance to plant those seeds yet, Neil was asking about you

2148
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:40,040
specifically. Oh, wait. Oh, Neil, you want to talk to him?

2149
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:42,040
Yeah. Did you plant the seeds?

2150
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:47,400
I got to sing my Starbucks song and I needed I was going to Skype you in,

2151
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,040
see how the seeds were coming.

2152
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:51,040
Do you want to buy a po? Do you want to buy a Pono?

2153
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:55,680
Don't make me write a mean song about you like George W.

2154
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:58,800
Bush. All right. I'll say let's impeach Mike Carlson.

2155
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,600
OK, Neil, I plan it on my swear.

2156
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:04,000
Planted a photographic proof, please.

2157
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,960
Have you been to DCA?

2158
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:08,160
Have you been to California Adventure?

2159
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:09,600
It's a good theme park.

2160
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,640
I don't like that sound.

2161
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:12,960
What they're going to they're going to add a Cars Land.

2162
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,040
I like the taking out the seeds, taking out the seeds.

2163
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:22,000
Crest commercialism. I was fine with it before, but

2164
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,800
you would have been OK if Cars Land was more like electric cars, I think.

2165
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,360
Yeah. Oh, sure. Yeah.

2166
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,960
Aren't they? Well, I guess you're right.

2167
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:34,800
The cars in the Cars Land, they have like hearts and lungs, right?

2168
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:37,960
Cars in the movie. Oh, yeah. They're just alive.

2169
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:40,440
Yeah. So yeah, he's fine with cars.

2170
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:45,080
Yeah. Take the joke back. Anyway, what would happen to all this?

2171
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:47,600
Is this just like the entrance of Cars Land now?

2172
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:52,400
What where are we geographically when we're at Santa Rosa seed and supply?

2173
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:58,280
I think we're looking at Cars Land and soon to be like Marvel.

2174
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:02,520
I think that's the real sort of in the in between.

2175
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:03,560
Oh, and you know what?

2176
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:07,120
Before we wrap up the thing we haven't said, you know, part of

2177
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:10,240
apparently the lore and I was trying to find a quote on this.

2178
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:14,360
And maybe I'll try to have something for part two for one point to when we do it.

2179
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:20,200
Supposedly the biggest fan of Bountiful Valley Farm was not a visitor,

2180
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:24,920
but Michael Eisner, I was trying to buy that love.

2181
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:28,360
I loved the heart and soul.

2182
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:33,040
I feel like he described it that like he was all in on Bountiful Valley Farm.

2183
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:34,840
Wow. Wow.

2184
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:37,120
There was some other quote where he said, like, all right,

2185
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:39,720
you know, everything I said about the Aspen retreat, like,

2186
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:41,960
what do we want to represent about California?

2187
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:44,240
Well, you know, there's the hot there's Hollywood and there's,

2188
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:48,560
you know, nature and tourism and there's industry.

2189
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,080
There's the workplace.

2190
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:53,360
I think he said the workplace that sucks workplace.

2191
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,800
Yeah, it sucks.

2192
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:59,600
I don't want any workplace to be represented.

2193
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,200
And what about like, workplaces are gone.

2194
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:03,400
Nobody has workplaces anymore now.

2195
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:05,320
I don't want us to go to a theme park and see.

2196
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:06,880
Maybe I do miss them.

2197
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,520
Well, I'll just go walk around an office.

2198
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:11,120
What about like if they represented like a Dunder Mifflin

2199
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:13,720
somewhere in California, venture?

2200
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:15,120
Oh, of course.

2201
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,200
The ultimate workplace.

2202
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:18,960
Well, that's going to have to be universal, though.

2203
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:20,240
That's all right. You're right.

2204
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:22,080
They have it back on Peacock and.

2205
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:28,360
Yeah, the that seems like a will.

2206
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:31,560
Like they, you know, if they did like a store that was exactly

2207
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:35,040
the layout of the office office, I couldn't aid on that.

2208
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:36,160
That's something.

2209
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:39,360
I think they should do a superstar limo style office, right?

2210
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,240
I mean, that's what we were getting at on the Monsters Inc.

2211
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:44,440
Right. But I think that universal at this point, it's probably

2212
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:47,080
it's like the most popular show on all the streaming services.

2213
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:49,200
So like, let's you got they got to do something with it.

2214
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:51,680
They got to expand.

2215
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:54,120
That's what she said.

2216
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:57,720
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

2217
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:02,000
Uh, or it's just like Office Live and they have they recast the characters

2218
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:05,920
and you get to watch like a little play, a little office play every every day.

2219
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:08,680
Well, Office, Office, the musical.

2220
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:12,680
OK, the way that, you know, like finding Nemo, the musical where there wasn't

2221
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:15,200
it wasn't a musical before, but why not do it now?

2222
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,880
And then they can get like during Halloween time, they can get rowdy.

2223
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:20,120
They can get bawdy.

2224
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:21,800
Like Slaughter World.

2225
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:24,120
Yeah, like Slaughter World. Yeah.

2226
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:28,320
But like it's and it's called the off fix with three X's at the end.

2227
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,440
Yeah, that's good.

2228
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:34,120
How have we not been we done done this show now for three years.

2229
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:36,240
We haven't been hired yet. It's unbelievable.

2230
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:39,640
I know great ideas left and right.

2231
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:40,720
This was just a con.

2232
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:43,600
This whole thing was just a con to get hired in one of these companies

2233
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,080
and it hasn't worked.

2234
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:47,360
Unbelievable. It's time to it's time to admit.

2235
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:48,600
What we're doing.

2236
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,880
This is all it's been about.

2237
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:57,280
So, yeah, if you work at Universal Studios, just let us just let us.

2238
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:59,800
You've been listening to all of them.

2239
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:02,000
We know you're looking for pun writers.

2240
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,240
We know puns are coming back around 20 years later.

2241
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:05,840
What do you want?

2242
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:08,280
Thing I did at the beginning, there were so many puns.

2243
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:09,560
Yeah. What else do we have to do?

2244
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:11,440
Cry on the air if you want.

2245
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,000
We'll beg. Cry.

2246
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,720
And it's OK to cry.

2247
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:18,760
As Judge Gad said nearly a year ago, it's OK to cry.

2248
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:23,880
Yeah. Oh, that actually might make me cry if I examine that statement.

2249
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:26,640
That it was almost. Oh, yeah.

2250
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:29,040
Yeah. No kidding. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

2251
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:33,360
Woof. Anyway, my therapist, my therapist says it's OK.

2252
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,480
OK, he emphasized it's OK to cry.

2253
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:37,760
He's like, sometimes if you need to prime yourself, he's like,

2254
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:40,680
if you need to like watch Rocky or something, because you know, it'll make you cry.

2255
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,240
And like, well, guess now I'm thinking,

2256
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,840
maybe I just need to watch Gad.

2257
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:50,280
You didn't it didn't make you cry when it was only a day old.

2258
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:55,320
But once it's a year old, imagine no possessions.

2259
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:59,960
That's we're going to get to so many year anniversaries.

2260
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,480
Remember?

2261
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:08,840
Then there was the other different one where Aaron Paul was yelling, boy,

2262
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:12,320
what a great work is it a year already?

2263
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:13,040
Happy birthday.

2264
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:14,520
They've done enough.

2265
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,440
They've done enough celebrity boxings.

2266
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:19,200
They don't remember that's been a year.

2267
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:22,080
So who wait?

2268
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,520
Who has done celebrity?

2269
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,640
The Paul brothers.

2270
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:27,160
They just know Aaron Paul from from.

2271
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:29,440
Oh, yeah. No, Aaron Paul.

2272
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,720
No, no, no.

2273
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:33,320
Not Logan Paul and not what's the brother?

2274
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:35,040
Jake, I would certainly.

2275
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,000
Jake, that's what I'm OK.

2276
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,960
I would buy that Aaron Paul has a brother and that they're into boxing together.

2277
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,320
That's not such a stretch.

2278
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:46,960
Yeah, that's that's not where it would be funny if it was suddenly revealed

2279
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:50,120
that Aaron Paul is the third after Jake and Logan.

2280
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:51,240
I was like, I was.

2281
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,800
Yeah, I was like, did Aaron Paul have like a celebrity

2282
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:56,640
boxing match against like the bagel boss or something?

2283
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:00,320
They fight it like it's a right.

2284
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,000
It was well right before the pandemic.

2285
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,720
So like, I kind of forget a lot of stuff.

2286
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:05,320
So, yeah. OK.

2287
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:08,200
We're announcing a new enterprise boxing bitch.

2288
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:11,360
A whole new way to fight.

2289
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:13,920
Universal involved in the fighting yourself.

2290
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:18,560
Universal, hire us so we can we can book celebrity boxing matches at the park.

2291
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:20,640
Yeah, get us.

2292
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:23,840
We just need the three of us and Aaron Paul and we will bring boxing

2293
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:26,000
bitch to your park.

2294
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,280
We have access.

2295
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,120
You know, the celebrities we've had.

2296
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:32,040
Do you want Evan Susser to box?

2297
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,480
Nick Weigar at Universal?

2298
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:36,160
Of course you do.

2299
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:37,720
We can make that happen for you.

2300
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:40,440
So hire us, please.

2301
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:45,360
Or do you want Evan Susser to fight the bagel boss?

2302
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,320
We can make that happen.

2303
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,840
We should do it. We can book.

2304
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,240
You know him. He did something with the minions once.

2305
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:57,040
Do you want someone who did something with the minions once to box Aaron Paul?

2306
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:58,640
That's right. That's what we're proposing.

2307
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:01,440
I don't know. I'm so so much.

2308
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,200
Whereas again, we're lost.

2309
02:00:03,200 --> 02:00:06,080
We're lost in the middle of confusing the middle.

2310
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:10,760
DCA. And what we've determined is that we have to step down

2311
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:17,080
like DCA, stop and talk about it and do a refurbish and we'll come back.

2312
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:19,960
We'll have to figure out the plan.

2313
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:21,560
We'll have to figure out the timing on this.

2314
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:24,000
Yeah, but yeah, do it.

2315
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:25,760
It will be sooner in a year.

2316
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:27,560
I don't know. Yes.

2317
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,720
Good question. Because we've got more.

2318
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:32,280
There's more DCA coming to the second gate.

2319
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:34,200
There's more. But do we do this?

2320
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,240
Well, I guess that's the off air conversation.

2321
02:00:36,240 --> 02:00:38,400
Either way, there's more off air, I think. Yeah.

2322
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:41,480
Yeah, because this is this is DCA 20 years.

2323
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,960
We got to celebrate it in a big way.

2324
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,000
It's got to we got to end.

2325
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,320
And it's the second gate.

2326
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:48,240
We have to celebrate the second gate on the second gate.

2327
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:50,160
So there's more coming.

2328
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:52,040
So don't worry about that. Right.

2329
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:55,440
For now, you survived.

2330
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:58,400
I can't believe we even thought we would get further than this.

2331
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:00,520
But you survived part one.

2332
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:03,080
You survived DCA one point.

2333
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:06,920
Oh, point one. Oh, oh, oh.

2334
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:08,200
Actually, yeah, one point.

2335
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:11,000
Oh, point one would be the first update.

2336
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,120
I think it well.

2337
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:15,240
But then you want to get two in the title when we do it.

2338
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:19,720
Yeah. For cleanliness sake, we'll call it the next installment.

2339
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:21,600
One point, oh point two.

2340
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:25,040
Yes, it's extremely cleanly.

2341
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:28,040
The this way, this was great.

2342
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:29,360
So we're going to figure it out.

2343
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,280
It's a big week.

2344
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:33,560
We will there will be more DCA content over on the second gate.

2345
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:35,680
And there's always great stuff happening over there,

2346
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:38,080
which hopefully, as you know, is Patreon.com

2347
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:41,720
slash podcast, the ride and follow us on all the other social media.

2348
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:46,400
We'll we'll be posting great photos of I mean, we got to post all our favorites.

2349
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:49,640
We for sure have to show some of that parade.

2350
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:54,800
Oh, my God. The chow main man and the Golden Gate Bridge boys.

2351
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:57,080
That was that's a hell of a parade.

2352
02:01:57,080 --> 02:01:58,520
I love Eureka. Yeah.

2353
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,760
Well, yeah, we'll we'll get deep into Eureka.

2354
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:05,280
Also, right on our way out, I'll drop the new story that Evermore Park

2355
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:07,800
is suing Taylor Swift for naming her album Evermore.

2356
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:10,720
Hell yes. Let's go.

2357
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:13,080
That's what you teased. Whoa.

2358
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:14,840
You told us he had a good one.

2359
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:17,360
A good topical. Oh, man.

2360
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:19,840
They got to pay those contractors somehow.

2361
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:20,880
Evermore. Yeah.

2362
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:23,520
No one's ever used Evermore before Evermore Park.

2363
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:27,680
Good. Nice. Nice try, I think.

2364
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:29,000
Yeah. Yeah.

2365
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,280
What are you going to try to sue Edgar Allen Poe now?

2366
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,440
Yeah. Nevermore is too close.

2367
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:38,280
Poe had a Poe had a time machine is what it alleged.

2368
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:40,680
They allege went into the future.

2369
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:42,400
So anybody would come on.

2370
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:44,480
He had a steampunk time machine.

2371
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:46,720
Of course he did. He stole our name.

2372
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:47,640
So yeah.

2373
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:50,080
So anyway, let's see if Taylor can get out of this one.

2374
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:52,960
I have not listened to Evermore nearly as much as Folklore,

2375
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:55,640
and Folklore is fantastic, I will say.

2376
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:58,240
But Evermore is good.

2377
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:00,880
OK, yeah. Well, so check those out.

2378
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:02,840
Check out those albums streaming.

2379
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:06,960
Plug Taylor Swift, help her out during this lawsuit from the Evermore theme park.

2380
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,200
It's going to be a tough time for her, clearly.

2381
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:10,200
And we will come back.

2382
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:14,240
You will hear more from us and we'll get to all your...

2383
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:15,720
We'll get to Burger Invasion.

2384
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,360
We'll get to Orange Stinger.

2385
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:20,000
We'll get to Pizza Um, Mau Mau.

2386
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:20,880
You're going to hear it all.

2387
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:21,680
That's right.

2388
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:23,320
Yeah. Mela-bur-ito.

2389
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,200
If that doesn't entice you.

2390
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,800
So hold on tight.

2391
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:30,440
Happy birthday, California Adventure.

2392
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:33,120
And we'll talk to you all soon.
