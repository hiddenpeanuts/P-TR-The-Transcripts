00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Warning! Today's episode contains a stomach-churning live taste test of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,000
a firm stance on adult-poo-based theme park leisure wear,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,500
sincere pining for J.K. Rowling-approved meat pies.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,000
All that, and Jessica McKenna joins us for a spellbinding discussion about the wizarding world of Harry Potter,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:43,500
but just the Hogsmeade Park. It's Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,300
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who all share the same childhood best friend,

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,800
the chunky Epcot Center robot Smart One. Joining me as always Scott Gairdner.

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,100
Yeah. And Jason Sheridan. Hi.

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,800
And today we are joined by a very special guest from the improvised musical podcast Off Book.

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,900
Is that right? Is that the name of it? Yeah. Okay, cool.

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,100
I'm right. Jessica McKenna.

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,000
Guys. Hi. Hi Jess. I said the name of it.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,200
I was like, that's I wrote it down, but I go, wait, was that wrong?

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,300
It seems wrong as I said it. So I didn't want to mess the plug up.

15
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you. Now that I have that I can leave.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,100
Wait, no. Hey, come back. I'll just add the sound effect of like clunk, clunk, clunk door slam.

17
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,800
Jess, you do have a reputation as the candiest podcast guest.

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,400
She's so good. She gets her plug and then she gets out.

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,200
In and out. In and out. Podcast world. You got eight more podcasts today where you're doing the same thing.

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,100
Yeah, every 15 minute interval. Ghosting.

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,000
So yeah, today you're joining us to talk about Harry Potter.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,500
Thank God. Specifically the universal Harry Potter world, which is not what that's called.

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,400
The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Right.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,500
But is that, to be really proper with our titles, is that what you call the entire thing, including Diagon Alley?

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,200
Yes. Oh, Jason says yes. Very authoritative.

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,000
Like the, I believe the marketing is the Wizarding World of Harry Potter is like the overall thing.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,800
And then it's Hogsmeade for the village and Diagon Alley for Diagon Alley.

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,900
So there's like a dash in between Wizarding World.

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,600
And we are focused mainly today on Hogsmeade, which is currently open at Universal Hollywood.

30
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,500
Right. And what was open in 2010 at Islands of Adventure,

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,400
although they have since expanded the Harry Potter world with Diagon Alley

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,100
and the train that connects the two parts. Oh my God, it's magical.

33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,600
Guys, I need to make a pilgrimage.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,500
I actually have been to Islands of Adventure Wizarding World, but when it was only Hogsmeade.

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,700
Like I went, my mom gambles a lot and gets gambling perks.

36
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,600
Oh sure. She gets basically a cruise a year. Great.

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,400
And she, because she's the sweet kind mother that she is, she was like,

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,700
do you want to do like one out of Florida and we'll go a few days early and we'll go to the Wizarding World?

39
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,800
My mom, not a Harry Potter fan, just did this for me.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,500
Wow. Yeah, that's real nice.

41
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,700
Yeah. And we stayed at like a park that got us that hour early entry.

42
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,200
Yes, yeah, of course. Which was clutch because like we did all of, we did like,

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,100
you know, Forbidden Journey and we did, you know,

44
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,700
like the Florida one has the repurposed dragon ride,

45
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,200
which I had been on when it was just the ice dragon fire dragon.

46
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Then it got transformed to be part of Wizarding World.

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,400
We did that and then we went back and when we went back you had to like wait in line

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,100
and get a ticket to like come back in and out. Like it was so packed.

49
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:46,100
Yes. Oh yeah. They were really doing that in both sections down there in Florida when it first opened.

50
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,200
And here in Hollywood too, they were experimenting with it early on.

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,500
Now it's calmed down. Yeah. And you can sort of get it anytime.

52
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Yeah, so I gotta get back. I was going to say there's a thing with credit cards I'm doing right now.

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Where you give you a lot of points. I don't want to get into it.

54
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,300
Yes. What did you say? Credit card churning. Churning?

55
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,400
Yeah. Is that a thing? I think that's what it's called.

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,400
When you like open a bunch of cards and you like, oh get all the points.

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,500
I guess I am churning in a way. Yeah.

58
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,900
There's something called like spend money on specific things with specific cards for point building purposes.

59
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, but I mean what I'm doing right now is called the Chase trifecta.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,500
And it's a series of three different Chase cards

61
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,200
and they all work in tandem to get you different points for different purchases.

62
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:35,200
So plus in addition to this these bonuses I'm saving on getting all these points and we're going to go to Tokyo.

63
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,800
Oh. So I would recommend the Chase trifecta and we can certainly discuss it off air.

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Mike, that's great. That's great you're promoting this little upstart company Chase Bank.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,300
I just think they're a... And the Chase Bank representative is nodding.

66
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,100
He got his plug. He's leaving. He's putting his small pistol away.

67
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,200
He's off to another podcast. Yeah. Thank you Chase Man.

68
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,600
He'll be menacing John Gabris very shortly.

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,500
Yeah, so Daigon is great. Go to it. I can't wait.

70
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,800
So let's before we get into it. Like let's let's get into a different thing.

71
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Let's talk about like your history with theme parks. What your feeling is about them.

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,200
What you like dislike. Well, I'm a I'm a SoCal native.

73
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,000
So I am grew up having like annual passes to Disneyland.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,700
Love it. Love Disneyland very deeply. Have been to Disney World three times.

75
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,100
So I have almost no connection with world. One of those was when I was three.

76
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,200
So like still pretty good. That's a lot for a West coaster.

77
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,900
Yeah. Yeah. One of them was like very very brief.

78
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:53,300
I would say and then one time I went in college with like a bunch with a college improv team road trip from Chicago to Orlando.

79
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,700
24 hours straight of driving. Holy shit.

80
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,800
Yeah, it was insane, but we only went to Magic Kingdom.

81
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,900
So I have never been to Epcot as an adult never been to you know,

82
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,500
Animal Kingdom haven't been to what used to be MGM and now is just Hollywood Hollywood.

83
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,400
Yeah, we're waiting for any second. Our new names coming down the pike

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,100
and we don't want to say one until it's more than just a rumor,

85
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,200
but we do know we do know no won't be called Marvel.

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I don't think I know we don't know just changing the name of the Hollywood Park again.

87
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,900
We had there was a list of rumors,

88
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,100
but there is what Scott is being coy that with a name that's the rumor.

89
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,700
I know he doesn't want me to say this but you know,

90
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,000
go ahead whatever it's going to be called Disney's sin imagine.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,900
They think it is sin imagine Park such a no valid sources.

92
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,500
Scott doesn't like this these rumors. I'm these are very like crazy.

93
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,300
These are not backed up to a bit.

94
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,900
We got to get it. I want to see this on a reputable on a laughing place or a mice.

95
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,000
Screamscape you trust screamscape.com which is another website aggregate.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,500
So I don't know if I can't because they're pulling from lots of difference.

97
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
So depending on where they're pulling it from yeah,

98
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,200
screamscape has always been kind of a rag.

99
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Let's be honest. Yeah, and now the screen skate screamscape rep is furious walking out of the room.

100
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, we blew our connection there.

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,400
But hey, no, we've got there's been legit scoops.

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,900
That's from them too. I don't want to throw them under the bus and maybe need maybe a better graphic designer.

103
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,200
I'll say that's yes.

104
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,500
Look we can all elevate each other is what I'm saying.

105
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,600
It's all us in the theme park media,

106
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,900
which we're in now rising tides.

107
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,700
Come on guys. Yeah, but I love theme parks.

108
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,100
I grew up going to not a good amount.

109
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,900
Are you Orange County? Yep. Okay.

110
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,200
Not a lot of Six Flags was a bit of a bit more of a drive

111
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,900
and bit more of a rumored to be just full of gangs.

112
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,000
Like there was this story when hair wraps were really popular.

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,300
Like you'd go on a beach vacation with your family

114
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,500
and you'd get like your your hair wrapped in thread

115
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,800
and a little like charm at the bottom. Do you guys know? Yeah, you guys know what I'm talking about?

116
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,300
I'm scared where this is going. There was like a story that a 10 year old girl her

117
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,900
she had like a blue one and it was like ripped out of her head by a blood which a hundred percent is not true.

118
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,500
Wow, like there's no way that's true.

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,700
But that's like the Orange County like everybody's like super conservative.

120
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,000
Like you can't go there cuz gangs will rip your hair wrap right out of your head.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,700
But I did go to Six Flags like as sort of a reward.

122
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,300
It was a reward for passing this certain level of piano

123
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,500
and that was a really good Six Flags trip where I went on Colossus for the first time.

124
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,900
Six Flags great coasters been back, you know more as an adult but Disneyland grew up going a lot,

125
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,200
you know, like I waited in line the opening week of Indiana Jones.

126
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Oh wow. Three hour line, you know in second grade wearing a Taz shirt,

127
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,100
which now I hate when I go to Disneyland.

128
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,800
I see people wearing properties that are also at different theme parks.

129
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,500
You want to support this corporation? Yeah, I hate but you know,

130
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,100
I hate seeing a Disneyland sweatshirt at Wizarding World. I'm like,

131
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,000
come on man. Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,200
Don't worry. Yeah, it feels like a shots fire.

133
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,500
Yeah, because the Disneyland's obviously the king of the castle.

134
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,300
So, but it is kind of like, yeah,

135
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,000
I think so. It is kind of like though where you're supposed to not wear this t-shirt of the band.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,200
Yeah. At the band's concert. In general.

137
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,500
Amusement parks or just in general. In general,

138
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm like, how old are you? What level of what are you wearing?

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,900
Like are you an adult? You're wearing like a cool vintage Mickey sweatshirt. Cool.

140
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,000
Are you wearing anything in the poo universe?

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,400
This is weird. Are you wearing anything that's like from a dwarf?

142
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,900
Are you like over 20 and wearing a grumpy sweatshirt?

143
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,900
I'm giving you some side eye. I mean the grumpy sweatshirt is a valuable warning device that people should not approach that person

144
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,400
until they've had their coffee. That person's a grump! Absolutely.

145
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,800
You're right. I haven't been thinking of it that way.

146
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,500
There's a whole the grumpy line is just for dads.

147
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,800
Yes. And it's been that way forever.

148
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,000
And it's a shirt that will just you can buy for your father that just says,

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,400
hey, you're a grumpy dickhead.

150
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,600
And that's like sort of the whole thing. This shirt you're wearing right now is rad.

151
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,500
Thank you. I like this shirt and I'm wearing a Harry Potter shirt that is like,

152
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,400
yeah, nice. This type of shirt where you name,

153
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,300
you know, you have a list of names. What do you call this type of shirt?

154
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,500
I feel like I was trying to describe this. Ampersand lists? Yeah, yeah.

155
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,900
But yeah, it's all the Helvetica, Ampersand lists.

156
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,400
While we're doing a shirt check, let's go over and see what Jason's wearing.

157
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, right. So Mike brought me, gave me this for my birthday back from when he was in Orlando.

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,500
It's a Margaritaville blue polo shirt like a dad would buy on vacation.

159
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Very good. I've been to that Margaritaville.

160
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,800
Yeah, it rules. It fucking rules.

161
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,100
So we got the seaplane outside and those gigantic Adirondack chairs,

162
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,800
right? Yes. Huge Adirondack chairs, which you can buy.

163
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,500
And oh, yeah, you can buy. I was actually not in Orlando,

164
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:55,300
but in New Jersey, you know, one of like the beach supply stores had a bunch of them on clearance at the end of the summer,

165
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,400
but they were all wood and already put together.

166
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,400
And I'm like, oh, how would I get that back to Southern California?

167
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:08,400
That's a great shirt. But yeah, this shirt is clearly made for someone who wants to be comfortable

168
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,300
because it's like very properly fitted in some ways and then like a tent in other ways.

169
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,600
Okay, everybody's got shoulders, but let's not worry about after that. Just make it a billowy.

170
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, just make it a billowy. Whatever your shape is, it'll fit under the tent.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,800
That's great. I feel like men's polo shirts already.

172
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,800
It's like there's two options. It like stops right at the waist or it's real long.

173
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,300
And this is definitely trending towards the ladder.

174
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,600
Yeah, I also told Mike, there was one or two times I almost wore it before.

175
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,800
So he, like an aunt who gave you a sweater, could see me wearing it.

176
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,100
But then it was times we were hanging out. We didn't say where we were going to eat.

177
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,100
And I'm like, we could end up at that Margaritaville and people might think I work there.

178
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,400
Like people might be complaining about their dipping sauces to me.

179
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, though.

180
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,100
Yeah. If you just accidentally got a job at the Margaritaville at City Walk.

181
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,800
Hey, you know, could be my new life.

182
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,400
Sir, we haven't gotten a pass from the balloon artist on the stilts yet.

183
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Oh, OK. Sorry. Let me look into that. I'm very sorry.

184
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,500
She's been on the East Side for a while now.

185
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,200
I also have, not even thinking about what we were today,

186
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,000
I got this Hervis tumbler as a stocking set for this year at Christmas.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,800
And it's got the Marauder's Map on it. Very good.

188
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,300
I'm drinking some coffee out of it. I'm also rocking some lightning bolt earrings.

189
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,200
But yep, this is great. This is all standard. Standard operating.

190
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,300
Yeah, you're wearing. So yeah, to go back to what you were talking about,

191
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,400
like that's there's a cool way to dress as an adult at these places and a not cool way.

192
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,700
Like if I'm taking if I have kids and I'm taking them, I could go full nerd.

193
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,600
Don't care. Oh, sure. But when you're a childless person at a theme park.

194
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,400
You know, yeah. I think the try our demo guys like I'm right there with you.

195
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,200
I just think there's you can go for it.

196
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,500
And like I don't I certainly don't want to like pretend like I'm some sort of too cool for school.

197
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,100
But like there's a certain like there is a certain line of clothing that just makes me

198
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,600
and from when I was a kid, not even like as an adult,

199
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,500
like I was eight being like that dad shouldn't be wearing so much Tigger swag,

200
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,500
you know, like there's just like there are certain characters that I feel like I think Mickey is safe.

201
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,500
I think any of the core is safe. Mickey is a cipher.

202
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,000
Mickey, you can paint anything on him and it makes sense.

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
Anything Mickey. I think you can wear anything, Donald.

204
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,200
I think you can wear anything goofy and you're just like, yeah, you're just a Disney fan.

205
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,600
Once you go into the other properties, I think you got to be careful.

206
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,400
I think some of it looks well a little specific and like garish

207
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,500
and whenever they try to make it part of a current clothing trend by current.

208
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,300
I mean 15 years old by the time Disney thinks of it.

209
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,400
Like it's like it looks like it's supposed to be like an affliction shirt,

210
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,300
but it's just like it's just like saying like all the villains names.

211
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,400
I'm like, no, I don't want to see you wear that.

212
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,100
Like that's horrible, right?

213
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,900
You know the bigger the face on the shirt too,

214
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:02,100
if it's Ursula taking over the entire collar to to bottom,

215
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,700
that's that's a little obnoxious.

216
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,500
And now that there's all this like it's, you know, Star Wars and Marvel are incorporated.

217
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,300
There's like so many other things you can wear.

218
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,600
Have you guys seen the like hip girl Star Wars clothes?

219
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,300
Yes. It's wild.

220
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,200
Yeah. I can't decide if I love it or hate being like pandered to.

221
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,700
Yeah, there's like a good version of it where they're making like girl little girl dress-up clothes that are like,

222
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,000
it looks like a princess dress, but it's like droid and they have obviously like Rey dress up

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,900
and they've all this kind of like new stuff that I think is for kids is like really awesome.

224
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm like, this is great.

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, that a girl who like like Star Wars, but as a little girl,

226
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,500
he can wear like a tutu, but it looks like C3PO.

227
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,900
I think that's rad. But then they have this line of like it's supposed to look like vintage clothing.

228
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:55,300
It's like little cardigans that just have like in embroidering like BB-8 or like a cool sweater,

229
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,900
but it's just a porg or yeah,

230
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,400
like truly like poodle skirts. I went twice at Christmas because

231
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,600
Disneyland Christmas is my single favorite thing in the world.

232
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,300
I mean, it's great. It's incredible.

233
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:15,000
And I was like, do I love this? Do I love this like reaching out and being like Star Wars is for all for all?

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,600
Or do I hate? I think the Star Wars stuff for men and women that I tend to like are like decent quality,

235
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,700
like vintage looking soft shirts that use like a lot of the 80s.

236
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:35,000
There was a long run of 80s Star Wars comic books that Marvel put out and now it's all back in the same roof again.

237
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,600
And so like if you can like beat up that shirt a little and use some of that art where it's like,

238
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,600
oh look, it's the character, you know, but it's also like the comic artists of their time put their own kind of spin on it

239
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,800
and it looks kind of faded and vintagey like that. I tend to gravitate towards.

240
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:59,900
I agree. I think those are cool. This is like and I think this is also winking to the like growing thing of like the Dapper Days stuff.

241
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,000
Oh yeah. So this is like big time like you could buy this and wear it to Dapper Days.

242
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes. Which I'm assuming your listening audience knows what Dapper Days is.

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, Dapper Days when people get dressed up in nice clothing, often anachronistic clothing.

244
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,500
It's kind of in reference to that you used to dress up to go to Disneyland in the 50s and 60s.

245
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,200
You watch old footage of people on the Matterhorn and they're all in like very fine suits.

246
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,000
Like what Archie would wear to a dance.

247
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Sure.

248
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,500
Yeah.

249
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,000
But also what's this, there's this crazy Disney founding.

250
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The old Archie by the way, not the new Riverdale, sorry.

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh yes, yes.

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Disney founding, yeah that's a whole other thing where people like wear outfits that kind of nod towards characters.

253
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes, because adults are not allowed to wear costumes at Disneyland.

254
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

255
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So there's like a, there is like a population that has figured out like different ways to, yeah you'll dress in like the color palette of Ursula.

256
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Uh huh.

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And like or you know the, you'll dress in like the color palette and the way that you wear like,

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
like you're a guy who is just wearing like a white shirt and pants but you have like a big red belt so you kind of look like Prince Eric.

259
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But like I have a friend from high school who's like getting sort of Instagram famous for being like into both cosplay and a lot of Disney specific cosplay.

260
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah sure.

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And Disney bounding.

262
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Um and I'm like this is this whole world of this girl I did like choir and theater with and I'm like where can she now?

263
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And I'm like, I like thousands of followers on Instagram for being in this community.

264
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah.

265
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And just to like meld our topics today guys.

266
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah.

267
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
To just talk so much already on this podcast.

268
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah.

269
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,000
She is part of this thing, she does like princess stuff like I think she sort of like got through the back door of like she was like a party princess, maybe still is.

270
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And then started getting like better and better at it like her like really really good at doing like the makeup and her wigs got better and like getting better events and whatever.

271
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And she's part of this group that does like sorts Disney princess into Harry Potter houses.

272
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So she does this whole look where she's Anna from Frozen as a Hufflepuff.

273
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh my.

274
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
In like a cute school girl Hufflepuff outfit.

275
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Whoa.

276
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And she's like Anna like braids and freckles and like Elsa is in Slytherin and she'll take like photos with another girl who's like a Slytherin Elsa.

277
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And they're like if they went to Hogwarts.

278
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah.

279
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Can we pull out like a whiteboard or something?

280
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Can you draw some lines between that?

281
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I need to keep track mentally of how this works.

282
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yeah.

283
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And they like look good.

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Like they look like cute and like the out, like I'm like I see why.

285
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Right people.

286
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The attention to detail of like cosplay stuff.

287
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah.

288
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Is incredible nowadays.

289
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah.

290
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So that's her specialty is that area?

291
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't know.

292
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I think like Disney princess, Disney stuff is more her specialty but she'll do and I think yeah everything is kind of besides this Harry Potter crossover everything's now in Disney universe.

293
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Like she'll do some like Mary Jane cosplay.

294
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
She'll do some, she'll do like some Star Wars stuff.

295
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Another princess crossover she did for, they did she did for some event for princess, for Disney princesses as Pokemon trainers.

296
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Wow.

297
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Whoa.

298
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And you're telling us this is popular on Instagram?

299
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I mean she has like 16,000 followers.

300
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah that's good.

301
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah.

302
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You can do this now.

303
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah.

304
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You can do this.

305
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You get a big following doing that.

306
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
All of this stuff is just, we all want this stuff to be real so bad.

307
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Yes.

308
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And it just comes out in different ways.

309
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Like obviously the theme park and the immersive lands, this Harry Potter land we're going to talk about and then Star Wars land.

310
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's getting closer to us like living there.

311
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But then it's like you're following these real people now on Instagram.

312
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So that's like, I feel like that's the better you can make people go like, oh yeah, now I know like one of the princesses.

313
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You feel like you're liking Elsa.

314
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm liking the real Elsa.

315
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I have a different friend from camp who's really into like Harry Potter cosplay.

316
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
She has like basically like she looks, she does a really good Luna.

317
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
She like kind of has the look anyway and she's like full Ravenclaw out and will just like do photo shoot.

318
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Because here's the difference, you can be in costume in Wizarding World.

319
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes, you can.

320
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Which is wild because the costume and the like staff outfits are identical.

321
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah, the merchandise, the merch is very, I don't want to get ahead of myself, but the merch is very good at Harry Potter.

322
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And yeah, it looks, the cast member clothing and the merch you can buy as a souvenir is identical and you could put it on right there.

323
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's very easy to put a cloak on over Levi's and the t-shirts.

324
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And yeah, and people just walk around all ages and are like super into it and it's really cool.

325
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I mean it helps, like JK Rowling has, Rowling? Rowling?

326
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Rowling.

327
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Rowling has approval over everything and that I'm sure will keep coming up today.

328
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Like that kind of adds why everything is so good.

329
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So you go up that Universal Hill, you can cosplay as Harry Potter, you can cosplay as a shift manager at Margaritaville.

330
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah, that's what I will go.

331
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's how we started on this, me talking about this shirt by Broadway.

332
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So yeah, you are wearing the ampersand shirt, you're wearing the earrings.

333
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Would you go further or have you at Wizarding World? Would you go, would you buy a cloak?

334
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't have a cloak. The cloaks, I mean, I'm into the school sweater. I have, I have like from just like before, I have like a Gryffindor tie.

335
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And I have like a Gryffindor track jacket from high school, like when Hot Topic like started selling like a few items.

336
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh yeah.

337
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I think it even says like Gryffindor Seeker on the back, I'm not sure.

338
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And I think I would go sweater for sure.

339
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh sure.

340
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I would go cloak.

341
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So there's a pretty casual way to do it, or the scarf I'd imagine.

342
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah, I think I've worn the scarf. I have a Gryffindor scarf, but it's like, again, I remember when there used to be like Warner Brothers stores in malls that started carrying Harry Potter products.

343
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You're talking Scott's language here.

344
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:14,000
In the last month, I watched a corporate in-house video, several of them, one from 93, one from 94, showing, it was like, we've made a lot of, there's been tremendous growth this year within the Warner Brothers studio store.

345
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And within that found like weirdo stuff of like, and we're opening, we're opening a location in Atlantic City and here now is our new investor, Donald Trump.

346
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh my God.

347
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You can watch Donald Trump and little Ivanka taking photos with Batman or whatever.

348
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I even hate these people already. The fact that she got to go as a little girl and hang out with Batman and Bugs Bunny and stuff.

349
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh my God.

350
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
They're insane videos.

351
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That's crazy.

352
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But were those still open where Harry Potter merch was a possibility?

353
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes.

354
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Really?

355
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I thought they were closed long ago.

356
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Right at the end I think.

357
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes, right at the end. So there's one, there was one in the Brea mall, so not far. I mean, I can hear the Disneyland fireworks from my backyard.

358
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Wow.

359
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh, you're a Belinda.

360
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah, yeah. So Brea is our mall.

361
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You ever go to the Black Gold Country Club?

362
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yes.

363
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That was what I started. I had like a really great brunch there with a bunch of mimosas and it got me golfing. That was four years ago. I've golfed ever since.

364
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh, that's great.

365
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I was so delighted by the Black Gold Country Club.

366
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah, very familiar with Black Gold Country Club.

367
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Was there ever like, was there like a prom or anything there?

368
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I think there have not, I not like in my time.

369
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I think we, that is there, there was like, I think I went there one night like with friends and we like tried to roll around on the slick, like sprinkled grass.

370
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, nice. There you go.

371
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But it's a good country club.

372
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah, an illegal event.

373
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah, ooh, mischief, mischief.

374
00:23:40,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So Brea Mall had one and I remember like, so Harry Potter got purchased by Warner Bros. like they got the movie rights when I was like in seventh or eighth grade, and that was like the last year that that store was open, and they had very few products but they did have some like I remember I got a just all black mug that in gold writing just in the Harry Potter font just at Harry Potter, and I got like, I think I got a stuffed Hedwig.

375
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I got two posters that were, but they were just like cartoon. It was like Harry playing Quidditch and like, I can't remember what the other one was, but we talk in pre movies.

376
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah, wow, movies weren't out yet.

377
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:35,000
They had the license to they already had like, yeah, because they had bought the rights they were starting pre production. And so all the products were like, they, they were like, they just would say Harry Potter, they'd be like really simple they weren't yet like things that had like the likeness

378
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
of the people who are in the movie.

379
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And now this I around the time of the first movie coming out like Universal was not the first part to have Harry Potter movie world Australia briefly had a walkthrough of like sets around the time of the first and second movies.

380
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Amazing.

381
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And they were closed very quickly after that, because then they they made the universal deal. This would have also likely been the time that Disney with lots of rumors over the years that Disney took meetings early on and fucked up like they like

382
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:22,000
they had proposed like some very small Harry Potter attractions, as opposed to Universal who handed over like, take it all, take it all here is a checkbook.

383
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Right, right, however much you want on planning explosives at the Gibson amphitheater already.

384
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah, this is yours.

385
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That's awesome.

386
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But yeah, Disney much more protective much more hands on and Universal like yeah gave the JK Rowling like full control like final say over everything where like there has been times where stuff had to be taken down because she was like no that doesn't look right.

387
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,000
She apparently she like checked everything on the menus. She I'm sure we'll do a bigger run about food later but she like personally taste tested everything apparently.

388
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh, is that right?

389
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah, it's whatever.

390
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Hell yeah.

391
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It shows.

392
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So you as a big Harry Potter fan, do you remember finding out that the theme parks were coming down the pike?

393
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, watching a video of like a fly through like a broom.

394
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
A broom through?

395
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
A broom through of like what they thought it would look like.

396
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And I think what year did Florida open? 2009?

397
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So here, let's get some numbers out there.

398
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Orlando opened in 2010 with the leads of the movie there. Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, right? Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe.

399
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Were they part of some weird skit? Our favorite thing? Weird opening skits?

400
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah, we love weird opening skits.

401
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I didn't know that they did weird opening. I think they just kind of like waved to the press and rode the rides and walked around.

402
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
They're big enough stars. They don't have to like memorize dialogue.

403
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I mean their performances in the ride are great.

404
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah, and they got them all back for the ride. John Williams conducted the Orlando Symphony Orchestra for played the score at the opening.

405
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Really? He did?

406
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Which is crazy since he stopped writing the scores after the first two.

407
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh, okay.

408
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I mean like they still would reuse his themes, but he didn't write additional music after the first two, I believe.

409
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Yeah. Although when they opened Diagon Alley, the supporting cast were the ones that there. Like, Ella Mabonham Carter was the biggest star.

410
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
She was still pretty good.

411
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And they're new in the rides there too.

412
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That's true. She's a new presence in the Gringotts ride.

413
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's true, yeah. And of course, what are their names? The Phelps brothers?

414
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oliver and James?

415
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:46,000
James, yeah. I believe they just live at Universal Parks now. Like they wheel them out anytime there's a new sandwich on the menu.

416
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Like they wheel them out to give it. And they're great at it. They're great as presenters.

417
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The Warwick Davis of... Although, wait, no, he's in Harry Potter too. But they're like the mascots forever of the things they were in.

418
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah. So 2010 in Orlando, 2014 in Japan, and 2016 here in Hollywood for the Hogsmeades.

419
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
What does Japan have?

420
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Japan has the Black Lake next to it. And has real owls. Like you can meet real owls. That is the main difference between the Japan one.

421
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Do they have both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley?

422
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
They're building Diagon Alley, right?

423
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I believe so, yeah.

424
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
They're building Diagon Alley but without the Hogwarts Express, which is wild.

425
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So they've started with Hogsmeade, much like here. Because, rumor that LA will expand.

426
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Well, it's taken... We've been waiting. And no announcement. And no announcements.

427
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And now we have these signs about the dang DreamWorks Amphitheater. Like when that construction started next to it.

428
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Man, I'm jumping ahead. But it was like... I was like, boom, here we go. Ding, ding.

429
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But it's like a DreamWorks thing.

430
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Yes, it's just they're repurposing the Shrek Theater to be the Kung Fu Panda Theater.

431
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And it's not... There's also not enough room there for Diagon.

432
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So there are...

433
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
That's a good question in general. Where does it go?

434
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Because there are rumors that they're going to move the tram tour queue.

435
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And then there's going to be a Hogwarts Express down the hill, essentially.

436
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That'd be great.

437
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's such a steep incline. To build a comfortable train would take some crazy engineering.

438
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
When I worked there, I got driven around on golf carts around that lot.

439
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And they're all super steep. It's a little scary moving around around there. So you gotta be careful.

440
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We had an intern there and they would send us up to CityWalk sometimes to pick up lunch.

441
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And there were times where it's like, is this golf cart going to get up this hill?

442
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I parked in some lot once for an audition on the Universal lot.

443
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And when I was leaving, accidentally drove into the tram ride.

444
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's very easy.

445
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's so easy to just accidentally be on the tram tour.

446
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I had to back up. It was right before they were going into the King Kong tunnel.

447
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I was like, wait a second.

448
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh, shit.

449
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I shouldn't be driving towards this skull display.

450
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yeah, because that's one of the things that's unique about Universal Hollywood.

451
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It is a theme park built into a movie studio, which is also a corporate headquarters.

452
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So you could be one of any number of disciplines or jobs or lifestyles crossing through each actors and executives and tourists.

453
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
My Ryan partner and partner on the podcast, Zach Reno and I both have passes.

454
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And any time that we have a meeting near there, we go pop in, pop in.

455
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And we say, welcome home.

456
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
We cross the threshold and we say, welcome home.

457
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Do you turn to each other and say it or do you just shout it?

458
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
To each other.

459
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
OK.

460
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
The day that me and Ryan Perez, past guest of the show, that we ended up on the lot for something.

461
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And we got to like, we like went and were part of Jaws.

462
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
We like went and reacted at the dock and like pretended we were supposed to be.

463
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That's very fun.

464
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
We acted like robots.

465
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So you were trespassing.

466
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You were just trespassing?

467
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah.

468
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And then we did get caught in the reaction.

469
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Just like, you guys supposed to be here?

470
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah.

471
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
No, you're not.

472
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
No, you're right.

473
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
All right.

474
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Well, get out of here.

475
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Like that's as far as it goes.

476
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And nobody's like, people loose on the lot.

477
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It's not it's not what happened to the gang from Big Fat Liar.

478
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yes.

479
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We wrote that in there.

480
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
The magic of the lot coming to life for two special children.

481
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
What a film.

482
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Every like every decade, there's some new movie that just uses the lot.

483
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It was The Wizard with Fred Savage, then Big Fat Liar.

484
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Waiting on that new one.

485
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Just using everything as is.

486
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah.

487
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
So yeah.

488
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So Japan has the Black Lake.

489
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Here at Hollywood, we have, we can see a cool feature of Hogsmeade here.

490
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,040
And they said they like encompass this or tried to use it in the view is you can see

491
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,200
mountain peaks like in the distance.

492
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,540
You can see the mountains, which is unique to here.

493
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:04,640
And then like the light, when they were designing it, they talked a lot about how they realized

494
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,280
like because you're on top of a hill at Universal Hollywood, like the sunlight, they could use

495
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:16,720
the light throughout the day to highlight different things and make sharp shadows and

496
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,800
that sort of thing.

497
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,720
Another feature of Universal Hollywood's Harry Potter land is that when you're eating at

498
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,800
Hogshead, sometimes you hear loudly playing nearby, do the Bartman.

499
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,440
It is very close to Springfield.

500
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
Super close.

501
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Yeah.

502
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,680
And which leads to an odd view from the other side of Disco Stu's disco with like the rising

503
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
peaks of Hogsmeade.

504
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,560
So I guess behind it, we've already like got it in the middle of this.

505
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,040
So yeah, we're officially now talking about Hogsmeade, right?

506
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,480
I mean, that's what we're doing.

507
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
We made it.

508
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
We arrived.

509
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,560
In case you couldn't tell.

510
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,240
This was the most seamless transition from intro to ride.

511
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,680
We usually have to do like a whole hard thing of like, now we're talking about this.

512
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
So I just wanted to.

513
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,320
It's again, Jess is a very candy potty.

514
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,680
We barricaded the door trapping her here after our plug.

515
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
So now she's just kind of going along with it.

516
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,680
What did you guys say?

517
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,760
Yeah, although we're talking about like, yeah, Japan has a big lake next to it.

518
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,600
I guess Islands of Adventure in Orlando does have a giant body of water in the middle,

519
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,960
but the illusion is kind of broken when you can see Marvel's superhero island or the Jurassic

520
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,160
Park visitor center.

521
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,500
When I went there before there was Wizarding World, I was like, Islands of Adventure is

522
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,920
one of my favorite theme parks.

523
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,320
It is still one of my favorite parks.

524
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,920
It's really, really good.

525
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,360
Nothing touches Disney for overall park.

526
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Oh yeah.

527
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,960
But like, man, that comes pretty close.

528
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,640
Yeah, there's a lot of satisfying rides.

529
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,640
I think that's probably the most, like the, of all, of any new park that's opened since

531
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,320
the Disney parks, since the main Disney World parks have been built.

532
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Yeah.

533
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,440
It's a like crazy new arrival on the scene and then adding Harry Potter to it makes it

534
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
like one of your best.

535
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
Yeah, just unbelievable.

536
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,840
Here's an interesting fact.

537
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:08,480
When Harry Potter opened in Florida that year in Orlando, a 36% increase in attendance to

538
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
Universal Orlando.

539
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,880
Yeah, they've been making so much money.

540
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,240
They've been making so much money.

541
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,420
In Hollywood, a 50% jump in attendance.

542
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,080
Cause let's be honest, Universal Hollywood, not that good of a theme park.

543
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
No.

544
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
It is a half day park.

545
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,080
It is a smaller park.

546
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,400
It's like a, it's a sweet little jaunt.

547
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,040
Cause it's a movie studio that has a theme park growing out of it and still growing.

548
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,480
I totally understand.

549
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,800
Uh, I don't hold it to the same standards as a full theme park.

550
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,840
I like it for what it is, but without Wizarding World.

551
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Yeah.

552
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,680
I mean like it just doesn't hold a candle to a full park.

553
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,560
It was my ninth birthday.

554
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,600
We went there with a group of friends and it was, it was like a fun day, but it's like

555
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,880
when one of the biggest attractions is backdraft where you just like stand and feel fire.

556
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,680
It's like, Oh sure.

557
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,800
This is not like, this is not the same like thrills and chills.

558
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Yeah.

559
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,880
They've done a lot better.

560
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,800
I think at like Simpsons World and now obviously Wizarding World, there's so much more immersive

561
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,760
feeling than the park used to feel when it was just like these disparate rides.

562
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,880
No real sense of like lands or.

563
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Yeah, absolutely.

564
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
Yeah.

565
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,040
They're finally doing like place making.

566
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,080
I went two days ago and prepped for this and I hadn't been to the one out here.

567
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,260
I hadn't been to Universal Hollywood in a while and not only like, I think it's really

568
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:28,520
great that the Harry Potter world has the whole streets that leads you into the ride.

569
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,240
It feels kind of a first for them.

570
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,760
They're starting to really improve the entrance of the park in general.

571
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,340
Like it finally has a vibe.

572
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,640
It's sort of like main street or the Karthik circle area.

573
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,680
Yeah, they're really leaning into like the art deco golden age Hollywood design.

574
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Which I think is great.

575
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,800
And when I went there at the holidays to see the lights on the Hogwarts castle, which was

576
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,560
great, fun, short, but like very delightful.

577
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,600
And I had the holiday meal.

578
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,940
We'll get back to food I'm sure.

579
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,640
But we have a lot of thoughts.

580
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
We got a lot of thoughts of it.

581
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Wait, let me change that.

582
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,960
I have a lot of thoughts of it.

583
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,360
But they like the Grinchmas is great.

584
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,420
Like it looks that Grinch tree is beautiful.

585
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,440
They have like a ton of fun stuff.

586
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,320
I was like, this is way to go guys.

587
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
You're up in your game.

588
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Yeah, they're really...

589
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,920
But I think a lot of that is probably they have a huge influx of money.

590
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,320
So now they can...

591
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
For sure.

592
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Yeah.

593
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,840
Universal in general, a lot of success with weird properties.

594
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,440
I don't think there's a lot of love for that Jim Carrey Grinch, but they do great attractions

595
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,480
off of it and Waterworld is...

596
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,160
There's talk of the Harry Potter expansion going into the Waterworld area, but I don't

597
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,080
know if they could replace it because Waterworld, it's extremely popular, extremely well reviewed.

598
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,880
Very well reviewed, multiple award winning I feel like.

599
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
It's a great show.

600
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
I saw it just in September again.

601
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
It was great.

602
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Yeah.

603
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,080
Splash Zone, not Splash Zone.

604
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,000
I was one seat beyond Splash Zone.

605
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Perfect.

606
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Just riding the line there.

607
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I got a little missed.

608
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,360
I feel like Universal Hollywood benefiting from the changing style of filmmaking where

609
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,240
they don't need as many giant sound stages anymore because unfortunately so much is shot

610
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,720
on green screens.

611
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
So they've already demolished a few sound...

612
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,720
International green screens.

613
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,200
You mean cannibalizing the actual lot?

614
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Yeah.

615
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Yeah.

616
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,080
Or rebuilding sound stage because they demolished two and just rebuilt them further back from

617
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
the park.

618
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,240
Away from the park and that will open up space that I don't know if this is officially in

619
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,160
the US but it seems like those demolished stages will be the Super Nintendo world.

620
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
Possibly.

621
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,520
So that you're not... it's right next to the rest of the park.

622
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,280
There's rumors about that though replacing animal actors for Nintendo Land.

623
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
Oh really?

624
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
That's a good chunk of Land.

625
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,000
They got a... boy there's big announcements that they have not... Secret Life of Pets

626
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
is kind of a flop stew.

627
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,320
But a lot of it's also limited by not only the presence of a movie studio, there's houses

628
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,520
so close to this park.

629
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,120
There's not a ton... there's no other theme park I feel like that has residential neighborhoods.

630
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,000
Like there's parts of the studio tour where you can look up and see someone's home.

631
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,160
Now what about this?

632
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,160
This might be controversial.

633
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Yeah.

634
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
Go ahead.

635
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,760
Can we get rid of Summer City Walk?

636
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,960
Oh sure.

637
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Wait a... hold on a second.

638
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
I got no...

639
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Hold on.

640
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Which part?

641
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
What do you think?

642
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,960
Yeah what do you think?

643
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,960
You think that opens up like Land for...

644
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,280
That could open up some Land and do we really need that long of a walk?

645
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,320
That City Walk has I think it's got... there's some fat you could cut off that City Walk.

646
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,360
Well the sock market has to say.

647
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Yeah obviously I'm not insane.

648
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
I'm a big fan.

649
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
Love the sock market.

650
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,040
The empty for five years John Levitz Comedy Club obviously has to say.

651
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Has to say.

652
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Diner.

653
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,360
In remembrance.

654
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,040
That water massage place gotta stay.

655
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
Zen zone.

656
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,040
Zen zone.

657
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,280
The back area past the movie theater where I believe...

658
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,120
Where the Margaritaville is?

659
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Yeah like...

660
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
You're stepping into it.

661
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,720
Well I think you keep a Margaritaville but I think that doesn't get foot traffic.

662
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:01,040
They just move the Margaritaville closer to the front like or make it more central.

663
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,840
Like put it where John Levitz is.

664
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,720
You basically you want to demolish the part that's close to the park but then just move

665
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
some of those good things.

666
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
Yeah but you got the parking garages.

667
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,920
Yeah I think it's the hiding garage.

668
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,560
I think there's also if you look up in parts of CityWalk there's office buildings.

669
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,360
There's technically office buildings above it.

670
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,560
But wouldn't you prefer your office to be in Gringotts?

671
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,960
Yeah for sure.

672
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,840
I mean there was rumors that turned out to go nowhere that there was going to be a Great

673
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Hall restaurant.

674
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
I know.

675
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,200
You could enter from the park or CityWalk.

676
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,100
This may have just been a whisper down the line sort of thing that never happened.

677
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,040
Whispered by you and me to each other.

678
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,880
We were so like that was so...

679
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,680
We talked about it every week I think.

680
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,440
Can I talk about a missed opportunity for some some magic making?

681
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Yeah sure.

682
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:53,400
Okay now this is sort of conflating narratives but I think there's an opportunity when you

683
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,520
again I'm skipping to food.

684
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Should we?

685
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Should I not?

686
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
Should I hold this?

687
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
No.

688
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Yeah yeah.

689
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
We want to go there.

690
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Let's go.

691
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Let's go there.

692
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
We want to talk about it so much.

693
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,680
This is not going to be the only Harry Potter episode.

694
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
No.

695
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,040
This probably won't be the only Hogsmeade episode honestly.

696
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,600
There's so much to cover.

697
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
So much.

698
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Let's not box ourselves in.

699
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Yeah.

700
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
For expansion.

701
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Yeah expansion pads.

702
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,960
If we take some tangents I think that's fine.

703
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,000
But yeah food is a big part of this because like you said this is a very immersive area.

704
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,800
I go there often just to be at 3Broom6.

705
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,260
Yeah it's great.

706
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,800
I love it when I sit there that is like peak moment of feeling in the world.

707
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,160
I love that building.

708
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,360
It looks beautiful.

709
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:43,240
I love entering on the Hogshead side and getting a pumpkin fizz and maybe a shot of fire whiskey

710
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
on the side.

711
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Oh no.

712
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
Sure.

713
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,000
You know just some drink hacks which I'm there are more drinks in Orlando.

714
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,560
I want to get more of these drinks.

715
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,320
Yeah there's more drinks.

716
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,560
There's also different food.

717
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:59,080
This is a big thing because I went on Yelp and I found the menus for both 3Broom6 and

718
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,240
they're a little different.

719
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,520
And some of the food is at 3Broom6 in Orlando and some is at Leaky Cauldron.

720
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,840
And out here I feel like they went like all right what sells best at both these places.

721
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:14,680
And we're like which I miss in Orlando they have like Cornish pasties which is not a common

722
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
food in America.

723
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,880
And I'm like oh I wish they had that out here.

724
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,920
I don't recognize this word.

725
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,920
What is it?

726
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
Pasties?

727
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,240
Pasties is like a hand pie.

728
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,240
Like a meat pie.

729
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Meat pie yeah meat and pie.

730
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
And they're delicious.

731
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
Yeah.

732
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Well yeah incredible.

733
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
They're incredible.

734
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,680
I think there's a so you I feel like the queue is really well run.

735
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,280
You order and then you get you know standard theme park you know like order pay pick it

736
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,800
up from a different window.

737
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,320
But I think you could you can see the open kitchen and I think they you should not be

738
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,680
able to see the kitchen.

739
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,600
Yeah you see bobbing house you see like bobbing house elf.

740
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
Oh yeah.

741
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
Oh you just see an animatronic.

742
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Yeah that's smart.

743
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,040
That's a shadow projection that kitchen and a lot of people probably don't know this because

744
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,560
they're normal.

745
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,600
That is a shared kitchen with all the Simpsons restaurants.

746
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
That's hilarious.

747
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:14,320
But yeah but a very well run because they also like once you order and pay they find

748
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,140
you a table and they bring the food out.

749
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,280
So like sometimes theme park restaurants are like the Wild West in terms of like yeah you

750
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,160
got to order there might not be a seat.

751
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,440
Good luck you're on your own.

752
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Yeah yeah.

753
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,780
Be our guest tavern.

754
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,360
That's kind of a mess around there.

755
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,720
Yeah that's on the better end of Disneyland restaurants and it's still it's a little.

756
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Oh is that right.

757
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,720
I think so.

758
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,200
In terms of seating and.

759
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,600
You mean the formerly village house.

760
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah what am I talking about Gaston's what's that place actually called.

761
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Where.

762
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You know what I mean.

763
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Fantasyland.

764
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,280
The one that they repurpose so they repurpose the village house which is right by the Pinocchio

765
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,800
ride and they call it like the Red Rose Tavern.

766
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
There it is.

767
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
I'm sorry.

768
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Jason got it.

769
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Jason got the poll.

770
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800
No more three star reviews.

771
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,000
Look I can mess up the name of a restaurant.

772
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,080
Get off me.

773
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,520
No I think I think be our guest restaurant in Florida is run more like the three broomsticks

774
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,680
that you would wear with an RFI.

775
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,400
Yes like thing.

776
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,200
And then they find you a table they bring your food appears.

777
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,600
I've never had my food brought to a table at three broomsticks.

778
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,840
Really Yeah.

779
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,740
You do you always just wait.

780
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,760
I get on that little tray and then they'll help you find a table if there isn't one.

781
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,960
I think you take your tray.

782
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,360
I think I think you take your tray.

783
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,380
Oh leaky cauldron in Florida.

784
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,760
That's they bring the food out.

785
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
That's great.

786
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,760
Or maybe not.

787
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,480
Well this universe I don't know who's in and we're here.

788
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,560
I'd also be different if it's crowded versus if it's not.

789
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
Yeah I don't know.

790
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,960
We're going to get torn up in the comments on all this misinformation.

791
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,960
Find a seat.

792
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,960
Yes I've I've been there when it's slammed and they help you find a seat and I've been

793
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,680
there when it's not slammed and so you're just it's just like yeah yeah you're you're

794
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,160
fine.

795
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,600
We had like we went there in a really crowded summer day with like my brother my sister

796
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,840
in law and like kids and we had like a super helpful guy get us like a nice big table.

797
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,520
Yeah they're great about that but there isn't you pick up your food at that tray that tray

798
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,920
station and then take it to your table.

799
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,560
Also that restaurant and the surrounding patio I forget it holds an obscene amount of people

800
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,440
it holds hundreds of people in there.

801
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
It's incredible.

802
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,000
Like we like spend a bunch of time walking through that space without even ordering food.

803
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,720
It's just like a cool environment to walk.

804
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:23,560
The hogshead side is great that the hogshead is like so perfect.

805
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:29,280
It's like just it's just frequent enough and it's like grunts and in head turning.

806
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,360
It's like charming without being like distracting or hard to order.

807
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,160
It's like that you want it to be like the kid sees it and points it out to his dad and

808
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,920
then he turns and then it doesn't do anything.

809
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,920
Yeah.

810
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
And you want the kid to look crazy.

811
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,920
Yeah.

812
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
That's the fun of it.

813
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,720
And I like that the sign is like broken and crooked out front.

814
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,200
And I feel like on a medium traffic day a lot of people don't know that you can get

815
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,920
all kinds of butter beer on that side.

816
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,200
You don't have to wait by the right or beer trucks.

817
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,080
No which typically have longer lines you can get hot cold.

818
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
Yes.

819
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,080
Frozen.

820
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
Frozen.

821
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
Yeah.

822
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,280
And I'm personally really into the pumpkin fizz myself.

823
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,880
I've never had the pumpkin juice.

824
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,400
It's pumpkin juice with club soda and it's.

825
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,680
Oh that's dynamite.

826
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Yeah.

827
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,680
Interesting.

828
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,040
So all the beers are made for Universal all of the Harry Potter beers.

829
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,840
Although we joked Mike and I a long time ago because we were reading about Diagon Alley

830
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,760
and one of the listings was like all of the different Harry Potter beers and then also

831
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:30,280
like and Coors Light like they broke it at one point and then they I think they changed

832
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,040
it but there's no Coke.

833
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,440
You can't like get Coke.

834
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,440
No.

835
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,440
You can only get like pumpkin fizz or lemon squash or butter beer.

836
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:46,320
They have they have a few on the I think on both sides they have a couple other non Harry

837
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,980
Potter brewed beers.

838
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,840
But they're not but they are like they're more like British they have like London Pride

839
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Guinness, Magners, Cider.

840
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,920
I think I saw a Stella maybe.

841
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,160
But they like that they aged the taps.

842
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,160
Yeah the taps are great.

843
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,960
Even if it's a brand you know it's all scratched up and it looks cool.

844
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Yeah it's great.

845
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,960
Love that part.

846
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,400
Like the parts outside like all that they like they have chips or candy bars for sale

847
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,040
and it's all British candy.

848
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,680
Yeah of course in honeydukes it's all packaged for like the world.

849
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,200
The chocolate frogs and I think honeydukes could be better.

850
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:28,300
I like I like the look of it but I feel like the products are slightly limited and are

851
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,700
never rotated.

852
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,760
Like I thought that there was going to be more holiday treats.

853
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,720
Oh that's true.

854
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,520
I mean they were they put out like a I feel like this is a like I said about that rolling

855
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,920
out the Phelps to introduce something I feel like there was a story a while back of like

856
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:52,520
honeydukes now has butter beer fudge everyone and it's like a new era has begun.

857
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,040
It's the kind of press event we're all trying to get into.

858
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,040
Yeah we're all on it.

859
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,200
The sweet podcast the ride card we hope to pull one day.

860
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,400
I wish I wish three broomsticks would rotate the food menu a little more.

861
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,720
Yeah there's lots of other British foods that I know the Pat joke is that like British food

862
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,600
is terrible but it's like if you put a crust on it and cover it in gravy it's delicious.

863
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:20,880
Yes yeah because we got let's see you got your beef stew your Guinness stew.

864
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,960
You got your fish and chips and chips.

865
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,960
Bangers and mash.

866
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,760
Shepherd's pie bangers and mash.

867
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,720
The lemon roasted chicken.

868
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,880
The ribs the like there's a bear ribs.

869
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,840
Jess is doing this off the dome by the way.

870
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,840
Yeah pretty good.

871
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:40,680
I have the menu in front of me and she's got it every like almost every check.

872
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,200
You got and then there's obviously the feast but I think there's also a Sunday roast.

873
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,200
There is a Sunday roast.

874
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,080
And then there's also you can get salads and they have three soups.

875
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,480
There's a potato soup there's a cheese ale soup.

876
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
That sounds good.

877
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,640
It's just good I've had that.

878
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,000
How many times do you how many meals have you had there do you think.

879
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,960
I have had probably 10 to 15.

880
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,240
I try to keep track of my business expenses and I like highlight three broomsticks on

881
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,160
my credit card bill knowing that it's a writing meeting between Zach and I.

882
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,160
Of course.

883
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
So I can write it off.

884
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,160
Sure yeah.

885
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,120
Yeah we're like we often go there and just like blue sky ideas.

886
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,480
Have a butter beer have some fish and chips.

887
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,160
That lemon chicken is really good if you want like a lighter.

888
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,080
Yeah there's also a sauteed asparagus platter.

889
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,080
Oh yeah.

890
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,080
Yeah sorry I missed that.

891
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,080
Yeah.

892
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:38,800
I had the holiday meal at Christmas time which was like turkey and it came with like a sausage

893
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:46,160
roll and no not a sausage roll it came with a sausage like cabbage.

894
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,160
It was great.

895
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,800
It really seems like all of that.

896
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,180
I did not eat there but the fact you've been there so many times and everybody's speaking

897
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,560
so highly of it like often like a good theme park restaurant is still like an impression

898
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,280
of a real restaurant.

899
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,680
It sounds like all this is legit.

900
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,680
I think the deficient chips and the shepherd's pie tastes totally like I got them at a pub

901
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:11,880
maybe not like the best part of the world but like I think they taste like yeah yeah

902
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,880
yeah.

903
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,400
So in Orlando at the three group.

904
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,400
Yeah go ahead.

905
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,240
Love it Cornish pasties.

906
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,160
They just have a rotisserie smoked chicken spare ribs.

907
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,000
We said that they have a chicken and ribs combo platter.

908
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,480
And then of course they there also serve a big turkey leg very popular more popular in

909
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,520
Orlando than like Southern California as a theme.

910
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,320
I mean you get you get them at theme parks certainly.

911
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,320
I think that's it.

912
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,800
It's a common Disneyland food isn't it.

913
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,120
Yeah yeah.

914
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:44,640
I've never been that into it because I don't like the I don't like how sweet they taste.

915
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,640
Yeah.

916
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,760
Nick Weiger previously just dissed the giant turkey leg on our last episode and sent Jason

917
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,040
into a rage.

918
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,000
I don't think that's an accurate assessment.

919
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,160
Hey but we should say with them we that led to us we got our first piece of fan art mission.

920
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,400
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

921
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:08,880
We requested fan art of Jason driving around a Mark Twain riverboat made out of cake piloting

922
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,960
it with holding a big turkey leg.

923
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,960
That's amazing.

924
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,960
And this was made for us.

925
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,960
This exists.

926
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,600
We should shout out the specific Twitter user.

927
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,600
Yeah.

928
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,600
Thank you.

929
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,080
My wife saw this and lit up like it was Christmas.

930
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,720
I just had high on it for like two days.

931
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,480
Well this should be the you know if that's all that happened in 2018.

932
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,200
Joseph Mulatto at 73 door on Twitter.

933
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,200
Here you can see.

934
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Oh gosh.

935
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,200
That's very good.

936
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:46,080
I got my hair swooped that I sometimes like and sometimes I'm self-conscious about.

937
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,080
Oh it's great.

938
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,240
It's part of the it's like Conan's hair.

939
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,240
It's your logo.

940
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,240
Yeah it's.

941
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,240
I feel good about that.

942
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,240
People have spoken.

943
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,920
But yeah the giant birthday cake Mark Twain made my day.

944
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,920
Hooray.

945
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,840
Anyway but turkey legs represented in there.

946
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,320
Yes we're open all turkey leg opinions on this podcast.

947
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,320
So you're welcome.

948
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:11,600
I get their appeal and I like I feel like the older I get the more I am into like quicker

949
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,280
walkable options at a theme park.

950
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
Which I like.

951
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,320
You know the bangle barbecue sort of like school of thought where you just have like

952
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,120
a skewer of skewer of meat you can do something a little smaller if you if you don't want

953
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,520
to do sit down for both your meals in the day.

954
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,860
So I get their appeal.

955
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,600
Me personally when they when meats are smoked and they get that sweet flavor I just don't

956
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,600
like it.

957
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,600
Yeah so it's less turkey leg.

958
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,560
I mean that applies to some hams and meat you know.

959
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,560
Yeah for sure.

960
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,400
So I don't need another rage cage over here.

961
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,400
No he'll he'll.

962
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Stop judging.

963
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:50,600
What do we think of the there's the at honeydukes the every flavor beans.

964
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,600
No thanks.

965
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,600
With the huh.

966
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,600
No thanks.

967
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:58,360
Well with that being said I do with your no thanks I do have a package.

968
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,360
Well every flavor beans here.

969
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,360
Packaging is great.

970
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,360
Yes.

971
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,920
I think that's one thing about honeydukes is like this is stuff sold as souvenirs and

972
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,040
stuff people are bringing back.

973
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,400
Totally the chocolate frog boxes are gorgeous.

974
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,520
They're gorgeous pretty good like good chocolate.

975
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,760
Totally the chocolate.

976
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,280
I just wish there was like oh I were unique maybe.

977
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,720
Yeah like there could be.

978
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,920
I think they have to sell out every flavor beans like I've gone through as a fan I've

979
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:30,320
like had them before and I just like I'm not into this roulette but like they have to have

980
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,320
them.

981
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,160
There's no world where they can't have fudge flies.

982
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,440
Those I think are the best actual candy.

983
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,440
Yeah the fudge flies.

984
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,880
Yeah the chocolate frogs are like rich and big and the box is gorgeous and you get a

985
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,880
card.

986
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,880
They're great.

987
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,240
I think that that the fact that they have a fudge stand in there with some other like

988
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,480
treats is a real missed opportunity.

989
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,640
There's like a cauldron cake but it looks kind of ridiculous.

990
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,720
And there's like I think we could have many treacle tart tarts.

991
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,520
I think we could be selling some of the desserts from three broomsticks there.

992
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:04,920
Why can't I get a like the the freakin sticky toffee pudding here or that almost looks like

993
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,960
it could be like a mini soda fountain stand where they're like another opportunity or

994
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,640
just the fact that they have that glass case and it never looks appealing because it's

995
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,800
just sort of like standard fudge.

996
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,680
There is some standard like candy from the park confectionary in there.

997
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:24,880
That just doesn't feel like the best execution of there's so few things you get to go in

998
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,820
and touch and feel and explore like we could I think we could bump it up.

999
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,840
But you know more events as time goes on more opportunities for the Phelps to show up and

1000
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:41,080
town your desserts I bet they'll it probably is a good area for them to like you know kind

1001
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,840
of juice the park a little like we have this thing now we have that thing now.

1002
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Yeah.

1003
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,760
How much of this like I'm not familiar with the books but it seems like there are so many

1004
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:57,240
like apologies I should have read all seven of them this week before the pug but the but

1005
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:02,640
like like are the are all these desserts like laid out this thoroughly.

1006
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,640
It's crazy.

1007
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,680
I have not read the books either I've seen all the movies.

1008
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,520
I'm going to get into it one day one day.

1009
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,760
I'm also not a good reader.

1010
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,320
It's the best audio book in the game.

1011
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,680
I should do that to yourself.

1012
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,760
I should do that to me and make those L.A. drives a joy while listening to Jim Dale.

1013
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,760
OK.

1014
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,760
It's the best.

1015
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,760
All right.

1016
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,760
I'll do it all.

1017
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,760
I re listen to five six and seven.

1018
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,760
Really.

1019
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,760
Yeah.

1020
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,480
This year I added four because I found it in my childhood bedroom like on disk.

1021
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,840
I was like I'm going to add four to the mix too.

1022
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,600
And it's great because what's been described about the books and like the movies seem to

1023
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,320
people are like movies are fine.

1024
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,840
Yeah but the books are joyous.

1025
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,480
I like the I like the idea of the book so much.

1026
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,480
The idea is great.

1027
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,680
It feels like very much like when I was a kid in the X-Men felt like oh you get to go

1028
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:49,080
to this place and you're special and you have powers and then you fight people.

1029
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,500
I don't know why that's part of the fantasy as a kid but it is that's fun.

1030
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,240
So like the ones like cables giant guns in the 90s.

1031
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,000
He's always trying to grow up.

1032
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,640
Jason always trying to cram the X-Men character cable into the podcast.

1033
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,280
Hey look when that new Deadpool comes out everyone's going to have cable fever.

1034
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,280
He is.

1035
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,640
Yeah Josh Brolin Josh Brolin is cable he bowls.

1036
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,640
What a world.

1037
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,440
It's fun casting but but what's been described to me about the books that's so great is that

1038
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:21,240
the detail is incredible food where you live what your quarters are like and and so like

1039
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,600
yeah when you're reading about desserts you're imagining eating the desserts.

1040
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:31,160
So it's extremely vivid and also like I think that movies do a good job of this production

1041
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:37,360
design like you don't picture any of these stores as like organized shelves which I think

1042
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,480
that maybe that's my other problem with honeydukes is like even if you can't buy it why isn't

1043
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:48,040
there like production design where it's like a town more like how the wants to store looks

1044
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,640
all vendors where it's like a tower of sugar quills that's about to fall over.

1045
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:57,440
Yeah like it should look more higgled higgled biggled like yeah it just doesn't like if

1046
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,520
you look at the way that they do wizard Weasley's wizard wheezes in the sixth movie is great

1047
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,800
like boxes coming out of everywhere.

1048
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,160
It shouldn't look organized like a wizard doesn't need to be organized they can just

1049
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,880
like summon the box they need like they don't need it to be like perfectly catalog.

1050
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,440
I think the honeydukes shelves look a little too clean for my money which that is the thing

1051
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:23,360
that happened in Orlando like when the Orlando hogs made first open they split like honeydukes

1052
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,840
was also like half song goes which is here.

1053
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:32,280
Yeah and then when they open Diagon Alley they just purge the Zonko is and hogs mead

1054
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,880
and expanded honeydukes and opened a big Zonko in Florida.

1055
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:41,800
That's so like you can go in the Zonko and there is like a working facade with the hat

1056
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,000
tipping that's great which is great.

1057
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,840
And then you can go across the street to I'm going to mess this up for lean for Tesco's

1058
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,320
ice cream parlor.

1059
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,320
You can order.

1060
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320
Well that Fabian.

1061
00:56:52,320 --> 00:57:00,040
But it's yeah so it's an ice cream for you Florian Florian he goes missing in the books

1062
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,040
it's really so easy.

1063
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,320
Yeah well his ice cream is delicious.

1064
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:09,280
You can order the ice cream that Harry gets it is so when he thinks Hagrid might still

1065
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,600
be just a guy abducting him and buy some ice cream.

1066
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,120
That ice cream parlor is unbelievable.

1067
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,720
I will say this we will stop talking about Diagon maybe.

1068
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,800
Well we don't have to but it Diagon is so good.

1069
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,800
It's the best place ever except for maybe the ride which again we'll do another episode

1070
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,340
of it really except for the ride.

1071
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:30,280
The ride is good but like not as good as is the Forbidden Journey.

1072
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,280
Oh OK.

1073
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,280
Oh I thought it was the other way around.

1074
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,920
I thought I've heard Gringotts is crazy but you know it's no for been during.

1075
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:43,600
I'll say this and Forbidden Journey I think is still the best theme park ride currently

1076
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,480
in the world and certainly the most innovative.

1077
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,040
I don't know that anyone's topped it yet and it's eight years old at this point.

1078
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,880
It's gorgeous.

1079
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,640
The line is amazing.

1080
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:03,240
All of the little storytelling along the way getting to see Ron, Harry, Hermione, Dumbledore.

1081
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,280
It's so good.

1082
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,560
The mix of the medias of that ride is incredible.

1083
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,000
It is a little dizzy making.

1084
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,560
Yeah I had a bit of a rough time on there and we should say the Universal Hollywood

1085
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:22,600
one was 3D when it opened and now is not 3D and I'm really glad I didn't do it 3D because

1086
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,600
I was nauseous as it was.

1087
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,160
It was way too much 3D.

1088
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:32,920
I think there was my friend went with her family and her aunt had to spend hours in

1089
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:38,440
a sick tent that had been set up for multiple people having barfing and dizzy spells.

1090
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,040
So I also think there was like before they got rid of the glasses the 3D component I

1091
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,140
think there was like well let's try to just like recalibrate a little bit so there was

1092
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:50,360
like I think they made some of the movements slightly less intense and then they were like

1093
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,160
we have to do even more and got rid of the glasses and now I think it's like pretty great.

1094
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
They just upgraded.

1095
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,800
Is it 4K now?

1096
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,280
Some of them they were upgrading to 4K.

1097
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,560
I think they were upgrading the old ones.

1098
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,360
I think this one was a higher def already because it was newer.

1099
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,920
Did it go down for a while?

1100
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,320
Was it like a financial issue for them to shut the ride down?

1101
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
I don't think it was.

1102
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,320
It was a quick thing.

1103
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:14,140
Yeah so when it first opened they were just pretty standard 3D glasses.

1104
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:18,600
There was a very brief period where they had Quidditch Goggle 3D glasses which were cool.

1105
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:24,640
I mean they were cool to hold and wear and look at but yeah I mean it is a dizzy making

1106
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,640
ride.

1107
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,400
It uses so yeah let's just get into Forbidden Journey.

1108
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,120
So Forbidden Journey uses what's called KUKA arm robotic arm technology and it's got an

1109
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,680
insane range of movement.

1110
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:40,720
Like you can go a full 180 degrees up and down like you practically go up and down upside

1111
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,120
down at one point which is crazy for like a family ride.

1112
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:49,240
Is there anything we can describe where you see a KUKA arm like if you've been on the

1113
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,160
tram tour I forget if this is still there but the summer I started working there there's

1114
00:59:53,160 --> 01:00:00,520
this truly awful stop on the tram tour that was the it is gone okay yeah fast and furious

1115
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:07,000
whatever that I forgot the subtitle was it a Tokyo Drift thing but the like cars fly

1116
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,320
at you on these big arms and then they swivel around and they dance for you to a Daddy Yankee

1117
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:19,280
song but if you it was a Gasolina or something I had to hear Gasolina three to four times

1118
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,160
a day every day and just watch like no one enjoyed it.

1119
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,400
I never saw a tram he was the guy on the tram tour.

1120
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,280
I'd still do it if I could what a what a blast and if it was a little more than minimum wage

1121
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,920
but the hell of a job though but the like yeah was that a KUKA arm?

1122
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,920
Those are KUKA arms.

1123
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:43,640
That's maybe the first universal's first use of KUKA arms and I think like it was it was

1124
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,800
like them putting a foot in the door with that technology because it was technology

1125
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:53,560
that Disney could use too and then in preparation for Harry Potter they bought the exclusive

1126
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:58,200
theme park rights to the KUKA arms so Disney like had rides in development that would have

1127
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,560
used these things and in fact they also appear in Stitch's Great Escape there's these like

1128
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,860
arms that are oh yeah the laser cannons are arms there you go yeah yeah those are those

1129
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:12,160
are KUKAs but Universal bought the exclusive rights so they pushed Disney out of the KUKA

1130
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,920
game in terms of Harry Potter it's almost like if you imagine yourself sitting on a

1131
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:22,040
couch and then if on the back of the couch there was a an arm that could move the couch

1132
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,320
any direction it please yeah I think it's called an arm because it has a full range

1133
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:30,360
of movement it literally can move you anywhere show you anything and like you're so surprised

1134
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,940
when you end up upside down or whatever like I remember getting on the ride for the first

1135
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:39,000
time in Florida and just the fact that they're like whatever the restraints coming down are

1136
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,080
always like oh god what's happening here but I was like very nervous because I honestly

1137
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,720
didn't know what the ride was going to do and you're on it and it's still finding new

1138
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,100
moves not tipping in the commercials what the ride was they mostly showed like the footage

1139
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:57,620
of Harry in the Quidditch game in the marketing and stuff and you still as you're on it you

1140
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:02,440
are not really sure what the hell's happening it's pretty hard to get your head around the

1141
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:07,960
ride mechanism I have on wire I do what that would look like if the lights were on I have

1142
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:14,980
no idea what that show building looks like I think the closest it feels to me is like

1143
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:20,360
if you could put the Indiana Jones car on an arm and like some of you know like in terms

1144
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,320
of like how many separate like chambers it feels like you're in oh sure and like weaving

1145
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:31,560
a narrative a journey you know like if that ride instead of being in a Jeep you were being

1146
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:37,000
moved and tipped backwards and had a little bit more screenplay yeah yeah yeah and and

1147
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
you know our only complaint about the Indiana Jones ride which we covered early on is that

1148
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,120
there's there are kind of like weird dead spaces in it there's literally like you're

1149
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:49,680
you're in transit from one room to another so there's maybe a projection effect or something

1150
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,160
but it's a mostly like black room that you're going through boy the Forbidden Journey is

1151
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,720
all action there is no dead space anywhere in that thing yeah I think the deadest space

1152
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,160
is the dementor beat but like in terms of like the walls and the ceiling having the

1153
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:07,160
least going on but you still have giant dementors right in it yeah things are great the one

1154
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:12,240
that sort of follows along with you where it's arm motion matches yours yeah this is

1155
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:18,680
all I'm it's it's scary scary I don't like them I don't like them yeah just giant puppets

1156
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:24,080
is another I think we talked at an episode recently about like oh an alien encounter

1157
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:29,720
a lot of the scares and the this old Disney ride alien encounter are just old theatrical

1158
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:36,360
techniques lighting cues sound cues like breath on your neck like it's just an air cannon

1159
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:41,600
and and like the dementors are just giant puppets hanging from a ceiling but they get

1160
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:46,360
and they're not even they're probably still like 8 10 feet away but they get close to

1161
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:51,680
you unlike that like Disney has a comfortable space between usually between you and something

1162
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,440
scary and universal feels like they go like two feet closer it feels like they're a little

1163
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,120
more comfortable putting it like heat like yeah four feet in front of you speaking of

1164
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:06,200
Indiana again I remember that that time that I went when it first opened we we did go on

1165
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:11,800
it like two times and my we went with like another family and my friend Chris Swanson

1166
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:16,080
and I were both terrified of the giant snake yeah it's the last time I went on and I was

1167
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:22,960
like this is so funny it's like a cartoon looking snake yes like a little bit it's like

1168
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,640
splitting the line between realistic it's all I mean it's obviously not realistic because

1169
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,640
it's gigantic but like even its eye and face shape are like halfway between a real snake

1170
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:39,680
and like an artistic like a cartoon snake but we used to know that third row third seat

1171
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:45,160
in was where the snake mostly came and we both like did not want to be in that seat

1172
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,400
and I remember like she was in it the first time and the way that we were like lined up

1173
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,880
she was going to be in again and we were walking in and she sat in the second seat she's like

1174
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:56,320
I'm not doing it again and I was like fine and sat there and like got to that part when

1175
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:01,560
you know full hands over completely like eyes closed it's like I can't handle this snake

1176
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:06,160
that's right where we talked about before Mike and I broke down on that that ride broke

1177
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:12,280
down the ride broke down we didn't break down and some of the lights in the building came

1178
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:17,120
on but I feel like the snake kept moving I feel like this yeah I think he did come down

1179
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,120
like he would come down every five like whatever minute or something we were there for a few

1180
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:25,400
minutes where do you least want to get stuck in Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey

1181
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:31,200
and the dementors or looking up at the Whomping Willow might be a little tricky the spider

1182
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:36,080
I think the spider I don't like either looking up at the spider once that wasn't super you

1183
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:41,600
broke down or the ride broke down a little bit better I think it stopped at the dementors

1184
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,800
too I do not like yeah the dementors the first time Lindsay and my girlfriend Lindsay and

1185
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:52,880
I went on it in Orlando we were freaked out and I guess we're not very tough people but

1186
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,320
then we would tell people like this is like the scariest ride and everyone who went on

1187
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,880
would be like what do you that wasn't that scary like what's right and made us feel like

1188
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,540
real like you come back here with your scaredy-cat boy yeah we all got your back we started a

1189
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:08,640
podcast because we're three scared boys and then Jason tries to act like he's the tough

1190
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:16,840
guy the three of us but he's still scared we know yeah Hollywood Hollywood would they

1191
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,880
a difference between Hollywood and Orlando even more dementors like there's a whole room

1192
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:27,600
of dementors extra dementors in Hollywood Hollywood okay I mean I went on it in Orlando

1193
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:33,600
but that was probably 2011 so it's been yeah yeah it's been a minute since I remember comparing

1194
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:38,600
and contrasting the ride this is also funny that like to go on in Orlando and I like went

1195
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:43,560
on both dueling dragons and the unicorn like the rides that got turned into flight of the

1196
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:48,840
hippogriff and the the dragon ride from gobble to fire so both of the other rides that were

1197
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:53,360
there at the time I had been on so it's like sure you know this is the star but I don't

1198
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:58,320
remember the differences now between it yeah well dragon challenge recently closed in fall

1199
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:04,640
of 2017 it's dead end in hell now as we say right well because they're making a new badass

1200
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:09,600
e-ticket Harry Potter ride another brand new Harry Potter do we know anything about it

1201
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:15,480
possibly a coaster it's a coaster type thing supposedly but I don't is it possibly through

1202
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:20,360
the woods yeah some woods thing I'm we're not there's I like them having a big true

1203
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:26,040
coaster I think it will be anything offhand you anything that's not covered in the existing

1204
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:31,440
rides that you would be excited to see is oh my gosh Scott that's a dream question I

1205
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:40,600
know what you mean I'd feel a lot of pressure to so good car no no if that noise is which

1206
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:46,800
I think is good for like not spoilers I feel like the books of the world's favor books

1207
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:52,360
three and below which I think is correct in terms of like spoilers and stuff like that

1208
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,360
and like knowing that a kid might be going there and having only read the first books

1209
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,760
that you don't want to introduce them with too much lore that's from like the later books

1210
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,720
especially since the books get more serious oh you mean when they start to become analogies

1211
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:13,120
for the Blitz yeah for what we're trying exactly or like yeah exactly so I think I think they

1212
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:20,840
are they walk that line correctly but I think we'll make a dope coaster is thressels which

1213
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:26,760
are the the winged horses that we meet in an order of the Phoenix you can only see if

1214
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:33,660
you've witnessed death so when they use them to fly half of the like Harry and Neville

1215
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:38,240
and Luna can see them but the other ones are flying on an invisible horse so that would

1216
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:42,800
make an incredible coaster I think like a journey from the Forbidden Forest to London

1217
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:49,240
to the Ministry of Magic but you making it in whatever way you could feel like you can't

1218
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:54,760
see the thing below you maybe like some Six Flags Tatsu maybe it's more of like a lay

1219
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:59,440
down fly feeling coaster but I think that's offhand I mean I could think of some more

1220
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:06,400
but I think that sensation is described so well about like Harry realized like they Harry

1221
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:12,760
Neville and and Luna all like hop on they look like reptilian horses that have like

1222
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:18,400
bat wings and they but they're like horse size and the three kids who've seen death

1223
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:23,120
can like just hop on them and the other three are like this is there's nothing here and

1224
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:28,040
they have to like be helped onto an invisible horse I think obviously you can't make a coaster

1225
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:33,640
invisible but like something that could approximate the sensation translucent maybe somehow what's

1226
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,080
below you or having like a couple of beats where like you have that weightlessness of

1227
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:44,520
like not seeing the track like X2 at Six Flags does this where you can't see the track guys

1228
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,160
let me think on it sounds really we'll revisit in 20 minutes I mean while we're talking anything

1229
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:53,800
occurs to you well if we're blathering on about dry facts and your mind wanders feel

1230
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:59,880
free I feel like a lot of speculation for a long time too was a Ministry of Magic attraction

1231
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,960
Ministry of Magic battle attraction yeah they're building something else in Orlando as well

1232
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,480
next to Diagon Alley they're building something we're not sure what it is but it might be

1233
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,640
a Ministry of Magic I feel like they are oh they're not slowing down and a third park

1234
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:18,040
at Universal could have it too do we get another stop of Hogwarts Express they've talked about

1235
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,080
it depends where the park goes I think but Ministry of Magic they've talked about making

1236
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:25,720
a whole land there's a whole thing as it is though you still are buying a ticket to Islands

1237
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:30,560
of Adventure to access this you have to buy if you want to go to park ticket to get both

1238
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,040
so this did that was a big thing when it opened and there's never been done before you ride

1239
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:40,280
an attraction to travel between parks yeah so Diagon is in the regular Universal Park

1240
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:46,120
oh my word yeah yeah you it's what a thing they figured out works as a monorail right

1241
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:52,840
like taking you between parks and you so you you can't do Diagon with just an Islands of

1242
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,640
Adventure ticket you need a park hopper you need a park like a park and they have in the

1243
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,400
King's babies in King Cross Station you can like there has to be an attendant there to

1244
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,520
sell you an upgrade because some people don't know it so they go to the attraction thinking

1245
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,360
they can do the train and then they go no and then they have to upsell so there's a

1246
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,040
whole person there to deal with tourists that might not actually know about that I think

1247
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:20,680
there is one way you could do so I think you get a one past one park ticket for Universal

1248
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:29,040
Florida and see all of Diagon and then after Islands of Adventure closes they do still

1249
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:33,160
University of Florida usually stays open later than Islands of Adventure so they still run

1250
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:37,720
the Hogwarts Express you just take the round trip the trade essentially goes back got it

1251
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,560
so you would you would not get to do Forbidden Journey then you would not get to do Forbidden

1252
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:48,120
Journey or I think one park holders might be able to ride the train at night after Islands

1253
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:54,160
closes interesting because like I remember the first time I went to Diagon Alley they're

1254
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:57,680
like oh you can go on the train you can't get off at the other park but you can just

1255
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:04,640
come back and the journey there and the journey back you see different footage like in your

1256
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,860
train to different hot like you maybe you're probably not spoiling it for yourself but

1257
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:16,720
the Diagon that ride I've avoided it mostly but I couldn't help but watch a little of

1258
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:22,080
Hogwarts Express it's insane I'm trying to do no spoilies yeah I've seen photos but I'm

1259
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:28,480
trying to just but my question is guys when should my pilgrimage be should I wait for

1260
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,480
more expansion?

1261
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,480
Well I think that's a couple that's two or three years probably still away well you've

1262
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:41,320
done yourself fit because I was there I went in 2014 six weeks after it opened and I waited

1263
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:46,000
three hours to ride Escape from Gringotts on the last day because it had broken down

1264
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:54,240
so many times I was there this past summer and I waited 10 to 15 minutes which was much

1265
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,800
easier and the crowds were pretty manageable so like any theme park attraction like a year

1266
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:04,560
or two after opening it gets it breaks down less and there's a lot less crowd so like

1267
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,400
I would stay on site if you can Universal's got some cool hotels there and you get that

1268
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,400
extra time in the park.

1269
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,400
Portofino Bay.

1270
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,240
But if you want to wait and do the Chase trifecta like I was talking about at the top of the

1271
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:17,520
show like that's a good like you could accrue points over three to six months.

1272
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,760
When are you going to Tokyo Mike because now I need to know if I need to just go there.

1273
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:25,440
Oh well Tokyo we're talking whenever this is real Lindsay's when she's on hiatus from

1274
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,160
her job great so it could be May could be June could be July we're not exactly sure

1275
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:33,200
yet but we're gonna go around that time and we're gonna do Tokyo DisneySea I've never

1276
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,560
done it before.

1277
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,720
Disney and then maybe Universal out there to see that lake Jason the Black Lake.

1278
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:43,840
Yeah which unfortunately Universal out there is on the other side of the country from the

1279
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:44,840
Disney parks.

1280
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,840
Oh yeah.

1281
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,400
So well I'll update we can update you guys further.

1282
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,600
You're gonna be working that trifecta real hard.

1283
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:54,600
I don't think I'm gonna make it to Orlando before the summer anyhow.

1284
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,880
Well you could also if you if you're interested in the opening of Fast and the Furious Supercharged

1285
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,400
that's opening in Orlando.

1286
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,600
So if that sweetens sweetens the pot.

1287
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,600
OK.

1288
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,600
All right.

1289
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,960
How do you feel about the concept of family.

1290
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,240
I would say me Familia.

1291
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,240
Ride or die.

1292
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,240
Everything.

1293
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,240
Yeah yeah yeah.

1294
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,240
You're my brother.

1295
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,240
A bunch of kids outside just went yay.

1296
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,240
Yeah.

1297
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,240
Right as you said that.

1298
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,240
Those are my kids.

1299
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,280
Wait out here Familia.

1300
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:27,640
I live my life one quarter mile at a time.

1301
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,640
Yeah.

1302
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,520
I still live.

1303
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,440
Ride or die.

1304
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,520
Have you been on the Fast and Furious Universal out here.

1305
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,520
Yes.

1306
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,520
Yeah.

1307
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,520
On the end of the tram tour.

1308
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,520
Pretty similar.

1309
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,520
I feel like it's going to be pretty similar.

1310
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,520
Yeah.

1311
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,520
It's pleasant.

1312
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,520
Does any of it have the song Gasolina.

1313
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,200
No I don't think so.

1314
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,960
Gasolina died with that small part.

1315
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,580
Disney's main song is like When You Wish Upon a Star.

1316
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:54,120
Universal's main song is Gasolina.

1317
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,120
Official anthem.

1318
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:01,240
I would say it occurs to me like maybe Universal never had a Mickey and I think Harry Potter

1319
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,240
is now their Mickey.

1320
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,240
I think they have a.

1321
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,640
Yes he is all the billboards.

1322
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,120
He is all you know that's I think that's great.

1323
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,120
What's interesting about it.

1324
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,920
I was thinking about when we were in Orlando we saw all the signs have Daniel Radcliffe

1325
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,560
on it and it's sort of funny that he's going to be stuck at that age in this promotional

1326
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,200
material for forever.

1327
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,680
40 years.

1328
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:23,280
Their 50 years until JK Rowling dies and they remake the movies maybe.

1329
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,280
Oh my gosh.

1330
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,880
I shudder to think of that time.

1331
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:27,880
I know it'll happen.

1332
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,880
You shudder to think of 2030 when it happens.

1333
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,040
But could you be in those new movies and would that be exciting.

1334
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,640
No they only cast British actors.

1335
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,360
But she's dead now in this scenario and they don't care.

1336
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,240
You know when they put out the casting call for the original movies my friend Kyle Sheldon

1337
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:46,600
and I who grew up doing plays but he moved back to Texas he and I got on the phone and

1338
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,280
we were like trying out British accents because we're like could we fool them.

1339
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,560
We were also one year too old.

1340
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,080
You had to be between like 10 and 12 and British and I think we were 13 in America but we were

1341
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,080
still like shit.

1342
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,840
I wanted to be Hermione so bad.

1343
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,240
I mean I.

1344
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,520
Well so many Russians like there's so many like magazine profile stories people pitch

1345
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,280
themselves as like so I went to this audition.

1346
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,000
I was not supposed to be there.

1347
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,040
I called out sick from my day job and lie like so many people like marketing stories

1348
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,360
are like I lied my way into the experience of a lifetime.

1349
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:26,840
I totally I mean like they saw it was just like I think the age thing would have been

1350
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:31,880
fine but the non British thing numbers is like no matter how good my dialect coach could

1351
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:36,200
have been there's like why would we cast an American fantastic beasts.

1352
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,520
Yes American I know I thought but they are not good.

1353
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,160
So we'll see.

1354
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:47,600
I did not get to I thought about it my parents wanted me to and I did not audition for the

1355
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,280
1997 Leave It to Beaver film.

1356
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,160
My whole life could be different.

1357
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:57,440
97 you were going to you didn't audition to be Beaver.

1358
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,400
I did not audition to be I think I still I think I could have got it.

1359
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,400

01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,480

01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,480
You are.

1405
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,480
Let me look at that I.

1406
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,080
You were looking at the pictures of the menu.

1407
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,080
The men Walter Matthau.

1408
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,080

I auditioned to be Mr. Wilson.

At 12 years old.

1412
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,920
You were too old.

1413
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,360
That small old man.

1414
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,360
You were like too old.

1415
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,600
Don't like you for Dennis.

1416
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,600

OK do you have it Jason you have in front of you.

01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,600
Yeah yeah yeah.

1421
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,600

01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,600
OK.

1428
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,600

We have.

1430
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,600
Oh yeah.

1431
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,600
Look at that.

1432
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,600
Yeah.

1433
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,600
He looks like a.

1434
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,600
Yeah.

1435
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,600
He's a real.

1436
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,600
He's a real hunk.

1437
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,160
He had the Leo and Titanic like hair in front of the eyes thing.

1438
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,400
Was the Leo and Titanic was it part of down the middle or the side.

1439
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,400
Middle middle.

1440
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,400
Yeah.

1441
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,400
Everyone had very like dirt.

1442
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,600
It was very like rut tussled rustled like.

1443
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,600
Yeah.

1444
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,160
Especially picturing him when he's like drawing her and he's got a lot of those like stringy

1445
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:24,520
greasy bangs in front of his eyes.

1446
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,520
Frickin hot.

1447
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,280
No no ride of that.

1448
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,360
No ride that gets you closer to Leo's bangs unfortunately.

1449
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,360
Yeah.

1450
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,860
You like you know you pass by the steamy car or whatever.

1451
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:35,720
That's a big property that doesn't exist.

1452
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,800
Yeah that's true.

1453
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,760
Does does Fox own it.

1454
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,760
Does this.

1455
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,960
I think there'd be a Titanic ride now in their adult park that we were Canadian mocap with

1456
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,640
current Leo to make him young Leo.

1457
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:52,560
Eric Von Deaton also in the 1995 remake of Escape to Witch Mountain the second.

1458
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:53,560
Oh wow.

1459
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,560
Before the rock.

1460
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,960
Before the rock hit it.

1461
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:01,160
Also in this movie Robert Vaughn and the great Elizabeth Moss was in this 1995 remake.

1462
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,160
Wow.

1463
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,580
Of Wait of Leave it to Beaver?

1464
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:04,580
Of Escape to Witch Mountain.

1465
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:05,580
Oh no.

1466
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,580
OK.

1467
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,580
Boy this.

1468
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:08,580
We got reboots flying every which way.

1469
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:09,580
Let's get.

1470
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:12,280
I guess we should get back to the Mac Harry Potter.

1471
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:13,280
I don't know.

1472
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,280
Oh you know what.

1473
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,280
We've barely scratched the surface.

1474
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,280
I do kind of feel that way.

1475
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,280
There's so much.

1476
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,280
Well I want to say an important fact that while this is a great ride in a great area

1477
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:28,440
they did have to demolish the Gibson Amphitheater one of L.A.'s most average concert venues

1478
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,160
in order to put it into Universal Hollywood.

1479
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,960
And this is a place that has great esteem and one of the great properties of all time.

1480
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:40,540
It is where the live album Briefcase Full of Blues by the Blues Brothers was recorded.

1481
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:44,400
So I mean have your fun in Harry Potter land but let's not forget that they had to.

1482
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,400
No that you trampled on history.

1483
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
Shatter.

1484
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,400
Yeah yeah yeah.

1485
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:51,280
You pissed on Belushi's grave and Ackroyd's eventual grave.

1486
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,280
I love the way that castle looks.

1487
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,160
I love that I can see it in Los Angeles from the freeway.

1488
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,160
Yes.

1489
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,160
I love.

1490
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,840
We're all kind of in this neighborhood and you see it on drives.

1491
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,840
I love it.

1492
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,440
Sometimes you see it with the new light show they put in.

1493
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:09,120
It's driving down all of that little hippogriff is a baby little coaster but it's delightful

1494
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,840
and I love the past the hippogriff.

1495
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,200
I think the hippogriff animatronic is really fun.

1496
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,560
Yes I won't wait another 40 minutes again.

1497
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,600
No like I did during a soft open.

1498
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,800
Yeah it is fun.

1499
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,840
They do a nice job of hiding.

1500
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,240
His name is Buckbeak right.

1501
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,480
Yes they hide him from Wind on the Line.

1502
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,520
You can kind of see it if you know where to look but you really do like see him like for

1503
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:33,120
the first time on the roller coaster and that's great views of the castle.

1504
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,480
Yes and of the NBC office building.

1505
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,480
That's right.

1506
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,480
Yeah true.

1507
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,760
Have you guys done the Ollivander show?

1508
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,760
Yes yes.

1509
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,760
Multiple times.

1510
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,760
What do you think of that?

1511
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:47,360
I think don't wait for it but I mean if you're visiting obviously wait for it.

1512
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:53,400
If you can if you can go often I would I would I would not wait more than 20 minutes for

1513
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,400
that.

1514
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,400
Yeah I would agree with that.

1515
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,400
But it is fun.

1516
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,400
Enchanting.

1517
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,760
For folks who yeah who have not done this this is the whole one ceremony where there's

1518
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,500
somebody playing a wizard they're not a real wizard and they come sorry sorry to break

1519
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,600
it and usually they choose a child.

1520
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:13,160
I have seen it happen where maybe an adult woman friend of mine I was with got chosen

1521
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:18,860
and she got to do the whole ceremony and children were upset maybe not upset but they were probably

1522
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:23,800
confused but then yeah so then the wand chooses that's the whole thing is the wand chooses

1523
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:28,220
the wizard and they do all these fun effects of like like is this your wand and then something

1524
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:31,560
happens and the shelves fall down or like the lights go out.

1525
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,560
Flower dies.

1526
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,560
Yes.

1527
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:36,160
Yeah it's great and then you get let into the big wand room.

1528
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,880
And then yeah and then they make the parents pay for the wand.

1529
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,880
Which is crazy.

1530
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,880
Which is crazy.

1531
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:41,880
Yeah.

1532
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,720
But I understand I was thinking about this because like that sucks that it's like you

1533
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:48,040
have to make the parent pay after the kid goes through this awesome like fun experience

1534
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:53,700
but if it was a free wand it would be bedlam it would be chaos every time because you would

1535
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,880
be like kids would be getting shoved to the front by their parents.

1536
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:02,040
Don't you guys think at least a 10% discount should be in order?

1537
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,040
Yes I'll yes for sure.

1538
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,040
If you got picked for the show.

1539
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,040
Yeah.

1540
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,040
Yeah I think they should give you a little bump.

1541
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:12,000
Or like 20% off your second wand because a lot of those kids who get chosen they got

1542
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
a sibling.

1543
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Yeah sure.

1544
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
And you know.

1545
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Yeah you can't share one deathly hallow wand.

1546
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,600
No no no no no so I feel like some there's got there's guys be have some sort of deal.

1547
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,720
How not special does that sibling feel?

1548
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,720
Exactly.

1549
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,840
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1550
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,360
yeah much superior sibling get chosen.

1551
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,360
Yeah yeah.

1552
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:34,160
Um here's my other question I love that JK has approval and you know I don't know it

1553
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:37,560
sounds like I'm the biggest Harry Potter fan in the universe.

1554
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,560
That is a hundred percent.

1555
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,560
Yeah yeah yeah for sure.

1556
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,600
So maybe you guys haven't explored Pottermore which is the website that allows you to like

1557
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,680
interact get officially sorted.

1558
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,680
I've been sorted.

1559
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:47,680
Have your Patronus.

1560
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:48,680
Have you guys been sorted?

1561
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,680
I've been sorted.

1562
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:50,680
I mean you of course.

1563
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,680
I've been sorted yeah.

1564
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,680
What do you guys have not been sorted?

1565
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,680
No not yet no.

1566
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,800
There's plenty of other like knockoff BuzzFeed type quizzes that tell you what house you're

1567
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,560
in but this is like an and they're very easy to like understand it's like would you rather

1568
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,360
be a dick brave smart or nice.

1569
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:09,160
You know the you have selected a dick.

1570
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:13,080
Yeah the Pottermore one is much more like some of them are like six options.

1571
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,080
Some of them are two that are a lot more like ambiguous.

1572
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:19,720
You can't like necessarily game it to try to like figure out what house you want to

1573
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:20,720
be.

1574
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:26,320
And then there's also a Patronus test which is you know the spell expecto Patronum that

1575
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:32,200
makes dementors go away and it's your own sort of like spirit animal for lack of a better

1576
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:36,960
word and it can be like a guardian and send messages and protect you and you can take

1577
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,640
a wand test.

1578
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,080
So I'm a little upset that they have tons of wand options but they don't have the full

1579
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,040
breadth of the ones you can paired with on Pottermore.

1580
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,720
My wand is not available at the store.

1581
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:53,520
Oh no would you care to share which house Patronus and one.

1582
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,000
I am a Gryffindor.

1583
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,520
My Patronus is a red mare which is a like a ginger type horse.

1584
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,800
The exact same Patronus as Mary Holland.

1585
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,320
She's like come on.

1586
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,600
It's an angel on earth.

1587
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:11,120
And and there's a lot of options.

1588
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,480
There are like a lot of different Patronuses.

1589
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:14,480
Yeah.

1590
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,280
So that's that's not so super common.

1591
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:22,360
And I can't think of my wand offhand but I think it's like I think it's a unicorn core

1592
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,840
and gosh I have a picture of it somewhere.

1593
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:31,040
But there's got to be people like date and get married with these facts as starting points.

1594
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,040
Correct.

1595
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,040
Like this has to have happened.

1596
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:37,640
I was already married when I made my husband take the Pottermore sorting.

1597
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,040
Was it tense while he was taking it in case it wasn't compatible.

1598
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,960
Did you have a lawyer on speed-dive?

1599
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:48,520
I am ashamed to admit that a part of me cared at all.

1600
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,040
I thought he was a Ravenclaw.

1601
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,320
He turned out to be a Ravenclaw.

1602
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,440
And so is great.

1603
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,160
But and you know because he's a dick.

1604
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,520
No no that's Slytherin.

1605
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,520
I was Slytherin.

1606
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,520
Yes.

1607
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,680
And so is Zachary and there's lots of great Slytherins.

1608
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,720
The problem is is like the Harry Potter narrative is through the eyes of Gryffindor they're

1609
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:09,040
enemies so we don't we only hear bad stuff about Slytherins.

1610
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:15,640
She has like done a ton in like post like writings and speakings about like that's because

1611
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,240
it's Harry's point of view.

1612
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,240
Right.

1613
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,360
They're not it's you're not doomed.

1614
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,360
I'm not evil.

1615
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,360
Yeah.

1616
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:27,600
Because some of Slytherins are pretty thinly veiled Nazi allegories and then some are just

1617
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,600
like I'm going to school.

1618
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:34,320
Right like I'm ambitious and like like I can be shrewd.

1619
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,320
Oh you're a Slytherin.

1620
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,320
Like yeah.

1621
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:42,200
And they are sort of they have Gryffindor's can also be like cocky.

1622
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:46,560
So like they I think Gryffindor's and Slytherins are sort of opposite sides of the same coin

1623
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:53,320
of just like where you put your I think they're definitely the cockiest brashest most confident

1624
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,600
of houses.

1625
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:59,440
So it's whether or not you filter that into like ambition or like bravery.

1626
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:03,780
But you can be a showboat in Gryffindor and you can be just like someone who achieves

1627
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:05,720
goals in Slytherin.

1628
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:06,960
Yeah you don't have to be bad.

1629
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,080
I'm not bad guys.

1630
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,080
I'm good.

1631
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,120
But I'm a Slytherin.

1632
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,120
I may sure do.

1633
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,640
Do I have a dark side like everyone.

1634
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,640
Of course.

1635
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:14,640
Of course.

1636
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,640
You're a pen-lilled puppy dog right now.

1637
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:16,640
No the dog might.

1638
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,640
Look at this.

1639
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,640
There's nothing wrong with you.

1640
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,080
Could an evil man have a dog like this.

1641
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,080
No.

1642
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,080
No.

1643
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,080
Evil people have cats.

1644
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,080
We'll post it.

1645
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,080
As many films have established.

1646
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,080
We'll post about that.

1647
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,080
Oh my nice dog.

1648
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,080
Say evil people have cats.

1649
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:32,280
I have a story about Harry Potter symbols and iconography.

1650
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:38,200
So I first went to Hogsmeade in Orlando in 2012 and I was with my family my girlfriend

1651
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:43,240
at the time and you know we're walking around in all the shops and again we said the merch

1652
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,600
is good like the ones are like nicely made.

1653
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,840
Wooden ones.

1654
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,800
I for one this kind of sounds so lame.

1655
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,800
The stationary is very good.

1656
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,200
Like the letterheads.

1657
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:58,560
There's letter paper you can get and notebooks and all these beautiful books.

1658
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,840
Jason I bought stamps there don't worry about it.

1659
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:04,200
I mailed some postcards from the hour from the hour.

1660
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,200
Come on.

1661
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,200
When they give it a custom stamp.

1662
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,200
They give you the custom stamp.

1663
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,200
Disneyland.

1664
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,360
That's a nice little advance of that idea.

1665
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,080
So I was looking at little.

1666
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,400
I was like oh maybe I'll get a little pocket notepad.

1667
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:19,160
And you know they had all the houses and I'm like oh look at this cute little guy.

1668
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,720
Look at this cute maybe I'll get this one.

1669
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,600
And they're like that's Hufflepuff.

1670
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,600
You would like that.

1671
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,480
My family fucking roasted me.

1672
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:30,080
Everyone's fucking roasted my ass because I'm like oh this Hufflepuff one is nice.

1673
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,080
I like this one.

1674
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,880
They're like yeah you would ask.

1675
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,080
Oh Jason I'm so sorry.

1676
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,400
I think yeah now it's happening all over.

1677
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,400
We're living.

1678
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:43,080
No no no no I'm saying we are living in a I feel like we're really living in the age

1679
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,680
of Hufflepuff.

1680
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:49,280
There's been because I took this pot the Potter more test became like really really big.

1681
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:53,240
I think like the summer of 2014 when I was in Zach and I were in Scotland and everyone

1682
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,980
was taking it and there were all these Hufflepuffs and they were like bummed.

1683
01:28:56,980 --> 01:29:02,160
But now I think that there has been like once people have seen just how many like awesome

1684
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,200
people are Hufflepuffs there's like a huge movement for Hufflepuff pride.

1685
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:10,120
Like tons more people are like pro Hufflepuff than ever before.

1686
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:15,360
You get your first famous Hufflepuff in I'm sorry the not very good Fantastic Beasts movie

1687
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,800
but Newt Scamander is a Hufflepuff.

1688
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:22,640
So OK I'll lead of one of the new break off franchise is a Hufflepuff isn't like their

1689
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:24,720
game sort of like nice.

1690
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,880
Nice people loyal.

1691
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,880
Yeah that's good.

1692
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,520
Loyal hardworking in kind.

1693
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:30,520
Yeah yeah.

1694
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,520
I like.

1695
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,520
Sorry.

1696
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,560
I think like if it's great to be a Hufflepuff like I think Hufflepuffs are probably the

1697
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:38,480
least likely to be bad.

1698
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:44,600
You know like they might be like the they might be less likely to be like huge.

1699
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,040
They might have like smaller percentage of huge heroes but I think they also have the

1700
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,200
lowest percentage of assholes so like.

1701
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,200
That's nice.

1702
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,200
Yeah isn't that nice.

1703
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,640
I will take the quiz before this comes out and then post the results.

1704
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,280
So we can officially say yes I should do.

1705
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,040
Yeah you know what it means but all.

1706
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,040
Yeah.

1707
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,040
Yeah.

1708
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,960
If you are a Ravenclaw and you're a Hufflepuff we'll have all four represented.

1709
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:04,960
Oh yeah.

1710
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:05,960
How about that.

1711
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:06,960
Fun.

1712
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:07,960
I like that.

1713
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:08,960
Fingers crossed.

1714
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:09,960
I like that Hufflepuff is now becoming more accepted.

1715
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,120
It's a lot like I think people are reconsidering their ideas about what Juggalos are as well

1716
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,880
now because Juggalos at a march and they've been classified as a gang and that might not

1717
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:17,880
be fair and I think.

1718
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:18,880
Yeah.

1719
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,240
It sounds like Hufflepuffs have not been treated fair and now we're fairly.

1720
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,600
It's exactly the same.

1721
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,240
I'm a violent J in the quiz.

1722
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:28,240
They also I'm also a violent J. Not a thing to do.

1723
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:32,080
Part of the theory is that Hufflepuffs might be like stoners.

1724
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:38,040
Their house is like by the kitchen and like there's a little oh you know I think some

1725
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:42,280
of the like teehee about Hufflepuffs is like well I do love treats.

1726
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,160
There is like snacks for the kids.

1727
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,600
I do love marijuana.

1728
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:51,720
They're chill little badgers who are just like nice and like maybe they're stone and

1729
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:55,320
their common room is like really sunny and round.

1730
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,600
Oh boy that actually sounds really pleasant.

1731
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,600
Yeah it's great.

1732
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,120
Like no one should be ashamed of you.

1733
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,440
No one should be ashamed from any house.

1734
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,760
Every house has pros and cons.

1735
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,240
They like discount hotel deals and naps.

1736
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:09,000
Oh boy I'm all over that.

1737
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,920
It says here the official app of Hufflepuff is Hotel Tonight.

1738
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,780
You can get a great deal on a last minute hotel room.

1739
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:20,800
And now the hotel dot com rep is Hotel Tonight is leaving?

1740
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,560
No the hotel dot com rep is not coming back.

1741
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:26,560
Yeah they died.

1742
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:31,920
Well I mean you know the typical way that we end up ranking the rides is keep it as

1743
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,640
is plus it up or burn it to the ground for insurance money.

1744
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:39,240
It seems a little silly to do it with the world of Harry Potter because how.

1745
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,920
So much and we haven't even covered.

1746
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,920
We barely.

1747
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,080
We barely scratched the surface.

1748
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,080
And so how.

1749
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:45,080
Let's just.

1750
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:49,220
For us to say burn it to the ground for insurance money how like flippant and brazen would we

1751
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:50,220
be.

1752
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:56,440
I don't know what like demanding theme park nerds to say start over because it's all obviously

1753
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:57,440
incredible.

1754
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,800
We've already and you've already been giving us such good plus it up ideas.

1755
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:05,600
But like yeah like I guess we can we can talk even any other ideas of like what would make

1756
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:06,600
this place even more magical.

1757
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:13,760
I have only one and it's very tiny which is that it as part of the immersive world even

1758
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:19,280
the ATM not the ATM but the card reader machines when you buy something are like part of the

1759
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:24,320
world there's there like a weird 40s looking little like industrial steampunk looking kind

1760
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,800
of piece and boy do they not work.

1761
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:33,300
Boy are the employees frustrated but in both of the transactions I made like the the the

1762
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:37,640
shop keeps are like rolling their eyes and somebody had to say to me like yeah often

1763
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:40,600
muggles find them difficult to use.

1764
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,120
So as much as I appreciate it.

1765
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,280
Insert the chip here.

1766
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:48,720
Well we tried three times swipe the magnetic strip young man.

1767
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:52,080
I did have a young a young guy.

1768
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,880
When I went with my niece and she got a Hermione one because you can also get a character specific

1769
01:32:55,880 --> 01:33:01,920
one and he took I gave him cash and he said huh weird I'll never get used to the fact

1770
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,480
that your money doesn't move.

1771
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:05,440
And I was like so good.

1772
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,960
Yeah that's good.

1773
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,300
Dorky 16 year old like braces and I was like you committed and I loved it.

1774
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:14,680
It's got to be the most fun part of the park to work in and I think that all of the under

1775
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,280
show if you're playing a character in a park that's got to be.

1776
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,280
Oh yeah.

1777
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:19,280
I mean like yeah.

1778
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,360
Oh we didn't talk about Moaning Myrtle in the bathrooms.

1779
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,360
Oh you're right.

1780
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:28,600
There's a little sad girl that's well in the book she is mostly in the men's room.

1781
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,600
Yeah that's right.

1782
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,600
Yeah.

1783
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,800
And she's not in the yeah because boy it's present in the men's room.

1784
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,800
It's in the way.

1785
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:34,800
Yeah.

1786
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:35,800
It's possible to ignore the men.

1787
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,080
She's haunting the boys room because she's thirsty.

1788
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,760
She's super thirsty for anybody who hasn't been well I couldn't does anyone know.

1789
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,200
Could someone like do a line or there's a lot of bubble sounds and it smells like cotton

1790
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,920
candy and what is the kind of thing that you hear in the bathroom.

1791
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:54,440
Does anyone know offhand like what Myrtle says this weird like giggly.

1792
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,760
It's like very like yeah it's like a real mirthful.

1793
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:00,880
Oh you've come back to my bathroom have you.

1794
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,400
Like very like I just clog the toilet this time.

1795
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,400
Yeah.

1796
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,400
Yeah.

1797
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,400
She roasts your ass.

1798
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,400
Yeah yeah yeah.

1799
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:09,400
Careful.

1800
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,400
One more flush please.

1801
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,600
Yeah it's a it's a strange vibe to be in in there.

1802
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,200
And she does the like which is like how she travels in the movies like when she like comes

1803
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:26,020
in she makes like is what how was Myrtle what hold is she is she like 13 or 14.

1804
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:30,040
And we meet her first in Chamber of Secrets.

1805
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:36,080
And we see we see her again in the book in Goblet of Fire book four and Half-Blood Prince

1806
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,080
book six.

1807
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,840
And she ends in a she's in a bathroom and all of them.

1808
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,020
That's where she died.

1809
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,020
She died in a bath.

1810
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:45,840
Okay I feel like I shouldn't tell you why.

1811
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,840
Okay that's fair.

1812
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:47,840
I will I will.

1813
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,840
But yeah.

1814
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:49,840
Okay.

1815
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:55,360
There's one other weird like the fact that everything is customized to that end.

1816
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:58,640
The bathrooms are called something really odd and formal.

1817
01:34:58,640 --> 01:34:59,960
And then the stroller parking.

1818
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,520
Wait I have a photo.

1819
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,160
Oh yeah they're pram parking.

1820
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,160
Yeah.

1821
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:05,160
They're called prams.

1822
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,200
Every single thing is customized.

1823
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,700
Over the ATM there's a little Gringotts logo.

1824
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:13,920
There's nothing that is just a regular America thing.

1825
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,920
Yeah.

1826
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:15,920
This place is great.

1827
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:16,920
Nice.

1828
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:21,240
A plus up that I appreciated this year was that they did anything for the holidays.

1829
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:24,160
Last year they didn't which was insane to me.

1830
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:30,040
This year it looked gorgeous all covered in like garland and it was so it looked great.

1831
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,680
Did they did you see the lights show then.

1832
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:33,680
Yeah.

1833
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:37,000
I think I think we both agreed like nice fun little short.

1834
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Yeah.

1835
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Yeah.

1836
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I saw the summer version.

1837
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,560
Oh I saw the summer version and it was packed.

1838
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,160
It's a little claustrophobic there.

1839
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,160
Yeah.

1840
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,160
Summer when they're doing that lights.

1841
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:49,120
But were the lights at the Christmas time Christmas.

1842
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:50,120
Yes.

1843
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,120
Oh cool.

1844
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,080
It was like carols and a big tree.

1845
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:59,640
And yeah we didn't even talk about the street for the Frog Choir the Triwizard tournament.

1846
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:00,640
Yeah.

1847
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,640
Pepper Alley.

1848
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,640
We'll have to do another one.

1849
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,120
Yeah we'll have to do a two parter event.

1850
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:10,720
Fortunately we know a lot of people who really like Harry Potter in the entertainment industry.

1851
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:11,720
It's great.

1852
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,720
Or eventual episodes.

1853
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:13,720
Oh yeah any other thoughts.

1854
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:14,720
Oh yeah yeah.

1855
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,720
Plus thinking about plussing it up you brought up the fact that like there's not enough fun

1856
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:24,200
magic in the candy shop and it's like yeah let's figure out a way where it feels like

1857
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,720
you're in this like fun chaos.

1858
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:32,840
So like get like a child performer to slip on some fudge every 10 minutes or something.

1859
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:36,680
Like have it be like a fudge spill or yeah.

1860
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:39,400
Like there should be things flying on the ceiling.

1861
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,400
That's what I'm saying.

1862
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,400
Yeah yeah.

1863
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:45,040
So like a child performer gets hit in the head with a box of candy or something.

1864
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,360
I believe you might be a Slytherin.

1865
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,920
They don't have to be children maybe they're adults.

1866
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:51,920
Maybe they're yeah like it's like.

1867
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:55,720
Mike does call those movies the movies where children get hurt.

1868
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,600
Like he doesn't even refer to Harry Potter.

1869
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,600
Yes.

1870
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,920
I like the movies where children get hurt and are menaced.

1871
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:01,920
Yes.

1872
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:02,920
What are those called again?

1873
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:03,920
What are those called again?

1874
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:04,920
What are those?

1875
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:05,920
The Menace?

1876
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:06,920
Leave it to Beaver?

1877
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:07,920
No no no.

1878
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:08,920
Harry Potter.

1879
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:09,920
I don't like Leave it to Beaver.

1880
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,840
I don't like the Dennis the Menace movie because he sticks it to the adult.

1881
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,440
I like I wish it was like Mr. Wilson's successful Revenge on Dennis.

1882
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:17,680
That would be what I would like.

1883
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:20,520
I'm gonna bang the garage door on your head.

1884
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:23,680
Yeah like fun fun pranks for a kid gets hurt.

1885
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:28,120
Yeah so yeah like more stuff like that and I guess it could be adults getting hit with

1886
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:31,280
candy too but to me it seems less fun.

1887
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,280
Sure.

1888
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,880
So child abuse.

1889
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:34,880
Next yeah.

1890
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:39,320
Yeah I don't know I mean I would like some plus enough stuff too.

1891
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:43,240
I mean a big complaint about the Hollywood one is the sight lines like you can see so

1892
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:48,080
much around it now clearly the trees they planted around it will grow this is a thing

1893
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:52,960
that happens when you open a new area or land in a theme park is they plant saplings and

1894
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:58,060
then they grow and cover it like the early pictures of California Adventure are pretty

1895
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:03,160
pathetic especially some of the more Redwood see part and now they look great.

1896
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:06,120
Yeah it's been well over a decade.

1897
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:09,040
They just had signs that say tree on it.

1898
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,040
Yeah.

1899
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:11,040
It doesn't work.

1900
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,040
Tree coming.

1901
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:13,040
If not.

1902
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,040
Pixie dust.

1903
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:21,560
But yeah I would like I would like more more can't because I mean this this area is not

1904
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:24,400
going to change change for a long time.

1905
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:31,960
So I think the stuff you have to do is yeah new merch new food new treats like rotate

1906
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:34,240
some stuff through.

1907
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,240
Yeah I agree.

1908
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:38,680
I'd like the full drink menu I've like seen stuff online that there are more drinks in

1909
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,260
Orlando I think.

1910
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:46,360
Give us all the drinks rotate in a few of the least popular three broomstick menu get

1911
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:51,360
get some projections of little elves making my food even though that's slave labor really

1912
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,360
good.

1913
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:55,880
They have their ice cream they have the ice cream out here they have some of it packaged

1914
01:38:55,880 --> 01:39:02,280
out here the ice cream but like in Florida they have like sticky coffee pudding clotted

1915
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:03,760
cream was really.

1916
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,000
Earl Grey I had Earl Grey.

1917
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,960
The peanut butter peanut butter and strawberry ice cream.

1918
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,880
Again I think Harry Potter eats that in the books but it's like oh yeah this is like a

1919
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,620
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

1920
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:20,380
But no one I can't say I've ever had peanut butter ice cream with strawberry in it.

1921
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:21,760
Like how has no one done this before.

1922
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:22,760
That's great.

1923
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,480
And butter beer soft serve of course in Florida.

1924
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,480
That's great.

1925
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:26,480
Which they don't have here.

1926
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:27,480
Which they don't have here.

1927
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:28,880
Which is your favorite version of butter beer.

1928
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,520
Oh yeah barely talks about butter beer cold not frozen.

1929
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:33,520
Same.

1930
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,520
Yeah.

1931
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:35,520
Cold.

1932
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,520
I think it's cold.

1933
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:37,520
Yeah.

1934
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,520
I didn't do it it was 11am.

1935
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:41,360
I was slightly hung over and the ride.

1936
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,080
You had a beer you had a regular beer.

1937
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,080
I didn't have a regular beer.

1938
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,320
The dog situation.

1939
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,320
Love those beers.

1940
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:51,140
You can get the butter beer and get a shot of that fire whiskey poured in.

1941
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:52,140
If you could.

1942
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:53,140
Yes.

1943
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:54,140
But they won't.

1944
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:55,140
You have to do it.

1945
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:56,140
You have to do it.

1946
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:57,140
Yeah.

1947
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:59,080
I the hot one is delicious but you can only have like three sips.

1948
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:01,160
It's like literally a melted cookie.

1949
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,160
Yeah.

1950
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:04,000
So good but it's so much.

1951
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,040
Butter beer potted cream like a parfait.

1952
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,040
Yes.

1953
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,040
Putting parfait content.

1954
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:09,040
Very good but again super.

1955
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:12,360
I wish there was half serving of butter beer because it does feel it's a lot.

1956
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,360
Yes.

1957
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,880
I had the butter beer fudge once and it was very good but it is it's insane.

1958
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:17,880
It's so sweet.

1959
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:23,200
I like my own boozy butter beer for you know like midnight screens of new movies type situations

1960
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:32,280
and I do you know cream soda butterscotch schnapps and like a golden rum and then if

1961
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:37,800
you whisk vanilla ice cream with club soda it will float like the head.

1962
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,800
Wow.

1963
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:39,800
Holy shit.

1964
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,640
Is that that's not they never do that in the books.

1965
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:45,160
There's never like Harry with a flask and he dumps a little liquor into the butter beer.

1966
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:46,680
In the book is mildly alcoholic.

1967
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:47,680
Oh it is.

1968
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,040
It's get a little fucked up.

1969
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,560
Oh I didn't realize that.

1970
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,400
A house elf can get wasted on it.

1971
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:56,120
It's very very very very slight like the same as like drinking like a kombucha.

1972
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,120
Yeah.

1973
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,520
That's the thing I'm interested in because I've never read the books either.

1974
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:04,720
I am interested in the more transgressive stuff where they get a little drunk and like

1975
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:05,720
you know.

1976
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:09,040
You just want to what you just want to read about kids getting drunk.

1977
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,040
Yeah getting drunk.

1978
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:11,200
I want to read about kids getting hurt.

1979
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,880
You want to read about them getting drunk.

1980
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:13,880
Yeah.

1981
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:18,680
I have a question that my my like longest friend my childhood best friend had this like

1982
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:24,840
viral thing this year where he via text message revealed that he he'd been reading the Harry

1983
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:28,720
Potter books all the way through and then started saying some things to his friend about

1984
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:32,200
like stuff that was happening in him and she was like what are you reading and figured

1985
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,320
out it was a yeah I figured you might have seen this.

1986
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,320
Yeah yeah.

1987
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,000
She was reading an erotic fan fiction.

1988
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,240
It was very well published of the of Order of the Phoenix.

1989
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:45,840
Yeah that was like that was my oldest friend Chris Chappell and he it was like this whirlwind

1990
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:49,600
of several days where it was like oh like oh that story is funny.

1991
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:50,600
Oh my God.

1992
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:51,600
Everywhere is picking it up.

1993
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,120
Every he's been interviewed by many many things.

1994
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,120
That's so funny.

1995
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:59,020
But it has all I didn't know all the details offhand but I did know it involved asserting

1996
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:02,440
that the wizarding age of consent is 15.

1997
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:09,480
Oh and that there's like like weird lives like characters like fake rapes they lie about

1998
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:13,440
rapes that happen in these books and he's telling his friend like these books are a

1999
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,360
lot crazier than I thought.

2000
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,360
And it tipped the scale.

2001
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:22,400
Well there is yeah there's an obscene amount of Harry Potter fan fiction and once you get

2002
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:28,240
to a certain amount of fan fiction it pretty quickly turns erotic for any topic.

2003
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:31,480
So I think there's multiple because I was looking up I wonder if I could find that book

2004
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:36,760
and it was like the top 12 Harry Potter erotic fan fiction like there's so is way too many

2005
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:41,200
to even I think there's 12 entire sets of all seven books that exist.

2006
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,200
Wow.

2007
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,200
Crazy.

2008
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,200
Jesus Christ.

2009
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,200
As immersive as the park.

2010
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:47,320
So I'd like to see some of those on sale.

2011
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:48,320
Yeah.

2012
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,680
Some of the body or coming of age takes.

2013
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:51,680
Yeah.

2014
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:55,000
They are coming of age books so there is a little that comes up every now and then comes

2015
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
up in the movies.

2016
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,320
Yeah I mean they're kissing they're getting crushes.

2017
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:02,660
You know like it's still pretty tame.

2018
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:04,360
They also don't get drunk Jason.

2019
01:43:04,360 --> 01:43:06,200
They like are like they felt a little.

2020
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,160
It's not like there's no like.

2021
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:09,160
All right.

2022
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,160
OK.

2023
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,160
I just want you to get your hopes up.

2024
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,160
He's a little little less than just a nerd.

2025
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:13,160
Yeah.

2026
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:16,240
You talk about like we're going to see if we can get fire whiskey you know.

2027
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,240
But they.

2028
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:18,240
Yeah yeah.

2029
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:19,240
Yeah there's like allusions to.

2030
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,240
Right.

2031
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:21,240
But they don't make a beer run.

2032
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:22,240
No.

2033
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:26,240
And then there's no like you don't ever hear about like they're getting tipsy enough that

2034
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,560
they're like actions are right.

2035
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,560
Yeah.

2036
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,560
Yeah.

2037
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,680
Do you think what do you think about a movie version of the Cursed Child play.

2038
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,680
No thank you.

2039
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:35,680
No.

2040
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,680
Do you think about the Cursed Child.

2041
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,720
No I would love to read it.

2042
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:39,720
OK.

2043
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:40,720
Don't care for it.

2044
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:41,720
Really.

2045
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:42,720
Yeah it's OK.

2046
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:46,120
I think I like it actually more as like a theater nerd than a Harry Potter fan because

2047
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:51,400
I love just like how willing to do spectacle on stage they seem to be.

2048
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,520
So I would love to see that.

2049
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,760
I think like that would be sort of amazing.

2050
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:58,400
But there's lots of stuff in the storytelling that I feel like undercuts the purity of the

2051
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,400
original.

2052
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,160
Also a lot of writers on that right.

2053
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:04,480
Yeah a couple of writers J.K. doesn't feel totally pure.

2054
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:10,360
I don't mean spoilers spoilers about cursed child we care about for over a year.

2055
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:13,520
I like the paperback and hardback that one of his kids is a slither and I think that

2056
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,920
does more than I think that's interesting to be like hey this doesn't mean as much as

2057
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,120
like it meant to Harry at eleven.

2058
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:26,480
Like obviously like obviously the whole backbone of wizarding education isn't predicated on

2059
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,560
one fourth being evil.

2060
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:33,120
So like I think that is really cool and like dealing with that is super neat but there's

2061
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:38,280
really lazy time travel stuff that is like what the hell we can do way better than this.

2062
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:41,840
Really there's time to fix that third movie.

2063
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:47,120
The Alfonso Caron one he directed that they I thought they handle time travel and that

2064
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,120
great.

2065
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:51,660
Yes like I thought that but it is also amazing that then like that doesn't become like a

2066
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:53,400
massive part of the series.

2067
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:54,400
Oh yeah.

2068
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,840
And this is like a huge part of the story.

2069
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:57,840
It's time travel.

2070
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,440
It's like oh that's not good.

2071
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:08,000
The thing is like a unsubstantiated theme park rumor that really read a theme park guy

2072
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,600
was it.

2073
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:14,960
I forget how long ago this was someone speculated that Warner Brothers is waiting for the three

2074
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,880
lead actors to hit the ages.

2075
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:23,900
They make three first child movies first child movie or movies that would be that was quickly

2076
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,640
debunked I feel like.

2077
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:28,140
But yeah but still of course they want to do it.

2078
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:30,480
They want to suck as much money out of it as they can.

2079
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:34,000
That would be cool but I do feel like going back to what I said originally I think what's

2080
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,840
cool about it is like trying to make magic work on stage in front of you.

2081
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:40,520
Yeah I think that's I think that's the main appeal of curse child.

2082
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:45,840
As a fan would you rather have them make like seven movies where they're all old like like

2083
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:50,440
Star Wars style now where you see all the old people you love but now they're ancient

2084
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,840
or remake the seven movie the original seven.

2085
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:58,200
I think remake because there's a lot of stuff there's lots of meat that got left on the

2086
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:05,160
bone and the whole stakes of the story should be gone.

2087
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:09,760
Voldemort is vanquished like I don't know you can't come up with a better baddie than

2088
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:16,280
Voldemort what if it was like a let's just say like a Snoke type has taken Voldemort's

2089
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:22,200
place a Supreme Leader Snoke type Voldemort he's like looks like Voldemort he's unclear

2090
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:27,900
exactly where he came from is that let's not a good idea maybe much rather get I'd much

2091
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:32,840
rather get into prequel territory I'd much rather so yeah Harry's parents them I'd much

2092
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:38,560
rather see a Marauders movie or I'd rather see a Founders movie the founder founding

2093
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:39,560
of Hogwarts.

2094
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:44,920
Oh sure I'd be much more interested in going back right which is what the Fantastic Beasts

2095
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:51,080
thing is but like a specific substory I'd much rather go back in magical history I think

2096
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:56,720
then forward first child goes forward and it's like yeah they have to just invent time

2097
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:01,720
travel to be like Voldemort could come back for their time you know like it still is Voldemort

2098
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:10,600
right you're like well you know guys what then do we have then any other any other thoughts

2099
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:15,400
about any of any of anything from any of those that you'd want to see in the part any other

2100
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:19,560
any final any final wish fulfillment.

2101
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:25,640
I think it would be rad to have as much as I didn't love the movie a Jungle Cruise type

2102
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,480
ride about Fantastic Beasts.

2103
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:28,920
Oh that's great.

2104
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:30,640
Like it's begging for it.

2105
01:47:30,640 --> 01:47:35,880
Sure with with like the same a little bit like pithy detached attitude maybe of junk

2106
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:40,640
maybe you can't directly rip that off maybe it's too too bald but like I think some sort

2107
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:47,640
of magical creature like mini zoo experience like like even a safari type ride where you

2108
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:54,760
see magical creatures in their habitats and that's a good way to get that new series incorporated

2109
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,360
into the parks and that's pretty cool.

2110
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:57,360
Yeah.

2111
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,360
It does feel like they're infinite.

2112
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:02,520
I think there could be like many genres of ride with Harry Potter.

2113
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:06,640
That's how I think a water ride is maybe time and that would be a good way to do that.

2114
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:07,640
Oh that'd be fun.

2115
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:10,760
And you're all these rides are starting to edge towards the back of that hill so you

2116
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:15,800
could use like at least in Universal Hollywood so you can like use the natural slope to do

2117
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:16,800
something.

2118
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,520
That's the only other good ride.

2119
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:19,520
Oh no the other hill.

2120
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:20,520
I don't think Mr. Spielberg.

2121
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:21,520
Yeah that ride is so good.

2122
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:22,520
He won't let that happen.

2123
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,280
But we can have two water rides in that park.

2124
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:28,240
I think maybe it would be more maybe it could be fun to be more like a rapid ride.

2125
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:29,240
Yeah.

2126
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:34,800
But I guess maybe it would be too similar to Jurassic Park because I am imagining going

2127
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:39,640
and looking at docile animals and then all of the Fantastic Beasts movie some creature

2128
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:40,640
has escaped.

2129
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:41,640
Yeah.

2130
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,640
You know.

2131
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:47,280
I'd be fine if they re-themed every ride to Harry Potter at Universal Hollywood.

2132
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,280
Why not?

2133
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:50,160
You want you're going to let the animal actors stage go?

2134
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:52,360
But then they're fun Harry Potter animals.

2135
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:53,360
Oh yeah.

2136
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,520
It's all owls.

2137
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:55,520
It's all owls.

2138
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:56,520
It's all different variety of owls.

2139
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,160
And it's like yeah Phoenix.

2140
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:07,440
Can an owl come out in its underwear in a bathrobe looking for their missing bra?

2141
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:11,200
Can an owl have big lips and impersonate Mick Jagger?

2142
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,520
I'm not letting the crucial parts of the animal actors stage go.

2143
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,520
Buckbeak can impersonate Mick Jagger.

2144
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:18,240
There could be a whole thing with his beak.

2145
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:21,720
Like he comes out and he does a strut while like Miss You plays or something.

2146
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,880
Like let's be honest there's ways to do it.

2147
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:27,520
And the Rolling Stones are English so it works in the universe.

2148
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:28,520
Wow.

2149
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:29,520
All ties together.

2150
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,520
Well all right.

2151
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:34,840
Hey I think all this being said Jess McKenna you survived podcast the ride.

01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:46,720
I know we got a.

2156
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:47,720
There's only a small portion of this episode.

2157
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:48,720
We got to do more.

2158
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:51,840
That shows what a great job they did that there's so there's you could that you could

2159
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,440
talk about the food almost primarily.

2160
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:54,440
Yes.

2161
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:55,440

2162
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:56,440

Can I interest anyone in playing this lottery of.

2170

2173

I don't know if I have the flavor guide off hand but I think don't look don't cheat.

2174
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,120
I'm 90 percent sure I got the vomit one.

2175
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:23,120
No no I think.

2176
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,120
Oh no maybe.

2177
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:27,160
I'm going to eat the weirder one.

2178
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:28,160
Hold on.

2179
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,560

Right into the mic.

2182
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:34,480
Very cherry.

2183
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,280
Mine's fine.

2184
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:39,320
Just kind of generically jelly bean.

2185
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:41,040
I think I got a watermelon.

2186
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,040
Oh yeah maybe watermelon.

2187
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:44,160
I got a vanilla like cream type of a thing.

2188
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,160
This is all great.

2189
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:46,160
I was here.

2190
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:47,160
Great.

Wow.

2194
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:51,160
We all won the day.

2195
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:52,160
This one tastes like piss.

2196
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,960
Oh oh oh oh no.

2197
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,440
We ended on a sour notes after a bad one.

2198
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:58,440
All right.

2199
01:50:58,440 --> 01:50:59,440

Find out if Mike had to be sent to the hospital or not.

2203
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,080
I'm trying to think.

2204
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,080
It might be good.

2205
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,440
They think it's good but it's bad.

2206
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:11,440
I don't know.

2207
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,440
I can't tell if it's like the vomit or.

2208
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:13,780
What if it's actually spoiled?

2209
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:17,560
What if they the jelly bean makers fell asleep at the wheel and you get sick?

2210
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:20,760
It's from like the opening day of Harry Potter in Orlando somehow.

2211
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:21,760
Oh no.

2212
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:22,760
It's weird.

2213
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:27,080
We need to get Mike onto the feigning couch I keep in my car.

2214
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,080
Thank you for listening.

2215
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,080
