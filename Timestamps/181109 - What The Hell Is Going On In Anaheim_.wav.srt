1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,560
Forever.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,300
Dog.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,660
Warning, the following podcast includes harrowing analysis of both hospitality industry wage

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,120
increases and an elderly mouse doing a K-pop dance routine.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,920
Not to mention a white knuckle unveiling of election results that have been publicly available

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,980
for three days.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,080
Today, the Good Boy War Room finds out what the hell is going on in Anaheim.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,680
This is Podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:57,168
I'm going to podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast that is suddenly deeply invested in

10
00:00:57,168 --> 00:01:00,788
local politics because the story involves sandwiches.

11
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:04,388
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

12
00:01:04,488 --> 00:01:08,948
Hello, my name is Mike Carlson, yes, and I love sandwiches, but not as much as the man

13
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:09,688
sitting next to me.

14
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:11,508
Yes, and I'm Jason Sheridan.

15
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:15,368
I have not eaten lunch yet, and that has fired off something in my brain.

16
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,168
Oh, God, we lost you already.

17
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:18,888
I chose the wrong word.

18
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:19,688
I triggered you.

19
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:20,928
That's okay.

20
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:22,448
I think I'll be good.

21
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:25,108
I had a slice of wheat toast with Nutella on it.

22
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:26,648
Nutella on sale recently.

23
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:29,648
Sorry, haters, but a big old jar of Nutella.

24
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:32,228
How much was it on sale for?

25
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:37,248
I think it was how much was it?

26
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:39,188
Two dollars, two fifty.

27
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:41,368
Two fifty off or two fifty.

28
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,988
Two fifty after we had a dollar cash back.

29
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:46,648
Okay, that's all I want. Got it.

30
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:52,928
Okay, this is as you will hear, we're going to weave a story that relates to the very

31
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:58,228
recent midterm elections that does, in essence, emanate out from a sandwich restaurant.

32
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:05,048
We're very excited to do this this highly topical, this politically charged episode

33
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:09,628
of podcast right titled What the Hell is Going On in Anaheim?

34
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,928
A question that we've had for a while and we're going to try to answer it here, although

35
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:17,188
the election sort of changes what might be going on in Anaheim.

36
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:24,508
But before we get into that, I should mention, as always, the Patreon, the second gate, is

37
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:30,408
open and this week there's a new episode entirely dedicated to our good friend, hashtag Botanicus.

38
00:02:31,428 --> 00:02:33,728
Anything we'd like to plug, especially?

39
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:41,448
It's about 90 minutes of a deep dive into the secondary characters of the ET universe.

40
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:47,088
As long as the episode that we did about the ET adventure, the entire ride, our first episode,

41
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:50,348
we've now equaled that length just about a single character.

42
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:53,208
Yeah, we've gotten much better at podcasting.

43
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:56,228
So you can basically pay five dollars a month.

44
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:57,908
We have three extra bonus episodes.

45
00:02:57,948 --> 00:03:02,488
We did Disney Quest and now the second episode in November is Botanicus.

46
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,708
We've announced third is Club 33.

47
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:06,368
We're going to talk about our visit there.

48
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:13,108
So yeah, if you want to hear all about the flop, gloppel and Senator Gribbleebs, the

49
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:19,848
other, the ET Senator and the third Star Wars prequel, please go over to patreon.com.

50
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:23,568
When I say it out loud, it sounds bad, but it's so good.

51
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:25,988
And there's a strong episode, I feel.

52
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:26,568
I feel really good.

53
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:27,888
I was very pleased with it.

54
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:31,868
It starts out with Jason eating a protein bar and.

55
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,208
Oh yeah, more information about you haggling.

56
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:34,868
Yes.

57
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:36,568
Oh yeah, the protein bar incident.

58
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:37,668
There's a great haggling story.

59
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:40,968
There's a great time where we stop in the middle because it seems like you're taking

60
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:42,568
selfies during our record.

61
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:44,608
So yeah, go ahead over there.

62
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,168
Patreon.com.

63
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:46,628
That you can see on our Twitter.

64
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:47,788
Slash podcast.

65
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:54,708
You'll also learn about the book sequel to ET where ET helps Elliot make time with a

66
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:55,068
girl.

67
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:56,508
Make time.

68
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:56,928
Make time.

69
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:57,408
Oh yeah.

70
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:02,068
Or neck, whatever the wholesome old timey ways of saying that sort of thing are.

71
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:10,388
And also where Elliot's phrase for his brother penis breath is put in ET's mouth.

72
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:12,668
And I was thinking about that since we recorded it.

73
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:16,388
And ET does not hear Elliot call his brother penis breath.

74
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:16,868
Oh yeah.

75
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,188
I think that's before he lands.

76
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:20,548
And I think that's just like a one time insult.

77
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:26,468
I don't believe, unless it's all off screen, that Elliot is constantly referring to his

78
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:27,308
brother's penis breath.

79
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:28,228
Yeah, that's a good point.

80
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:35,648
As will maybe be revealed, I could email somebody special to ask him about that question, but

81
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:37,348
I won't say who I'm talking about.

82
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:44,188
And then I guess the last tease I have for this paywall episode of Botanicus is that

83
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:47,268
who is a mysterious new character that has been created?

84
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:50,208
Who is Potanicush?

85
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:52,048
That's all I'll say.

86
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:52,708
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:53,548
We'll leave it at that.

88
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:54,928
Who is Potanicush?

89
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:58,048
You'll have to enter the second gate to find out.

90
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:03,788
So go to patreon.com slash podcast the ride and purchase your Patreon park hopper today.

91
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:04,348
Yeah.

92
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:07,668
Look, the holidays are coming up, lots of travel time.

93
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:14,188
You need some more podcast content to enjoy on cars, planes, trains, automobiles.

94
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:18,188
I like that you added that extra sell because it was like, well, if they weren't completely

95
00:05:18,188 --> 00:05:22,848
invested in hearing about Botanicus, it was like, I do have a long car ride coming up

96
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,188
and I really should.

97
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:27,348
You know, you got to look to the future, right?

98
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:28,308
That's true, you do.

99
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:35,588
You know, we all engaged in an event this week that I would describe as being akin to

100
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,088
a long car ride.

101
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:44,968
A major event in the world of Disney that in fact is on in the background as we record

102
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:46,888
this T-vode.

103
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:52,508
I'm talking about Mickey Mouse's 90th birthday celebration.

104
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:57,268
And before we get into the local politics of Anaheim, I feel like everything's happening

105
00:05:57,268 --> 00:06:00,368
under the shadow of Mickey's 90th.

106
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:08,788
And Jason and I were, I think Mike was not watching it live, eschewing your duties as

107
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:09,568
a journalist.

108
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:10,868
Yeah, that's true.

109
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:17,828
But doing a routine all three of us fall into where two of us are very active on a group

110
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:18,528
of people.

111
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:24,008
One is sitting on the couch and one is clearly at the movies or driving or in the shower

112
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,628
and totally not engaged.

113
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:29,448
Honestly, I may have been sitting on this couch watching something else.

114
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:30,708
How likely?

115
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:36,348
I mean, we were sitting watching something, I think, and I was like, oh, they're watching

116
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:37,228
the Mickey special.

117
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:38,728
Okay, well, I'll get to this later.

118
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:44,468
And then also part of me was like, I don't want any spoilers, but I didn't get to watch

119
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:44,668
this.

120
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:47,888
I'm watching a lot of it now for the first time and now I'm watching it with the sound

121
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:48,088
off.

122
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:56,028
So yeah, I'd like to say that I put on this special 100% because I saw a silent clip go

123
00:06:56,028 --> 00:07:02,868
by on Twitter in which Mickey Mouse with the fully articulated head that smiles and talks

124
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:06,388
and blinks that Mickey Mouse was playing the drums.

125
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:12,888
And so in that regard, I was not disappointed because he sure did play the drums and I was

126
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:18,828
oddly little kid tickled by seeing a cartoon character play a real set of drums.

127
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:23,068
If he'd just been pantomiming, nothing, but knowing you could see he was hitting every

128
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,328
tom and every cymbal and I really enjoyed that.

129
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:29,208
Mickey plays the drums in several different theme parks.

130
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:34,608
Disneyland specifically first, he plays at the end of there's the one parade, I forget

131
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:38,568
what it is in Disneyland, where Mickey is on the end of the float and he's just going

132
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:41,208
nuts on the drums and it's my favorite thing.

133
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:43,508
And I don't know, they haven't done it in a while.

134
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:44,968
But it was a parade.

135
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:45,408
I'm trying to think.

136
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:46,268
It's not soundstational.

137
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:47,848
Soundstational was the Pixar one?

138
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:53,008
No, Soundstational was the one in Florida, I think it was the afternoon parade.

139
00:07:53,188 --> 00:07:54,028
I don't know about that.

140
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,748
Maybe it was out here too.

141
00:07:56,988 --> 00:08:01,008
The Pixar play parade is the one you're 5, 4, 3, 2, fun.

142
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:05,568
No human being could possibly keep all these parades straight in Disneyland.

143
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,268
It is the Soundstational parade.

144
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:08,708
It's coming back.

145
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:13,628
It's coming back, it's coming back, it's Soundstational and the big finale of it is Mickey standing

146
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:19,248
up playing the drums and he's doing it, he's not pantomiming it and I have so many videos

147
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:25,068
from the years of being like giggling under my breath and I'm like, Mickey's playing the

148
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:25,088
drums.

149
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:25,988
It's coming back.

150
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:33,968
That is exactly where I was laughing in a gleeful, it just tickled me on this bass level.

151
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,928
I'm with you, this is as pure as I can get.

152
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:41,448
It's happening again, Agent Cooper, it's coming back.

153
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:48,288
I tuned in to see Mickey play the drums and in order to get to that I had to wade through

154
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:50,108
a lot of other stuff.

155
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:58,328
I have this whole thing where sometimes I'm watching entertainment that has celebrities

156
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:03,508
that I've never heard of and sometimes people say, well this is because you are old and

157
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:09,608
you just don't know who the hip new celebrities are and other times I feel I am being gaslit

158
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:16,028
and these people are not actually that famous and there was a time, there's an 80s, obviously,

159
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:22,888
okay, I'm always going back to 80s things, but there was a 1988 Mickey birthday special

160
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:32,328
where he goes to cheers and family ties and he's hanging around with Felicia Ristrad and

161
00:09:33,588 --> 00:09:34,148
celebrities.

162
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:41,848
I don't know who so many of the people in this special way, am I wrong or am I just

163
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:46,828
kicking and flailing and denying that I am old, but I don't like, look who's on right

164
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:46,988
now.

165
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:54,128
This is NTC 127 and it's their first live performance of an English language song.

166
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:55,948
They're a K-pop band.

167
00:09:55,968 --> 00:10:02,308
They're a K-pop band with about a dozen members and as I said in our group text, these swanky

168
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:07,768
words of ensembles always make me nervous because I have read articles similar to, they

169
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:13,048
operate similar to like Menudo did where like you have aged out, it is time for a new member

170
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:16,748
and they will swat in people and now Mickey's dancing with them now.

171
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:17,768
Holy shit.

172
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:19,408
This is your first time seeing this?

173
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,088
I'm just seeing the whole special for the first time.

174
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:24,068
I know he danced earlier and I loved it and now he's back out.

175
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:27,248
Here's what's, I will go right back to your question in a second.

176
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:33,748
I had tickets to this show and each segment that comes on, I'm a little more regretful

177
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:37,388
that I didn't go because I asked my sister, I got tickets.

178
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:40,168
I just signed up for them like any normal human.

179
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:45,948
Then they said, you know, it's taping down by USC, which is like, if you live up in Burbank,

180
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:47,228
it's like, I gotta go all the way down there.

181
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:49,148
Was it the shrine?

182
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:49,988
Yes.

183
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:52,148
And then it's like, you gotta be there too.

184
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,248
It doesn't start till seven, but you gotta be there at two and you gotta check in and

185
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:56,268
you gotta dress up.

186
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:56,908
Oh yeah.

187
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:04,028
I did that same, like that level of amount of time for the, in order to be a seat filler

188
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:07,688
at the 2005 MTV movie awards.

189
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,688
And it was kind of a big hassle.

190
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:17,468
Although my girlfriend at the time got to shake peak Lindsay Lohan's hand.

191
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:18,548
So that was sick.

192
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:21,808
The whole cast of Mean Girls accepted an award together.

193
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:23,728
So actually, you know, maybe it was worth it.

194
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:24,128
It was good.

195
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:26,208
But it was many, many hours and kind of a pain in the ass.

196
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:26,628
Yes.

197
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:31,948
By and large, if you've never been to a television show taping, the word to call it would be

198
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:33,128
interminable.

199
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:33,548
Right?

200
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:34,788
That's how you say that word.

201
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:35,848
I think that's right.

202
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:36,588
The worst.

203
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:40,228
Except for the old, I'll speak up for my friends at the Conan show.

204
00:11:40,268 --> 00:11:43,108
They made that a pretty like tight, fun experience.

205
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:44,068
I was always pleased.

206
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:47,508
Like if I had friends who came to visit, it was like, oh, that was good.

207
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:51,148
We weren't waiting around for hours and hours and there's no retakes and there's no, but

208
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:54,248
you could tell this Mickey thing from miles away.

209
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,288
It must have been the most tedious event.

210
00:11:56,468 --> 00:12:01,928
Late night shows, because they're so timed out and structured, tend to be quicker.

211
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:09,428
Sitcom tapings tend to be hell because it's like you go to see a play and if a scene in

212
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:15,788
a play didn't go well, you'll just see that scene again and again and again until someone

213
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:17,608
is happy with how that scene went.

214
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,948
And then you end up like, you know, 11 hours in.

215
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,388
It's like, all right, round two of pizza.

216
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:25,908
Yeah, pass them down.

217
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:27,588
Get them all the way down to your neighbor.

218
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,268
Ensure you get a single slice of Little Caesars and your single bottle of water.

219
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:35,728
Although, as you said that, did you have that thing trigger in your brain again?

220
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:38,028
A little bit, because I am a Little Caesars fan.

221
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:40,588
Let's count the food references.

222
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:41,708
Our Little Caesar.

223
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:47,608
So yeah, so anyway, I basically I was like, you know what, this is going to be a big slog.

224
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:50,648
And then I was worried because we watched that Disneyland special a few years ago, which

225
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:52,368
was like the anniversary of Disneyland.

226
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:55,828
And I don't think there was barely any Disneyland in it.

227
00:12:55,828 --> 00:13:02,128
It was just a really shallow, like, look at the movies and TV that we have.

228
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:03,428
And it was nothing about the park.

229
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:06,608
So I was like, there's that maybe there's barely any Mickey stuff in this.

230
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:07,688
But now I'm seeing it.

231
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,068
Mickey has danced twice already.

232
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,608
He's played the drums once and I'm really feeling like we should have gone.

233
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,688
That's all pretty good.

234
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:17,568
But again, like so much of it was a slog.

235
00:13:17,568 --> 00:13:22,168
I mean, I'm just going to like leaf through what we were texting each other.

236
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,328
I like Jason's texts.

237
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:25,288
I don't know of themselves.

238
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:29,608
Mickey has made his grand entrance and now is doing a dance number to I Can Make Your

239
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,228
Hands Clap.

240
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:30,668
All right.

241
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:31,228
That was great.

242
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:31,788
I'll say this.

243
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:32,188
I saw it.

244
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:32,648
It was great.

245
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:33,668
I liked it.

246
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:36,648
All of the dancers were very good.

247
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:37,448
They were very good.

248
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:41,268
And the singers, anyone singing, the singers were good.

249
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:47,328
Although the implications of Meghan Trainor singing You've Got a Friend in Me to her father

250
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:51,428
with her father playing piano and then the West L.A.

251
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:53,688
Children's Choir backing her up.

252
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:55,788
Like that was a very odd combination.

253
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:56,588
What do you mean?

254
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:58,488
And her father was not like a muse.

255
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:02,388
I was looking up who is Meghan Trainor's dad, because I thought it might be a clue as to

256
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:04,928
why Meghan Trainor has been foisted upon us.

257
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:08,248
Like, oh, is he he's like a Clive Davis.

258
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:10,888
But no, he's like a Halliburton.

259
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,988
I think he's not really any.

260
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:16,388
I think what is there are parents like both dentists or something or there?

261
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:18,268
Or jewelers.

262
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:20,448
Meghan Trainor's parents are both jewelers.

263
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:21,348
That's not nothing.

264
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:23,528
Yeah, that's money, I guess.

265
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,468
She could be Clive Davis's jewel.

266
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:27,508
Like they could be Clive Davis's jeweler.

267
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,388
You got to wonder if it's something like that.

268
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:32,428
No offense to anyone who enjoys the music of Meghan Trainor.

269
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:33,288
I do not.

270
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:37,368
And I don't understand why she sings like You've Got a Friend in Me.

271
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:40,948
Like you are the whitest, the whitest, whitest person.

272
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,828
Why? Where did all these extra vowels in your singing come from?

273
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:47,028
Not a fan.

274
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:50,208
I was just writing down quotes.

275
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,868
Also, some of the copy in this special copy is incredible.

276
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:58,368
Very strange, such as Mickey was dreamed up by Walt Disney,

277
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,608
an American man from the Midwest.

278
00:15:01,308 --> 00:15:04,828
It truly sounds like a five paragraph essay a high schooler wrote.

279
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:06,908
I did see that.

280
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:09,028
The Wester's defines Mickey Mouse as.

281
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:12,628
It was all well, the whole thing was filler.

282
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:15,128
And then it was that other bizarre copy.

283
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:15,828
There was something.

284
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:20,068
Oh, describing Mickey Mouse as a round faced cartoon character.

285
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:22,708
Who described him that way?

286
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:23,968
Or is that in the narration somewhere?

287
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:27,488
That was it was either Sarah Highland or Kristen Bell.

288
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:31,708
Like this special was written by they made the K-pop band

289
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,308
write it and then translate it into English.

290
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:37,788
This is all like bizarre, the most base English I've ever heard.

291
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:42,168
Well, and someone described like all the forms Mickey takes of like

292
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:46,088
and they show like, you know, a toaster toaster that looks like Mickey.

293
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:47,988
TV that looks like Mickey.

294
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:52,488
My favorite was or sent down the runway in the form of a handbag.

295
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:57,608
And then as it right, they said that a fashion show happened

296
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:02,528
very quickly while Al City started to play the Al City song

297
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:07,188
from the end of Wreck-It Ralph that was tweaked for the paint the night parade.

298
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,408
Like, when will I see you again?

299
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,448
Oh, oh, oh, oh, that one.

300
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,008
Yeah. OK, so that is weird.

301
00:16:13,028 --> 00:16:15,728
That's coming up. I have I have that to look forward to.

302
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,728
You get a fashion show and then they interview, you know, Annie Lebowitz

303
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:23,048
and like various fashion people about why Mickey is a fashion icon.

304
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,028
And it's simplicity of design.

305
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:29,328
And they show you circles being formed with a compass and all this bullshit.

306
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:32,408
He is a round faced cartoon character.

307
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:37,268
My favorite back and forth we had was I may.

308
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,528
Oh, there's a warning on the screen.

309
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:40,268
Meghan Trainor in three minutes.

310
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:43,188
I think I needed that warning. Thank you.

311
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:46,388
I texted a great for that was commercial.

312
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:48,708
The narrator said, Josh Gad coming up.

313
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,948
And I texted that.

314
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:54,088
And Scott, you said always a good sentence.

315
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:57,208
Anytime you've got Josh Gad in your.

316
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:58,868
You'll be glad for Gad.

317
00:17:00,308 --> 00:17:04,688
I don't very, very bizarre thing.

318
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:08,808
And then like also this probably the weirdest thing was this assertion

319
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:12,888
that like because Mickey dreamed Mickey's indomitable spirit,

320
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:15,788
open the doors to so many creative avenues

321
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:21,068
and then essentially asserting that without Mickey, there would be no

322
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:25,108
Star Wars and eventually or no Black Panther.

323
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:31,688
Like, OK, I know Disney owns these things now, but Mickey did not.

324
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:37,368
How what chart could you draw to where Mickey leads directly to Black Panther?

325
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:39,848
Extremely bizarre.

326
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:41,788
Yeah, that is very bizarre.

327
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:43,888
That Kirby buried again.

328
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:50,128
Yeah, there's a weird I mean, all these corporations that rewrite their history.

329
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:54,668
But this is particularly bizarre because they're making it like Mickey was a real

330
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:57,688
person that trailblazed for Black Panther.

331
00:17:59,228 --> 00:17:59,968
Like the narrative.

332
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:04,628
He found spare time in his full time duties as a fashion icon.

333
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:07,208
Right. To pioneer, to invent Black Panther.

334
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:11,428
You also here's what I think is that, you know, I mean, there's there.

335
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:15,548
I guess there's impressive celebrities who appear on stage like Kristen Bell

336
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:17,748
and Josh Gad, they're very famous people.

337
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:20,548
The Goldbergs actress is on right now.

338
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:23,128
I think they just had was it Lamar Odom?

339
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:27,348
One of the Hamilton actors. Lamar Odom.

340
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:29,968
Is that? Oh, no. Lamar Odom is a basketball player.

341
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:32,488
Yes. Ah, what is the name?

342
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:36,768
But then you then you have to sit through a lot of like

343
00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:40,568
owned in like Neil Patrick Harris didn't come.

344
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,948
He just sent in a video. Right.

345
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:47,668
And then this really rushed appearance by

346
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,908
a bit the crown jewel of the ABC empire right now.

347
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:55,068
The host of the Alec Baldwin show, Alec Baldwin.

348
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:57,888
Hey, hey, happy birthday, Mickey.

349
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:01,448
He's doing it like so you can you can feel that right where they cut.

350
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:04,088
He's like, OK, I'm doing one more time and then I'm getting the fuck out of here.

351
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:07,488
And this aired two days after Alec Baldwin's arrest

352
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:10,228
for punching a man in the face in New York City.

353
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:12,028
Yeah, they did not edit that out.

354
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:16,848
They did get a quick clip from The Rock, probably on the set of Jungle Crew.

355
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:19,388
Like they got him to say like, hey, happy birthday, Mickey.

356
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:22,148
And he is one of the biggest movie stars in the world.

357
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:23,808
That one makes sense to me. Sure.

358
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,688
But also, are we as a society,

359
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:30,628
is anyone still impressed by the phoned in

360
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:35,888
the video filmed between the trailers of whatever the real project is?

361
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:40,268
Is anyone at home like, whoa, they got Callie Cuoco

362
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:46,028
to step outside of where she lives for three seconds and like have the copy

363
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:50,888
half memorized and whether it's a Disney special or whether it's a commercial

364
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:55,468
encouraging people to vote like what are people are people?

365
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:57,728
Is anyone impressed by trailer videos?

366
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:01,048
Well, I don't know about impressed, but I will say I was emailing

367
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:05,388
with my mom about something else and she did email me a link to this

368
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:07,048
like the ad for it.

369
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:10,848
And she's like, you did not tell me about this and I missed it.

370
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:16,728
Really? Was I supposed to like it's of course, it's now all been cut up

371
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:20,928
and put on the ABC's YouTube channel so you can see probably

372
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,588
100 percent of it in in a playlist form.

373
00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:30,228
So I also also bizarre things like when the when Tony Hale comes out,

374
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:33,048
that we can make he says hi, a pal.

375
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:37,408
Mickey or for Tony Hale and Mickey friends.

376
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,968
Yeah. Well, Mickey's friend to all really.

377
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:41,328
That's sort of his eye.

378
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:44,588
But yes, specifically, it does seem like he and Tony have a relationship

379
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:47,028
that extends past just his normal friendship.

380
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:49,588
I think it's interesting that Mickey is sitting there.

381
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:52,868
Did you see that? Remember that Don Rickles, Spike TV,

382
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:54,868
like roast thing?

383
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:58,948
Mickey is sitting in a very similar chair to like Don Rickles was sitting

384
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:00,908
during his like couch.

385
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,148
Yeah, like a velvet couch.

386
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:04,808
The only thing that's different is that the people that come

387
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:07,428
don't go over and sit with him for the rest of the show.

388
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:11,508
So like Tony Hale's not sitting with Mickey the whole show.

389
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:12,868
They're like laughing it up.

390
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:15,468
And there's certainly anything but a roast.

391
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:20,908
It's yeah, no, it's just, you know, like praise that makes no sense about,

392
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:23,588
you know, he's beyond an American icon.

393
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:25,848
He's an intergalactic icon.

394
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:30,428
And then, you know, they chiseled Mickey ears into the they sent something

395
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:32,248
to Mars or whatever. Yeah, yeah.

396
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:36,808
To correct myself earlier, the actor from Hamilton is Leslie Odom, Jr.

397
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:39,828
won a Tony for the role of Aaron Burr. OK.

398
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:42,768
Are you married to Chloe Kardashian?

399
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,888
I believe one of the. Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm.

400
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,748
But both was both Lamar and Leslie

401
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,988
would not have careers without Mickey Mouse.

402
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:57,488
That's an icon, a basketball lover and a historical rap lover.

403
00:21:58,168 --> 00:21:59,968
Yeah. He has always been all of these things.

404
00:22:00,108 --> 00:22:01,108
Mickey loves it.

405
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:03,428
We just saw in between this.

406
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,848
What are the commercials with this?

407
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:08,568
I was pointing out to Scott is for limited edition.

408
00:22:08,748 --> 00:22:10,728
Mickey Mouse beats headphones

409
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:15,548
and the spokesman in the commercial was Lil Yachty,

410
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:19,248
which is a very time like that is like, oh, OK.

411
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:24,068
Yes, that that is very funny that Disney is in his heart.

412
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:27,668
It is like the current crop of famous people.

413
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:29,708
But like, yeah, Lil Yachty, Megan Trainor.

414
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,448
But it's all right now.

415
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:33,808
It's terrified me where Megan Trainor leads a giant children's choir

416
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:35,868
over to the couch where Mickey is.

417
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:38,008
If I were Mickey, I'd be scared of that.

418
00:22:38,328 --> 00:22:41,008
Like 50 children all coming at me. Yeah.

419
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,888
It's it was all a little odd.

420
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,148
The cutaways, we're looking at a cutaway right now.

421
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,728
The cutaways are the fakiest thing.

422
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:49,788
And this is why it's good that you didn't go, Mike,

423
00:22:49,988 --> 00:22:54,148
because I think you would have been directed for hours and hours.

424
00:22:54,188 --> 00:22:55,628
This would have become such a chore.

425
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:58,208
Yeah, because they like direct the audience, like when the audience

426
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,108
like standing up and like look at everyone's faces.

427
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:04,308
And during these like shows or awards, not award shows,

428
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:07,928
but like these weird specials, everyone will, if they're supposed to be excited,

429
00:23:08,068 --> 00:23:13,508
will have these faces on that look so unnatural and not what excitement looks like.

430
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:16,248
But it's clear that some director was like, all right,

431
00:23:16,248 --> 00:23:20,828
now we need this section to stand up and clap as loud and as hard as you can.

432
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:22,328
And it's just this fake thing.

433
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:26,288
And they do this a lot and they cut in inserts and it's between in the end.

434
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:31,408
Especially for I was saying for NTC 127's performance, the cutaways.

435
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:32,888
You know the name of this band.

436
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:34,948
In front of me.

437
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:36,008
What is it? Say it again.

438
00:23:36,188 --> 00:23:38,468
NTC 127. NTC 127.

439
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:40,568
That's a video format, isn't it?

440
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:42,428
You have to export an NTC 127.

441
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:43,308
Aspect ratio.

442
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:48,228
They the audience for that, I was saying, I couldn't tell

443
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:53,588
if it was central casting seat fillers or ABC employees, because it seemed like

444
00:23:53,588 --> 00:23:58,968
it was just rows of of women who they're like, all right, they're good.

445
00:23:59,128 --> 00:24:01,188
Now we're on you and just look real excited.

446
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:03,328
Clap like like you're really into this.

447
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,448
I just my big issue.

448
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:09,468
You know, I don't ever want to be just blindly nostalgic

449
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:11,728
and something is better because it was in the past.

450
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:16,728
But let me say this, like I was an active fan of like the VMAs in the 80s and the 90s.

451
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:18,548
Oh, yeah. And I like that there were sloppy.

452
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:20,448
They were sloppy. There were mistakes.

453
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:23,748
People did shit and they didn't have cameras on and they had to react.

454
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:27,488
And somebody acted out or these Kanye moments even up until recently.

455
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:29,528
I love things like that.

456
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:33,228
There's an Eddie Murphy hosted VMAs where it is so sloppy.

457
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:34,548
He is not rehearsed.

458
00:24:34,628 --> 00:24:38,908
He takes a camera backstage into a bathroom and everybody's like, ah, like,

459
00:24:39,088 --> 00:24:40,868
you know, like he told people he was going to do it.

460
00:24:40,868 --> 00:24:42,288
It certainly wasn't blocked out.

461
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:48,028
Why have we all accepted that these specials are so glossy and hyper edited?

462
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:51,288
Yeah, there's no room for anything remotely interesting to happen.

463
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:54,188
See, I always like the movie awards better because they always came

464
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:57,648
at the start of summer and I'd get to see previews of like, oh,

465
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,328
what movies are coming out this summer?

466
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:04,168
And there was usually cool musical performances there, too.

467
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:06,888
So but then the VMAs always came at the end of summer.

468
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:08,668
And I was like, oh, now summer's almost over.

469
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:09,788
The VMAs are here.

470
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:14,428
Oh, so you have dread because you're like maybe like doing homework by then.

471
00:25:14,828 --> 00:25:15,208
Yeah. Yeah.

472
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:18,168
Doing like I had to do finish summer reading.

473
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:19,728
I had to finish this.

474
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:21,068
So you five days.

475
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:24,508
You're saying you don't care if it's taped or live or slick,

476
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:27,168
as long as you get to see movie trailers and it's the start of summer.

477
00:25:27,188 --> 00:25:30,688
I well, I'm very easy to trick at the start of summer.

478
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:33,508
Sure. But no, I agree with Scott.

479
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:35,488
I like it when it's a little looser.

480
00:25:35,588 --> 00:25:37,768
It is so, so very slick.

481
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:40,508
I mean, I liked I'm sure part.

482
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:44,428
We talked about this on the Christmas like parade episode,

483
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:48,748
the Christmas specials like we my family watch that every year.

484
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:49,848
Like Christmas morning.

485
00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:52,628
And if we so boring now, they're deeply boring.

486
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:55,948
They've just gotten to the point, I think, where they are just trying

487
00:25:55,948 --> 00:25:58,508
like mistakes are not tolerated.

488
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,188
They just the control is tightened.

489
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:04,368
So like because those old specials are boring, but because they were rougher,

490
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:05,728
they were interesting. Yeah.

491
00:26:06,308 --> 00:26:09,608
And again, this is this might be nostalgia tricking me,

492
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:14,288
but some of those specials were like, this is the shot live on Main Street

493
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:18,868
right now. And we're like, well, cool, Disney, Disneyland on Christmas Day,

494
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:20,588
Disney World on Christmas Day.

495
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:24,168
And now it's all like they start filming that shit in October.

496
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:28,308
They'll like take down the Halloween decorations and cordon off a little area

497
00:26:28,308 --> 00:26:30,668
to like, yeah, we're going to film this for the Christmas thing.

498
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:33,228
Oh, yeah. They're movies. It's inserts.

499
00:26:33,248 --> 00:26:35,328
Yeah, they're filming audiences.

500
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:38,548
It's it's so preened as opposed to like,

501
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:42,528
let's let Regis do whatever he wants and like get people's names wrong

502
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:44,628
and miss here. Where are you from? Where are you from?

503
00:26:44,748 --> 00:26:46,368
Where are you from? All right, back to you.

504
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:49,048
So if we were going to plus up this Mickey special,

505
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:53,068
what do we get Regis or Eddie Murphy to host it?

506
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:54,488
Maybe both of them.

507
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,728
I don't know about current Eddie Murphy, but current Regis for sure.

508
00:26:57,928 --> 00:27:00,068
Yeah, that's the solution.

509
00:27:00,848 --> 00:27:02,368
I just give them no time to rehearse.

510
00:27:02,368 --> 00:27:03,708
It could even be all the same stuff.

511
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,308
I want people to trip.

512
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:08,508
I want I want Mickey's eye to fall out.

513
00:27:08,548 --> 00:27:09,728
All right. Problems.

514
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,788
And then like Mickey will speak a lot like whoever is doing.

515
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:15,288
Mickey's voice has to be on a mic behind the stage

516
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:18,268
and they just has to react to whatever people say or do.

517
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:19,148
Yeah. Yeah.

518
00:27:19,528 --> 00:27:22,388
And the audience and everybody should be fed a lot of booze

519
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:24,388
and people should be able to shout whatever they want.

520
00:27:24,688 --> 00:27:26,228
Mickey and he has to deal with it.

521
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:31,448
And still the K-pop band NTC 127 should be there, right?

522
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:32,948
No, no, no. They're staying. They're staying.

523
00:27:32,948 --> 00:27:34,068
Of course. Yeah.

524
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:37,008
Mike, I don't want to ruin the end of this for you, but it does.

525
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:42,928
That's OK. Mickey coming out in his classic, you know, red pants and tail.

526
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:44,368
You know, the short tails.

527
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:48,388
No, no, no. Like his formal attire, his form, formal conductor.

528
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:49,888
Gosh, kids here.

529
00:27:50,788 --> 00:27:52,328
Josh Gad has just showed up on screen.

530
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:55,308
My impression of Josh Gad is like the Pillsbury Doughboy was a kid.

531
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:56,928
Well, I'm just kidding.

532
00:27:57,548 --> 00:28:00,708
That is kind of his voice when he's doing like his is like sticky voice.

533
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,908
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He gets cheeky.

534
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:05,628
I'm Olaf, the snowman.

535
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:10,408
I'll also I, you know, I know he's not affiliated with the company anymore,

536
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:16,508
but no Disney special is any good in my book without the terrible acting

537
00:28:16,508 --> 00:28:17,428
of Michael Eisner.

538
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:21,528
So my request is that still, though, he's not in charge of the company.

539
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:25,088
This event should be hosted live on stage by Michael Eisner.

540
00:28:25,628 --> 00:28:26,928
That's the only way I'm happy.

541
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:29,488
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

542
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:33,028
Mickey comes out in formal where all his friends come out, too.

543
00:28:33,148 --> 00:28:34,988
And then he stands for his friends.

544
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:39,548
Oh, Pluto and Scoofy and not NTC 127.

545
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:43,528
I think everyone comes out at the end, actually, everyone from the special.

546
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:49,168
And then Mickey is raised up on a platform that then becomes a tiered

547
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:54,408
birthday cake and he starts dancing again, but a little looser dancing.

548
00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:57,128
And the song that is playing is

549
00:28:57,428 --> 00:28:59,868
Zero to Hero from the Hercules soundtrack.

550
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:01,108
What now?

551
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:05,308
Yeah, now at the very end of the grand finale of Mickey's birthday party.

552
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:06,688
But hey, he's the birthday boy.

553
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,288
He gets a song he wants. Right.

554
00:29:08,448 --> 00:29:09,608
I know we need to wrap this up.

555
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:11,668
But also my big comment is that this special,

556
00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:14,668
if you're asking what the core of the special was, it's pretty much

557
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:17,288
people come out and sing When You Wish Upon a Star.

558
00:29:17,308 --> 00:29:20,308
And you've got a friend in me to Mickey, which makes me think so.

559
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:24,928
Mickey only likes the songs that his company made. Yes.

560
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:28,628
He likes songs where ultimately, like at the end of the day,

561
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:31,068
the songwriting royalties go to me.

562
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,128
You performing this is money in my pocket.

563
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:36,848
My favorite song is Corporate Synergy.

564
00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:44,428
Hey, have you ever found yourself at an airport with a dead phone

565
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:47,728
and an awful old carry on with sticky wheels?

566
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:49,608
You're stuck. You don't know what to do.

567
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:52,308
That's what happened to the guys who started away.

568
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:53,908
They had a better idea.

569
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:58,588
Luggage with power away creates special carry ons and luggage

570
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,628
that are designed to be resilient, resourceful and essential

571
00:30:01,628 --> 00:30:03,788
to the way you travel today.

572
00:30:04,148 --> 00:30:08,188
Both sizes of the carry on are able to charge all cell phones, tablets,

573
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:12,228
e-readers, anything else that's powered by a USB cord right in the luggage.

574
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:14,748
The material is sleek and ultra durable.

575
00:30:14,808 --> 00:30:18,668
They use high quality materials while offering a much lower price

576
00:30:18,668 --> 00:30:21,348
compared to other brands by cutting out the middle man

577
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:23,768
and selling directly to you.

578
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:26,348
You can choose from a variety of colors and sizes.

579
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:29,808
The carry on, the bigger carry on, the medium and the large.

580
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:32,108
I'm going to Japan soon.

581
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:35,548
I'm really excited, but I don't have a good carry on,

582
00:30:35,588 --> 00:30:37,788
a good functional carry on that can charge your phone.

583
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:41,888
I am so excited to try a way to take it to Japan with me.

584
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:44,588
These things are easy to carry up and down stairs.

585
00:30:44,768 --> 00:30:47,208
They're so lightweight and I'll be able to charge my phone.

586
00:30:47,248 --> 00:30:49,248
I don't have to worry about it dying on the trip.

587
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,228
It's going to make my vacation so much easier.

588
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:55,008
And I'm very excited for twenty dollars off on a way suitcase.

589
00:30:55,068 --> 00:31:00,148
Visit a way travel dot com and use promo code theme park during checkout.

590
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:01,748
That's twenty dollars off.

591
00:31:01,768 --> 00:31:06,028
If you go to a way travel dot com, use promo code theme park away.

592
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,368
First class luggage at a coach price.

593
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:12,768
Hi, folks, Jason here.

594
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:16,588
You know, I'm a frugal man and I hate paying a lot for crappy quality product.

595
00:31:16,948 --> 00:31:18,388
At Everlane, that doesn't happen.

596
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:22,608
Upgrade your go tos and your style and make Everlane's classics your new favorites.

597
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:26,228
I've gotten clothes on Everlane for myself and for others as gifts,

598
00:31:26,388 --> 00:31:27,468
and they're always a hit.

599
00:31:28,268 --> 00:31:31,748
Everlane only makes premium essentials using the finest materials

600
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:35,688
without traditional markups, and they tell you their real costs.

601
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:37,988
So, you know, you're never overpaying.

602
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:41,408
Everlane wants you to know what you're paying for and why.

603
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:44,548
They're radically transparent about every step in the process,

604
00:31:44,788 --> 00:31:47,988
from the materials they use to the ethical factories they work with.

605
00:31:48,188 --> 00:31:50,488
Because Everlane sells directly to you,

606
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:54,388
their prices are 30 to 50 percent lower than traditional retailers.

607
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:58,268
Everlane's clothes look better, cost less and last longer.

608
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:01,928
Essentials like their cotton crew T-shirt are exactly what they should be.

609
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:05,188
Simple, stylish and made from quality materials.

610
00:32:05,808 --> 00:32:09,088
Some stuff on Everlane I'm fond of include the 365 crew,

611
00:32:09,488 --> 00:32:12,408
the nylon weekender and the slim fit jean.

612
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:15,328
Everlane's timeless essentials are just what you're looking for.

613
00:32:15,448 --> 00:32:17,028
No frills, just quality.

614
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:20,168

Everlane.com slash theme park.

619
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:37,808
The the subtext, of course, to this special

620
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:42,628
is that it was a joint birthday between Mickey Mouse

621
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:48,008
and the many anniversaries of when public domain laws have been changed.

622
00:32:48,248 --> 00:32:51,588
So Mickey and Superman do not go into the public domain.

623
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:55,568
Sure. Which that'll be coming up again soon.

624
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:58,548
Coming up again. And I wonder how they will rule.

625
00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:02,988
Yeah. Well, you know, when that happens,

626
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,828
Disney will flex their considerable muscle

627
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:11,968
as they have done in the elections that transpired on Tuesday.

628
00:33:12,628 --> 00:33:17,588
We are recording this hot on the heels of the midterm elections,

629
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:21,588
which I hope that wherever you are listening to this,

630
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:25,608
that you're mildly happy with whatever happened in your area.

631
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:29,388
I think we can agree that was not a blue wave, but there was some blue.

632
00:33:29,388 --> 00:33:33,428
There are some blue speckles and some nice things that occurred.

633
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:37,828
Very good stuff happened. California kind of ate shit, but

634
00:33:37,828 --> 00:33:40,228
we'll be fine.

635
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:41,968
We're saying there's some there's some good ones.

636
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:46,588
We're just catching with a couple like this one in Orange County seems to flip

637
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:49,028
blue and Katie Hill.

638
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:50,808
We have a new one.

639
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:56,688
Yeah. Yeah. For some reason, California denied a rent control measure that,

640
00:33:56,688 --> 00:34:03,048
you know, probably screws us and everyone who's ever been on this podcast

641
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:05,508
and everyone who's ever been on any podcast.

642
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:11,228
A large portion of California residents rent not own.

643
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:16,108
And that proposition had a lot of money coming in from massive,

644
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:20,408
massive real estate companies. The no on that proposition.

645
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:25,228
So there's there are some bummers. There's some good things.

646
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:30,768
But we were primarily invested in the midterms as to how it affects

647
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,688
Anaheim and the future of the Disneyland Resort.

648
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:36,888
And this is all this is all legitimate stuff.

649
00:34:37,048 --> 00:34:38,928
And I think until we started talking about doing this episode,

650
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:42,608
I don't think we realized how much was on the line for Disney.

651
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:48,008
And we will reveal to you as we go how things landed for Disney.

652
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,988
Yes. Also, if you are not in California or Disneyland is not your like primary

653
00:34:52,988 --> 00:34:57,628
park, home park, whatever, there will be plenty of theme park infrastructure

654
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,408
talk, which everyone loves when we do.

655
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:06,868
So and we will make a point to try and contextualize it in terms of larger

656
00:35:06,868 --> 00:35:11,208
theme park comings and goings and and if none of that interests you,

657
00:35:11,308 --> 00:35:15,608
I will still like quiz Jason about his diet periodically during the episode.

658
00:35:15,788 --> 00:35:17,988
There'll still be some treat bullshit, I'm sure.

659
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:21,408
So all right.

660
00:35:21,408 --> 00:35:26,948
If we're talking about Disneyland and how it compares to other resorts

661
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:32,248
in Florida, they set up this fake shadow government,

662
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:34,928
the Reedy the Reedy Creek Improvement District.

663
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:37,108
I was reading about it. Yeah, it's crazy.

664
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:38,748
They they're just their own government.

665
00:35:39,128 --> 00:35:42,008
Yeah. Yeah. And they did that by design

666
00:35:42,008 --> 00:35:47,768
so that they didn't have to deal with the surrounding city as they did in

667
00:35:47,768 --> 00:35:50,348
when they started Disneyland in 55.

668
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:54,688
You know, Disney has always had to curry favor with the city of Anaheim,

669
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:57,348
and they didn't buy all the land that they maybe would have wanted to

670
00:35:57,348 --> 00:35:59,628
because they didn't know if it was going to be a hit or a flop.

671
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,008
So by the time Florida comes around, they have a shadow government.

672
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:04,388
Yes. But not the case.

673
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:10,928
Right. I read that at Florida that Disney World Government can issue municipal bonds.

674
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:13,188
Hmm. Yeah, that makes sense.

675
00:36:13,948 --> 00:36:16,248
That just Disney, the Disney Company. Yes.

676
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:20,148
Ultimately. And I'm sure we're going to talk at some point about

677
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:23,928
Celebration Florida, but there was just a very good is the YouTube channel.

678
00:36:24,388 --> 00:36:27,368
Rob plays that the name of it, if that's what's in my head, it's probably it.

679
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:30,968
There was a very good series of YouTube videos about Celebration Florida,

680
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:34,828
which was all this effort to that's Disney's town that they built on

681
00:36:34,828 --> 00:36:36,768
the outskirts of the Disney World property.

682
00:36:36,768 --> 00:36:41,068
And it was like they were going to like lose the land if they didn't do something with it.

683
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:42,608
So, all right, let's build a town.

684
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:46,348
And they since have divested from the town and it was kind of a disaster.

685
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,548
And it's going back to nature almost.

686
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:52,488
It sounds like things are not going great since Celebration.

687
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:57,928
Colonial houses are being reclaimed by Swamp Land and plants and alligators.

688
00:36:57,928 --> 00:36:59,588
The apartment buildings condemned.

689
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:03,548
There's a very interesting article out there about the movie theater.

690
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:09,108
And they built a big movie house and that the people actually really did love.

691
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:14,268
And then I think AMC took over running it and then they divested from it.

692
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:16,308
And then the locals tried to buy it.

693
00:37:16,328 --> 00:37:17,668
But then there was issues with that.

694
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:19,248
And the building is not doing well.

695
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:20,908
It's a real fucking mess.

696
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:23,088
Now it's just filled with wasps.

697
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:24,568
It's a wasp sanctuary.

698
00:37:24,568 --> 00:37:25,668
Yeah, probably.

699
00:37:27,588 --> 00:37:30,188
I. Yeah. So to.

700
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:34,988
That's just funny that like, all right, what happens if Disney does control a city?

701
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:37,528
It's a horrible, notorious mess.

702
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:38,828
So instead.

703
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:43,668
But it doesn't seem to be any better necessarily when they have to do a little dance

704
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:45,248
with the city that they're in.

705
00:37:45,508 --> 00:37:48,428
So let's we'll step you through this bit by bit.

706
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:51,828
If anybody listening to this follows Disneyland News,

707
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:56,708
then you're maybe aware of a couple odd things that have been happening all year.

708
00:37:57,588 --> 00:38:02,448
About a year ago, we recorded a podcast in which we eulogized

709
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:07,768
some businesses that were being removed from the downtown Disney shopping.

710
00:38:08,028 --> 00:38:08,568
Yes, that's right.

711
00:38:09,228 --> 00:38:15,328
Disney announced plans to build a luxury hotel at the outskirts of downtown Disney.

712
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:19,728
In order to do this, they were going to have to get rid of the AMC theater,

713
00:38:20,068 --> 00:38:25,168
the Rainforest Cafe, the ESPN zone, and of course, Earl of Sandwich.

714
00:38:25,548 --> 00:38:28,708
We did eulogies for all of these establishments.

715
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:30,268
They were all going to disappear.

716
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,148
And then they did disappear.

717
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:36,228
All of these places were taken out of downtown Disney closed.

718
00:38:36,508 --> 00:38:40,208
And then to go back a year farther in 2016,

719
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:43,068
they first announced this new hotel.

720
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:48,628
Right. And the plans had the plans have since changed a couple of times.

721
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:53,128
This new hotel was going to be a 700 room, four diamond hotel

722
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:56,028
built on top of the downtown Disney resort.

723
00:38:56,408 --> 00:38:59,888
So north of these restaurants that closed. Oh, yes. OK. OK.

724
00:38:59,948 --> 00:39:03,228
And and they put out some very scratchy concept art.

725
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:06,908
Mickey hugging a child in a lobby, a pool,

726
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:11,528
and then the rooftop bar, lounge restaurant that would have views

727
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:14,648
into the parking and be able to watch fireworks there.

728
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:16,528
Sounded pretty nice.

729
00:39:16,748 --> 00:39:22,188
And by the way, four diamond resorts are a big deal for the city of Anaheim.

730
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,688
Yes. Something that they want, something that they're after,

731
00:39:24,848 --> 00:39:28,888
and something that they are issuing tax subsidies in order to encourage to happen.

732
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:31,768
Not just Disney, but other property.

733
00:39:31,808 --> 00:39:35,088
The people who run the Garden Walk Mall that's right nearby

734
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:37,368
have talked about building four diamond resorts, too.

735
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:39,788
It's better for their

736
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:43,068
convention business to have a higher tier of hotel.

737
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:46,188
Yeah, because right now the only four diamond resorts

738
00:39:46,188 --> 00:39:50,068
are the Disney hotel in the Grand Californian Hotel. Oh.

739
00:39:50,328 --> 00:39:53,148
But there are multiple other four diamond resorts coming.

740
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,828
Yeah. Like you said, at the Garden Walk, the Annabelle Hotel,

741
00:39:56,168 --> 00:39:59,268
which I always thought seemed like a very nice hotel mission style building

742
00:39:59,268 --> 00:40:03,548
kind of right behind California Adventure closed over the summer.

743
00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:07,008
And they're leveling it and building

744
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:11,308
like a new Annabelle Hotel that will be twice as big

745
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,908
and will be a four diamond. Oh, interesting.

746
00:40:13,908 --> 00:40:17,428
And then I think there's two others coming on top of that.

747
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:21,248
OK, so this is all this is all good news.

748
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:23,068
Anaheim's getting along with Disney.

749
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:25,608
They're they want to they're going to build.

750
00:40:25,808 --> 00:40:27,648
They're going to get these tax incentives.

751
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:30,928
They'll add more parking for downtown Disney.

752
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:36,208
And there was going to be a parking garage or next to it or underneath.

753
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,328
For the new hotel and for downtown Disney.

754
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:44,288
Mm hmm. But then but then cut to a year later.

755
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,168
The plans of the hotel have changed.

756
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:50,108
They've moved about a ball, only a block south.

757
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:54,588
But the building looks

758
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:58,108
it was still about the same number of rooms, but it looks massive.

759
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:02,008
It was going to encompass the monorail stop.

760
00:41:02,048 --> 00:41:06,508
And it was going to be built on top of like, yeah, the movie theater.

761
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:10,088
The Starbucks on that part of the property. Oh, yeah.

762
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:13,928
ESPN zone, the Rainforest Cafe and the Earl of Sandwich. Yeah.

763
00:41:13,968 --> 00:41:16,908
Which was not very old to the Earl of Sandwich either.

764
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,248
Oh, yeah, true. Yeah. 2012, I think. Yeah. Yeah.

765
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:24,108
Yeah. And and I think part of the reason they moved it from instead of the hotel

766
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:27,848
being built over by the Mickey and Friends parking garage, which you know about

767
00:41:27,848 --> 00:41:31,308
because we talked about it instead of there, they wanted to move it

768
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:33,608
onto the monorail path. Yeah.

769
00:41:33,608 --> 00:41:35,748
So they did this. It's fine, right?

770
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:37,608
It's just somewhere else on our property.

771
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:40,968
It was not fine at the city of Anaheim.

772
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:42,728
Furious about this.

773
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:46,948
It technically to move the hotel required a different address.

774
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:49,028
This is not the same.

775
00:41:49,248 --> 00:41:51,348
It's not with the plans that you filed with us.

776
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:55,288
So we can't approve it in the tax subsidies you would get.

777
00:41:55,288 --> 00:41:57,728
Would not be part of this. Right.

778
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:01,428
And it also cost the move cost jobs.

779
00:42:01,508 --> 00:42:04,568
It closed all for all of these businesses to close.

780
00:42:04,628 --> 00:42:09,668
Now, I believe they were trying to reallocate people's positions

781
00:42:09,668 --> 00:42:13,788
within either the resort or these independent these companies.

782
00:42:13,788 --> 00:42:18,288
Starbucks, AMC, you know, find the employees new jobs.

783
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:22,708
But that's still like a lot of businesses closing right at once.

784
00:42:23,088 --> 00:42:27,048
Yeah. Yeah. So Rainforest Cafe gutted ESPN zone.

785
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:31,568
If you go there right now, it still says ESPN zone, but there's nothing on the inside.

786
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:37,048
This is a very odd thing for a Disney shopping district to have just shuttered

787
00:42:37,048 --> 00:42:41,448
buildings, shuttered building, clearly playing football games on the outside.

788
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:43,828
The outside. They still show the bill.

789
00:42:44,148 --> 00:42:46,028
Yeah, yeah, they're on. That's the weirdest thing.

790
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:48,108
I I think you're right.

791
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:50,928
But also I was thinking about what is the reality where these screens

792
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:52,808
aren't on and the lights aren't on.

793
00:42:52,808 --> 00:42:55,228
And it just looks like a scary building, probably.

794
00:42:55,228 --> 00:42:57,688
So it makes sense to me that something is on those TVs.

795
00:42:57,748 --> 00:42:59,108
But it is weird. Sure.

796
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:02,868
And they've made an effort to make that this zone of downtown

797
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:05,208
Disney feel like a little street fair.

798
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:09,188
They kept the stage going where you can see, you know, some swing band

799
00:43:09,188 --> 00:43:12,468
or whatever it is. And they put up there's a bunch of food trucks.

800
00:43:12,648 --> 00:43:18,228
But none of it truly distracting from the fact that there's a gutted movie theater.

801
00:43:18,508 --> 00:43:23,708
So what has happened now is a pretty

802
00:43:25,128 --> 00:43:29,208
unprecedented event in Disney history that a closed shop,

803
00:43:29,428 --> 00:43:32,048
the Earl of Sandwich, has been reopened.

804
00:43:32,448 --> 00:43:34,548
The Earl of Sandwich is back.

805
00:43:34,848 --> 00:43:36,868
I saw it with my own two eyes.

806
00:43:36,868 --> 00:43:38,128
I ate there. A couple nights ago.

807
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,988
Oh, now I've never really eaten at the Earl of Sandwich.

808
00:43:42,188 --> 00:43:44,308
I have only been once with me.

809
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:46,628
I think right when it first opened. Yeah.

810
00:43:47,128 --> 00:43:49,688
What's the what's the read on the quality of the Earl of Sandwich?

811
00:43:49,748 --> 00:43:52,348
It is above average for Disney.

812
00:43:52,868 --> 00:43:54,228
That is not good.

813
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:56,388
Well, I wouldn't say not good.

814
00:43:56,388 --> 00:44:00,268
I would say like it's a it's very reasonably priced for Disney.

815
00:44:00,268 --> 00:44:04,968
And I don't know, I think it's one of the better options for cheap lunch.

816
00:44:05,288 --> 00:44:10,548
Yes, it's one of the few counter service options in officially in downtown

817
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:13,888
Disney, you go to the hotels and get decent counter service to

818
00:44:13,888 --> 00:44:16,308
a couple of the sandwiches are better than others.

819
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:19,508
I'm trying to think the one I like, like the one that's the first one,

820
00:44:19,588 --> 00:44:20,908
whatever that one is. Yeah.

821
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:21,948
Like that Gobbler.

822
00:44:22,008 --> 00:44:23,368
I feel like that was a big thing when they open.

823
00:44:23,368 --> 00:44:26,588
They have like the yeah, Gobbler's like Thanksgiving dinner on a roll.

824
00:44:26,688 --> 00:44:27,988
OK, I never had that one.

825
00:44:28,808 --> 00:44:33,668
But yeah, it's it's one of the better places to eat for seven dollars.

826
00:44:34,148 --> 00:44:40,248
Yeah. It was my salvation in Paris because they I was able to go in there

827
00:44:40,248 --> 00:44:45,428
and get a cup of tea and a banana because I was so desperate in Paris

828
00:44:45,428 --> 00:44:47,428
for something, not just soaked in salt.

829
00:44:47,648 --> 00:44:50,868
So, hey, thanks for the banana Earl of Sandwich.

830
00:44:50,948 --> 00:44:54,568
I think something about the brand weirds me out in general.

831
00:44:54,688 --> 00:44:59,368
I feel like at least in the Paris one, I didn't love the smell of the facility.

832
00:45:00,608 --> 00:45:04,608
I think some of the shots of the sandwiches gross me out a little bit.

833
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:07,928
They some of them seem unbelievably rich.

834
00:45:08,388 --> 00:45:12,248
And and I have this other thing with the Earl of Sandwich,

835
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:15,728
which I think will become a Patreon episode at some point,

836
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:19,568
which is the owner of Earl of Sandwich, Robert Earl,

837
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:22,868
who also owns Bucatabeppo and Planet Hollywood.

838
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:24,248
And there is a seer.

839
00:45:24,268 --> 00:45:27,088
I you know, I don't even want to get into it. I. Yeah.

840
00:45:27,788 --> 00:45:30,248
We may have talked about him a little in the past.

841
00:45:30,568 --> 00:45:33,468
Yeah, we will delve into this.

842
00:45:33,588 --> 00:45:34,968
The Robert Earl in general.

843
00:45:35,128 --> 00:45:39,228
But there's let me just say that Robert Earl gives me an icky feeling

844
00:45:39,228 --> 00:45:44,808
about this brand in addition to the the icky feeling I get by looking at it.

845
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:45,888
You can attest to the quality.

846
00:45:45,888 --> 00:45:47,888
The quality of food is like pretty good.

847
00:45:47,908 --> 00:45:48,688
Fine. OK, OK.

848
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:53,608
I also will recommend the the pizza Napoli, the Vienna Napoli,

849
00:45:53,768 --> 00:45:56,868
whatever the pizza slices to go in downtown Disney. Very good.

850
00:45:57,468 --> 00:45:58,548
I didn't know they did to go.

851
00:45:59,268 --> 00:46:02,188
Yeah, I think it's been closed for a while because I think they've been redoing

852
00:46:02,188 --> 00:46:04,448
a lot of that. You have to demand it, though.

853
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:06,728
What's that for them to do this to slices to go?

854
00:46:07,128 --> 00:46:10,408
You have to stand at the desk and say, I want to win a gun.

855
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,688
Yeah, Jason. Oh, I see. You're teasing me.

856
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:14,588
Yeah, I get it.

857
00:46:15,268 --> 00:46:17,768
You know, downtown Disney is in a good zone right now.

858
00:46:17,848 --> 00:46:21,308
I feel like they are adding some good some good establishments in general.

859
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:24,288
Splitsville is fairly high quality.

860
00:46:24,688 --> 00:46:28,908
So we'll get we'll get into this in, you know, a number of sectors

861
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:32,408
at some godforsaken point in the future.

862
00:46:32,668 --> 00:46:34,088
But this is just this.

863
00:46:34,188 --> 00:46:38,308
This is the odd crux events that made us have to talk about a lot of stuff.

864
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:41,708
A sandwich place closed entirely, all the signage removed,

865
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:44,748
the all the kitchen implements are out of there.

866
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:46,288
And now it is back.

867
00:46:46,368 --> 00:46:48,528
They hired back up and it's like it never happened.

868
00:46:48,728 --> 00:46:53,048
This awkward situation presented by the bizarre

869
00:46:53,048 --> 00:46:57,108
nature of Disney's relationship with the city of Anaheim at this moment.

870
00:46:57,308 --> 00:46:59,828
And it started like once you start reading about all this,

871
00:46:59,868 --> 00:47:03,948
and then it ties back to the parking garage fiasco from the year prior,

872
00:47:04,028 --> 00:47:05,768
which is they were going to build a big parking garage

873
00:47:05,768 --> 00:47:07,588
and have a whole new hub across from Harbor.

874
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:10,448
And then the city was mad because they didn't want those businesses to suffer

875
00:47:10,468 --> 00:47:12,648
because it would have just been a bridge from the parking garage.

876
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,808
You couldn't access Harbor and the local businesses.

877
00:47:14,888 --> 00:47:19,488
Yeah, let's let's slow down because you're going very fast through that,

878
00:47:19,608 --> 00:47:20,928
because that was long.

879
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:25,808
Like visitors going fast above shitty restaurants.

880
00:47:26,228 --> 00:47:29,668
I was just trying to make sure the episode doesn't go three hours.

881
00:47:29,668 --> 00:47:35,268
So but the current state of the hotel is that it was the project was canceled.

882
00:47:35,828 --> 00:47:39,048
The Eastern Gateway, which was the name of this parking garage,

883
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:44,048
that was going to be for people coming from Disneyland from

884
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:45,428
south of the resort.

885
00:47:46,768 --> 00:47:49,208
They were going to direct their traffic coming from the south

886
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:53,328
to that garage and coming from the north to the Mickey and Friends garage.

887
00:47:53,428 --> 00:47:56,868
All this because and people who've been to Disneyland recently now know

888
00:47:56,868 --> 00:48:00,848
that they are building a new parking garage right next to Mickey and Friends.

889
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:04,308
And don't worry, we'll be covering it at length. Yes.

890
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:08,368
But Disney is in sore, sore need

891
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:14,048
of more parking because Galaxy's Edge is going to be a clusterfuck.

892
00:48:14,068 --> 00:48:16,388
It's going to be so crazy when that thing.

893
00:48:16,508 --> 00:48:17,888
It's crazy already.

894
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:21,368
Every time we're there, we talk about how are they possibly going to add

895
00:48:21,368 --> 00:48:27,348
an entire Star Wars theme park, essentially on top of what we already have.

896
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,968
New parking sorely needed.

897
00:48:29,008 --> 00:48:31,488
They had this whole plan for a gigantic structure.

898
00:48:31,848 --> 00:48:37,468
And the city of Anaheim said no, no, no, because they had this crazy scheme

899
00:48:37,468 --> 00:48:42,268
that, yeah, to get into the resort from that side of the property,

900
00:48:42,588 --> 00:48:48,168
you would have to go into like the ground floor of this massive structure

901
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:51,808
through the security set up and over the sky bridge.

902
00:48:53,328 --> 00:48:57,128
You would not be able to enter off of the street

903
00:48:57,128 --> 00:49:00,808
anymore directly into the Esplanade to security there.

904
00:49:00,808 --> 00:49:04,408
You were going to have to take the sky bridge in so that they could send

905
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:11,288
everyone through security in the garage, take the walkway above Harbor in

906
00:49:11,288 --> 00:49:15,428
then into the Esplanade that pissed off all of those restaurants.

907
00:49:15,428 --> 00:49:19,288
And there's quite a few hotels that are right there along Harbor,

908
00:49:19,648 --> 00:49:24,148
many of which market themselves as like the closest hotels to the main entrance

909
00:49:24,148 --> 00:49:28,148
of Disney, closer than the Disneyland Hotel and Paradise Pier Hotel.

910
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:29,348
Distance wise.

911
00:49:30,308 --> 00:49:32,828
So now there's a big, clunky, concrete

912
00:49:32,828 --> 00:49:38,508
bridge blocking views, blocking your path that they're like sending people

913
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:43,848
through the sky above local businesses that have been there for decades and decades.

914
00:49:44,088 --> 00:49:45,508
Yeah, it wasn't a good look.

915
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:47,508
I will say this. It's a thing they need.

916
00:49:47,628 --> 00:49:49,668
It's a thing I kind of wish they would get to build,

917
00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:52,348
but not the best scenario for the neighborhood.

918
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:56,088
There seems like there was a solution where they could let people exit the

919
00:49:56,088 --> 00:49:57,848
bridge and at least go down on the harbor.

920
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:58,828
Yeah. Yeah.

921
00:49:58,828 --> 00:50:01,488
But they want to do that because they want to they're trying to choke all

922
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:05,968
those businesses out so that eventually they go out of business and Disney can

923
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:08,808
keep buying up property. Yeah, that's what they're doing.

924
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:11,168
I mean, I think they're hoping the Garden Walk

925
00:50:11,168 --> 00:50:15,068
literally like folds into the ground before they buy it.

926
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:16,448
Because like they want all of that.

927
00:50:16,468 --> 00:50:20,128
They want everything there, but they want to pay like dirt cheap prices for it.

928
00:50:20,128 --> 00:50:21,068
It's got to be the plan.

929
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:24,508
And this is if you haven't been to the Garden Walk, it is the shopping center.

930
00:50:24,848 --> 00:50:26,608
Not even that close to Disney.

931
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:27,948
It's a pretty awkward zone.

932
00:50:27,948 --> 00:50:29,548
But it does bridge.

933
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:34,568
It would bridge a parking garage to a potential third gate,

934
00:50:34,928 --> 00:50:38,548
which is sort of south of the convention center and all this stuff.

935
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:39,408
So, yeah, I absolutely.

936
00:50:39,528 --> 00:50:42,588
And if you go around that mall, nobody is there.

937
00:50:42,848 --> 00:50:44,408
It is so desolate.

938
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:46,228
If you can imagine that the opening

939
00:50:46,228 --> 00:50:51,408
of the new House of Blues did not transform the area immediately.

940
00:50:51,628 --> 00:50:54,128
I really think that Disney is trying to

941
00:50:54,128 --> 00:50:57,248
burn this mall to the ground without like technically doing it.

942
00:50:57,248 --> 00:51:01,828
I mean, just by the sheer nature of being a mall in America,

943
00:51:02,428 --> 00:51:04,608
the diagnosis is not good.

944
00:51:05,308 --> 00:51:08,628
Yeah, why get into that business any time past 2005?

945
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:11,128
Yeah, unless you can fully commit resources

946
00:51:11,128 --> 00:51:16,688
to like an outdoor mixed use Americana, Glen,

947
00:51:16,988 --> 00:51:19,128
you're referring to the kind of thing.

948
00:51:19,148 --> 00:51:23,868
These are L.A. Disney, ask mall, outdoor mall, the Americana and Glendale,

949
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:27,568
which has a trolley and Frank Sinatra music and a fountain show.

950
00:51:27,948 --> 00:51:29,388
Yes. So if you're going to do a fountain

951
00:51:29,388 --> 00:51:31,608
show and a trolley, by all means, build a mall.

952
00:51:31,608 --> 00:51:33,908
Go nuts. But no, not a normal mall.

953
00:51:35,428 --> 00:51:37,828
So, you know, all of this combative

954
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:44,448
relationship is somewhat fueled by the the mayor of Anaheim, Tom Tate.

955
00:51:44,628 --> 00:51:50,808
And Tom Tate essentially was was promising to be tougher on Disney.

956
00:51:51,228 --> 00:51:54,948
And I think there's been this tension that has gone for many, many years.

957
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,708
It goes back to our episode about the McEwen Friends garage where, you know,

958
00:51:58,828 --> 00:52:03,728
back then, I'm sorry, in the 90s, when Disney was thinking about

959
00:52:03,728 --> 00:52:06,848
building their second gate, not in Anaheim, but over in Long Beach.

960
00:52:06,928 --> 00:52:11,928
Part of that was Disney saying, hey, Anaheim, hey, residents of Anaheim,

961
00:52:12,148 --> 00:52:14,428
taxpayers, build us a parking garage.

962
00:52:15,028 --> 00:52:20,588
Yes. And through the years, Disney has like the city of Anaheim has

963
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:23,128
stood up and said, no, we're not going to play ball like that.

964
00:52:23,168 --> 00:52:26,628
And it's probably never been tougher than under Mayor Tom Tate.

965
00:52:26,848 --> 00:52:28,448
Yeah. And like to just a few things,

966
00:52:28,508 --> 00:52:31,468
there's a there's a big article in the LA Times about it, which is when Disney got

967
00:52:31,468 --> 00:52:37,648
pissed and tried to pull like the access to early movies from the LA Times critics

968
00:52:37,648 --> 00:52:39,188
and oh, yeah, yeah.

969
00:52:39,788 --> 00:52:44,648
But like stuff like that, Mickey and Friends parking garage, Anaheim paid for it.

970
00:52:44,688 --> 00:52:45,888
They just paid for the whole thing.

971
00:52:46,008 --> 00:52:49,648
And then they just charged Disney a dollar rent every year and Disney collects the

972
00:52:49,648 --> 00:52:50,488
money from it.

973
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:55,048
So there's like there's like so many examples of Anaheim paying for something

974
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:59,628
and Disney getting all the money that Anaheim wanted to put like a dollar tax

975
00:52:59,628 --> 00:53:03,128
on the tickets and and Disney's like, no way.

976
00:53:03,988 --> 00:53:07,028
And yeah, in LA Times, it was like that would have been a billion dollars

977
00:53:07,028 --> 00:53:10,948
for Anaheim, which is not doing so well as a city right now.

978
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,808
There's a lot of problems in Anaheim.

979
00:53:14,008 --> 00:53:18,008
There was a little run where I was taking my bike down and riding along the river

980
00:53:18,008 --> 00:53:24,808
that goes right past Angel Stadium and kind of weaves through the eastern zone

981
00:53:24,808 --> 00:53:27,808
of Anaheim. It is scary around there.

982
00:53:27,868 --> 00:53:33,628
There are massive shanty towns like gigantic right at the border of Angel

983
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:37,468
Stadium and not that far from Disney.

984
00:53:37,868 --> 00:53:43,408
There are there are gangs and there are murders and like there's it's a like the

985
00:53:43,408 --> 00:53:44,728
take Disney out of the equation.

986
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:47,708
The city of Anaheim has a lot of problems and is really struggling and needs some

987
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:48,668
help. Yeah.

988
00:53:48,988 --> 00:53:53,608
California at large, like so many places, there's a huge homeless population.

989
00:53:54,028 --> 00:53:56,648
Like there's a huge homelessness issue

990
00:53:56,648 --> 00:53:59,768
and Anaheim.

991
00:54:00,088 --> 00:54:01,088
Yeah, it's awful.

992
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:05,648
I mean, I would say the city council and the Disney company should be ashamed

993
00:54:05,648 --> 00:54:10,448
of themselves, but corporations and government entities are not human,

994
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:14,288
contrary to Supreme Court rulings and cannot feel shame.

995
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,628
I hope the people in charge of these

996
00:54:17,628 --> 00:54:20,188
organizations sleep a little poorly at night.

997
00:54:20,188 --> 00:54:26,028
They don't. They don't because they say this is how capitalism is meant to work.

998
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:31,628
Like that dollar, the dollar of rent a year that happens all the time.

999
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:33,568
Like anytime a sports stadium is built,

1000
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:38,148
the city or the county or the state has essentially paid for that.

1001
00:54:38,368 --> 00:54:39,728
Right. Yes, that's a common thing.

1002
00:54:39,728 --> 00:54:45,088
But it's like it doesn't make sense if the place where you are operating your

1003
00:54:45,088 --> 00:54:50,548
business is suffering so poorly that you're not helping out at all.

1004
00:54:50,748 --> 00:54:54,328
And where the people who live around there couldn't possibly afford to go to

1005
00:54:54,328 --> 00:54:58,088
the places that are getting all the money and you bring up sports stadiums.

1006
00:54:58,148 --> 00:54:59,648
Let me bring another thing into this,

1007
00:54:59,828 --> 00:55:05,428
which is very similar degree of politics going on with the Angels right now.

1008
00:55:05,448 --> 00:55:09,988
Tom Tate has been tougher on the Angels than

1009
00:55:09,988 --> 00:55:14,088
previous mayors and is like it's that kind of thing.

1010
00:55:14,248 --> 00:55:19,428
It's like, no, we're not going to pay for you to get nicer luxury boxes or whatever.

1011
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:22,948
And the owner of the Angels is furious.

1012
00:55:22,968 --> 00:55:26,488
And he, in fact, has been threatening to take the Angels out of there.

1013
00:55:26,568 --> 00:55:28,488
They have to stay in Southern California

1014
00:55:28,488 --> 00:55:31,088
somewhere, but they're starting to look in Tustin.

1015
00:55:31,168 --> 00:55:33,708
They're starting to look in Carson, I believe.

1016
00:55:34,688 --> 00:55:36,868
So with all this Disney stuff going on,

1017
00:55:36,968 --> 00:55:41,428
same syndrome going on with the Angels, and it got so bad, in fact,

1018
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:47,548
that people perceive the Angels changing their name to Los Angeles Angels as a fuck

1019
00:55:47,548 --> 00:55:50,368
you to Anaheim and to Tom Tate. Yeah.

1020
00:55:50,368 --> 00:55:54,388
Like how dare you treat us like we're not going to even mention Anaheim and try to

1021
00:55:54,388 --> 00:55:57,888
get tourism to Anaheim. We consider as part of L.A.

1022
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:59,368
We're not giving you a name check anymore.

1023
00:55:59,428 --> 00:56:02,408
And that's one of the only things that that's one of the only time tape moves

1024
00:56:02,408 --> 00:56:05,708
that Disney may have liked, because there's also rumors that Disney will just

1025
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:10,588
take all that land where there's a baseball stadium and level it and put at least

1026
00:56:10,588 --> 00:56:15,328
a parking garage or something or probably another park or potentially a third gate

1027
00:56:15,328 --> 00:56:17,408
or a fourth gate. Oh, my God.

1028
00:56:17,768 --> 00:56:22,548
Yeah. Or something else they need desperately talking about people taking

1029
00:56:22,548 --> 00:56:27,828
advantage of stuff, employee parking, because employees have to park so far away

1030
00:56:27,828 --> 00:56:29,388
and get bused in.

1031
00:56:30,108 --> 00:56:36,508
It's it's one of the biggest examples of wage theft in America by a company of the

1032
00:56:36,508 --> 00:56:41,688
workers, second, probably to like Amazon employees having to spend half an hour

1033
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:45,228
going through metal detectors and not getting paid for that time.

1034
00:56:45,288 --> 00:56:46,608
Is that right? That's the case.

1035
00:56:46,768 --> 00:56:46,988
Yeah.

1036
00:56:47,168 --> 00:56:51,568
Whether it's a conscious thought in the people at Disney, the higher ups at Disney

1037
00:56:51,568 --> 00:56:56,988
or not, I think that at least subconsciously or just by the nature of how all this works,

1038
00:56:56,988 --> 00:57:02,028
they are hoping that literally the whole city of Anaheim becomes uninhabitable

1039
00:57:02,028 --> 00:57:04,068
and everyone needs to sell to them.

1040
00:57:04,528 --> 00:57:08,668
Like that is sort of I think the thinking of like we're going eventually this is

1041
00:57:08,668 --> 00:57:12,108
going to be as big as Disney World maybe in 30 years.

1042
00:57:12,308 --> 00:57:16,588
Let's just wreck everything around us and then we'll come in and buy everything up.

1043
00:57:16,588 --> 00:57:19,668
I don't know if they're really thinking in those terms, but that is what's happening.

1044
00:57:19,928 --> 00:57:21,488
That is the desired result.

1045
00:57:21,488 --> 00:57:27,088
And also, if that does happen, they're not going to share it with their workers.

1046
00:57:27,108 --> 00:57:29,188
They're not sharing that wealth with their workers.

1047
00:57:29,368 --> 00:57:29,968
There was an article.

1048
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,688
Come up to in this.

1049
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:38,568
Yeah, there's been multiple articles over recent years of like Disney employees living

1050
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:44,308
super far away or in some cases living in their cars because they're being paid

1051
00:57:44,308 --> 00:57:46,228
such low wages by Disney.

1052
00:57:46,468 --> 00:57:49,628
Yes. And now Disney has committed to paying

1053
00:57:50,068 --> 00:57:57,828
$15 as a minimum, but we'll loop back around to that because I realize there's a little caveat there.

1054
00:57:57,828 --> 00:58:00,288
Yeah, that is incredibly loaded.

1055
00:58:00,628 --> 00:58:05,768
So to get things closer to the midterms that have just occurred,

1056
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:10,788
this luxury hotel is canceled and it's canceled because of this address change.

1057
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,408
You know, you said you're going to build it there, not there.

1058
00:58:13,648 --> 00:58:15,708
Now, in another scenario

1059
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:19,388
and with another mayor and with another city council, it might be like, oh,

1060
00:58:19,388 --> 00:58:20,688
that's an easy change to make.

1061
00:58:21,288 --> 00:58:26,548
Absolutely. But Disney pissed off Anaheim with this Eastern Gateway parking garage.

1062
00:58:26,748 --> 00:58:31,448
And I think there was pressure on the city council and the mayor to be harder.

1063
00:58:31,528 --> 00:58:35,508
And that's what they were elected to do, was to be firmer to Disney.

1064
00:58:35,668 --> 00:58:38,208
So they did not play ball.

1065
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,588
They rejected this this hotel thing.

1066
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:47,168
And then, OK, there's also the this is we're saying this this issue with the four

1067
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:51,528
diamond hotels where any Anaheim wants these things.

1068
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:57,408
So they are offering tax subsidies, which would make it much cheaper to pay

1069
00:58:57,408 --> 00:59:00,788
and make it much cheaper to build these hotels.

1070
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:08,308
But as part of the tax subsidies, you would have to agree to a measure

1071
00:59:08,308 --> 00:59:11,568
which is on the ballot this week.

1072
00:59:11,568 --> 00:59:18,008
And the measure is not just Disney, but all the all the hotels being built

1073
00:59:18,008 --> 00:59:23,188
in the near future have to start at fifteen dollars an hour and go up a dollar every

1074
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:28,508
single year, very reasonable, like reasonable, a reasonable measure.

1075
00:59:28,508 --> 00:59:34,588
And I'll go ahead and spoil this past, past bias, slim margin

1076
00:59:34,588 --> 00:59:40,988
in Anaheim. And, you know, this will apply to any new

1077
00:59:41,188 --> 00:59:47,268
hotels that are the tax incentive, any new hotels taking the Anaheim tax

1078
00:59:47,268 --> 00:59:51,308
incentives will start to go from fifteen, sixteen, seventeen dollars and a good wages

1079
00:59:51,308 --> 00:59:52,688
for employees. This is good.

1080
00:59:52,808 --> 00:59:56,728
Wages have been stagnant across the country for years.

1081
00:59:57,748 --> 01:00:01,328
So and let anyone who's like, wow, fifteen dollar minimum wage

1082
01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:03,928
and in a few years, eighteen dollar minimum wage.

1083
01:00:04,428 --> 01:00:05,748
People living it up in California.

1084
01:00:05,748 --> 01:00:12,708
The price of to live in California is much more expensive than where you may live

1085
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,288
and be hearing this. Absolutely.

1086
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:16,528
So this is good, right?

1087
01:00:16,608 --> 01:00:18,028
Hotels will be paying people more money.

1088
01:00:18,108 --> 01:00:21,788
Disney will be paying people more money. Not so fast.

1089
01:00:22,228 --> 01:00:24,608
Here's what happened in July.

1090
01:00:25,108 --> 01:00:29,708
Disney says we we've heard Bernie Sanders, we've heard what people have been saying.

1091
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:35,608
Fifteen dollars an hour and we'll start moving things up 45 cents a year.

1092
01:00:35,828 --> 01:00:37,228
Different than a dollar.

1093
01:00:37,408 --> 01:00:40,408
Pretty different from a dollar in August.

1094
01:00:41,148 --> 01:00:45,868
Because of all of these problems with the hotel, Disney says, you know what?

1095
01:00:46,088 --> 01:00:48,268
Forget about it. We're not going to do it.

1096
01:00:48,288 --> 01:00:50,288
And we don't need those tax subsidies.

1097
01:00:50,468 --> 01:00:52,188
So don't worry about it.

1098
01:00:52,268 --> 01:00:56,888
Thus, skirting Measure L, which this week has passed,

1099
01:00:57,408 --> 01:01:00,608
Measure L would have required them to pay more than 45 cents an hour.

1100
01:01:00,768 --> 01:01:03,108
Would have been a dollar more per work.

1101
01:01:03,108 --> 01:01:04,708
Right. So they're saying, you know what?

1102
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,388
We did the math. Fuck it.

1103
01:01:06,488 --> 01:01:10,988
We'd rather not get the tax subsidies, but also not have to pay our workers more.

1104
01:01:10,988 --> 01:01:14,208
Yeah. So it's very but it's of course framed in a PR way.

1105
01:01:14,268 --> 01:01:16,708
They're doing something very altruistic because they're saying, you know what?

1106
01:01:16,828 --> 01:01:19,028
Like the press release and everything was like, you know what?

1107
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,868
It's just gotten too tense between us and the government.

1108
01:01:22,108 --> 01:01:23,828
You know what? Never mind.

1109
01:01:23,928 --> 01:01:26,928
Those subsidies, we're not going to take them because we just want a fresh start.

1110
01:01:26,988 --> 01:01:29,448
We want everything to be good between the two of them.

1111
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:32,728
Also, there's one other twist to that.

1112
01:01:32,728 --> 01:01:38,348
When they did agree to the $15 minimum wage for union employees,

1113
01:01:38,668 --> 01:01:45,588
for non-union employees, they gave them something like a $15.65 an hour.

1114
01:01:45,808 --> 01:01:52,028
A common union bustigue like shitty, like flipping off, flipping you the bird.

1115
01:01:52,048 --> 01:01:58,788
Just a shitty little dig at the union, basically, to say like, fuck you for being in a union.

1116
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,048
Yeah. Wow.

1117
01:02:00,048 --> 01:02:01,448
Yeah. Wean, petty shit.

1118
01:02:01,588 --> 01:02:06,328
So let me just let's reset and make this a little personal for a minute.

1119
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:09,128
As you can hear, we're not happy about any of this.

1120
01:02:09,128 --> 01:02:15,028
And in general, you've certainly picked up that we are pretty on the left side of things politically.

1121
01:02:15,628 --> 01:02:18,248
However, however, we love Disneyland.

1122
01:02:18,848 --> 01:02:19,968
We love Disney World.

1123
01:02:19,988 --> 01:02:25,028
You've heard us talk for many, many hours about all of these things.

1124
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,968
It puts us in a pretty odd place.

1125
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,808
I feel so mixed up at this point.

1126
01:02:30,888 --> 01:02:37,388
Well, sure. Well, I mean, the bomb that everyone says nowadays is there's no ethical consumption under capitalism.

1127
01:02:37,388 --> 01:02:39,328
Like, where should we turn our attention to?

1128
01:02:39,348 --> 01:02:44,268
Video games, Red Dead Redemption 2, they were working people a hundred hour,

1129
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:49,208
like a hundred hour weeks to get this dumb ass fucking game done.

1130
01:02:49,268 --> 01:02:50,828
That makes me so mad.

1131
01:02:50,848 --> 01:02:53,308
I just want to chill out and just watch one of my favorite movies.

1132
01:02:53,368 --> 01:02:55,048
Like, I don't know, Sausage Party.

1133
01:02:55,428 --> 01:02:58,428
Yeah, people were treated great and with respect.

1134
01:02:58,468 --> 01:03:01,608
Yeah, no, they pulled a real screw job on the animators.

1135
01:03:01,748 --> 01:03:03,128
What? No.

1136
01:03:03,588 --> 01:03:11,588
We all personally, I'm sure, have many stories of being screwed about various jobs in our industry.

1137
01:03:11,828 --> 01:03:15,068
And we are all in at least one union.

1138
01:03:15,768 --> 01:03:19,468
Yeah, I mean, sometimes multiples and sometimes ones that you have to join.

1139
01:03:19,548 --> 01:03:23,448
But then they severely limit what that union can actually do.

1140
01:03:23,448 --> 01:03:26,188
And they lay the unions weak, but you have to join it anyway.

1141
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:29,688
There's all kinds of odd chicanery.

1142
01:03:30,068 --> 01:03:32,248
Yeah, boy, a lot of stuff's not good, huh?

1143
01:03:32,468 --> 01:03:33,728
Yeah, everything is bad.

1144
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:38,448
So when we're talking about this, it became kind of apparent to us.

1145
01:03:38,688 --> 01:03:42,508
I guess we weren't even really fully understanding it until weeks ago,

1146
01:03:42,628 --> 01:03:48,688
is that in times where the government kisses Disney's ass and does probably bad

1147
01:03:48,688 --> 01:03:55,008
stuff for humans, individual people, that's the time when big stuff is built.

1148
01:03:55,408 --> 01:03:55,948
Yes.

1149
01:03:56,508 --> 01:04:00,628
So very quickly, it was obvious because, like, when we were talking back by that

1150
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:04,928
parking garage, there was a whole other plan, supposedly for whatever Marvel and

1151
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:07,448
was going to be and it was going to come out in the Esplanade.

1152
01:04:07,688 --> 01:04:11,748
And like there was a whole California adventure was going to change because of

1153
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:14,888
the nature of the bridge and because they weren't going to have to put security

1154
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:17,128
where it currently is in that south side of it.

1155
01:04:17,128 --> 01:04:19,168
They could claim a little of the Esplanade

1156
01:04:19,168 --> 01:04:20,948
property because no one was going to be walking.

1157
01:04:20,948 --> 01:04:22,148
Oh, I don't know that, actually.

1158
01:04:22,268 --> 01:04:24,228
I mean, this this was never like officially announced.

1159
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:28,048
But the word was we're pulling we're moving like the boundaries of Disney's

1160
01:04:28,048 --> 01:04:29,708
California venture out. This is all rumor.

1161
01:04:29,728 --> 01:04:32,388
But I think it makes a lot of sense because when you see her,

1162
01:04:32,388 --> 01:04:36,588
because now they have this base, Marvel essentially most likely is happening.

1163
01:04:36,768 --> 01:04:39,528
I mean, we know a lot of it is replacing

1164
01:04:39,528 --> 01:04:44,108
the land, but there was also talk of it

1165
01:04:44,168 --> 01:04:49,268
replacing kind of this desolate Hollywood studio area that's always been sort of a

1166
01:04:49,268 --> 01:04:53,808
problem. So for them to build on top of that and then expand outwards beyond it

1167
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:54,788
would have been huge. Right.

1168
01:04:54,828 --> 01:04:57,108
Because basically what would have happened is there wouldn't have been any

1169
01:04:57,108 --> 01:04:58,628
security there at that south point.

1170
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,548
And it would have just been a it would be a more narrow walkway because everyone's

1171
01:05:01,548 --> 01:05:05,588
now been through security and all it is is just people walking into the part of

1172
01:05:05,588 --> 01:05:09,448
the Esplanade. So like you could have moved Hollywood land out there, made a big

1173
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:10,888
new ride, done a whole.

1174
01:05:10,888 --> 01:05:14,788
So like there were all these plans that then got changed because that gateway

1175
01:05:14,788 --> 01:05:18,028
project got got shuttered or whatever.

1176
01:05:19,128 --> 01:05:22,188
So it affected not just all this kind of infrastructural stuff.

1177
01:05:22,188 --> 01:05:26,108
It's a little dry. It changed the makeup of of Marvel.

1178
01:05:26,448 --> 01:05:29,428
Probably Marvel. Yeah. The chances are it was probably Marvel and it was going to

1179
01:05:29,428 --> 01:05:31,328
go over there. Now it's in Bugsland or whatever.

1180
01:05:31,568 --> 01:05:35,108
And it should be said Disney doesn't need these taxid.

1181
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:39,988
Disney is kind of up there with like Amazon and Apple of like more money than

1182
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:42,468
God, like can do whatever they want.

1183
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:47,028
Yeah. Once the Fox merger goes through with the start of 2019,

1184
01:05:47,668 --> 01:05:50,648
they will be a massive media company, even bigger.

1185
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:51,948
They're already massive.

1186
01:05:52,768 --> 01:05:59,008
And the greater spectrum of media right now is the Netflix dropped a bomb on

1187
01:05:59,008 --> 01:06:03,468
everything and everywhere is struggling and until unless places can figure out

1188
01:06:03,468 --> 01:06:04,768
their streaming situation.

1189
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:08,908
And Disney is almost is one of the companies that probably the only company

1190
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:12,168
guaranteed that when they start their streaming service, I mean,

1191
01:06:12,188 --> 01:06:15,788
unless something goes horribly awry like that, they're the Disney's.

1192
01:06:15,788 --> 01:06:19,128
Once they pull all their movies and shows from all the other from Netflix, Hulu,

1193
01:06:19,368 --> 01:06:20,028
Amazon. Yeah.

1194
01:06:20,228 --> 01:06:23,708
They're a force to be reckoned with immediately out of the gate. So they're,

1195
01:06:23,768 --> 01:06:26,448
they're new media. Future is fantastic.

1196
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:31,048
Of course, the biggest victim of that Netflix bomb,

1197
01:06:31,308 --> 01:06:36,208
the idea of curation and taste because Netflix is now

1198
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:39,008
everything. Uh huh. Uh huh.

1199
01:06:39,088 --> 01:06:43,628
But every, are you saying that not every Netflix show is a masterpiece out of the

1200
01:06:43,628 --> 01:06:47,668
gate? Uh, uh, that, that, uh, yeah, whatever the,

1201
01:06:47,868 --> 01:06:52,728
I can't even remember half of these shows. Like this four new series every,

1202
01:06:53,108 --> 01:06:57,068
yeah, it's, it's, yeah. You, if you liked Apocalypse now,

1203
01:06:57,068 --> 01:06:59,428
maybe you'll like the Miranda Sings show.

1204
01:06:59,428 --> 01:07:04,988
So a friend texted me, a friend from high school texted me just yesterday saying,

1205
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:10,108
like, it's very funny that Netflix is putting out, uh, uh, the, the,

1206
01:07:10,168 --> 01:07:13,548
they, they paid for the finishing funds for the other side of the wind.

1207
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:16,928
Orson Welles's last unfinished film. Um,

1208
01:07:17,328 --> 01:07:20,628
and it is available, uh, to watch now. And he's like,

1209
01:07:20,728 --> 01:07:25,088
it's funny because they have like no movies before 1980.

1210
01:07:25,088 --> 01:07:31,348
So like the main sort of story point of the movie of aging studio director trying

1211
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:36,108
to make an imprint in, you know, artists driven seventies Hollywood,

1212
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,608
uh, there's no context there. There's no,

1213
01:07:40,008 --> 01:07:42,888
you can't watch the movies to contextualize this.

1214
01:07:43,308 --> 01:07:47,448
They did somehow make two documentaries about finishing the other side of the

1215
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:51,408
wind. So I guess that kind of contextualizes it. But, uh,

1216
01:07:51,528 --> 01:07:51,688
so many

1217
01:07:51,688 --> 01:07:56,188
Sean O'Toole Yeah, Netflix will increasingly become Netflix properties from 2015

1218
01:07:56,188 --> 01:08:00,028
and beyond, which is why they're making so much so that they can say,

1219
01:08:00,028 --> 01:08:04,948
we have a gazillion hours of shows because they're about to lose not just

1220
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:08,508
Disney, but probably a ton of other media companies, uh,

1221
01:08:08,808 --> 01:08:13,028
cause they've all helped Netflix get rich. This is, it's madness right now.

1222
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:18,328
Everything's madness on our, on our level, on the, on gigantic media level,

1223
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:20,708
it's, uh, everything's on the theme park level.

1224
01:08:20,728 --> 01:08:22,068
Everything is bad. Like I said earlier,

1225
01:08:22,088 --> 01:08:26,688
Sean O'Toole So make sure to, uh, support your, uh, local, local, independent,

1226
01:08:26,688 --> 01:08:31,108
self owned media, uh, patreon.com slash podcast, the ride podcast,

1227
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:32,448
the ride on TV public.

1228
01:08:32,848 --> 01:08:35,988
Sean O'Toole Don't just, don't just go watch star wars movies.

1229
01:08:35,988 --> 01:08:41,268
Listen to us analyze characters in the background of star wars movies and

1230
01:08:41,268 --> 01:08:42,968
support us doing so.

1231
01:08:42,968 --> 01:08:48,548
Sean O'Toole There will be a whole DJ rex episode for sure on Patreon next year.

1232
01:08:48,548 --> 01:08:51,568
Sean O'Toole And you know what, since this has become, we'll get back on track,

1233
01:08:51,748 --> 01:08:56,328
but since this has become essentially a what's going on, not just in a bad ways,

1234
01:08:56,328 --> 01:09:00,108
but good ways, uh, in the current state of the Disneyland resort.

1235
01:09:00,488 --> 01:09:06,768
Did you guys catch the Jim Hill scoop that apparently Disney is not confirmed?

1236
01:09:06,808 --> 01:09:07,648
It's not done.

1237
01:09:07,968 --> 01:09:13,288
Apparently Disney has asked Paul Rubens to reprise his role as the voice of

1238
01:09:13,288 --> 01:09:17,108
Rex. I did not see that. I mean, that makes a lot of sense, of course.

1239
01:09:17,108 --> 01:09:18,828
So that's very good news.

1240
01:09:19,248 --> 01:09:22,668
Sean O'Toole If I love DJ Rex being there, but if it's not Paul Rubens,

1241
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:25,728
I don't want him to talk. I just want him to be a prop. But if,

1242
01:09:25,788 --> 01:09:30,608
if they get him and there's new Rex dialogue, I will be so,

1243
01:09:30,888 --> 01:09:31,208
so excited.

1244
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:34,288
Sean O'Toole If Disney came to you, Scott, and said,

1245
01:09:34,568 --> 01:09:35,948
would you do the voice of Rex?

1246
01:09:36,768 --> 01:09:40,808
Sean O'Toole Absolutely not. No, I would not commit the sacrilege myself.

1247
01:09:40,808 --> 01:09:42,868
Sean O'Toole Would you do a dialogue for the animatronic to say?

1248
01:09:42,868 --> 01:09:45,908
Sean O'Toole I would. And if they need anyone to do so.

1249
01:09:45,908 --> 01:09:48,328
Sean O'Toole After we just trashed them properly.

1250
01:09:48,648 --> 01:09:51,428
Sean O'Toole We'll continue to do so. No, we're, look, we're,

1251
01:09:51,428 --> 01:09:52,828
Sean O'Toole We're not trashing the creative people.

1252
01:09:52,848 --> 01:09:55,708
Sean O'Toole We're screwing ourselves over in terms of the Disney relationship.

1253
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:58,968
Sean O'Toole I don't know. Thank you. There's so much media,

1254
01:09:59,148 --> 01:10:00,548
they'll probably never hear it.

1255
01:10:00,768 --> 01:10:01,708
Sean O'Toole Absolutely not.

1256
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:02,908
Sean O'Toole The show isn't that popular.

1257
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,688
Sean O'Toole No, it's not. Hey, the Disney executives,

1258
01:10:05,888 --> 01:10:09,688
they got to finish watching Meniac and the Haunting of Hill House just like

1259
01:10:09,688 --> 01:10:10,708
everyone else, you know?

1260
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:15,648
Sean O'Toole And as soon as, as soon as Scott gets the deal to write

1261
01:10:15,648 --> 01:10:20,668
the Guardians of the Galaxy spin-off TV show on Disney Play that

1262
01:10:20,668 --> 01:10:25,508
features Cosmo the dog, then we'll take this episode right down.

1263
01:10:25,508 --> 01:10:30,088
Sean O'Toole Oh, yeah, I will be asking anyone to pull as much as possible.

1264
01:10:30,288 --> 01:10:35,688
Sean O'Toole Although again, to contextualize it, it's not just Disney doing all this,

1265
01:10:35,688 --> 01:10:41,508
this stuff we're slagging. It's everyone, every company in every field.

1266
01:10:41,728 --> 01:10:45,948
There is a reminder there's no benevolent companies besides charities.

1267
01:10:45,988 --> 01:10:48,148
Sean O'Toole So back to us being conflicted.

1268
01:10:48,928 --> 01:10:53,948
Basically the sum up was what we realized is that, okay, if a crazy

1269
01:10:53,948 --> 01:10:58,868
kiss ass government, there's a good chance we could get bigger, better rides

1270
01:10:58,868 --> 01:11:01,008
because now Disney feels much more comfortable.

1271
01:11:01,288 --> 01:11:05,028
They're getting more money in taxes back or maybe they'll just get like,

1272
01:11:05,188 --> 01:11:07,408
Anaheim will pay for a new Spider-Man ride.

1273
01:11:07,588 --> 01:11:12,848
Like who knows what crazy thing they can trick or make lobby their way into

1274
01:11:12,848 --> 01:11:17,148
getting from the government. So what's, what's, yeah, what's on the table?

1275
01:11:17,188 --> 01:11:19,088
Okay. Yeah. The hotel potentially,

1276
01:11:19,888 --> 01:11:23,508
Sean O'Toole All of these canceled plans could be back on the table.

1277
01:11:23,508 --> 01:11:27,648
We have not seen this many things canceled since that beloved Disney

1278
01:11:27,648 --> 01:11:34,448
anniversary special hosted by the late great Harry Anderson featuring coming

1279
01:11:34,448 --> 01:11:37,848
soon rides, the majority of which never came to fruition.

1280
01:11:38,248 --> 01:11:42,328
Sean O'Toole Yeah, we could be looking at something closer to a new Disney decade

1281
01:11:42,328 --> 01:11:43,628
where it's on happens.

1282
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:45,828
Sean O'Toole It's possible. I mean, obviously in the short term,

1283
01:11:45,828 --> 01:11:49,988
I would imagine that parking garages and hotels are of the highest priority

1284
01:11:49,988 --> 01:11:52,588
because they need more rooms because this, if you have,

1285
01:11:52,688 --> 01:11:55,508
if you guys haven't noticed lately, the park is insane.

1286
01:11:55,668 --> 01:12:00,248
The parking garage fills up like Mickey and friends fills up in the middle of

1287
01:12:00,248 --> 01:12:03,488
the afternoon. Most days I get alerts on Twitter every day.

1288
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:07,968
Mickey and friends is full. It's like, we need more parking, more rooms.

1289
01:12:08,268 --> 01:12:13,308
It severely impacts. Like, did you have a good time there today or not?

1290
01:12:13,408 --> 01:12:16,208
It makes it. Yeah. It makes you more tired.

1291
01:12:16,348 --> 01:12:17,588
I can still have a good time.

1292
01:12:17,608 --> 01:12:20,488
Sean O'Toole We tried to get out of the park.

1293
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:24,148
When we tried to get out of California Adventure, the crowd,

1294
01:12:24,568 --> 01:12:28,508
the one time we were there and, um, uh,

1295
01:12:28,908 --> 01:12:32,268
the, the paint the night parade was happening. It was,

1296
01:12:32,268 --> 01:12:36,228
the infrastructure had fallen apart. Like the parade was passing,

1297
01:12:36,408 --> 01:12:40,748
but the parade goes around the main entrance sort of pathways.

1298
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:42,288
So you could not cross,

1299
01:12:42,308 --> 01:12:46,368
you could not exit the park without taking an insane rat.

1300
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:49,428
And so it's just mobs of people. They don't have enough people working,

1301
01:12:49,688 --> 01:12:53,088
directing. It's crazy. It's crazy. And it's like, I am,

1302
01:12:53,088 --> 01:12:55,428
I mean, I'm just saying it cause I want another theme park, but it is,

1303
01:12:55,568 --> 01:12:58,788
once you, once you've been there and you've gone for so many years and it's been

1304
01:12:58,788 --> 01:13:03,608
like pretty bad for years now. It's like, make the third park. I mean,

1305
01:13:03,768 --> 01:13:07,988
do something, make it half the size of these parts, like something right now,

1306
01:13:07,988 --> 01:13:12,968
cause this is crazy. Like obviously so many people are going to this,

1307
01:13:13,688 --> 01:13:15,628
like, like they're just trying to maximize.

1308
01:13:16,108 --> 01:13:19,368
The person had never been better the way they've juiced up California Adventure.

1309
01:13:19,408 --> 01:13:24,308
You have two crazy high quality parks back to back only to be

1310
01:13:24,308 --> 01:13:26,428
improved by galaxy's edge.

1311
01:13:26,588 --> 01:13:29,528
Yeah. And other parks don't have, as we said,

1312
01:13:29,628 --> 01:13:33,648
Disney world is sort of its own self contained entity. Uh,

1313
01:13:33,648 --> 01:13:36,608
they've got plenty of room to spread people out. Uh,

1314
01:13:36,608 --> 01:13:40,988
Universal Orlando kind of butts up against a lot of houses and

1315
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:41,528
neighborhoods.

1316
01:13:41,688 --> 01:13:45,488
They still have a lot of area to work with and they're expanding, uh,

1317
01:13:45,528 --> 01:13:49,528
down the road. They bought up a bunch of land and stuff to expand to.

1318
01:13:49,648 --> 01:13:50,728
They keep adding hotels.

1319
01:13:51,168 --> 01:13:56,408
Universal Hollywood is kind of in an odd spot because it's right in the,

1320
01:13:56,408 --> 01:13:56,708
you know,

1321
01:13:57,088 --> 01:14:01,388
right around a lot of houses and businesses and stuff on multiple elevations,

1322
01:14:02,388 --> 01:14:03,148
multiple elevations,

1323
01:14:03,428 --> 01:14:08,128
but it is a self contained movie studio and stuff that both universals on both

1324
01:14:08,128 --> 01:14:11,948
coasts, the issue they deal with is noise. They have their certain point.

1325
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:16,148
You'll notice universal Orlando not open super late most of the time.

1326
01:14:16,188 --> 01:14:17,088
As opposed to Disney,

1327
01:14:17,228 --> 01:14:21,708
which just blares phantasmic and neighbors have to deal with it every night at

1328
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:24,148
10 o'clock. Yeah. If you're Lee, I was, we were,

1329
01:14:24,228 --> 01:14:27,268
I was in the parking garage like hearing fantastic,

1330
01:14:27,408 --> 01:14:31,368
like that the far end of the parking garage and you could hear phantasmic

1331
01:14:31,388 --> 01:14:36,068
as if you were watching it. You said if you were right in it. Um,

1332
01:14:36,088 --> 01:14:39,348
so, uh, yeah, a lot's at stake.

1333
01:14:39,368 --> 01:14:42,048
We beyond the infrastructural stuff. Um,

1334
01:14:42,048 --> 01:14:46,028
so this was a very important election. So let's,

1335
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:50,688
let's say the, uh, the specific races and what was at stake.

1336
01:14:51,128 --> 01:14:52,048
Mayor Tom Tate,

1337
01:14:52,048 --> 01:14:55,868
who has been tough on Disney and who has led a Disney,

1338
01:14:56,168 --> 01:15:00,688
an anti Disney dominated city council, Tom Tate,

1339
01:15:01,048 --> 01:15:04,108
uh, no longer the mayor. He has finished out, termed out,

1340
01:15:04,248 --> 01:15:06,088
finished his last out, reached term limits.

1341
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,668
So it's not like he was kicked out because he was, he was bad or anything.

1342
01:15:09,668 --> 01:15:13,728
And when we say tough on Disney, it's still very,

1343
01:15:13,988 --> 01:15:17,108
very PR, very discourse heavy.

1344
01:15:17,488 --> 01:15:21,828
Oh yeah. It's just basic necessity. Very, very, very tame.

1345
01:15:21,888 --> 01:15:23,308
Like no one's cursing.

1346
01:15:23,528 --> 01:15:28,568
No one's like that salty Beto O'Rourke saying everyone did a great fucking job

1347
01:15:28,888 --> 01:15:30,528
How dare you. I'm kidding.

1348
01:15:31,228 --> 01:15:36,128
The most human moment in politics all year. It's Beto O'Rourke cursing on stage.

1349
01:15:36,768 --> 01:15:41,048
Yeah. Uh, yeah, he tried hard. He did good. But the, um,

1350
01:15:41,048 --> 01:15:44,968
yeah, it's still, it's still civil. And even like the, the people who are,

1351
01:15:45,028 --> 01:15:46,568
when I say quote unquote anti Disney,

1352
01:15:46,828 --> 01:15:50,868
they're all still on record saying Disney is so important to this community and

1353
01:15:50,868 --> 01:15:55,328
we want this relationship to work well. Nobody's like kick them out. Um,

1354
01:15:55,328 --> 01:15:58,868
there's no, you know, so, so anti Disney is barely anything.

1355
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,068
But when you're dealing on Disney's level,

1356
01:16:02,268 --> 01:16:05,628
anything utter than do whatever the fuck you want is, is a problem.

1357
01:16:05,768 --> 01:16:10,248
And that is why Disney has spent more in this election, uh,

1358
01:16:10,248 --> 01:16:11,428
than ever before.

1359
01:16:11,668 --> 01:16:15,708
$1.5 million in spending via a pack.

1360
01:16:16,028 --> 01:16:20,168
Sorry. I'll get it to, I just saw today. The number is closer to 1.6.

1361
01:16:20,388 --> 01:16:21,048
Oh, all right.

1362
01:16:22,408 --> 01:16:26,728
Most expensive unions also spending 1.5 million, but regardless,

1363
01:16:27,148 --> 01:16:29,208
the most expensive election in Anaheim.

1364
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:31,588
Which would indicate, like we were saying,

1365
01:16:31,928 --> 01:16:36,368
like the plans they have are big probably for different things,

1366
01:16:36,428 --> 01:16:39,268
which indicates that they're willing to spend this much money.

1367
01:16:39,448 --> 01:16:41,608
This is just as if we know about like there,

1368
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:45,748
there could be stuff that isn't even on the table. It's not announced. And, uh,

1369
01:16:45,748 --> 01:16:46,808
so they have,

1370
01:16:46,808 --> 01:16:50,988
they've pumped a lot of money to certain candidates via an organization called

1371
01:16:50,988 --> 01:16:56,008
SOAR, which is, which stands for support our Anaheim

1372
01:16:56,008 --> 01:17:00,708
resort. Now SOAR isn't only Disney. It's also, uh,

1373
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:05,168
you know, the it's garden walk. It's anybody building fancy hotels. Uh,

1374
01:17:05,168 --> 01:17:09,168
and right now Mickey has just risen atop a giant cake and

1375
01:17:09,168 --> 01:17:11,368
I like playing in the background.

1376
01:17:11,508 --> 01:17:14,208
The background of all this has included the Disney special.

1377
01:17:14,248 --> 01:17:18,008
Donald is in a sparkly sailor suit. I like this too. I would like to see this.

1378
01:17:18,068 --> 01:17:20,748
This is, yeah, this is good.

1379
01:17:20,748 --> 01:17:22,268
I like having a visual in the back.

1380
01:17:22,408 --> 01:17:26,208
This reminds me of like taking meetings at like fancy companies and they have

1381
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:31,168
TV silently playing stuff in the law. It's, it's, it, it makes me feel important.

1382
01:17:31,388 --> 01:17:34,008
Keeping things alive and it's good to see future guests.

1383
01:17:34,188 --> 01:17:38,568
John Stamos having a good time. Guaranteed future guests.

1384
01:17:38,788 --> 01:17:43,208
John Stamos, uh, we'll make it happen. That's the white whale. Um,

1385
01:17:44,088 --> 01:17:47,388
so, uh, Disney, it's tons of money spent by Disney for,

1386
01:17:47,768 --> 01:17:52,168
so in via SOAR, uh, tons of money spent by unions, uh,

1387
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,428
the most combative Anaheim relationship ever.

1388
01:17:54,468 --> 01:17:57,468
So not only is the mayorship up for grabs,

1389
01:17:57,508 --> 01:18:02,748
but also three seats in the Anaheim city council enough to

1390
01:18:02,748 --> 01:18:06,508
flip things, uh, pro or anti Disney.

1391
01:18:06,628 --> 01:18:09,648
Yes. It's, it is a seven seat. Okay.

1392
01:18:10,028 --> 01:18:13,288
Local elections are confusing. Uh,

1393
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:17,528
it is a seven seat city council, including the mayor is one of those seats.

1394
01:18:17,528 --> 01:18:21,388
It's called a council manager government. That's the style of government.

1395
01:18:21,408 --> 01:18:23,228
That is the style of government. Uh,

1396
01:18:23,228 --> 01:18:27,008
all of these seats used to be elected at large, meaning like everyone's voting,

1397
01:18:27,528 --> 01:18:32,628
uh, uh, for every candidate as of 2016 due to an

1398
01:18:32,628 --> 01:18:36,348
ACLU lawsuit, the, the seats,

1399
01:18:36,348 --> 01:18:40,828
the council seats are allocated more like,

1400
01:18:41,108 --> 01:18:42,928
oh, this person represents these districts.

1401
01:18:42,988 --> 01:18:47,468
This person represents these districts. Makes more sense to me.

1402
01:18:47,668 --> 01:18:52,268
Also it makes more sense because it is more representative of Anaheim at large.

1403
01:18:52,408 --> 01:18:56,868
The older system apparently, uh, did not accurately represent the,

1404
01:18:56,868 --> 01:19:01,528
the people who did not benefit from that system was unfairly,

1405
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:04,548
a large Latino population of Anaheim.

1406
01:19:04,968 --> 01:19:06,148
Once again, these,

1407
01:19:06,248 --> 01:19:10,488
all of these breakdowns occurring while a TV is on mute in the background where

1408
01:19:10,488 --> 01:19:12,368
Pluto is dancing up a storm.

1409
01:19:12,648 --> 01:19:16,088
This is the perfect synthesis of this podcast.

1410
01:19:17,928 --> 01:19:22,568
Left politics meet Pluto dancing, dancing in a sparkly collar.

1411
01:19:22,568 --> 01:19:23,888
This is how our brains are broken.

1412
01:19:24,128 --> 01:19:26,188
Jason is talking about precincts and I looked in,

1413
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:30,048
Scott is just looking like lovingly at the TV as Pluto is dancing.

1414
01:19:31,468 --> 01:19:34,348
I was trying to do both. I was like, Oh yeah, Jason sings very important.

1415
01:19:35,248 --> 01:19:38,528
There was a writer credits and there was a writer credit for Joe Saunders.

1416
01:19:38,688 --> 01:19:42,228
Is that the Joe Saunders that we know? Comedy bang, bang writer.

1417
01:19:42,248 --> 01:19:43,148
Do you want to text him?

1418
01:19:43,808 --> 01:19:47,048
Um, I am going to text him. You know what? I was going to,

1419
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:47,908
I almost just went to.

1420
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:50,528
Host of Doe Boys spin off the breadcast.

1421
01:19:50,908 --> 01:19:55,608
Uh, Joe Saunders. So a lot distracting me, but let's,

1422
01:19:55,608 --> 01:19:57,708
yes, let's get back to disenfranchisement.

1423
01:19:58,788 --> 01:20:01,928
Uh, I, uh, okay.

1424
01:20:02,188 --> 01:20:06,068
So what were you driving at Jason though, in terms of this?

1425
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:08,668
Oh, so, so it's a, it's a, it's a,

1426
01:20:08,668 --> 01:20:13,648
it's a very specific kind of system and one that has just changed in

1427
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:16,548
recent years. Now I think the change is good. Um,

1428
01:20:16,548 --> 01:20:19,708
the other thing that I learned about this and, uh,

1429
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:23,168
this is apparently another thing, very common and more local elections,

1430
01:20:23,168 --> 01:20:27,008
because they tend to be more managerial positions.

1431
01:20:27,008 --> 01:20:32,108
There is less of an emphasis on quote unquote party

1432
01:20:32,108 --> 01:20:36,668
politics, partisan politics. A lot of this is again, quote unquote,

1433
01:20:36,988 --> 01:20:42,408
nonpartisan politics where the candidates do not have an RDI

1434
01:20:42,408 --> 01:20:46,188
next to their names. That said,

1435
01:20:46,588 --> 01:20:49,988
if you are a registered Democrat or Republican, you are,

1436
01:20:49,988 --> 01:20:51,708
it's very easy to look that up.

1437
01:20:51,728 --> 01:20:56,088
So you can kind of get a gauge of where these people may fall on the political

1438
01:20:56,088 --> 01:21:00,688
spectrum, which is more reliable than looking up the candidate websites,

1439
01:21:00,948 --> 01:21:05,748
all of which are the same cookie cutter templates and largely PR speak

1440
01:21:05,748 --> 01:21:09,588
and kind of confusing. Okay. Okay. Sure. Uh, yeah. I mean, there's a,

1441
01:21:09,648 --> 01:21:14,648
it's just basically not putting that in your face because like I've noticed that

1442
01:21:14,648 --> 01:21:18,948
down, there's a race in orange County that still hasn't been decided. Uh,

1443
01:21:18,948 --> 01:21:21,908
and on all the flyers for both candidates,

1444
01:21:22,028 --> 01:21:24,988
they never mention Republican or Democrat,

1445
01:21:25,308 --> 01:21:29,428
even though they're clearly they have a party, but like just in the advertising,

1446
01:21:29,908 --> 01:21:33,848
either way, they're not trying to associate with parties. So like,

1447
01:21:33,848 --> 01:21:36,368
this is like an even more extreme version of it,

1448
01:21:36,368 --> 01:21:39,828
but like do a little digging and you can make a pretty good guess.

1449
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:43,668
Pretty good guess, especially some of them have ran for state assembly,

1450
01:21:43,968 --> 01:21:47,368
where you do know the political affiliation. Right. Well,

1451
01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:49,128
so what I'm thinking is we go,

1452
01:21:49,128 --> 01:21:54,948
how about we reveal this in backwards or let's because we have the results in

1453
01:21:54,948 --> 01:21:59,668
front of us. We know who was backed by sore slash Disney. Uh,

1454
01:21:59,688 --> 01:22:03,188
so you want to start with district six. That's what I'm thinking. Let's,

1455
01:22:03,408 --> 01:22:07,748
let's see. I let we're soaring over district six. Uh, okay.

1456
01:22:07,968 --> 01:22:11,908
So, uh, the, uh, uh, all right.

1457
01:22:11,988 --> 01:22:15,868
And I would say to council district six, uh, the, uh,

1458
01:22:15,868 --> 01:22:20,608
the Disney, uh, endorsed candidate, Trevor O'Neill, anti Disney,

1459
01:22:20,888 --> 01:22:25,668
Grant Henninger and Patty Gabby. And again, anti, I don't know. I,

1460
01:22:25,748 --> 01:22:28,728
I, some of these, I have numbers and some of them I don't in terms of who.

1461
01:22:28,728 --> 01:22:33,588
Jose Moreno's district though. No, no, no. Okay. Excuse me. Um, okay.

1462
01:22:33,728 --> 01:22:37,248
So, uh, but they, I'm also going, I think in backwards order of what they,

1463
01:22:37,348 --> 01:22:41,668
how much they spent on, on candidates. Uh, but okay.

1464
01:22:41,908 --> 01:22:42,368
So again,

1465
01:22:42,488 --> 01:22:45,568
most of this coming through political action committees because there's a

1466
01:22:45,568 --> 01:22:50,048
certain amount individuals or companies can give, I think it's like $2,000,

1467
01:22:50,228 --> 01:22:53,668
2,500. There's a certain limit on what individuals can give.

1468
01:22:53,748 --> 01:22:56,828
$2,000 is the limit. Yes. And, and,

1469
01:22:56,848 --> 01:22:59,768
but the way around that you give to a political action committee who gives to

1470
01:22:59,768 --> 01:23:00,888
your candidate of your choice.

1471
01:23:00,988 --> 01:23:04,148
It's just a bunch of fucking shit that everyone's allowed to get away with this.

1472
01:23:04,308 --> 01:23:06,968
So much cheating. It was all cute. It was very, Oh,

1473
01:23:07,008 --> 01:23:11,128
it wasn't a funny back in like 2006 when Colbert made his own political action

1474
01:23:11,128 --> 01:23:15,448
committee and we all laughed and had a good time. And now it's all, uh, hell.

1475
01:23:15,568 --> 01:23:18,708
Since the Supreme court, uh, ruling in 2010,

1476
01:23:19,128 --> 01:23:24,088
that kind of changed and made corporations people, uh,

1477
01:23:24,088 --> 01:23:27,708
saying limits on how much money they could give essentially limits,

1478
01:23:27,928 --> 01:23:31,848
free speech rights. So like anything, it's all gotten a lot worse.

1479
01:23:31,868 --> 01:23:35,208
All right. Anyway, but at least this one, depending on how it goes,

1480
01:23:35,388 --> 01:23:40,228
could lead to more rights. Uh, unlike other dark evil in the,

1481
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,228
okay, so here we go. Disney's endorsed candidate, Trevor O'Neill.

1482
01:23:43,228 --> 01:23:49,688
And in the election in district six, the winner was Trevor O'Neill.

1483
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:55,408
Disney takes a seat. Uh, all right. Moving on to district three.

1484
01:23:55,788 --> 01:23:56,808
Uh, now they,

1485
01:23:56,828 --> 01:24:01,548
Disney fought hard in the last election and fought hard against a candidate

1486
01:24:01,548 --> 01:24:05,348
named Jose Moreno who you mentioned, uh, who is,

1487
01:24:05,348 --> 01:24:07,268
who has served since then. Uh,

1488
01:24:07,268 --> 01:24:10,808
and they put up a guy named Jordan Brandman who lost to Jose Moreno.

1489
01:24:10,808 --> 01:24:15,568
I watched a little video of Jose Moreno seems like good, reasonable guy. Yeah.

1490
01:24:15,608 --> 01:24:19,728
It seems, it seems like good, like good with the neighborhood. Um, and uh, you know,

1491
01:24:19,828 --> 01:24:22,088
again, not like it's not this harsh anti Disney rhetoric.

1492
01:24:22,088 --> 01:24:25,408
He just wants the neighborhood to get a chair. Excuse me. Oh yeah. Disney. Um,

1493
01:24:25,448 --> 01:24:29,008
could we just a little tax, um, to fix some of the roads? Uh, no.

1494
01:24:29,168 --> 01:24:32,228
Fuck you. Fuck yourself.

1495
01:24:32,388 --> 01:24:35,508
Here is one of the hard, hard, firm,

1496
01:24:35,768 --> 01:24:40,168
ball busting lines of Jose Moreno. If Disney has its way in this election,

1497
01:24:40,168 --> 01:24:43,908
it's another worthwhile investment, a million dollars in an election.

1498
01:24:43,968 --> 01:24:48,388
So you can get a $300 million subsidy. Moreno said at a council meeting

1499
01:24:48,388 --> 01:24:51,128
recently. Fuck you.

1500
01:24:51,188 --> 01:24:55,408
Fuck you. Look, coming in hot. Communist son of a bitch.

1501
01:24:56,408 --> 01:24:58,928
So they put up a candidate, Mitch Caldwell.

1502
01:24:59,148 --> 01:25:03,288
Disney's candidate is Mitch Caldwell and the winner in Anaheim city council

1503
01:25:03,288 --> 01:25:07,008
district three is Jose Moreno.

1504
01:25:08,008 --> 01:25:13,948
Does not take the seat. Uh, this seems good. Moreno seems good. Um,

1505
01:25:14,028 --> 01:25:17,548
so hopefully he is a voice for, uh, for the city of Anaheim.

1506
01:25:18,248 --> 01:25:22,008
Nevermind. I won't say that until we're done with this. Okay, sure. Um,

1507
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:26,228
so let's go back. Let's go to Anaheim city council district two,

1508
01:25:26,228 --> 01:25:29,648
uh, Disney's candidate, Jordan Brandman,

1509
01:25:29,788 --> 01:25:33,548
who had lost to Jose Moreno in the prior election.

1510
01:25:33,548 --> 01:25:36,828
I don't know who was the main anti Disney.

1511
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:40,048
Vanderbilts I think is the name. Uh,

1512
01:25:40,488 --> 01:25:45,428
Disney spent almost $300,000 to support Brandman who

1513
01:25:45,428 --> 01:25:49,568
supported subsidies for Disney and luxury hotel developments while a city councilman.

1514
01:25:50,408 --> 01:25:54,688
Uh, so Brandman is Disney's guy and in district two, the winner is

1515
01:25:54,688 --> 01:25:57,968
Jordan Brandman. Disney takes the seat.

1516
01:25:57,988 --> 01:26:02,668
Two seats. Two so far of the three up for grabs.

1517
01:26:02,668 --> 01:26:07,028
And that brings us to the mayor. Uh,

1518
01:26:07,368 --> 01:26:11,988
the main does eight candidates for mayor. Uh, probably,

1519
01:26:11,988 --> 01:26:16,708
you know, four or five were seemingly worthy of serious consideration.

1520
01:26:17,008 --> 01:26:20,988
Main anti Disney candidate, Ashley Aitken, uh, again,

1521
01:26:21,288 --> 01:26:25,548
very just like should do their share and labor background, your hotel,

1522
01:26:26,288 --> 01:26:30,888
uh, service industry background. Oh, okay. Sure. The way I understand it. Okay.

1523
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:34,968
Uh, um, and by the way, also some of these, you know, did,

1524
01:26:34,968 --> 01:26:40,808
did Disney do these things directly? No. Did they funnel money into campaigns

1525
01:26:40,808 --> 01:26:45,108
that ultimately led to flyers that were like Aitken wants the homeless over

1526
01:26:45,108 --> 01:26:50,128
running the streets? And, uh, yes, Disney did lead to like scary flyers.

1527
01:26:50,148 --> 01:26:55,068
Yeah, probably not dissimilar to Trump's like recent border fear tactics.

1528
01:26:55,068 --> 01:27:00,068
So I'm the legal lead up to another candidate in this election was using the

1529
01:27:00,068 --> 01:27:05,528
angels logo in material. Uh, you are not supposed to do that.

1530
01:27:05,748 --> 01:27:08,428
Oh, oh really? So that, oh, that's a, that's a cheat.

1531
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:13,648
Well, I think, I don't think the angels encouraged it saying, you know,

1532
01:27:14,408 --> 01:27:20,508
the companies don't typically want their official like logos and implied backing

1533
01:27:20,508 --> 01:27:24,508
of like, I want to keep this company. I want to keep the angels here.

1534
01:27:24,548 --> 01:27:27,928
Like the angels were not funding that or something.

1535
01:27:27,928 --> 01:27:30,648
So a little bit of shade in relationship. Yeah. Applied related.

1536
01:27:30,648 --> 01:27:33,788
I see. Well, yes. So the,

1537
01:27:33,788 --> 01:27:40,088
the main guy who is soft on Disney who Disney supported a hairy Sid you is,

1538
01:27:40,108 --> 01:27:43,028
do we think that's the pronunciation? S I D H U.

1539
01:27:44,088 --> 01:27:48,148
Yeah. Yeah. I would guess. So, yeah. Yeah. Um, so,

1540
01:27:48,228 --> 01:27:52,728
and is he's been saying we're going to keep, uh, uh,

1541
01:27:52,728 --> 01:27:57,148
we're going to try to get angels to very, I mean, the easiest Google,

1542
01:27:57,788 --> 01:28:01,548
uh, is, is what political parties Harry said to you in a,

1543
01:28:01,548 --> 01:28:05,868
he's a Republican and he ran as a Republican for other positions and has a

1544
01:28:05,868 --> 01:28:10,048
lot on his website about like a business, small business,

1545
01:28:10,268 --> 01:28:13,288
the real heroes of America, small business owners.

1546
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:17,088
Like Disneyland, like Disneyland. Yes. And he's called it.

1547
01:28:17,088 --> 01:28:21,668
He's called Disneyland the crown jewel of the city and we have to, uh, you know,

1548
01:28:21,668 --> 01:28:25,328
like, like we have to support them and it creates jobs. And, and by the way,

1549
01:28:25,628 --> 01:28:30,088
I'll voice that side of things that Disney builds hotels. It is,

1550
01:28:30,088 --> 01:28:33,228
they it is jobs. It is operated. It's tourism.

1551
01:28:33,648 --> 01:28:36,348
It's a company town. Yeah. It isn't,

1552
01:28:36,348 --> 01:28:40,028
it isn't as if Disney having a free ticket to do whatever they want is like

1553
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:43,488
specifically a malicious thing, but they just, they could treat people better.

1554
01:28:43,608 --> 01:28:47,488
Those wages could be higher. Well, it's that article is Disney paying its fair

1555
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:51,388
share in Anaheim. That's the question really. Yeah. And the answer is no,

1556
01:28:51,388 --> 01:28:51,908
I think.

1557
01:28:51,908 --> 01:28:52,808
They could probably know.

1558
01:28:53,068 --> 01:28:58,048
Or to pay more and think a little more about their workers wellbeing and not

1559
01:28:58,048 --> 01:29:00,808
just their shareholder wellbeing or executive wellbeing.

1560
01:29:00,968 --> 01:29:06,308
Cause Lord knows Disney's executive compensation has followed the trend in

1561
01:29:06,308 --> 01:29:09,328
America of like workers wages go up a little bit.

1562
01:29:09,328 --> 01:29:11,388
Executive wages go up a lot.

1563
01:29:11,608 --> 01:29:15,008
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Um, okay.

1564
01:29:15,188 --> 01:29:17,408
So Disney does not want Aitken.

1565
01:29:17,408 --> 01:29:25,148
Disney wants Harry Sid you and the winner of the Anaheim mayoral election is

1566
01:29:25,148 --> 01:29:30,808
Harry Sid you Disney's man wins significantly.

1567
01:29:30,808 --> 01:29:33,788
And I will say a lot of these results,

1568
01:29:33,788 --> 01:29:35,488
significant victories,

1569
01:29:35,728 --> 01:29:40,228
not a squeaker like so many of the midterm elections that we've seen.

1570
01:29:40,428 --> 01:29:45,348
Disney demolished this election. They got everything they want.

1571
01:29:45,528 --> 01:29:49,188
They flipped the council. The gates are open.

1572
01:29:49,268 --> 01:29:52,128
They soared over campaign finance laws.

1573
01:29:52,968 --> 01:29:56,568
Is very funny.

1574
01:29:57,408 --> 01:30:01,048
Thank you. Yeah, they won a big,

1575
01:30:01,268 --> 01:30:05,388
I saw the number now that it's like basically the mayor also is Jason told me

1576
01:30:05,388 --> 01:30:07,908
before this is just sort of a member on the council. Basically.

1577
01:30:07,928 --> 01:30:11,248
That's how this works is like everybody votes. He doesn't have any more,

1578
01:30:11,308 --> 01:30:13,768
really more. His vote doesn't matter more than anyone else.

1579
01:30:13,768 --> 01:30:16,608
He's just sort of a ceremonial post as a figurehead and,

1580
01:30:16,668 --> 01:30:21,908
and also he represents Anaheim when dealing with the state government,

1581
01:30:22,148 --> 01:30:25,608
federal government, any sort of that sort of thing. Yeah.

1582
01:30:25,808 --> 01:30:29,868
So it's in the current, the people who are pro and anti Disney stay.

1583
01:30:30,108 --> 01:30:35,348
Uh, so, uh, but that, that brings it to, uh, what is it? I think it's,

1584
01:30:35,348 --> 01:30:38,868
I think it's five. Oh, five. I think it was five too. I saw it.

1585
01:30:38,868 --> 01:30:43,068
I think that was about right. I was having trouble reading.

1586
01:30:43,068 --> 01:30:45,968
I saw somebody's. Yeah. I was trying to read everyone,

1587
01:30:46,068 --> 01:30:48,188
but somebody said five to at least four, three.

1588
01:30:48,268 --> 01:30:52,568
This is a another, uh, downside to media consolidation.

1589
01:30:52,568 --> 01:30:56,808
It's very hard to find local coverage, uh,

1590
01:30:56,808 --> 01:31:00,968
or at least varied coverage. Honestly, the thing I was finding most up,

1591
01:31:01,048 --> 01:31:04,928
I was just typing into Twitter, Anaheim mayor, Anaheim city council.

1592
01:31:04,968 --> 01:31:09,188
And that was kind of when we were texting last night, I was sending tweets.

1593
01:31:09,188 --> 01:31:12,828
I was finding from the orange County reporters giving up.

1594
01:31:13,028 --> 01:31:17,068
And like, like there's a, there was a couple, maybe one Disney Twitter.

1595
01:31:17,068 --> 01:31:18,868
I'm going to pat ourselves on the back here.

1596
01:31:19,008 --> 01:31:21,788
I didn't even see this as being a huge story for everyone.

1597
01:31:21,968 --> 01:31:25,168
So like those bumper car boys really dropped the ball. Yes.

1598
01:31:25,328 --> 01:31:29,588
By not covering this a little bit more. Only you're only getting the election

1599
01:31:29,588 --> 01:31:33,428
analysis. We were eyeing it last night. We were texting each other about it.

1600
01:31:33,428 --> 01:31:38,228
This is, this is important info to analyze. And honestly,

1601
01:31:38,428 --> 01:31:40,448
I think this is a pretty big, I mean,

1602
01:31:40,448 --> 01:31:44,308
there's so much going on midterms wise in the world that I can see why this isn't

1603
01:31:44,308 --> 01:31:50,068
a more publicized situation. Hopefully in the next couple of months,

1604
01:31:50,328 --> 01:31:53,568
this is like, this does get more of a spotlight from, you know,

1605
01:31:53,748 --> 01:31:57,948
LA and orange County media, because think about this. This is like,

1606
01:31:58,048 --> 01:32:02,808
Disney has been boxed in by a combative mayor's office and city council and they

1607
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:07,068
flipped it. It is pro Disney. They have their run of the city. Now,

1608
01:32:07,068 --> 01:32:11,308
they can do what they want and measure L passed, like you said,

1609
01:32:11,428 --> 01:32:14,448
but Disney thinks that it does not apply to them necessarily.

1610
01:32:14,948 --> 01:32:17,908
The way the language is written, it doesn't seem like it does.

1611
01:32:18,068 --> 01:32:22,808
The measure L thing is interesting because in the larger, uh,

1612
01:32:22,808 --> 01:32:27,668
picture of the midterms, a number of states, some of them very red past,

1613
01:32:27,808 --> 01:32:33,188
overwhelmingly minimum wage increases similar to this one.

1614
01:32:33,288 --> 01:32:38,828
Uh, and I, I, I'll give him credit. I forget, uh, uh,

1615
01:32:38,828 --> 01:32:41,388
not him. Uh, I'll give them credit. Um,

1616
01:32:41,808 --> 01:32:46,568
their exact wording a writer named Alex Pirene, uh, pointed out like,

1617
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:50,628
yeah, this is very interesting that, uh,

1618
01:32:50,768 --> 01:32:54,428
left leaning labor favoring, um,

1619
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:58,788
policies, uh, uh, initiatives, propositions, that sort of thing,

1620
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:04,308
do even in red states, red counties, red neighborhoods, uh,

1621
01:33:04,488 --> 01:33:08,988
are popular, are popular with voters, not necessarily,

1622
01:33:09,008 --> 01:33:13,488
but that doesn't always translate to Democrats or progressive candidates are

1623
01:33:13,488 --> 01:33:15,888
popular, but the ideas are popular.

1624
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:18,448
They like the ideas of the left,

1625
01:33:18,448 --> 01:33:22,448
but they wanted ass kicking, uh,

1626
01:33:22,568 --> 01:33:28,608
pile driving asshole leading the ship. We want real sons of bitches in charge.

1627
01:33:28,648 --> 01:33:33,808
Really cornered ourselves in the insane cult of personalities that govern like,

1628
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:35,868
uh, uh, politics in America.

1629
01:33:35,948 --> 01:33:38,928
That's true. But it's always been like that actually, I think. Yeah,

1630
01:33:38,928 --> 01:33:40,928
I don't think that's wrong, but, uh,

1631
01:33:40,988 --> 01:33:44,828
we may have been cornering ourselves for 200 plus years. Yeah, no, I agree.

1632
01:33:45,248 --> 01:33:49,268
Um, so, I mean, this makes me worried that, you know, if,

1633
01:33:49,268 --> 01:33:52,568
if Mickey is kind of like the,

1634
01:33:52,568 --> 01:33:55,988
the overseer unofficially of Disneyland,

1635
01:33:55,988 --> 01:34:03,508
are we going to see a rise of a more populist mean candidate like Pete or like

1636
01:34:03,508 --> 01:34:06,128
Captain Hook or like, uh,

1637
01:34:06,128 --> 01:34:11,068
are we going to start seeing Captain Hook leading the shows or James Woods is,

1638
01:34:11,068 --> 01:34:15,988
uh, Hades. Yeah, we're going to see Hades dethrone Mickey as the primary,

1639
01:34:16,348 --> 01:34:19,428
the most popular character in Disney is now Hades. Yeah.

1640
01:34:19,428 --> 01:34:21,728
The planter is going to be Hades when you walk in,

1641
01:34:21,728 --> 01:34:24,748
you're going to look for hidden Hades all over all of the rides.

1642
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:28,768
The Alton Hades statue has been erected in Main Street. I hate to say it,

1643
01:34:28,768 --> 01:34:33,888
but I have read that like when Hades shows up in the park or like, you know,

1644
01:34:34,028 --> 01:34:37,388
spook like a ticketed defense, very popular.

1645
01:34:37,588 --> 01:34:41,488
It puts Disney in a weird position cause James Woods is out of his mind.

1646
01:34:42,308 --> 01:34:45,708
Well, as long as he's never going to do the voice again. So Scott,

1647
01:34:45,828 --> 01:34:49,548
would you take the role as Hades if offered to you? Yeah, that one. Yeah,

1648
01:34:49,568 --> 01:34:51,108
that one's no problem. Yeah.

1649
01:34:51,108 --> 01:34:54,988
Sure thing babe. Yeah. I, uh, what's his deal?

1650
01:34:55,048 --> 01:34:56,888
He kind of talks a little more like a natural. He's kind of,

1651
01:34:56,888 --> 01:35:00,048
let's do lunch. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah. Go to Spago.

1652
01:35:00,188 --> 01:35:05,068
He's like referencing 90s Hollywood stuff. Jokes Eisner likes. Sure.

1653
01:35:05,248 --> 01:35:07,808
Yeah. Isn't that, that's my vague. All right. So there I've been to Spago.

1654
01:35:08,788 --> 01:35:09,348
I like that.

1655
01:35:10,188 --> 01:35:14,908
Or doesn't Hades sound like, uh, open the gates of hell.

1656
01:35:15,588 --> 01:35:19,048
That's what, that's Hades voice, isn't it? Yeah. Okay.

1657
01:35:19,148 --> 01:35:23,568
So what we have learned Disney, why everything we've talked about this.

1658
01:35:23,568 --> 01:35:26,348
So what happens? What do we think happens?

1659
01:35:26,528 --> 01:35:28,548
It's a very good question because there's the,

1660
01:35:28,548 --> 01:35:32,488
there's like the depressing end and there's the least like, well,

1661
01:35:32,488 --> 01:35:34,448
I don't like that Anaheim is suffering,

1662
01:35:34,448 --> 01:35:38,468
but we do get two more theme parks in the next 10 years.

1663
01:35:39,048 --> 01:35:42,588
I do feel like that. I think you're over optimistic. Yeah. No,

1664
01:35:42,588 --> 01:35:45,688
I didn't say that was happening. I'm saying there's the, there's the two extremes.

1665
01:35:45,968 --> 01:35:48,688
I think. Oh, right. Okay. I think probably,

1666
01:35:48,688 --> 01:35:52,848
cause these terms like every two, they're staggered, these council seats too.

1667
01:35:52,888 --> 01:35:55,888
So it's like every two years, I believe that some of them come up. Yes.

1668
01:35:55,948 --> 01:35:58,748
Every two years, some of the seats.

1669
01:35:58,808 --> 01:36:00,628
I have to imagine that we,

1670
01:36:00,628 --> 01:36:05,488
I think that we're going to just see a lot of these projects we're talking about

1671
01:36:05,488 --> 01:36:06,268
come back.

1672
01:36:06,748 --> 01:36:09,968
I think we'll see more money for different things at downtown Disney,

1673
01:36:10,068 --> 01:36:14,488
maybe a paradise pier hotel redo, maybe one more hotel.

1674
01:36:14,688 --> 01:36:15,948
There was talk also when that,

1675
01:36:15,948 --> 01:36:19,628
that hotel was initially going to be not where it is in downtown Disney,

1676
01:36:19,668 --> 01:36:24,748
that it was going to be situated that such that a wing of it would be the Star

1677
01:36:24,748 --> 01:36:28,188
Wars hotel in Anaheim, which they are building in Orlando. Okay.

1678
01:36:28,388 --> 01:36:30,748
So there was talk that they would build that four diamond hotel,

1679
01:36:30,748 --> 01:36:34,968
but a wing of it is the interactive, crazy, expensive Star Wars hotel.

1680
01:36:35,228 --> 01:36:38,748
So I feel like for two years,

1681
01:36:38,748 --> 01:36:40,768
they're just going to take care of that stuff.

1682
01:36:40,928 --> 01:36:44,088
I think they'll build what they were already planning on building ride wise,

1683
01:36:44,228 --> 01:36:45,828
but I think that this,

1684
01:36:45,828 --> 01:36:51,328
this pro Disney thing has to last for years to get like third park because

1685
01:36:51,328 --> 01:36:54,768
there's, it doesn't seem like there's any, not a thought about it.

1686
01:36:54,788 --> 01:36:57,908
They do not care as long as they're making as much money as they are.

1687
01:36:58,268 --> 01:36:59,568
They can choke us.

1688
01:36:59,908 --> 01:37:02,608
They'll do limited time events, other ticketed events,

1689
01:37:02,768 --> 01:37:07,068
and like they will put off new attractions for as long as they can.

1690
01:37:07,108 --> 01:37:10,888
We haven't really had anything new, new, I guess guardians,

1691
01:37:11,028 --> 01:37:11,888
but that was a rescan.

1692
01:37:11,888 --> 01:37:15,468
I mean, well, we've cars landed five, six years ago, whatever.

1693
01:37:17,028 --> 01:37:21,868
And I do think we're in the, even without this, they're about to build more.

1694
01:37:22,228 --> 01:37:24,648
Like obviously like Marvel, there's going to be at least some ride.

1695
01:37:25,108 --> 01:37:28,688
We haven't even talked about how the sort of plans may be leaked.

1696
01:37:28,708 --> 01:37:33,468
And there's the Spider-Man ride we thought was going to come is like now a very

1697
01:37:33,468 --> 01:37:35,888
like lame sounding shooter, 3d ride.

1698
01:37:36,048 --> 01:37:39,928
Sounds a little gutted potentially. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, they're still going to,

1699
01:37:39,928 --> 01:37:43,888
there's the Mickey and Minnie's runaway railway is probably going to be built in

1700
01:37:43,888 --> 01:37:46,828
that is announced. And that is in that not for Disneyland.

1701
01:37:47,688 --> 01:37:51,008
Is it not enough? It's, it's just a strong rumor. I'm saying,

1702
01:37:51,008 --> 01:37:54,808
but that has weird infrastructure implications too,

1703
01:37:54,908 --> 01:37:58,928
because that would go backstage in like the entertainment building,

1704
01:37:58,928 --> 01:38:01,868
which is also the building they launched the fireworks off of.

1705
01:38:01,868 --> 01:38:04,528
So they have to figure out where to launch the fireworks,

1706
01:38:04,608 --> 01:38:07,588
where to put all those entertainment department. I think the residents homes,

1707
01:38:08,248 --> 01:38:12,168
people work out of the roofs of the apartment buildings behind the park.

1708
01:38:12,308 --> 01:38:12,508
Yeah.

1709
01:38:12,508 --> 01:38:15,428
I think the fireworks stuff was already like they were figuring out what to do

1710
01:38:15,428 --> 01:38:18,488
because of Star Wars land, but it is interesting that I heard that supposedly

1711
01:38:18,488 --> 01:38:22,768
they're just going to gut the building. The building is going to, is there already?

1712
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:25,828
It's just an office building and they're just going to take the floors out and

1713
01:38:25,828 --> 01:38:27,968
then the rides going in there. Whoa.

1714
01:38:28,088 --> 01:38:31,488
Cause it's a screen ride basically, but it's supposed to be very impressive.

1715
01:38:32,348 --> 01:38:33,408
So it's just, they're going to,

1716
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:37,528
the building is big enough where they can just set the screens up and have this

1717
01:38:37,528 --> 01:38:39,628
like a similar, I'm sure it'd be laid out a little different.

1718
01:38:39,768 --> 01:38:44,028
And the only casualty in Toontown is a single gift shop. Like you would,

1719
01:38:44,288 --> 01:38:45,588
that would be the entrance,

1720
01:38:45,648 --> 01:38:49,048
but then you would go back towards this off backstage building.

1721
01:38:49,188 --> 01:38:52,188
No attractions eliminated and you keep gadgets, go coaster,

1722
01:38:52,368 --> 01:38:54,688
you keep Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin.

1723
01:38:54,928 --> 01:38:59,428
It's a best case scenario in terms of attractions and keeping Toontown intact.

1724
01:38:59,628 --> 01:39:01,968
And it's like Tony said, there's a lot more land.

1725
01:39:02,348 --> 01:39:03,848
He said Tony Baxter said in our live ups,

1726
01:39:03,928 --> 01:39:06,888
there's a lot more land than you think at Disneyland that's still available.

1727
01:39:06,968 --> 01:39:08,448
And if you look on the map,

1728
01:39:08,548 --> 01:39:11,848
you can kind of see what he's talking about back there. So,

1729
01:39:12,088 --> 01:39:15,148
so there's my point was just that they're building a lot of rides.

1730
01:39:15,148 --> 01:39:17,908
I don't know that that was going to change depending on this election,

1731
01:39:17,908 --> 01:39:20,408
but I think at least the next two years,

1732
01:39:20,648 --> 01:39:25,088
we're going to see a lot of that type of parking garage stuff, hotel stuff,

1733
01:39:25,708 --> 01:39:26,448
downtown Disney.

1734
01:39:26,448 --> 01:39:29,708
Probably this hotel comes back. Maybe Eastern gateway comes back.

1735
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:33,888
Yeah. I think they're probably right now parsing what this decision means for

1736
01:39:33,888 --> 01:39:35,928
them. Do you want to take it a step further?

1737
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:40,708
Do we think that it's possible that some of these local hotels in order to keep

1738
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:41,648
them in compliance,

1739
01:39:41,768 --> 01:39:45,828
that we have armed guards with Mickey shaped armor

1740
01:39:45,828 --> 01:39:52,028
and heavy assault rifles like watching over the Howard Johnson across the

1741
01:39:52,028 --> 01:39:53,148
street. Do we have,

1742
01:39:53,148 --> 01:39:57,828
do we have armed Mickey guards policing Anaheim under the purview of Mayor

1743
01:39:57,828 --> 01:39:58,268
See You?

1744
01:39:58,368 --> 01:40:02,008
That's a sort of twisted idea I would expect from escape from tomorrow.

1745
01:40:02,248 --> 01:40:03,368
Escape from tomorrow.

1746
01:40:03,908 --> 01:40:07,368
Uh, there will, there will be a rise of cat flu.

1747
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,688
Mayor said you will know about it.

1748
01:40:09,688 --> 01:40:13,688
Scott will not do anything that I mean, the,

1749
01:40:13,688 --> 01:40:16,028
the looking head to the future, uh,

1750
01:40:16,028 --> 01:40:19,108
should they confirm the Mickey and Mickey mini runaway railway?

1751
01:40:19,348 --> 01:40:24,368
Presumably that would mean brand new attraction back in Toon town.

1752
01:40:25,128 --> 01:40:26,368
They're not,

1753
01:40:26,588 --> 01:40:30,908
they could not stop closing Toon town at like six or seven o'clock at night.

1754
01:40:31,068 --> 01:40:36,168
I would think it would have to keep Toon town open all night to get people into

1755
01:40:36,168 --> 01:40:40,508
this brand new attraction that would take some people away from star Wars land.

1756
01:40:41,388 --> 01:40:44,608
And, uh, even if they scale back on the fireworks,

1757
01:40:44,708 --> 01:40:48,668
do more projection a kind of stuff. Well, we got a brand new ride.

1758
01:40:48,748 --> 01:40:52,208
We got people out of the mess of star Wars land.

1759
01:40:52,528 --> 01:40:55,428
Is that a win win for a little while until we figure out a fireworks

1760
01:40:55,428 --> 01:40:56,208
alternative?

1761
01:40:56,868 --> 01:40:59,868
Wait, what you're saying that they're gonna, that that,

1762
01:40:59,868 --> 01:41:01,768
they're just going to stick with what they're doing.

1763
01:41:02,268 --> 01:41:03,568
Well, I'm saying if the,

1764
01:41:03,868 --> 01:41:07,588
if they do confirm that the Mickey and mini runaway railway is going back into

1765
01:41:07,588 --> 01:41:11,148
town, they keep Toon town open later at night.

1766
01:41:11,148 --> 01:41:15,108
It takes away some of the crowds from star Wars land. Yeah.

1767
01:41:15,108 --> 01:41:18,108
Maybe the fireworks aren't as impressive for a little while,

1768
01:41:18,408 --> 01:41:22,148
but isn't that a net positive that we get some people out of star Wars land and

1769
01:41:22,148 --> 01:41:24,288
keep them distracted with the shiny new attraction.

1770
01:41:24,288 --> 01:41:27,688
You sure fireworks become a screen fireworks or a screen.

1771
01:41:28,768 --> 01:41:29,308
Yeah.

1772
01:41:29,808 --> 01:41:34,268
They fly in Anaheim airspace loud noisy helicopters allowed by the mayor.

1773
01:41:34,268 --> 01:41:37,668
Right. To go back to what Scott is saying, uh, the, with the armed guards,

1774
01:41:38,028 --> 01:41:42,108
do you think that the fireworks start to become missiles and they can shoot them

1775
01:41:42,108 --> 01:41:46,048
at people and businesses in Anaheim to make the businesses blow up?

1776
01:41:46,548 --> 01:41:50,228
Well, that's the sort of twisted idea I would expect it. Banksy's Dismaland.

1777
01:41:52,568 --> 01:41:56,488
Like captain kids buffet will get shot at by firework missiles.

1778
01:41:56,588 --> 01:42:00,928
They're asking for it already with their military imagery there. They've,

1779
01:42:01,008 --> 01:42:02,508
with calling themselves captain,

1780
01:42:02,568 --> 01:42:06,948
they've presented an affront all these years to the Disney resort and yeah,

1781
01:42:06,948 --> 01:42:11,068
now they're going to pay for it. Uh, they've, there's been talk about drones in,

1782
01:42:11,068 --> 01:42:13,828
in Disney shows, coordinated drones,

1783
01:42:13,968 --> 01:42:15,928
making shapes and making Mickey ears and stuff.

1784
01:42:16,128 --> 01:42:19,768
What's to stop those drones from, uh, given captain kids or what,

1785
01:42:20,068 --> 01:42:21,748
what shooting fireworks bombs at them.

1786
01:42:21,748 --> 01:42:25,968
I think that on the bridge will now be maybe extended and that you will have

1787
01:42:25,968 --> 01:42:29,168
little like kind of things that'll like areas that you'll jut out and you'll be

1788
01:42:29,168 --> 01:42:32,668
able to walk up and down Harbor above it and spit on the businesses.

1789
01:42:33,448 --> 01:42:35,408
Like the tourists can spit along.

1790
01:42:35,608 --> 01:42:39,688
Surely that would undo the parlay that Disney has had with captain kids

1791
01:42:39,688 --> 01:42:41,948
establishment for many years.

1792
01:42:42,488 --> 01:42:44,208
Well that's what this is all about. I think.

1793
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:45,248
And there will be,

1794
01:42:45,368 --> 01:42:49,968
and they'll also have increased funds to have drinking fountains every five

1795
01:42:49,968 --> 01:42:52,748
feet on the bridge so you can be nice and salivated.

1796
01:42:52,748 --> 01:42:56,128
So it's not just a soft amount of spit. It's a torrent of spit.

1797
01:42:56,128 --> 01:43:00,908
When you want to, uh, you know, uh, forget what else is down there.

1798
01:43:01,708 --> 01:43:05,628
The Annabelle they'll hand out a dip to.

1799
01:43:05,668 --> 01:43:09,428
Oh, sure. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you can, yeah, you,

1800
01:43:09,428 --> 01:43:12,368
you can blacken the sidewalks outside of these places.

1801
01:43:12,448 --> 01:43:16,848
And then the Yelp reviews start going down filthy sidewalks spit everywhere.

1802
01:43:17,008 --> 01:43:20,848
I would never stay here. I'd only stay at the new luxury star Wars hotel.

1803
01:43:20,848 --> 01:43:25,328
You know, there's gotta be a review somewhere of someone going like,

1804
01:43:25,608 --> 01:43:26,908
I don't like going to Disneyland.

1805
01:43:27,548 --> 01:43:30,788
I get a lot of dirty looks when I dip,

1806
01:43:32,268 --> 01:43:34,608
when I walk around with my dip cup.

1807
01:43:35,388 --> 01:43:37,868
We got to Google that to see if that's, uh, that's the case.

1808
01:43:38,028 --> 01:43:43,128
I'm thinking about something. I think maybe it's, you know,

1809
01:43:43,168 --> 01:43:48,868
what I'm concerned about with this increased power that Disney is going to

1810
01:43:48,868 --> 01:43:49,968
have by flipping these seats.

1811
01:43:50,008 --> 01:43:54,908
I think it presents a problem for local businesses and local other theme parks.

1812
01:43:55,068 --> 01:43:55,308
Like they're,

1813
01:43:55,428 --> 01:44:00,068
they have such power now in the face of places like knots who we've become more

1814
01:44:00,068 --> 01:44:01,928
friendly with. And I think it's important.

1815
01:44:02,248 --> 01:44:06,148
What I think is that there should be legislation that kind of reaches a handout

1816
01:44:06,148 --> 01:44:11,188
to knots. And that's why I think we, uh, should,

1817
01:44:11,308 --> 01:44:16,188
our pack, the PTR pack should introduce a measure.

1818
01:44:16,188 --> 01:44:20,488
And I want to call the measure measure ADG.

1819
01:44:20,508 --> 01:44:26,048
And this would provide crucial infrastructure for the building of a ride that

1820
01:44:26,048 --> 01:44:29,628
would link Disneyland to knots, Barry farm.

1821
01:44:29,628 --> 01:44:32,608
You didn't catch my drift. I mean, ADG would have,

1822
01:44:32,608 --> 01:44:36,928
I just chose those letters at random, right? But it could provide for the,

1823
01:44:36,928 --> 01:44:41,488
you know, for the installation of a ride based on the Apple dumpling gang,

1824
01:44:41,488 --> 01:44:44,908
the ride that we pitched to Tony Baxter that would shuttle people back and

1825
01:44:44,908 --> 01:44:46,188
forth between knots and Disney.

1826
01:44:46,428 --> 01:44:50,468
And that would show that we are the greatest imagineers of the 21st century.

1827
01:44:50,568 --> 01:44:52,088
Well, I think that is a great idea.

1828
01:44:52,208 --> 01:44:55,668
I think we need to make everyone know that we are the greatest imagineers of the

1829
01:44:55,668 --> 01:44:56,968
21st century. But we also,

1830
01:44:57,008 --> 01:45:00,468
this also makes sense just from other stuff that we're doing on the podcast.

1831
01:45:00,668 --> 01:45:03,848
What was the, is the pack is ADG? Is that what we call it? What did you call?

1832
01:45:03,988 --> 01:45:04,688
Oh, PTR pack.

1833
01:45:04,908 --> 01:45:09,208
The PTR pack would, I mean, there's probably a, you know, way to disguise

1834
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:14,588
that it's us, uh, you know, it's, it's some little acronym.

1835
01:45:14,608 --> 01:45:18,068
It's it's im improve our rights. I, I,

1836
01:45:18,068 --> 01:45:23,128
I was pack the childless pack. Great. Uh, uh, and,

1837
01:45:23,448 --> 01:45:26,148
I mean, really we should figure out something that Wolf stands for us that we

1838
01:45:26,148 --> 01:45:29,808
can be the Wolf pack. Oh, that's good. You know, so like, you know,

1839
01:45:29,888 --> 01:45:33,228
well that's workers, uh, overseeing, uh,

1840
01:45:33,228 --> 01:45:37,628
I have to figure out the math on that, but the, you know, the,

1841
01:45:37,908 --> 01:45:41,048
the pod pack, the PTR pack, the Wolf pack, we all, we, whatever it is,

1842
01:45:41,568 --> 01:45:45,288
we introduce measure ADG and which I think,

1843
01:45:45,568 --> 01:45:49,148
and that's going to land with such a bang. I think it'll pass easily.

1844
01:45:49,148 --> 01:45:53,188
And I think the person front and center of measure ADG,

1845
01:45:53,528 --> 01:45:58,088
Jason Sheridan will prove that he has what it takes to get further involved in

1846
01:45:58,088 --> 01:46:00,808
local politics and become the mayor of the DLR.

1847
01:46:00,808 --> 01:46:06,028
Well, it's time we all rolled up our sleeves and use the levers of power to

1848
01:46:06,028 --> 01:46:07,988
our, to benefit our,

1849
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:12,568
ourselves and others for we are the, the theme park going public.

1850
01:46:12,748 --> 01:46:17,048
And I also would like to allocate some of the money from that pack from a

1851
01:46:17,048 --> 01:46:21,948
proposition I'm calling proposition T proposition T requires all

1852
01:46:21,948 --> 01:46:27,008
ice cream sold at Disney to come with one complimentary

1853
01:46:27,008 --> 01:46:30,608
topping unless you don't want it. I think it's time.

1854
01:46:30,708 --> 01:46:35,108
Is there a discount if you don't want it? You know what? If you don't want it,

1855
01:46:35,108 --> 01:46:37,648
there is a slight discount. I like that.

1856
01:46:37,708 --> 01:46:40,608
It's like not getting chips with your corn dog. You pay a little less.

1857
01:46:40,688 --> 01:46:42,968
You should. Yes. I like the sound of this.

1858
01:46:43,268 --> 01:46:47,148
This is like a pretty fully worked out proposition. It's, it's,

1859
01:46:47,308 --> 01:46:52,208
I think it's time to pass some of the,

1860
01:46:52,688 --> 01:46:56,448
the benefits of all of this development back to the guests,

1861
01:46:56,468 --> 01:47:00,968
you know, and it's certainly not going to be Disney lowering prices anytime.

1862
01:47:00,968 --> 01:47:05,328
So that would be the craziest news story theme park news is seeding years.

1863
01:47:05,328 --> 01:47:09,388
If they're like tickets are $20 less now. I mean,

1864
01:47:09,728 --> 01:47:12,528
they should do that. That would be great.

1865
01:47:12,648 --> 01:47:13,768
But in the meantime,

1866
01:47:13,828 --> 01:47:17,288
we need to look for other avenues to get the benefits to people.

1867
01:47:17,288 --> 01:47:22,048
And I think a complimentary topping of sprinkles or nuts or fudge or however,

1868
01:47:22,248 --> 01:47:23,988
you, the ice cream buyer,

1869
01:47:24,268 --> 01:47:27,908
guests choose to allocate that that is your choice.

1870
01:47:27,908 --> 01:47:31,468
I think that is a great idea. I think that is a really nice first proposal.

1871
01:47:32,188 --> 01:47:35,728
I had an idea and I tell me if this is wild.

1872
01:47:36,828 --> 01:47:38,648
You've been doing some reporting for us lately.

1873
01:47:39,568 --> 01:47:41,308
There's going to be an episode on the patron coming out.

1874
01:47:41,308 --> 01:47:44,408
You did some good reporting. You went to report at universal horror nights.

1875
01:47:45,088 --> 01:47:48,788
What if we send you Jason Sheridan, future mayor of Disneyland,

1876
01:47:48,968 --> 01:47:52,908
our cub reporter to interview the mayor of Anaheim,

1877
01:47:53,188 --> 01:47:56,748
Harry Sidhu and you sat down with him and you just talked a little bit.

1878
01:47:56,748 --> 01:47:59,528
You sort of took his temperature on everything where it was going.

1879
01:47:59,768 --> 01:48:01,688
I don't think this is out of the realm of possibility.

1880
01:48:01,908 --> 01:48:03,848
I don't think there's a ton of people's we're talking about.

1881
01:48:03,888 --> 01:48:08,648
It's hard to find good coverage of this stuff in Anaheim. Is there a chance?

1882
01:48:09,188 --> 01:48:09,528
First of all,

1883
01:48:09,608 --> 01:48:13,868
would you agree to a sit down with the mayor of Anaheim and do we think we can

1884
01:48:13,868 --> 01:48:14,588
make it happen?

1885
01:48:15,848 --> 01:48:17,728
I mean, I'd need to think about that.

1886
01:48:18,388 --> 01:48:24,808
For the sake of the show, I'll say yes. For the sake of my wellbeing,

1887
01:48:24,808 --> 01:48:29,288
I'll say I'm now covered in a Jeff Garland episode, levels of Flopps.

1888
01:48:29,288 --> 01:48:36,188
I don't have him here or anything. I'm not about to ambush you.

1889
01:48:36,928 --> 01:48:40,768
Oh, not Jeff. Jeff is not here. Harry is not here.

1890
01:48:41,888 --> 01:48:46,008
You're going to meet the mayor now. We're going to meet me.

1891
01:48:47,608 --> 01:48:48,948
All right. So you'll think about it. I mean,

1892
01:48:48,948 --> 01:48:52,548
I think the fans would like Jason to sit with Harry.

1893
01:48:53,428 --> 01:48:55,748
Hashtag Jason and Harry, I guess.

1894
01:48:56,968 --> 01:49:00,128
Mayor meets mayor. Mayor meets mayor. Mayor meets future mayor.

1895
01:49:00,628 --> 01:49:05,068
How many minutes do you think it would take for

1896
01:49:05,068 --> 01:49:09,948
my contempt for the current political system in America to

1897
01:49:09,948 --> 01:49:11,668
just seep out of my pores?

1898
01:49:11,708 --> 01:49:15,648
I think that's a good test for you because you have to work with people that

1899
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:17,748
necessarily don't necessarily agree with everything.

1900
01:49:17,968 --> 01:49:21,548
You have to work with Hades and Peet. You're going to have to reach across the aisle.

1901
01:49:21,548 --> 01:49:23,448
Yes, you're going to have to reach out to that hook.

1902
01:49:23,448 --> 01:49:26,428
Could cut your hand, but you could learn something in the process.

1903
01:49:26,548 --> 01:49:32,368
There was. I did see a, I think it was Guy Selga posted a picture from,

1904
01:49:32,488 --> 01:49:35,548
I don't remember if this was when Poo ran for president,

1905
01:49:35,588 --> 01:49:39,488
but it was a piece of paper and one side you tore off to vote for Poo and another

1906
01:49:39,488 --> 01:49:41,668
side you tore off to vote for Captain Hook.

1907
01:49:42,428 --> 01:49:44,048
What? He was the opposite?

1908
01:49:45,028 --> 01:49:45,508
Wow. Really?

1909
01:49:45,708 --> 01:49:49,088
Hook was running for, oh God, what was it? Was it president?

1910
01:49:49,088 --> 01:49:53,708
Which if this was, I'm not sure that that election corresponded with the

1911
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:59,108
presidency of Richard Nixon, but I feel like it might have, it was in the 70s,

1912
01:49:59,108 --> 01:49:59,948
but I could be wrong.

1913
01:49:59,988 --> 01:50:03,768
But if Nixon was the sitting president and then like there was, as I was saying,

1914
01:50:03,888 --> 01:50:09,328
like a little like weird right wing uprising, if Poo had lost the Poo

1915
01:50:09,328 --> 01:50:13,828
election and then they had to do events where Captain Hook is the main

1916
01:50:13,828 --> 01:50:15,348
president.

1917
01:50:15,348 --> 01:50:20,888
I mean, it's entirely possible Poo went the McGovern route and lost

1918
01:50:20,888 --> 01:50:21,728
resoundingly.

1919
01:50:21,868 --> 01:50:27,748
Poo at 8% crushing blow to the, his, his pro ice cream campaign.

1920
01:50:27,828 --> 01:50:33,268
I will break a story right now that we teased early in the episode.

1921
01:50:33,268 --> 01:50:40,268
Oh, the breadcast Joe Saunders did write on the Vicky Attaversary special.

1922
01:50:41,528 --> 01:50:42,888
Wow. That was him.

1923
01:50:43,088 --> 01:50:44,348
Wow. We got to sit down with him.

1924
01:50:44,348 --> 01:50:46,768
Oh, that's a great reason to have him on.

1925
01:50:47,328 --> 01:50:51,988
Put him in the hot seat and see if he wrote Mickey Mouse is a round face

1926
01:50:51,988 --> 01:50:53,088
cartoon character.

1927
01:50:53,428 --> 01:50:54,588
Oh, why? Good point.

1928
01:50:54,668 --> 01:50:59,548
What if those were like weird sly, like attempts at dry jokes and that we are

1929
01:50:59,548 --> 01:51:04,948
the, why they jumped out at us is because it was like the wry sensibilities of Joe

1930
01:51:04,948 --> 01:51:05,348
Saunders.

1931
01:51:05,468 --> 01:51:11,628
It's entirely possible that our overwhelming sincerity about theme parks

1932
01:51:12,268 --> 01:51:17,828
and such blinded us to the irony part of our brains that have been destroyed.

1933
01:51:19,628 --> 01:51:24,748
I, well, I hope it's possible that Joe Saunders just sent in a single pitch and

1934
01:51:24,748 --> 01:51:26,528
the pitch was Mickey drums.

1935
01:51:26,728 --> 01:51:27,628
And then he left.

1936
01:51:27,788 --> 01:51:34,128
He collected a paycheck and, and my brain was the better for it.

1937
01:51:34,128 --> 01:51:36,348
I'm very well, we got to talk.

1938
01:51:36,608 --> 01:51:36,808
Yes.

1939
01:51:37,028 --> 01:51:37,228
Yeah.

1940
01:51:37,228 --> 01:51:41,968
We all show attempts to get the full scoop on Mickey's on the Mickey's 90th writers

1941
01:51:41,968 --> 01:51:44,448
or the oral history of Mickey's 90th.

1942
01:51:44,748 --> 01:51:48,908
We have promised a lot on this episode and that's just another promise we've made.

1943
01:51:49,408 --> 01:51:52,228
But I can't wait to get all of it by Friday.

1944
01:51:52,568 --> 01:51:54,808
We promise more promises.

1945
01:51:56,088 --> 01:51:56,448
Yes.

1946
01:51:57,488 --> 01:52:03,048
Well, mayor to mayor sit down Joe Saunders, oral history, Stamos guests, Stamos

1947
01:52:03,048 --> 01:52:04,068
will be a guest.

1948
01:52:04,068 --> 01:52:04,808
This is the cat.

1949
01:52:04,828 --> 01:52:09,228
We're starting to make promises for 20 90 and the formation of our pack.

1950
01:52:09,228 --> 01:52:14,428
And if there's anything else you'd like our pack to get up to, please let us know.

1951
01:52:15,028 --> 01:52:20,988
You know, I think it's been pretty fascinating to, you know, view everything

1952
01:52:20,988 --> 01:52:24,948
going on in Anaheim through the lens of our current political climate and talk

1953
01:52:24,948 --> 01:52:28,748
about the way that corporations take advantage of the little people.

1954
01:52:28,748 --> 01:52:33,788
I'd also like to say that the Earl of Sandwich newly reopened now is presenting

1955
01:52:33,788 --> 01:52:38,568
the item, the holiday ham featuring ham, cheddar, yams and cranberry sauce

1956
01:52:38,568 --> 01:52:40,828
on freshly toasted artisan bread.

1957
01:52:41,128 --> 01:52:45,688
It will join longtime favorite holiday turkey starting on Monday, November 5th.

1958
01:52:45,688 --> 01:52:46,608
Well, that was this week.

1959
01:52:46,688 --> 01:52:48,368
So that's that I buried the lead.

1960
01:52:48,388 --> 01:52:51,028
That's the biggest headline of the week.

1961
01:52:51,708 --> 01:52:55,568
Enjoy those sandwiches along with peppermint brownie peppermint brownie

1962
01:52:55,568 --> 01:52:58,628
for the perfect quick bite holiday lunch at the Disneyland Resort.

1963
01:52:58,668 --> 01:53:00,508
Wow. Did you you're triggering him again?

1964
01:53:00,588 --> 01:53:01,948
You know that he hasn't had lunch.

1965
01:53:02,028 --> 01:53:04,488
You're trying to get him. The flop sweat is now doubled.

1966
01:53:04,568 --> 01:53:05,608
I'm very curious.

1967
01:53:06,248 --> 01:53:09,508
I have not sampled because they always seem to be out of them.

1968
01:53:09,528 --> 01:53:13,228
When I was there, the Earl of Sandwich brownies, but I have had some

1969
01:53:13,228 --> 01:53:15,288
shitty brownies the last few years.

1970
01:53:15,288 --> 01:53:19,368
I feel like they're the number one item you see in a bakery case that looks good.

1971
01:53:19,368 --> 01:53:21,348
And it turns out to be very stale.

1972
01:53:21,808 --> 01:53:26,148
Well, you can talk to Mayor Sidhu about that and see if he what his brownie take is.

1973
01:53:26,248 --> 01:53:28,468
No more dry brownies.

1974
01:53:28,468 --> 01:53:33,208
And maybe just maybe you guys can shake hands and have found common ground.

1975
01:53:33,208 --> 01:53:39,608
You survived podcast, the right strident political edition.

1976
01:53:40,168 --> 01:53:41,168
This was this was interesting.

1977
01:53:41,168 --> 01:53:44,488
I've been looking forward to this discussion.

1978
01:53:45,348 --> 01:53:48,788
We'll get back to to nonsense soon enough.

1979
01:53:49,628 --> 01:53:54,008
And as we said, nonsense is available at the at the Patreon right now.

1980
01:53:54,008 --> 01:53:56,168
All about botanicals.

1981
01:53:56,168 --> 01:54:00,268

The T-shirt with we should make a shirt

1986
01:54:13,568 --> 01:54:17,348
that's like a listing of all of the political figures Jason will be sitting down with

1987
01:54:17,348 --> 01:54:19,868
on his on his mayor quest.

1988
01:54:21,308 --> 01:54:24,808
Like like a concert tour on my burning bridges rounds.

1989
01:54:27,548 --> 01:54:30,548
As long as you don't burn the Eastern Gateway Bridge.

1990
01:54:30,548 --> 01:54:34,168
Sure to be built now at the Anaheim Resort.

1991
01:54:35,448 --> 01:54:36,348
Yeah. Anything else?

1992
01:54:36,508 --> 01:54:38,588
