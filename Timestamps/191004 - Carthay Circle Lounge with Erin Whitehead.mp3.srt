1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,240
Warning, the following podcast contains heavenly bathroom

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,960
stalls, a small painful boil on one seat,

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,200
and the most interesting topic of all,

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,480
improv comedy politics.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,920
Aaron Whitehead hangs out with us in the Carthay Circle Lounge

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,600
today on podcast, The Ride.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,600
Welcome to Podcast, The Ride, the theme park podcast,

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,720
which today we'll spend at least 30 minutes

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,120
on the topic of spherical ice.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,600
My name is Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,160
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,840
And Scott Gardner.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,560
Oh yeah, finally, found fucking time.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,720
It's been two years and we really haven't gotten deep

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,240
into the spherical ice yet.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,080
No.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,480
We may have mentioned it, but we haven't really talked

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,320
about exactly what we love about it.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,120
We've ignored one of the best things on property

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,240
for so long, not today.

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,200
Not today, and I also know our guest is a big fan

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,120
of spherical ice, I assume, I actually could be wrong

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,960
about that.

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,480
I mean, it's interesting you think that because,

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,440
well, I'll tell you, you've seen my feelings about it.

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,120
I guess I have, maybe I'm just remembering.

30
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,080
Do you pick up and break spherical ice

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,200
every time you see it?

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
No, but I lift it out of my drink.

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,360
Whoa.

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,840
Oh yeah, that's true, because it's too hard to navigate.

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,320
That's the voice of Erin Whitehead, everyone.

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,040
You know her from Wild Horses

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,160
and various other things around Hollywood.

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,200
She's here too, I guess.

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,320
Just tape her off.

40
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,720
You know her from the things.

41
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,560
Things, definitely things.

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
You know her from creative stuff.

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,280
Creative endeavors.

44
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,480
And from aspirations.

45
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,240
You know her from her aspirations.

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,440
You know her dreams.

47
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,160
Her wishes.

48
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,000
Some of the most famous dreams out there are Erin's.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I know Erin from her black and white headshots.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,400
You keep them black and white, you didn't upgrade.

51
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,760
No, I just had to stay with them.

52
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,600
I look the same.

53
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,160
Yeah, they work.

54
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,800
Is there a reason why people,

55
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,360
I feel like they aren't black and white as often.

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,400
They aren't.

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't know why that changed.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,120
Well, I think it just probably became easier

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,720
to make color copies when digital became a thing.

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,560
That's a good point.

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
Because when I first got them done,

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,440
there was a curtain over the photographer.

63
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,280
No.

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
It was.

65
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,080
And it was the four.

66
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,720
That was doctor.

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
And then you had an arrow through your head.

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,320
Exactly.

69
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,160
And the bulb shattered when it went off.

70
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
Yeah.

72
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,680
Guts on your face.

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,560
That's a rough process back then.

74
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,720
No, but it was like film film.

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,440
Like I had to drive back to the location

76
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,400
to pick up the actual negatives from the photographer

77
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,440
and then go get them printed somewhere.

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,280
Right.

79
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,120
It was a whole thing.

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,640
And then it was not just an improviser you kind of knew.

81
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,680
No, he was like a photographer, a photographer.

82
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,920
He wasn't like an improviser.

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,600
It was like, oh shit, I gotta make some money.

84
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,200
Okay, let's buy a camera.

85
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,040
Okay.

86
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,640
Those, I mean, we won't name names,

87
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,240
but those are some fun headshots.

88
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,800
That people look like pancakes.

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,720
It's true.

90
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,320
No lighting, completely flat, paid only $300.

91
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,600
An improviser that looks like a pancake?

92
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,920
I don't believe it.

93
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,720
Listen, I'll tell you who it was,

94
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,000
but after the podcast.

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
Yeah.

96
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,480
Because that outs the photographer and the person.

97
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,320
Of course.

98
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,040
Not the first time that phrase will be said today.

99
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,880
I'm sure.

100
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,720
It's my favorite thing to say.

101
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,000
This way I don't have to email you and go,

102
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
could you cut this out?

103
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,040
Because that's usually what I have to do after every podcast.

104
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm editing as you go.

105
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm gonna just write as we go

106
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,920
who I think everyone you're talking about is

107
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,760
and then we'll match it up at the end.

108
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,520
Do some guesses, do some guesses.

109
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,040
And they'll see like what my score is.

110
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,880
Yeah.

111
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,720
Let's see if I can get 100%.

112
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,560
That's fun.

113
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Let's agree right now,

114
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,600
do we cut the inevitable Lasseter chunk

115
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,920
or do we just go into it and have fun with it?

116
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,760
Lasseter?

117
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,600
Lasseter you mean?

118
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,440
Oh, oh, oh I see.

119
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,280
Maybe it's not inevitable.

120
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,240
I just know like the ghost of Lasseter haunted.

121
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,080
This place.

122
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
Well so John Lasseter was the head of Pixar

123
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,880
and he was fired.

124
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,720
Do you know any of this?

125
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,760
No, I should have done my research.

126
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
No, it's okay.

127
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,640
He's really not.

128
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,880
He was like overseeing the parks

129
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,560
and he was overseeing Pixar.

130
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,520
And then he was essentially fired, let go,

131
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,440
because he would hug women too long

132
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,080
and he would like intimidate them

133
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,800
in like kind of a bizarre way

134
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,960
like during like meetings and stuff.

135
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,080
It sounds like that's the women's interpretation.

136
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,480
He seems like a pretty nice guy.

137
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
I mean.

138
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,760
Well of course that's what I thought.

139
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,800
It's all about intent, it's not how it's taken.

140
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,240
Okay, I just wanna put that out there.

141
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,680
I think the multi-year reign of fear

142
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,400
he instilled in multiple companies probably.

143
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,640
Probably put him over the edge.

144
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,480
Female companies.

145
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,520
There's also a story where like when he went to New York,

146
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,640
I don't think I have to cut this, but maybe I do.

147
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,600
He went to New York, you know this,

148
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,360
and he was like on some press junket

149
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,360
with all the women playing fairies, the Disney fairies.

150
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,480
They had to send a handler with him

151
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,680
because they were worried he was gonna drink too much

152
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,520
and get too handsy and weird

153
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,320
with the women who voiced the fairies.

154
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,120
How else do you hold a fairy but in your hand?

155
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,400
They're tiny.

156
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,600
They're incredibly hard to manage

157
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,760
if you don't use your hands.

158
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,600
I mean.

159
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,440
You're supposed to just rest on your shoulder.

160
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,600
Yeah, they're not trained.

161
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,280
They're wild, they're feral fairies.

162
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,400
This poor guy, I swear to God, men have it hard.

163
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,480
The high standard he's held to.

164
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,760
I can't anymore with the abusive men in his town.

165
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,600
Well, Aaron, don't worry.

166
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,200
He is working again in another animation studio.

167
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,840
How long do they have to disappear is what I'm asking.

168
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,440
How long is the break needed?

169
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,000
He had a tough four months.

170
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,960
Four months, that's a third of a year.

171
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,960
I know, and all he had was his winery and unlimited money.

172
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,480
His drunken semester.

173
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
His Oscars, his mini awards.

174
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,200
His closet full of a thousand Hawaiian shirts.

175
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,360
And his dick.

176
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,080
And his little dick.

177
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,560
His little dick.

178
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
I like that you said, do I have to cut this out?

179
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,840
How do you know these stories?

180
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
Do you know these from a friend of his?

181
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,160
No, no, this is on Hollywood Reporter.

182
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,400
Oh yeah, then this seems like it's fair game.

183
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,240
So it's out there.

184
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,080
It's out there.

185
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,000
But the little dick though, I don't know.

186
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,480
That could be Slander.

187
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,200
But all dicks are kind of little.

188
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,040
That's true.

189
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,520
We don't mean his specifically.

190
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,200
All dicks are kind of little.

191
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,920
Dicks not, it's not two feet wide.

192
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,760
No, that's true.

193
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,600
They're all pretty little.

194
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
God, I hope not.

195
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,120
All dicks, we all have little dicks

196
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,280
because dicks are little.

197
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
So don't sue us.

198
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Good save, Scott.

199
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,120
Yeah.

200
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,960
Never little enough.

201
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,400
Just in general, the body part is little.

202
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,240
That's all we're saying.

203
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,800
Yeah, that's true.

204
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,880
Can't argue with that.

205
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,440
Anyway, we just, I just.

206
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,160
She's got an expensive face over here.

207
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,560
Stroking his beard.

208
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,360
All men are gonna sue for Slander.

209
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,440
What do I wanna add to this?

210
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,080
Yeah, Erin, I haven't seen you in a little while.

211
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,920
It's been a while.

212
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,240
Has your dick gotten bigger?

213
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,080
No.

214
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,080
I was going to say, I'm trying to exercise,

215
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,800
restraint a little more in my older age than I do

216
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,640
when I was younger.

217
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,960
I know it's an intriguing development.

218
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,000
I feel like I've probably grown in areas too,

219
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,920
but I don't know what yet.

220
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
So as the podcast goes,

221
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
you and I will get to know each other again.

222
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,360
See where you're at today.

223
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,000
See what our respective therapist has been working on.

224
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,560
I left mine.

225
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,400
Oh, okay.

226
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,240
I'm freewheeling.

227
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,080
Fair, fair.

228
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,600
You're adrift.

229
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,960
The three of you were all on an improv team together?

230
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,240
Yeah, and it's been a while.

231
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,840
This is a reunion of sorts.

232
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,680
For real.

233
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,240
Who's been on the show who was on that team?

234
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,080
Anthony Geo.

235
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,920
Anthony Geo.

236
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,400
Percy Strickland.

237
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,240
Zach Reno.

238
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,080
Zach Reno.

239
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,920
We'll get everyone.

240
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
Everyone will.

241
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,600
Yeah.

242
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,920
Yeah.

243
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,840
It's like years already.

244
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,680
It's five years ago.

245
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,040
It's been six years.

246
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,680
But when did it, that it was over?

247
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
That it was over.

248
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,400
Unceremoniously taken off the night?

249
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,240
Yeah.

250
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,960
Yeah, oh, that's an development.

251
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,760
Now I will publicly talk about.

252
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm so sorry to our listeners

253
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,600
who are dealing with this improv talk.

254
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,360
I'm so sorry to listeners who have to listen to this,

255
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,120
but it took a few years for me to go like,

256
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,880
what a stupid fucking time.

257
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Like what a bad decisions people made.

258
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,800
It took you three years to say,

259
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,840
I feel like I remember you saying that the day it happened.

260
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
No, no, but like publicly.

261
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,680
Oh, publicly.

262
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,640
Well, we all had, we all were very good.

263
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,000
We were like, no one, no one fucking says anything

264
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,320
on social media no matter what happens.

265
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,720
And that was very smart of us, I feel.

266
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,440
We did not have the bitter or impassioned

267
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
goodbye to Harold Knight pose.

268
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
Like I loved, I do love them though.

269
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,640
I didn't realize Harold Times had come around this year

270
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,160
and I somehow caught in my feed a bunch of like

271
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,440
goodbye speeches and I'm like,

272
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,560
I didn't even know you were on Harold Knight,

273
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,800
but this is fantastic.

274
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,920
I love, I love the goodbyes.

275
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,040
Like leaving social media or saying goodbye to a celebrity

276
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,360
who you met once and can prove that you did with one photo.

277
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,680
Leaving Harold Knight's gotta be like a number three

278
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,600
in terms of monologue prompter.

279
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,080
Yeah, I think for a lot of great content.

280
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,680
Yeah, we didn't want to.

281
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,520
Fusive multi-part rants where you get the one and the slash

282
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,000
like it's getting with the question mark.

283
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,120
You don't know when it's gonna end.

284
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,120
Oh, for the Twitter, yeah, Twitter specifically, yes.

285
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
When it goes, there's 10 posts about what it means

286
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,920
to be on Harold Knight.

287
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,320
Oh God, Twitter's the worst place to do it

288
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,800
where you have to do like one of 16.

289
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
That's what he's saying.

290
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,480
Two of 16.

291
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,320
Yeah, yeah.

292
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,160
Good Lord.

293
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,240
It's a good multi-part prompt.

294
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,360
The Instagram ones though, no limit.

295
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,280
Oh sure, yeah, yeah, you can go and go.

296
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,120
A novel.

297
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,040
And if people click the dot dot dot,

298
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,280
they know what they're getting into.

299
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,840
And I, oh I click.

300
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,960
You always click.

301
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,280
Never not clicked on a dot dot dot.

302
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,400
What are these dots about?

303
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,640
I think we should post a teary farewell now.

304
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,680
Now would be good.

305
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,240
Six or seven years later.

306
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,880
Dead and loving it six years later.

307
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,040
The perspective we've gleaned from 10 paragraphs long.

308
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,280
That was the joke, that was the bit we did,

309
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,480
we would refer to it as dead and loving it.

310
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,160
But that was still for, that was years later.

311
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes.

312
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,840
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,560
Anyway, that's another cop podcast.

314
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,400
I'm sorry everyone.

315
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,640
So you all spent the last six years then

316
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,480
just going to the Carthage Circle Lounge

317
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,760
and drinking yourselves into a Sierra.

318
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,960
We did do that for a while.

319
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,680
It was very cathartic that we.

320
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,400
It was cathartic at Carthay.

321
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,440
No, it's not the same word.

322
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,400
That does work though.

323
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,600
There's a way though.

324
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,440
Cathartake.

325
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,280
That must be why.

326
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,120
It was cathartake.

327
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,960
It was cathartake.

328
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,800
Cathartake.

329
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Cathartake.

330
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,880
Carthy take.

331
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,320
Carthy take.

332
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,520
Yeah, so we would just, yeah,

333
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,080
we would just drink for years to get over the pain of it.

334
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,200
And it was a great place because you could say,

335
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,840
as I have my problem of saying first and last names

336
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,240
too loudly in public spaces,

337
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,560
there was no one who would have overheard us who would care.

338
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,240
Like, it wasn't like when I would accidentally

339
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,920
do it in Silver Lake and be like.

340
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,760
Accidentally.

341
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,600
I gotta stop.

342
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,440
Accidentally.

343
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,280
Accidentally.

344
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,680
The only people you can insult at the Carthay Lounge

345
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,680
are Joe Roady and who's another Imagineer of it.

346
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,960
Scott Trowbridge.

347
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,480
Yeah, just don't go talking shit on Scott Trowbridge.

348
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,880
Yeah, I wouldn't want the Floridian tourists

349
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,960
to overhear that.

350
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,800
No.

351
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Oh, my ears.

352
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Yeah, so yeah, we would go hang out here.

353
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,080
Did we talk about what we're doing yet?

354
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,920
No.

355
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,760
Well, it was probably at the, I mean,

356
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,600
we intro'd it.

357
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,160
The teaser that we have yet to do,

358
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,520
but that's, you know, and it's in the title, presumably.

359
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,360
I forgot how the show works.

360
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
But you handed with the spherical eyes, I mean.

361
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,280
How many places can you get spherical eyes?

362
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,760
I mean, people know what they're getting into,

363
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,720
but there is a clarification we have to make,

364
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,080
which is that we're talking about the lounge,

365
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,480
not the restaurant, correct?

366
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,120
So today we're talking about Carthy Circle Lounge,

367
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,400
not the restaurant.

368
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,240
I mean, we can talk about it,

369
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,680
it's just that that's not the topic.

370
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,520
Right.

371
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,800
It'll maybe.

372
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,080
Look, we're all about microtopic divisions.

373
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,920
I don't like rules.

374
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,760
I don't like, I don't want boundaries.

375
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
It's weird.

376
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,080
That doesn't sound.

377
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,920
I walk through the restaurant

378
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,400
and if I want to talk about what it looks like,

379
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,480
I think I should, I will.

380
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,120
And the bathrooms, I love the bathrooms.

381
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,480
That's fine, but we might glare at you

382
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,800
while there might be a lot of judgment.

383
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,400
I can take a glare.

384
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,640
I don't know, have you seen our glares?

385
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,480
A lot of judgment in our glares.

386
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,240
Our glares, although our glares are like,

387
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,360
we dart our eyes away a lot.

388
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,200
Absolutely.

389
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Like your dog, it's more of fear.

390
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
Yeah.

391
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,880
Yeah.

392
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,720
Yeah.

393
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,600
Share a lot of traits with Edwin.

394
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,520
But why did this, did this rule come up

395
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,840
because are you just more versed in the lounge?

396
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,920
Well, when Mike and I were emailing about it,

397
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,600
I said, just an FYI, like I would love to talk about this

398
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,880
because it is one of my very favorite places in the park,

399
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,160
but I have not actually eaten dinner there

400
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,360
because you have to have a reservation

401
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,640
and we never planned that far ahead.

402
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,480
That's right.

403
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,720
You gotta look pretty far.

404
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,640
Probably pretty far.

405
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,560
Unless there's like a little last minute free up.

406
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,400
So yeah.

407
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,000
And all I really want is three big Manhattans.

408
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
Hell yeah.

409
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,320
Fucking yeah.

410
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,480
Well, let's see, if we're going toe to toe,

411
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,640
I don't think I could handle three.

412
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,520
I'm like.

413
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,720
We only did three a couple of times, but it was great.

414
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,720
I would love to, I think I'd be a total fucking mess.

415
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,040
As much as I'm defined as the drunk of the show,

416
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,720
I don't like, more than two I cannot handle.

417
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,160
I think I've only, have we done, did we do three once?

418
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,880
Maybe two, but I feel like there was a time

419
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,320
where we just were like, yeah, why not?

420
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,960
I mean, cause our conversations,

421
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,360
I don't know if we're getting into this at this point,

422
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,200
but like.

423
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,040
We can go with whatever.

424
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,080
We would fucking get into it.

425
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,560
I loved those conversations.

426
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,280
It was my favorite conversations, maybe ever.

427
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,120
Wow.

428
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,960
Was the Carthay Lounge talks.

429
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,800
I was not there for these, what you're describing,

430
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,560
but I know what you're talking about.

431
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,400
This is a place where you get in.

432
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,920
You had alcohol and hadn't talked before.

433
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,760
Yes.

434
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,600
But your sense was.

435
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,760
But you're essentially drinking.

436
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,040
But specifically this lounge.

437
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,440
Yeah, I think I've had like big old deep bonding moments

438
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,760
at Carthay, and I think there's something about

439
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,880
the Manhattans that get it out of you too.

440
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,320
And that's where a coping drink for me

441
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,920
a couple years back when I was going through bad shit.

442
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,800
Like, there's something about, I don't know,

443
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,680
it's like the super sugary nature of it.

444
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,360
It just like loosens the brain up.

445
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,280
Well, it's such a treat too.

446
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,120
It's like a really, like you're paying so much money

447
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,560
for this really delicious, well-crafted cocktail.

448
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,400
Like it's.

449
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
And it's not like doing shots

450
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,960
where you just wanna get the alcohol in.

451
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,800
It's like a.

452
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,360
There's a ritual with it.

453
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,280
It's a ritual.

454
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,760
They make them very well there.

455
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,040
It's also like, whenever we would go,

456
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,360
we would do the park all day.

457
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,120
It's like you've been standing in lines.

458
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,680
You've been small talking in the lines.

459
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,000
You're in like little kid mode.

460
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,240
And then you have that hit the wall moment

461
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,080
where you're like, we might need to go home.

462
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,120
And instead, we go to Carthay.

463
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,960
Come back to me.

464
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,360
I do remember maybe the first time you went with us.

465
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,520
And I do remember you being like, I'm real tight.

466
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,360
I'm like, I'm ready.

467
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,840
And then we went to Carthay and we came out.

468
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,760
And you come out of Carthay, it's like you've been born again.

469
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,600
Oh my God, born again.

470
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,320
It's like you started the park all over.

471
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,880
This is where going to Disneyland as a kid

472
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,400
and as an adult changes.

473
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,240
Yes.

474
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,640
And it's a big, when I talk to other people about like,

475
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,000
there's a lot of people that still go like,

476
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,840
why do you wanna go?

477
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,720
Who cares about it?

478
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,560
Why do you wanna go to Disneyland so much?

479
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,400
I'm tired of that attitude.

480
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,480
I get. 100%.

481
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,160
There's two things that people are making fun of a lot

482
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,000
these days.

483
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,520
It's the people who go to Disneyland as adults

484
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,640
and then girls who are into horses.

485
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
And I'm like, so you've heard a joke 40 times

486
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,000
and now you think it's free reign to act

487
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,480
as if you made the joke up?

488
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,400
It's the most annoying.

489
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,120
It's like the Twitter thing where someone's like,

490
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm not gonna make that joke.

491
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,400
I've seen it twice, but now that I've seen it 500 times,

492
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,240
I'll make it.

493
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,680
Yeah, it's like cop shows or procedural shows on TV too.

494
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,480
It's the same thing where it's like,

495
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,600
once there's a couple versions of something

496
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,440
that everyone does it.

497
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,280
Now they'll just do it.

498
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,680
I think I threw up my mouth a little line.

499
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,440
Suddenly that joke is just free reign.

500
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,760
It's like it became public domain joke or something.

501
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,720
That's not even a thing.

502
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,560
Is that even a thing?

503
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,680
I can hear you.

504
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,520
Yeah.

505
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,800
That's just it.

506
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,400
We're just trashing all our friends

507
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,200
who have actual writing jobs right now.

508
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
Yeah, they've all used that hacking shit.

509
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,960
That's fine.

510
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,780
They got paid for it.

511
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,620
They don't care.

512
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,460
Yeah, it's fine.

513
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,280
Yeah, for them it is a job.

514
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,760
I mean, they would like to go home.

515
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,600
Yeah, for me it's home.

516
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,920
At some point you just, yeah.

517
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,120
Do you know how many, if Jason had a staff writing job,

518
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
how many of those he would use every day?

519
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,840
All of them, every day.

520
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,920
I mean, depending on the show,

521
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,400
if it's a network show, they're gonna be like,

522
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,800
yeah, that's good, that's great.

523
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,080
This Jason knows what he's doing.

524
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,200
It's possible that the head of NBC is asking for really,

525
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,880
and is that a thing?

526
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,520
Oh yeah, well they may be replacing better jokes.

527
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,360
Yeah, sure.

528
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,280
Yeah, for sure.

529
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,680
I could see a persnickety actor on set going,

530
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,720
this is too, I can't score with this.

531
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,640
I need something that'll get me to score.

532
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,000
Is that a thing?

533
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,440
Oh, I just saw that in a trailer recently.

534
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,280
Yeah.

535
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,100
Let's do that.

536
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,720
Or they improvised it.

537
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,560
Yeah.

538
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,400
They improvised a real funny line.

539
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,440
I bet that's where a lot of the is that a thing comes from.

540
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,880
I'm sure, because it feels like such a bad acting improv

541
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,440
thing, like when they ask actors to improvise

542
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,400
and what they do is they get flatter and flatter in tone

543
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,960
as they go back and forth and the sentences

544
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,480
get shorter and shorter.

545
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,120
Like, yeah, it is my desk chair, is it?

546
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,920
It is, chair, yeah.

547
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,320
Office, cool.

548
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,560
Duh.

549
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,800
Okay.

550
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,320
Or the thing that I love, this is very like,

551
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,840
again, one of those that was fine when it began,

552
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,120
the first few on the office of,

553
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,200
you know, so Jan is coming in today

554
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,920
and so Michael's pretty on edge

555
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,840
and so he's making everybody wear these costumes.

556
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,080
So that's, and then they don't finish the sentence?

557
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,760
But I feel like the office is what started it

558
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,080
and they did it in a way that actually

559
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,960
was like a person who didn't know how to finish

560
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,040
their sentence.

561
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,960
Yes, yeah, yeah.

562
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,800
And then people did the pale imitation of that,

563
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,400
which was, it sounds cool if I don't finish my sentence.

564
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,720
Like there is no intent behind it.

565
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,560
Where it's done because the person could not actually

566
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
think of an ending to that.

567
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,000
So the trail off is the ending.

568
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,640
And it was just like, this is the formula.

569
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,600
I didn't know, that's where I, like,

571
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,520
I'm not holding that against the office.

572
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,040
I think that's more like the many sub iterations

573
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,640
of office since then.

574
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,480
Yeah.

575
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,640
It's like on Snickers commercials now.

576
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,400
It's like the commercials always catch a blast,

577
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
usually, to the trend as well.

578
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes.

579
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,200
So like whatever was on the office 10 years ago now,

580
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,400
the execs are like, whoa, these fresh jokes.

581
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,760
Where did these come from?

582
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,280
I mean, the Sonic ads are essentially the office in a car.

583
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,520
Yeah, well those have been on for longer than the office.

584
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,360
Have they?

585
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,200
I think.

586
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
Oh my God, the office ripped off Sonic ads

587
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,480
is what you're saying, Mike.

588
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,120
I mean, yeah, I guess they probably ripped off

589
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,360
the British office if we're talking about the American one.

590
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,440
Did they rip off the British Sonic ads?

591
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,280
Were the British?

592
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,120
Yeah.

593
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,080
They were drier, it was just more clever.

594
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,360
I love Tater Tots.

595
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,200
Yeah, they were.

596
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,400
I love to get a route 69 with my Tater Tots.

597
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,080
Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry in the car

598
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,920
on Sonic commercials.

599
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,760
Can you imagine?

600
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,640
They were very young.

601
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,920
The first few British Sonic ads

602
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,040
are a little rough to get through,

603
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,880
and I even had to watch them with subtitles

604
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,800
because they're so British, so dry.

605
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,120
But it picks up and they end up being

606
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,560
the greatest set of commercials you ever seen.

607
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,600
How do we get talking about this?

608
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,160
This got to, well we're always waiting

609
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,200
around any turn of these complaints.

610
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,280
We're all happy to talk about this.

611
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,560
You were talking about the hackiness

612
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,160
of the adults at Disneyland.

613
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,000
The joke.

614
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,840
Stole the vanes.

615
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,680
Oh yeah, he interrupted you is what happened.

616
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,200
No, I don't remember that.

617
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,280
Well, I think the, yeah, I was thinking the car

618
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,760
is one of those things where, yes,

619
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,920
when you encounter people, like,

620
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,400
you're going to Disneyland again?

621
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,680
So you go to Disneyland?

622
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,400
What, like, are you a child molester?

623
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,160
What's up with, like, in the rare case

624
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,880
that you encounter that judgment from people,

625
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,320
you go, oh yeah, why would you want to go to a place,

626
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,240
have wonderful drinks, bond with your friends,

627
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,440
then go on a crazy mechanical marvel,

628
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,000
and then, like, I don't, I can't get my head around

629
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,680
why you wouldn't want to.

630
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,520
Right.

631
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,960
That also, that leap that people make

632
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,400
where it's like, you're going to Disneyland?

633
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
What do you do, fuck kids?

634
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,320
You weirdo.

635
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,120
It's like, whoa, whoa, buddy.

636
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,720
I guess the questions I get are somewhat different.

637
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,560
What's that?

638
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,600
No one's ever asked if I was gonna molest kids.

639
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,280
Yeah, I have to admit,

640
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,400
I've never had that moment specifically.

641
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
But you know, we had it.

642
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,520
Oh, I thought it was more like,

643
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
you're just a sad child person.

644
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,360
Like, you're a sad.

645
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,320
But we're all sad child people.

646
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,800
It means that you're locked in perennial child state,

647
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
and that's all that it could possibly mean.

648
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,640
It can't mean, like, I like going to really good bars

649
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,480
and eating good food and having a good time with friends.

650
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,560
But I feel like a lot of the complaints too

651
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,640
also come from, like, it's like, well, what do you do, man?

652
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,480
What do you do?

653
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,160
Do you go to the same, like, six dog shit places

654
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,600
in Silver Lake all the time and burn money there?

655
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,040
But I will say, I get the confusion

656
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,920
because when I went with you guys,

657
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,840
I really was like, I don't know how you go so often.

658
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,480
Like, I truly could not wrap my mind around it

659
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,800
because I hadn't been since I was a kid,

660
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,560
and I did remember it being really fun,

661
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,720
but mostly a super tiring day.

662
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
And as an adult too, I do get to a point where I'm like,

663
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,880
I do want to sit around and talk.

664
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,440
I'm kind of tired of, like, standing in lines a little bit.

665
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,600
And like, so when we did it, that's when I was like,

666
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,080
oh, you take a siesta, you get your, like,

667
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,640
deep, great conversations,

668
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,520
and you have actually good drinks.

669
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,240
It's not like, and also they didn't have this

670
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,060
when we were kids.

671
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,080
Like, Disneyland did used to be like,

672
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,820
you couldn't go into a great bar or get good food.

673
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,760
You were getting, like, a mouse burger.

674
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,600
Like, that was as good as it got.

675
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,680
I don't know what the drinking situation was

676
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,960
in the 80s and 90s, but I bet it was a little more

677
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,240
wine cooler.

678
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,840
At the hotel, it was at the, maybe at the hotel.

679
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,120
Oh, but you have to go all the way to the hotel

680
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,880
because there was no Disney California.

681
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

682
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,200
And there was no bars, and there's still no bars.

683
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,400
I mean, I haven't been to Star Wars, so.

684
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,240
But there was nowhere you would drink.

685
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,120
I mean, also I was eight, so I wasn't worried about it.

686
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,960
But.

687
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,560
What was it like Epcot?

688
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,760
Could you always drink an Epcot?

689
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,840
Well, that's Florida though.

690
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Yeah, I think so.

691
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,240
I think an Epcot you could always drink,

692
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,280
but yeah, out here.

693
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,160
But I bet it wasn't good drinks yet.

694
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,920
I don't think, like, quality cocktails came to Disney.

695
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,520
Half cocktails wasn't even a thing.

696
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,840
Like it was, because. Anywhere.

697
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,480
Like our parents didn't drink cocktails.

698
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,880
That was the beer wine generation.

699
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,680
Like our generation is the one that brought back cocktails

700
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,360
from whatever the 60s.

701
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,440
From Jason's generation.

702
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,720
From Jason's generation, yeah, yeah.

703
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,600
From me and. From Madison Avenue.

704
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,960
From Madison Avenue.

705
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,800
It was pure white Russians.

706
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,320
From Bill Frawley days.

707
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,320
Let's drink like Bill Frawley again.

708
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,840
Yeah, since right into the grave.

709
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,400
He could handle 16 Manhattans.

710
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,240
For sure.

711
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,560
He would do it every day.

712
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,760
Erin, you spent some of your childhood

713
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
growing up in Southern California.

714
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,200
Yeah, Alta Dena.

715
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,520
Yeah.

716
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,720
So did you guys go to the parks regularly?

717
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,560
Or.

718
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,400
Yeah, we went to Disney.

719
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,560
My mom would sometimes like take us out of school

720
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,640
so we could go on a weekday and not do the weekend crowds.

721
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,480
Oh, sure.

722
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,720
And she would let each of us invite a friend.

723
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,800
Wow. I know.

724
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,920
So you would get friends out of school too.

725
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,040
We get friends out of school.

726
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,880
So we would do that.

727
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,960
And I remember once she took just me and my sister.

728
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,000
It was from a sister's birthday, I think.

729
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,800
And she had, this is when the rules

730
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,000
of the park were very different.

731
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,320
And so she had had like a little cotton duffel bag

732
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,840
and she'd packed our lunches and packed cupcakes

733
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,800
because it's like single mom bringing two kids.

734
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,280
It's like very expensive to buy food all day.

735
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,120
Of course, yeah.

736
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,880
They would not, they searched her bag

737
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,320
and wouldn't let her bring the food into the park

738
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,840
and threw all of it out.

739
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,320
Which now they can't do.

740
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,600
Now I'm sure it's like there's enough like diabetics

741
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,800
and people with food allergies and whatnot

742
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,640
that you can't do that.

743
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,800
But at the time they threw all her like homemade food out.

744
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,520
She somehow managed to like hide the cupcakes

745
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,800
and we had the cupcakes, but like it was very,

746
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,560
she was like, I remember her like being very upset about it.

747
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,280
Which you would when you have like two little kids in tow

748
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,360
and suddenly you're gonna be buying

749
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,280
like multiple snacks and lunch.

750
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,880
And yeah.

751
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,400
Do you remember why they did that?

752
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,000
You weren't allowed to bring food into the park.

753
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,400
Huh, I wonder, did that change at a certain point?

754
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,920
Well, I know at a certain point

755
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
you could bring food in,

756
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,280
but they ushered you over to the picnic area

757
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,320
was it just like a concrete slab with no shade.

758
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,960
Like it was this like crazy place

759
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
and you could not eat anywhere else in the park.

760
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,480
And now it's like you can bring anything in.

761
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,320
Right, right.

762
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,160
Yeah, food wise.

763
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,200
Yeah, I always bring a Clif Bar or some nuts or something

764
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,800
just cause like when you start to hit that wall.

765
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,600
Yeah, well I haven't been in a while,

766
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,960
but now I'm on like a crazy diet.

767
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,240
So I would have to bring everything I've ate into the park.

768
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Oh wow, really?

769
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,560
And Mouse Burger is not on the diet?

770
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,480
I wish Mouse Burger's on the diet.

771
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,360
I love a Mouse Burger.

772
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,200
They're fun.

773
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
They don't have, but they never had a thing

774
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
that is like Mickey shaped and the bun and the patty

775
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,280
are both.

776
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,600
It's shocking that they didn't.

777
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,480
It is.

778
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,000
The Mouse Burgers as I recall

779
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,040
were just burgers called Mouse Burgers.

780
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,880
Yeah, probably.

781
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,200
And maybe made out of rodent, who knows.

782
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,520
Magic dogs.

783
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,240
Yeah, they may have had a little piece of mouse in them.

784
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,080
There was a, yeah.

785
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,160
Probably inadvertently had some mice parts, but.

786
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,680
They fell into the fryer.

787
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,520
Yeah.

788
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,600
My memory as a kid was a lot of burgers and pizza.

789
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,160
And I just remember my parents being so happy.

790
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,680
Like two days where we had dinner or lunch reservations

791
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,040
of like, thank God we don't have to have a burger

792
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,880
or pizza today.

793
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,720
Right, right.

794
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
And then when I first started,

795
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,560
first came out here like 12, 13 years ago,

796
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,400
I was so impressed by the variety of food

797
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,520
at Disneyland and stuff.

798
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,040
But whenever I tell someone that,

799
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,000
it's like, yeah, mid 2000s is when

800
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,680
the food started to get good.

801
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,520
It was not good before that.

802
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,360
It was never before.

803
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,480
It was really like, you were very limited

804
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,480
to all the fantasy land type little spots,

805
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,680
which were like, as a kid, it's like amazing.

806
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,120
Like you go in and it looks like you're in an old,

807
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,040
you know, Snow White type place.

808
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,320
And like, it's so cool, but the food really was

809
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,160
pretty gross.

810
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,000
Yes.

811
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,680
The basic standard issue,

812
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,560
Disneyland fries remain so shitty.

813
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,680
Yes, that's true.

814
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,880
Unless you're at like a higher end place.

815
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
But like a normal.

816
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,960
Oh goody, yeah, good fries at a lamp light.

817
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,080
Are these what were Freedom Fries for a while?

818
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,480
Did they do Freedom Fries?

819
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,320
They did Freedom Fries.

820
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,160
Disney called them Freedom Fries?

821
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,280
Disney called them Freedom Fries.

822
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,320
I remember because when it happened,

823
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,160
my mom was like, so, it was just insanity.

824
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,480
This is the Bush Jr. era.

825
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,560
Yeah.

826
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,800
They did it?

827
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,720
Even though they had a French park.

828
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,960
This SoCal Disneyland Freedom Fries.

829
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,720
I mean, it was the little like stands

830
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,680
where you would get the fries, but that's all Disney.

831
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
They had, well, and that was around the time

832
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,920
when they had, I think McDonald's still in the park.

833
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,840
They would have like a big McDonald's fry.

834
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,680
I don't remember.

835
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,520
Yeah.

836
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,340
So I'm sure they had variety,

837
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,920
different variety of fries in the park.

838
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,400
They renamed Lumiere Freedom Candle.

839
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,480
Ha ha ha ha.

840
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,960
Rejected his voice.

841
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,880
Yeah, but he had like Toby Keith's voice.

842
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,600
Freedom Candle, what's up?

843
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,440
What's good?

844
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,760
Hello, Bell.

845
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,160
Good to meet ya.

846
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,720
Hey Beast, let's roll.

847
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,280
The name's Loomer.

848
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,880
Loomer the Freedom Candle.

849
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
Here's a song.

850
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,440
Red, white, and blue flames.

851
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
Yeah.

852
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,600
Be Our Guest is a country jam now.

853
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,160
It's called Be Our Guest parentheses, come on in.

854
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,000
Be our guest, come on in.

855
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,480
Big and Rich provided the,

856
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,120
who was voiced by both Big and Rich at the same time.

857
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,520
They combined their voices.

858
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,360
The haunting echo.

859
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,000
They had to speak at exactly the same clip.

860
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,120
It was better though.

861
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,960
Yeah.

862
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,800
It was a good time.

863
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,040
But here in 2019, yes, we have a wonderful,

864
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,200
but I'm glad you feel the same way.

865
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,600
And I think this, you could almost just,

866
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,520
this could have been the episode about

867
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,360
the Carthay Manhattan specifically,

868
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,240
which I feel like we're probably in agreement.

869
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,360
Well, I don't know, it's up for debate whether,

870
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,720
I would call that the best theme park beverage,

871
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,120
alcoholic beverage.

872
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,960
Yeah, I would.

873
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,560
Adult libations as our theme park.

874
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,560
As every other theme park podcast.

875
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,440
Do you know what this,

876
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,560
we're the only theme park podcast that will just say,

877
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,080
drinks, you get drunk, you get drunk with drinks.

878
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,520
Every other theme park podcast,

879
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,600
like we've had a couple of adult libations,

880
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,880
let's just say.

881
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,640
They won't say alcohol on their.

882
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,320
They won't say the word alcohol.

883
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,840
As if there's children listening to their adults

884
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,960
talking about, seriously about podcast.

885
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,200
The many seven year olds hearing updates

886
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,880
about like the Saratoga Springs Hotel renovation.

887
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,040
But I think it's similar to the comedy thing

888
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,800
where like one person did it

889
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,240
and then it just became ubiquitous.

890
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,640
It was like a stone rolling down a hill,

891
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,760
just picking up moss.

892
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,600
Oh yeah, probably.

893
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,520
It does seem like an ingrained kind of,

894
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,960
we're good boys type of comedy.

895
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,800
Yeah.

896
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,620
Yeah.

897
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,180
But don't go insulting being a good boy.

898
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,020
This is a phrase we have owned.

899
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,860
The phrase, yeah.

900
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,740
The listeners call us that.

901
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,620
Oh, I did not realize.

902
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,460
That's okay.

903
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,300
Before the movie.

904
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,140
This was before the movie.

905
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,780
I didn't know there was a movie.

906
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,060
In my mind I was thinking about like,

907
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,740
I feel like guys who were raised Christian specifically

908
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,180
but then aren't anymore but then still have the guilt.

909
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,420
So I'm basically describing you.

910
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,260
Yep, that's it.

911
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,100
I'm curious.

912
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,700
Guys who wear jeans with little athletic socks.

913
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,940
Really cheap Hanes.

914
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,700
But it feels like I can do bad adult things.

915
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,620
I just won't say the words mommy.

916
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,740
Sure, yes.

917
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,340
I did a thing with a girl with my thing

918
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,980
or I put it in her thing.

919
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,820
Mommy.

920
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,660
Mommy.

921
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,260
I'll say fucking and drinking.

922
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,380
I'll say them all day.

923
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,180
And then they whip themselves when they get home.

924
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,020
Yes.

925
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,180
We are the, we're very good boys

926
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,660
but we are the baddest boys in Theme Park Podcasts.

927
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,500
Yeah.

928
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,660
People who willingly call themselves good boys

929
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,180
who've embraced that title are still the baddest boys.

930
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,020
Yeah.

931
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,300
We're squeaky clean by comedy podcast standards

932
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,060
and disgusting by theme park standards.

933
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,060
Yeah, it's good to know in what context

934
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,340
you're being considered.

935
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,180
Yeah.

936
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,020
Now I understand you.

937
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,980
Gotta know your angles.

938
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
Our buddy Doug Barnes on the season pass

939
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,740
has been very nice and was plugging us a couple times

940
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,580
but he'd always be like,

941
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,420
now there's gonna be some language on their show.

942
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,260
Some language.

943
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,100
Yeah, so like it's just.

944
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,300
They do get a little foul but so still.

945
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,060
Even the fact, that's one of my favorite things

946
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,980
is when people can't even bring themselves to say swearing.

947
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,140
Like even swearing feels like it's referring

948
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,220
too closely to bad words so it's language.

949
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,060
Yes.

950
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,900
You do the work.

951
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,740
Yes.

952
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,900
I'm putting it in your head.

953
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,500
And like when we started it, someone warned us,

954
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,820
it's like hey, just because the podcast,

955
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,020
we're gonna mark it explicit

956
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,700
because if we don't, even if you curse once or twice,

957
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,140
iTunes will flag it if it's not marked explicit.

958
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,260
Some people see that E.

959
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,100
Oh.

960
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,940
Yeah.

961
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,140
The mega theme park fans see that E and get a little alarmed.

962
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,420
I never knew what that E was for and I never questioned it.

963
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,260
Yeah.

964
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,780
I thought it was excellent.

965
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,620
Thank you.

966
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,700
That's how I view it.

967
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,380
There was an early on, I feel like we had a podcast review

968
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,180
that said like, if you could cool it on the language,

969
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,260
I would recommend it to my mom.

970
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,860
I feel like there was something along the lines of that.

971
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,700
Yeah.

972
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,220
What mother fucker said that?

973
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,020
We'll never know.

974
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,540
Shit head bitch.

975
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,580
This is I've ever.

976
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,140
Too far Scott.

977
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,860
Erin is allowed to say that but not you.

978
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,700
You're one of us.

979
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,020
Shit head bitch.

980
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,860
I'm canceled.

981
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,140
It sounds like something someone full of rage spits out

982
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,740
when they lose their mind.

983
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,700
Shit head bitch.

984
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,900
Like you were in a car and you came from the office

985
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,500
and you had your meltdown that day.

986
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,620
Well, keep in mind, as you correctly assessed,

987
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,260
I was raised Christian.

988
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,660
So the rage is always exploding and deeply, deeply shut down.

989
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,980
Have I talked on the podcast before about how my sister

990
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,100
didn't understand how swearing worked?

991
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,060
Was like, so like, if I already use a swear word,

992
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,780
it's a big deal but so much more Christian than I

993
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,500
that she truly didn't even know what the words meant.

994
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,100
And things hit, came to a boiling point once and she went,

995
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,860
well bitch, all right.

996
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,500
Like as if bitch was shit.

997
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,340
Oh my God.

998
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,180
That's so funny.

999
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,380
Bitch you.

1000
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,660
Like she had had them so deeply repressed

1001
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,140
that it was just a pool of words without actual meaning.

1002
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,860
She never heard an example of how one is used.

1003
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,780
That's very funny.

1004
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1005
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,540
I will never forget.

1006
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,380
What the fuck.

1007
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,220
Bitch, all right.

1008
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,980
I won't use the, I won't say SHB about my sister.

1009
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,060
That's for sure.

1010
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,900
Of course.

1011
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,140
Now I'm self-censoring.

1012
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,980
Right, right.

1013
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,780
To her credit though, that is the fun thing about any

1014
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,220
swear word is that like you can use it incorrectly

1015
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,020
and people just go, yeah, okay.

1016
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,420
Like if I called you a fuck.

1017
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,940
Suddenly that's fine.

1018
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,380
And my heart going, well bitch, suddenly I'm like,

1019
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,460
I don't know, I'll buy it.

1020
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,100
I find, I feel like if you have the anger behind it,

1021
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,060
it works.

1022
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,220
I don't know how anyone is like eloquently profane

1023
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,780
because I think if I truly hit a rage,

1024
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,780
but you're right, the shit head bitch is a perfect example.

1025
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,620
Yeah, I'm never eloquent.

1026
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,300
You sounded pretty stupid.

1027
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,940
One of my favorite things is when I'm driving

1028
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,900
is to hear the things that come out of my mouth

1029
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,220
because I'm like, my brain is like still focused enough

1030
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,220
on the driving, but then the rage comes up

1031
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,060
and like it's none of it makes sense.

1032
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,860
Like I can't even, I don't even know if I can like

1033
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,540
approximate one because I'm always like,

1034
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,380
I hear it and I'm like, wow, that was,

1035
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,580
I'm always like, you, funt, cock, liquor.

1036
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,580
And I'm like, oh, you got the words wrong.

1037
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,300
You crap farter.

1038
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,820
That makes sense.

1039
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,980
Yeah, it's very hard to not make sense on purpose.

1040
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,580
Yeah.

1041
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,740
So we were talking about the drinks being the best

1042
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,500
and I agree that Manhattan is the best

1043
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,740
of the ones I've had.

1044
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,500
Lindsay, K-tie.

1045
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,420
She likes the gin and tonic.

1046
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,540
She loves the dill gin and tonic and is obsessed with it.

1047
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,060
And it's so obsessed with it,

1048
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,580
she has the ingredients to make it here.

1049
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,860
Yeah, but it does look really good.

1050
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,980
I'm not a big gin and tonic fan,

1051
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,060
but I do like the herbal twist that they put on it,

1052
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,900
literally.

1053
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,860
That is what stops me.

1054
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,820
I would like to try that, especially given

1055
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,700
how much she digs it, but I'm there.

1056
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,740
I can't not have the Manhattan.

1057
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,780
It is hard.

1058
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,620
Yeah, it is hard.

1059
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,740
If you're there, you want the best one.

1060
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,980
I should try it at home.

1061
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,460
And you leave your ice sphere in your drink?

1062
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,580
Oh, of course I do.

1063
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,220
I'm a big sphere fan.

1064
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,620
And in fact, I've been doing the spheres at home.

1065
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,060
He bought a sphere maker.

1066
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,100
I bought sphere and we did a little

1067
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,420
Carthay Manhattan night.

1068
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,260
Wow.

1069
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,100
Yes.

1070
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,940
We had to like,

1071
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,940
I got four little plastic sphere makers that are not,

1072
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,900
you're not getting the quality of the sphere

1073
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,780
that you'd be getting at the Carthay Lounge at home

1074
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,500
because it's not clear.

1075
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,100
That's I think a very hard thing to do is get clear ice.

1076
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,340
It requires like science.

1077
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,020
But I had four little plastic guys to make spheres.

1078
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,020
And just for weeks ahead of time,

1079
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,180
we were like making them, taking them out of the mall,

1080
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,780
like building a stockpile of spheres,

1081
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,300
which we had in our fridge for a while.

1082
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,740
Like very dangerous snowballs.

1083
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1084
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,060
I could have, if you guys came over,

1085
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,100
I could have killed you that night.

1086
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,220
Yeah, that's true.

1087
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,940
My issue with them is like,

1088
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,340
so the Manhattan is not a drink

1089
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,940
that's supposed to be served on the rocks.

1090
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,380
And so I've seen this criticism in preparing for this.

1091
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,180
Okay, all right, you've seen this.

1092
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,020
I get it.

1093
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,860
No, no.

1094
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,700
I'm not saying.

1095
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,300
One of them I said that you can add, I've seen that.

1096
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,140
Sorry.

1097
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,980
I love to know.

1098
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,820
There's a lot of people think that, yes.

1099
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,660
I love to know.

1100
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,500
Sorry, I missed that.

1101
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,380
You're saying Manhattan is not,

1102
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,620
is served on the rocks or not?

1103
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,260
No, it's not a drink that's served on the rocks.

1104
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,180
Oh, an old fashioned is served on the rocks.

1105
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,020
Yeah, okay.

1106
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,540
And so I've certainly like,

1107
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,380
occasionally if you're in a bad bar,

1108
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,260
they'll serve it on the rock, but that's wrong.

1109
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,220
It's not supposed to be.

1110
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,180
It's served up.

1111
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,020
It's served up.

1112
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,840
Yeah.

1113
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,220
And it's stirred, not shaken.

1114
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,060
Not shaken.

1115
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,780
When they shake it, I once heard myself,

1116
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,980
this is again, like the driving,

1117
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,860
I was at a bar and I ordered a Manhattan.

1118
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,100
He didn't serve it on the rocks, but he shook it.

1119
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,380
And I went, and he goes, are you okay?

1120
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,980
And I was like, yeah, I'm fine.

1121
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,060
I was like, why would you do that?

1122
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,740
Why would you shake?

1123
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,180
It's this guy that has a foam on it

1124
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,780
and it tastes totally different.

1125
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,100
It's so weird to me.

1126
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,100
That's why the shake and not stir,

1127
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,660
James Bond's martini is watering down the alcohol.

1128
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,380
But some drinks you are supposed to shake.

1129
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,220
Some drinks you are.

1130
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,300
But I would think a martini would be another

1131
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,420
that you wouldn't, I don't know.

1132
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,900
No, you're not really supposed to.

1133
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,460
So James Bond was important.

1134
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,300
Yeah.

1135
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,180
That's true.

1136
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,940
It's showing his true classlessness.

1137
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,780
Sure.

1138
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,980
That's probably what you might think.

1139
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,140
When you take this Vira,

1140
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,980
were you doing it because of tradition?

1141
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,980
No, because I don't like, to me,

1142
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,540
I don't like ice in any drink because it waters it down.

1143
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,540
Right, right.

1144
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,060
So it's like slowly as it melts,

1145
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,420
makes the drink more and more diluted

1146
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,940
and it takes away the, I don't like that.

1147
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,420
So I take it out immediately so it's cold,

1148
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,660
but not gonna dilute my drink.

1149
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,340
And then you put it in your pocket to throw it.

1150
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,180
And I put it in my pocket.

1151
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,020
A child later.

1152
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,220
Or a mascot or a beefier Pluto

1153
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,700
you meet outside the restaurant.

1154
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,420
Your least favorite Disney character.

1155
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,900
Right, right.

1156
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,100
Learn to talk, you shit head bitch.

1157
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,340
Poor his horse collar.

1158
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,820
So my drink of choice, I usually, at the Carthay,

1159
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,460
I usually opt for the Scotch Mist.

1160
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,860
Oh yeah, that's right.

1161
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,380
Which is.

1162
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,820
All ice.

1163
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,820
Pretty much all ice.

1164
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,180
It is supposedly Walt's drink of choice.

1165
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,980
It's called Walt's Scotch Mist.

1166
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,340
Walt's Scotch Mist, yes.

1167
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,540
And it said, it used to say

1168
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,500
it was made with black and white Scotch,

1169
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,340
which to clarify,

1170
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,580
I always thought that was two different kinds of Scotches

1171
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,740
and then someone, a listener told me like,

1172
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,860
no, that is the brand of Scotch.

1173
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,940
You just don't see it around that much anymore.

1174
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,460
So it's black and white Scotch over crushed ice

1175
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,540
with a twist.

1176
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,100
Does it have a mist of anything on it?

1177
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,420
Like a different alcohol or anything?

1178
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,500
Not really, no.

1179
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,340
And. The Scotch itself is the mist.

1180
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,700
I mean it either does or it doesn't.

1181
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,460
It doesn't, no it doesn't.

1182
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,580
It's just Scotch over crushed ice with a twist of lemon,

1183
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,460
which I like.

1184
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,900
And I like, I don't really like drinks served up

1185
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,700
because I feel like they hit me really hard

1186
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,260
and I've never had much of a tolerance.

1187
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,700
So I need the ice.

1188
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,620
You like the dilute.

1189
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,060
I like the dilution, yeah.

1190
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,860
Now though, the menu says for that drink,

1191
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,020
it's Johnny Walker Black over ice,

1192
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,980
which is a decent, that's a fine like Scotch.

1193
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,940
Like that's fine.

1194
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,420
Most bars that is like the regular decent Scotch.

1195
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,620
But it's a little less special to me

1196
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,460
because you can find it.

1197
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,340
Did the price stay the same?

1198
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,180
Pretty much.

1199
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,140
I mean now that's tricky.

1200
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,340
Yes, yeah.

1201
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,220
And mainly you're not getting Walt's experience.

1202
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,460
They're breaking Walt's wishes.

1203
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,380
Getting his brand.

1204
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,180
I wonder if you go to,

1205
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,500
what's the bar that I always wanted to go to?

1206
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,340
The special one?

1207
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,180
The Club 33 place?

1208
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,020
Yeah.

1209
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,460
Do they have the black and white probably?

1210
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,300
I don't know.

1211
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,140
I don't know.

1212
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,140
They have, we did go.

1213
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,980
They might have a more real bus.

1214
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,820
And they had an insane drink.

1215
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,220
Did you go with Garland?

1216
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,220
No. No.

1217
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,900
We went with the crafts.

1218
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,500
The people who ran the,

1219
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,340
that's from Disneyland exhibit.

1220
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,820
There was a museum where there were a bunch of,

1221
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,060
like a guy was selling all of his Disney rides.

1222
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,420
And then when we did a show there

1223
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,020
and then we got to go to Club 33.

1224
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,860
Oh cool.

1225
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,420
And the little private Club 33

1226
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,700
next to Carthay Lounge called 1901.

1227
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,900
Oh my God, I didn't even know about this one.

1228
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,820
They all have numbers.

1229
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,340
When each time you're there, look off to the right

1230
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,660
and there's a little door nobody's going into.

1231
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,900
God damn it.

1232
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,740
1901.

1233
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,900
1901's pretty fucking cool.

1234
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,860
I've heard the opinion

1235
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,860
and I think I might have the opinion.

1236
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,820
Maybe 1901 cooler than Club 33.

1237
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
It's smaller.

1238
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,940
It's like a little study.

1239
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,300
It's like you're involved study.

1240
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,020
But you went in there.

1241
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,900
Did you drink in there?

1242
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,100
I had a Manhattan in there and I will say this.

1243
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,620
The Manhattan in there was not as good

1244
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,780
as the Manhattan in the Lounge.

1245
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,620
Wow.

1246
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,900
I mean sometimes that's a bartender thing.

1247
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,740
Yeah.

1248
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,580
I think it was a bartender thing.

1249
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,500
But also it was prepared table side.

1250
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,340
That's true too.

1251
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,820
And we got to see the sphere being made.

1252
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,860
It was made in an old fashioned way.

1253
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,780
It was a contraption with a very heavy weight

1254
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,780
that just slowly crushed a cube of ice into a sphere.

1255
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,700
Oh, I would never have guessed

1256
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,900
that's how they were doing it.

1257
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
It's pretty nuts.

1258
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,420
It is like a gravity physics driven simple machine

1259
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,180
that slowly lowers onto a block and makes a sphere.

1260
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,020
It's like Superman making a diamond.

1261
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,860
Yeah.

1262
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,700
Yeah.

1263
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,540
Mm-hmm.

1264
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,380
It's just as beautiful.

1265
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,220
Out of cold.

1266
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,060
Exactly.

1267
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,740
Maybe some of the appeal, because as you say this,

1268
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,860
you're right, it is the sphere is watering down the drink,

1269
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,180
but I just like looking at it so much.

1270
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,140
I mean, no, don't get me wrong.

1271
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,540
It's pretty, if I'm gonna have ice in the drink,

1272
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,540
I want big ice.

1273
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,380
I have the big square ones at my home.

1274
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,220
Yes, yeah, love the big squares.

1275
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,020
But I don't ever use them.

1276
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,860
Okay, sure.

1277
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,660
But they're there.

1278
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,180
If I make a mojito, I would use ice.

1279
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,740
A drink like that, it's like a cause for it.

1280
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,260
That's more naturally.

1281
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,420
Right.

1282
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,580
But yeah, Manhattan, I see what you're saying.

1283
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,940
Because anywhere else you get a Manhattan,

1284
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,780
it's probably just the, it's just the liquid.

1285
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,900
Yeah, it's chilled.

1286
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,740
Yeah.

1287
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,580
But it's not.

1288
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,420
Yeah, yeah.

1289
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,580
I think I just, I love looking at how clear that thing is.

1290
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,420
Because I looked at it, I was like,

1291
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,460
if we wanted to do true clear ice

1292
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,260
for having you guys over, what would we have to do?

1293
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,820
And there was like a place downtown

1294
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,660
where we could have done it,

1295
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,900
and each ice sphere would have cost like $10.

1296
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,740
Oh my.

1297
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,260
I was like, there's a real art to it, apparently.

1298
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,100
Yeah, sure.

1299
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,940
Not just any civilians can.

1300
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,220
It's like using distilled water or spring water,

1301
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,060
like that one knows.

1302
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,900
I don't think so.

1303
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,260
There's something to do with boiling it too.

1304
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,260
I think you may have to pour it in boiling.

1305
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,260
I don't know, my cousin is a big drink guy.

1306
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,500
His whole Instagram is cocktails,

1307
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,260
and he now makes a side living off of whatever,

1308
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,220
promoting alcohols through his Instagram.

1309
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,180
But he knows how to make the super clear ice.

1310
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,780
But it's like, it took him a long time to perfect it.

1311
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,620
Okay, okay, sure.

1312
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,940
Do you guys, when you make coffee,

1313
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,100
do you use tap or spring or filtered water?

1314
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,940
Oh, I use tap.

1315
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,060
Filter at least.

1316
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,980
Okay.

1317
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,260
I don't make coffee.

1318
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,100
I feel, I just.

1319
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,540
But I will say, I boil and do pour over,

1320
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,780
so I'm already boiling it.

1321
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,620
Yeah.

1322
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,740
Like I'm not pointing, you know,

1323
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,420
like I'm not putting cold water into a machine,

1324
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,260
because I don't use one.

1325
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,100
Right.

1326
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,060
That pour over at home is probably a good idea.

1327
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,140
I have not gone that way.

1328
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,380
I feel like, does it improve the quality of life?

1329
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,380
Well, it improves the,

1330
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,980
I mean, it makes a really good cup of coffee,

1331
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,220
but it also like limits you.

1332
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,020
If I make a pot of coffee, I'm drinking it.

1333
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,780
And then I'm gonna feel impending doom

1334
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,420
and like all the things that happen

1335
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,820
when you drink too much coffee.

1336
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,260
If I make myself do a pour over,

1337
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,060
I'm like, that's it, you got one.

1338
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

1339
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,820
Okay, okay.

1340
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,620
I feel like you have pretty strong tolerance

1341
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,900
for like coffee and liquor.

1342
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,500
I have never had that on either case.

1343
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,980
I need strong coffee, but I can't do a ton of it.

1344
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,540
Like I can do one or two strong coffees.

1345
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,100
After that, I truly, it's like my eyes turn into raisins,

1346
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,420
and like I can't see the horizon.

1347
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,300
Everything's scary, like awful.

1348
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,020
I'm a big time coffee lightweight, like very much.

1349
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1350
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,660
You can, I'm glad to hear you describing

1351
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,740
that you can get like weird and paranoid and scared.

1352
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,380
The impending doom is so-

1353
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,820
I'm afraid of cold brew.

1354
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,740
Oh, cold brew, actually.

1355
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,380
So now that's the only thing I can drink.

1356
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,460
Oh, okay.

1357
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,940
Because I'm on this crazy diet for like IBD,

1358
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,620
and cold brew I read was like,

1359
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,780
I was off coffee for five months,

1360
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,540
which was the worst time of my life.

1361
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,140
I had no personality and I didn't know what anything was.

1362
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,740
And I would see friends and think,

1363
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,140
this is what boring people feel like.

1364
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,220
No thoughts are arising in my mind.

1365
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,940
Like I have to just pretend to have things to say.

1366
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,660
Thank fucking God I started with coffee again,

1367
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,980
and now I'm back to normal.

1368
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,900
But then I read, so I read that cold brew

1369
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,380
is like better for people with IBD,

1370
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,020
because it's less acidic, so I tried it,

1371
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,340
and it has been fine so far.

1372
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,180
Oh, that's good.

1373
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,820
Yeah, I make it at home.

1374
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,020
And you can heat it, so it's like, you can have hot coffee.

1375
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,860
Oh, I see.

1376
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,220
It just has to be brewed cold.

1377
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,060
Yeah.

1378
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,980
So you don't trip, it's not scary.

1379
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,820
I genuinely.

1380
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,660
Well, for a while I was into cold brew,

1381
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,940
and I remember I had it at Earwolf,

1382
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,580
and it was like the most disgusting watered down thing.

1383
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,340
It was like the Emperor wears no clothes.

1384
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,540
Like they were all excited about the word,

1385
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,860
and they're like, the cold brew, we have cold brew.

1386
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,940
And I was like, this is gross.

1387
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,620
You guys don't know you're drinking anything gross.

1388
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,340
I feel, yeah, some of the ones they sell in stores,

1389
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,500
it is either gross or I'm just like,

1390
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,900
it's like drinking concentrate.

1391
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,340
We're so wired.

1392
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,260
Groundwork cold brew is the best.

1393
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,780
And they sell the concentrate at Gelsen's,

1394
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,860
and probably other places.

1395
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,940
And you just mix it with whatever milk you would use it with,

1396
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,220
or you can mix it with water, but I wouldn't.

1397
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,180
Yeah.

1398
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,300
Or you can just buy their bottles,

1399
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,060
which are just their cold brew, but not concentrate.

1400
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,940
I just do regular grounds,

1401
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,180
like half a cup to four cups of water,

1402
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,860
and put it in the fridge overnight.

1403
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,700
Kacen is recipe.

1404
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,740
And then French press that.

1405
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,100
Yeah, that's how you make it.

1406
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,940
Yeah.

1407
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,100
Yeah.

1408
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:29,940
We should.

1409
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,540
Anyway, that's my little.

1410
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,420
But that's pretty weak, it sounds like.

1411
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,860
It's pretty weak, yeah.

1412
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,140
Coffee at the parks.

1413
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,100
Let's tie it back in.

1414
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,180
What do you get?

1415
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,180
I still have never gotten a coffee at the park.

1416
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,020
Really?

1417
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:42,980
Which is shocking for me,

1418
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,940
but I think it's because I go caffeinated,

1419
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,980
and I don't want the impending doom at Disney.

1420
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:47,820
Yeah, sure.

1421
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,780
Yeah, yeah.

1422
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,180
I've gotten some of the coffee drinks at Carthay.

1423
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,020
I've always wanted to.

1424
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,860
I've always wanted to.

1425
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,700
They look really good.

1426
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,460
Yeah, they put, if you like,

1427
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,140
like I like coffee with amaretto.

1428
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,900
I can't believe you can drink coffee that late in the day.

1429
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,380
Although that, actually that sounds so good.

1430
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,300
If you do it with the amaretto,

1431
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,500
then you're getting like,

1432
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,580
you're getting the chill of the alcohol,

1433
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,820
but then a little bit of a buzz

1434
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,140
so you can go on more rides.

1435
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:10,980
Yes.

1436
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,820
That sounds good.

1437
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,660
I like that.

1438
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,820
I feel like they always switch up the coffee drinks.

1439
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,500
It's always some sort of liqueur,

1440
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,340
or something. I never even noticed

1441
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,660
what they had there, yeah.

1442
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,460
Somebody, the intergrossum got an Irish coffee one time

1443
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,460
that looked pretty solid.

1444
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,860
That's like with whiskey and coffee?

1445
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,780
I feel like, that's the only thing though,

1446
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,420
is I mean, I haven't had it with amaretto,

1447
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,220
but anytime I've had the coffee with liquor drink,

1448
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,060
I'm like, this is making both of them taste worse to me.

1449
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,820
The coffee doesn't taste great, and the,

1450
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,020
I'd much rather.

1451
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,740
Have two cups of both.

1452
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,380
That would be ideal, honestly.

1453
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,500
Yeah, just one drink, drink, drink.

1454
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,300
Get an iced espresso and a Manhattan.

1455
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,620
What's off your, what do you not drink?

1456
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,140
What's gross to you?

1457
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,700
What's gross to me?

1458
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,540
Mayonnaise.

1459
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,580
Yeah, anything white, pretty much.

1460
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,100
But alcohol-wise?

1461
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:58,940
I mean, that, sure.

1462
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,220
I don't like vodka of any, no vodka.

1463
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,980
I'm not really a clear alcohol person.

1464
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,300
I will drink gin or white rum if it's in a cocktail,

1465
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,820
but it's not ever my first choice.

1466
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:08,660
Sure, sure.

1467
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,700
Right now I can't drink at all.

1468
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,860
I haven't had a drink since last Christmas.

1469
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,700
Okay, wow.

1470
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,740
We're here talking about, this is just,

1471
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,100
you're just getting pummeled with drink info for amaretto?

1472
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,940
I mean, I love it, I love it.

1473
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,420
I can't have a lot of things right now.

1474
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,300
I can't have chocolate either,

1475
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,260
and I bought a Bon Appetit magazine

1476
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,380
that was just chocolate recipes,

1477
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,820
and read it like a little fiend,

1478
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,580
where I was like, got so hungry

1479
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,100
I couldn't fall asleep that night.

1480
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,140
Whoa, a little fiend.

1481
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,140
A little chocolate fiend.

1482
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,700
Little chocolate fiend, who does that remind you of?

1483
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:41,700
I can assure you, I eat enough for the both of us.

1484
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,540
Thank God somebody is, Jason.

1485
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,700
I knew I could count on you.

1486
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,660
What do you got in the house, chocolate-wise, Jason?

1487
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,460
Well, it's very funny you ask.

1488
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,500
So, I bought this,

1489
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,740
I bought these like caramel chocolate sea salt cookies

1490
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,020
that are far too salty.

1491
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,060
Yeah, yeah.

1492
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,060
I made a mistake there.

1493
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,820
There is no too salty, keep going.

1494
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,660
Yeah, yeah.

1495
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,500
They're really salty.

1496
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,620
That's my thing with the Carthay.

1497
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,460
And you're licking your lips and grinding.

1498
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,060
The collagen and tonic is too salty to me.

1499
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,380
It's too tangy to me.

1500
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,380
Tangy or salty?

1501
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,500
Those feel like different things.

1502
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,340
Both.

1503
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,180
Is it salty?

1504
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,020
It is salty, isn't it?

1505
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,900
Cause it's got a little pickle brine in there.

1506
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,700
Oh, I guess that, yeah, you're right.

1507
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,140
So, I have that, and then I bought a bar,

1508
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,220
Girodeli, so they have like the dark chocolates,

1509
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,900
the percentages of cacao.

1510
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,740
Yeah, they do.

1511
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,980
And I saw like, oh, 92%.

1512
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,820
That's interesting.

1513
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,660
That's fucking dark.

1514
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,500
And it's-

1515
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,700
92 proof.

1516
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,460
They took a few squares,

1517
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,580
cause at first I was like, this is, there is,

1518
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,060
on the back, it's like there was hardly any sugar

1519
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,020
in a square.

1520
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,700
It tastes almost like baking chocolate,

1521
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,780
but then it's just palatable enough.

1522
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,620
Yeah.

1523
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,060
But after a few squares, it's grown on me.

1524
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,900
I do like it now.

1525
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,820
I love dark chocolate.

1526
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,740
I can't have milk chocolate at all.

1527
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,500
To me, it's like a different category.

1528
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,340
Okay.

1529
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,180
Hmm.

1530
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,020
Was there ever a time, cause I,

1531
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,220
the dark chocolate, I feel like I've had to get used to.

1532
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,660
Milk chocolate now was always, of course, the default.

1533
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,020
Pretty early on, I started liking dark chocolate.

1534
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:14,860
Yeah.

1535
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,100
Like as a kid, as a kid for sure.

1536
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,060
But I mean, as a little kid,

1537
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,700
I would eat Easter candy and Halloween candy

1538
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,460
and all that's usually milk chocolate, but-

1539
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,420
For sure.

1540
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,140
Easter, yeah, Easter candy especially.

1541
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,660
But yeah, I think 92% might be a little much for me.

1542
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,260
I like it, but I think like 80 or 70

1543
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,820
is probably the right level.

1544
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,620
You're calibrating your level like a mattress or-

1545
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:34,460
Yes.

1546
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,300
CBD oil.

1547
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,620
Yeah, sure.

1548
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,220
What's your number?

1549
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,100
Jason's chocolate update.

1550
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,100
Yeah, so that's my chocolate update.

1551
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,620
If you did have to put, do you have an ideal number?

1552
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,420
It's not 92, probably quite.

1553
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,420
I think it's somewhere between 70 and 80,

1554
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,700
but I do usually prefer dark chocolate,

1555
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,060
except like at Easter time,

1556
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,580
I like all the milk chocolate Cadbury stuff.

1557
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,700
But I mean, all that stuff would be so much better dark,

1558
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,700
like Cadbury egg with dark chocolate,

1559
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,180
that would be so much better with the dark,

1560
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,140
with the sweet yolk.

1561
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:03,980
I agree with that for sure.

1562
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,180
They have some of that now.

1563
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,020
They do, they have dark chocolate Cadbury egg?

1564
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,580
Because the milk chocolate with the yolk,

1565
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,540
it's like, it's just sugar on sugar to me.

1566
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,340
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1567
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,820
My palate's too refined at this point.

1568
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,900
Yeah, you're used to a certain thing,

1569
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,500
a certain standard of chocolate.

1570
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,780
Can we make Jason do an Easter egg hunt for,

1571
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,940
is that bonus content?

1572
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,780
Oh, yes.

1573
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,620
Like right there on Easter egg hunt.

1574
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,820
Is that a good episode of me ranking

1575
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,100
my Easter candy choices?

1576
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,180
I mean, I wanna hear that,

1577
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,820
but I also wanna see you go on a hunt first.

1578
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,660
I want the hunt.

1579
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,140
Yeah, I want the hunt too.

1580
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,100
I'll do a hunt.

1581
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,540
What if it's clues that lead you to where the eggs are

1582
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,740
that are somehow like Disney trivia based?

1583
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,580
Okay.

1584
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,020
I just wanna stand here like a parent

1585
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,660
and be excited when he gets close.

1586
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,660
You know, like, oh, oh, oh, he's getting close.

1587
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,660
A little pro parent curl up.

1588
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,780
If I could do an Easter egg hunt

1589
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,420
without those pesky kids around,

1590
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,260
that would sound great.

1591
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,140
That part was always stressful.

1592
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,300
I remember as a kid,

1593
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,860
we never participated in those,

1594
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,940
like if there'd be a group hunt at a hotel

1595
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,300
we were staying at or something like that,

1596
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,180
because truly to me, even as a child,

1597
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,780
the anxiety outweighed whatever chocolate I would find.

1598
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,900
Like even when my,

1599
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,980
this is how competitive my sister and I were.

1600
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,180
My mom had to, she'd separate the yard

1601
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,580
and we had Easter egg hunts.

1602
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,540
We each had our own on one side of the yard.

1603
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,900
Like here's the line where you can't hunt pasts

1604
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,380
and my sister had all her stuff and I had all mine.

1605
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,700
Cause if we hunted together,

1606
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,900
I would have gotten too upset.

1607
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,740
Right.

1608
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,380
That's just that sort of like outside the box thinking

1609
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,940
that they say geniuses do that like seems so,

1610
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,460
I think that's brilliant.

1611
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,620
I think that's like, well, you've solved the problem.

1612
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:32,460
That's great.

1613
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,460
Yeah, she did solve the problem.

1614
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,700
And my mom was also very good at Easter egg hunts.

1615
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,260
Like we would get little stuffed animals.

1616
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,820
And like, it was definitely like,

1617
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,100
if it would not have made sense if like I had run through

1618
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,820
with, you know, like teeth gritted and like gotten everything.

1619
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,860
Cause I would have gotten two of everything.

1620
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,700
Yeah.

1621
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,660
Oh, so she evened it out.

1622
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,580
So everybody.

1623
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,980
Everybody got the same stuff.

1624
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,820
Right.

1625
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,660
I have to give my parents a lot of credit

1626
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,220
cause they would, me and my brother would each get

1627
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,660
an Easter basket, but we'd wake up Easter morning

1628
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,300
and find a jelly bean trail in the hallway.

1629
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,620
Oh my God.

1630
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,940
Jelly bean trail.

1631
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,260
I've never heard this story from you.

1632
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,100
I think I heard all this.

1633
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,940
Holy shit.

1634
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,020
We would have to follow the jelly bean trails.

1635
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,700
Parents there is so excited like I am.

1636
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,460
Every now and then there would be a dead end

1637
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,260
or like a red herring.

1638
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,020
How do we not know this?

1639
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,860
How old were you?

1640
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,460
How, what age was this?

1641
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,220
I want to picture little Jason at the right level.

1642
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,180
For years.

1643
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,020
Oh my God.

1644
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,140
For years, like through middle school.

1645
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,220
Oh my God.

1646
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,540
This is fantastic.

1647
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,380
Jelly bean trail.

1648
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,220
Jelly bean trail.

1649
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,820
And then to the basket.

1650
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,660
And then, so, but then sometimes.

1651
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,460
And the basket was already full?

1652
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,300
Yeah.

1653
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,780
Well, we each, it was the same.

1654
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,540
We each had our own baskets, the same baskets every year.

1655
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,500
So like if you found the others,

1656
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,340
you just kind of were like, okay.

1657
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,180
Right, right.

1658
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,020
Like a stocking.

1659
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:53,860
And to keep looking.

1660
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,740
And then there'd usually be like a movie in it

1661
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,700
or a stack of comics.

1662
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,580
But with the candy, it wasn't like,

1663
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:02,340
we would usually get like one thing in the Easter basket.

1664
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,940
Would you eat the jelly beans

1665
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,580
as you walked along the trail?

1666
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,860
Not, you might have one or two.

1667
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,700
Oh, really?

1668
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,540
We would definitely collect them.

1669
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,380
Now I'm picturing ET.

1670
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,220
We would definitely collect them.

1671
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,500
Now I am totally picturing ET,

1672
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,260
like crunching his way towards the Easter basket.

1673
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,300
Collect them and then we would

1674
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,060
disperse that I would put them in the basket

1675
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,180
because I wouldn't want to inventory the basket first

1676
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,260
before I started.

1677
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,100
Oh yeah, you gotta organize your candy.

1678
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,900
Because it's also, it's like, all right,

1679
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,180
I'm gonna have one or two pieces

1680
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,460
and then I gotta eat breakfast

1681
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,620
and then we gotta go to church

1682
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,020
and then we gotta go to another family.

1683
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,380
And the whole thing with that kind of loot

1684
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,420
is anticipating it.

1685
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,580
Like that was Halloween too.

1686
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,380
I would organize it first by like,

1687
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,380
you know, fruits and chocolates

1688
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,580
and then I'd like mess it all up again

1689
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,780
and be like, now by favorite,

1690
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,620
mess it all up again.

1691
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,660
Now by whatever, like how I'm gonna pack.

1692
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,500
Alphabetize.

1693
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,980
I mean, I would do it by every category I could think of.

1694
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,820
Whoa.

1695
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,660
I loved it.

1696
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,980
Halloween and Easter would kind of stress me out

1697
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,100
because unless they fell on a Friday or Saturday,

1698
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,500
well, Easter didn't fall on Saturdays.

1699
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,580
Easter seems to be Sunday every year.

1700
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,580
Typically, usually.

1701
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,420
Typically.

1702
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,260
So far.

1703
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,540
But Easter especially would stress me out

1704
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,380
because it was like, once I got the basket,

1705
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,820
I was like, the clock is ticking.

1706
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,620
I have to go to school tomorrow.

1707
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:20,620
Like I knew, like any relaxation from the week off

1708
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,580
or the long weekend.

1709
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,820
You don't drive to school along a jelly bean trail.

1710
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,780
No, you don't at all.

1711
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,820
Okay, so I have a few questions about the jelly bean trail.

1712
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,660
Okay, so what surface wore the jelly beans on?

1713
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,500
Was it carpet?

1714
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,340
It was carpet.

1715
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,340
It was carpet.

1716
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,700
From the bedrooms down the hallway to the living room.

1717
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,580
Okay, about how many jelly beans

1718
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,700
do you think the trail was long?

1719
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,620
Yeah, like how, tell us the spacing.

1720
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,540
Space kind of far apart.

1721
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,980
I think like by the time,

1722
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,620
probably like 20 or so.

1723
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,460
20 jelly beans?

1724
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,380
Maybe a couple dozen.

1725
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,940
I had somehow, I was picturing them back to back.

1726
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,940
So it was 100, it was 100.

1727
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,540
I was picturing at least 500 jelly beans.

1728
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,700
At least, yeah.

1729
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,020
And Jason's eating all of them.

1730
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,740
I mean, eating them not even touching them.

1731
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,980
Yeah, eating them not even touching them with his hand.

1732
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:11,820
Yeah, exactly.

1733
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,140
Hands flat on the ground.

1734
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,100
A little exorcist.

1735
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,140
And you would eat them off the carpeting?

1736
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,180
I would collect them.

1737
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,340
Right, but you would eat all of them.

1738
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,860
Yeah, they would get eaten.

1739
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,700
Interesting, does anybody?

1740
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,860
What's your favorite color jelly bean?

1741
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:28,700
Pink.

1742
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,540
White.

1743
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,140
White is good too, that's up there.

1744
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,180
But I love red too.

1745
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,420
Cherry, yeah.

1746
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,700
Purple, grape.

1747
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,100
Never the green and yellow, no thanks.

1748
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:37,940
No, no one thinks so.

1749
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,300
Orange is on the fence.

1750
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,980
Yeah, orange is pretty good.

1751
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,140
Well, I just want the listeners,

1752
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,660
mark it down this episode,

1753
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,940
the reveal of Jason's jelly bean trail.

1754
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,060
That's gonna come back a lot,

1755
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,860
I think, in the history of the podcast.

1756
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,100
You're simultaneously full of joy that you've discovered it,

1757
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,100
but also having regrets of many years

1758
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,940
of not knowing about the jelly beans.

1759
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,740
I can't believe we didn't know about this.

1760
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,500
The jelly bean trail has not come up before.

1761
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,860
I just, now I'm like,

1762
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,220
oh, the Heralds we could have done.

1763
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,380
Okay.

1764
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,220
Oh my gosh.

1765
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,740
You don't think I'd keep myself up at night

1766
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,140
thinking about that?

1767
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,180
I mean, by the time you found that basket,

1768
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,180
someone had a hat headache, you know?

1769
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,100
We have not really talked about Jason's hat headaches

1770
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,940
so much on the show.

1771
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:21,780
No, it's a family-

1772
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,620
I'm kind of over it, I'm wearing a hat right now.

1773
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,380
It's a family trait that all the Sheridans

1774
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,260
get hat headaches from their hats.

1775
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,100
That is real.

1776
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,260
And Jason brought it up to us

1777
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,820
as if it was a phrase that everybody uses.

1778
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,660
Yes.

1779
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,460
You know, when you get a hat headache.

1780
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,340
Usually, eventually I realize,

1781
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,620
it's like, well, that meant it was very hot outside

1782
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,860
and I was not drinking enough water

1783
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,620
and I probably had my hat on too tight.

1784
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,620
Well, it's also, the too tight part is a big factor.

1785
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,620
But I think it's also,

1786
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,100
I think I ever wore hats as a child.

1787
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,820
Like we were not a hat wearing family.

1788
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,900
I would get a ponytail headache.

1789
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,180
I think we sunburned the easiest kids.

1790
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,420
Oh, ponytail headache.

1791
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,260
I believe if you pull it too tight.

1792
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,100
It hurts, oh my God, yeah.

1793
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,940
Right?

1794
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,760
Yeah.

1795
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,600
And people get wig headaches.

1796
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,440
Those have to be on pretty tight.

1797
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,280
Sure.

1798
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,100
They wear a wig for a long time.

1799
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,940
Wigs hurt.

1800
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,780
Yeah.

1801
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:08,940
Pull back.

1802
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,700
Jason's pond deals just came up on a recent show.

1803
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,340
Remember he used to put a little piece of hot dog

1804
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,020
on the end of a fishing line and then fish for pond deals.

1805
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,300
So like the stuff we've learned has come out.

1806
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,820
That's why I'm just shocked at Jelly Bean Trail.

1807
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,100
I had never heard of it before.

1808
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,900
Because it's one of the best.

1809
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,100
It's already one of the best.

1810
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,780
We've been on the Jelly Bean Trail

1811
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,820
for 110 episodes or whatever.

1812
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,180
Yeah, we just didn't know it.

1813
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,780
I say we, I have nothing here.

1814
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,620
You were in the whole, the old Herald run.

1815
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,460
Yeah, yeah.

1816
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,020
The reward finally came.

1817
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,220
So now write your Instagram post.

1818
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,980
It was a long trail but I feel good to have gotten here.

1819
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,740
I got the basket.

1820
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,180
Were it not for all those Monday nights

1821
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,460
I would have never discovered the greatest.

1822
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,620
The Jason basket, yeah.

1823
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,820
I'm looking at the menu for Karthay here.

1824
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,900
And the Karthay, the Karthay man has 17.50, which I think.

1825
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,100
That's more than we used to pay, right?

1826
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,580
His way is like, it used to be like 14.

1827
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,740
Yeah, probably around that.

1828
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,580
Yeah.

1829
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,780
It's the pricey one.

1830
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,620
They've kept.

1831
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,700
I just had a more expensive one than that.

1832
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,820
Granville in LA where we've been.

1833
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,660
Oh right.

1834
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,500
Yeah, there's that.

1835
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,460
18.

1836
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,300
Interesting.

1837
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,580
Wow, they're really getting up there.

1838
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,420
Yeah, no kidding.

1839
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,100
I'm looking at the thing here and they have,

1840
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,980
and I remember I got this one year on Halloween.

1841
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,780
They have, because it's Halloween season,

1842
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:23,380
they have the poison appletini, which has not the ice

1843
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,740
but a little like skull, like melty,

1844
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,140
like piece of plastic that lights up in the drink.

1845
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:30,980
So it's a similar.

1846
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:31,800
I mean that's fun.

1847
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,980
Not to me worth drinking an appletini.

1848
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:34,800
Yeah.

1849
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,240
It sounds so bad.

1850
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,080
Yeah.

1851
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,320
I like one sugar nonsense drink generally.

1852
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,160
Yeah, I can't do it.

1853
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,920
But like I couldn't do many appletinis.

1854
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,760
Yeah, I hope not.

1855
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,480
I mean I could if I had to,

1856
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,280
but going to my head I could do it.

1857
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,120
You'll do the appletini trail.

1858
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:48,960
I feel like they should have made that more

1859
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,800
of like a bitter cider cocktail.

1860
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,760
Like that would have been a fun way to get the apple

1861
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,360
in there without being disgusting.

1862
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,680
Yes, that is true.

1863
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,840
They, yeah, I wonder, I would be so interested.

1864
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,200
We should really have emailed and tried to get the breakdown

1865
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,520
of like what people like, like what gets ordered the most.

1866
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,200
I'm always curious about that type of thing.

1867
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,840
Like do most people go in there and order a sugary drink

1868
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,360
like an appletini or does everyone know

1869
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,000
that Carthy Manhattan is the best?

1870
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,920
Or do people go for Scotch Mist because of the Walt thing?

1871
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,760
Right, who knows?

1872
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,240
Well, and it's funny when you look around in there too.

1873
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,120
I mean, I think we, I feel like we've been in there before

1874
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,520
when it felt like the kind of people who go for a cocktail

1875
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,780
and then you also realize that like sometimes people

1876
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,760
just drag their family in for a snack

1877
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,080
not really knowing what it is.

1878
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:30,920
Right.

1879
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,400
They're not taking advantage of.

1880
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,480
It's very, it's much darker than a lot of places park

1881
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,200
and very heavily air conditioned.

1882
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,040
So.

1883
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:39,880
Air conditioning is.

1884
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,800
Major things.

1885
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,920
It's the only time I appreciate air conditioning.

1886
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,760
Yes.

1887
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,400
Because I hate air conditioning.

1888
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,800
But after you're tramping around on the sun,

1889
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,640
it feels good.

1890
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,200
You hate, does it just feel like weird fake wind

1891
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,200
or something to you?

1892
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,200
Well, I don't like being cold, number one.

1893
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,120
But yes, I don't like the, it's like an oppressive wind.

1894
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,940
I don't like anything that's sort of like,

1895
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,600
I always start to feel like I'm getting sick

1896
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,580
when I'm in a lot of air conditioning.

1897
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,280
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

1898
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,120
Yeah.

1899
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,640
But Disneyland, necessary.

1900
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,280
So it makes those, it's a commonly said thing,

1901
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,460
but your theaters, your Lincoln shows

1902
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,520
and your American adventures,

1903
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,360
it's almost the main thing about it.

1904
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,280
Yeah, it's a break.

1905
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,120
Yeah.

1906
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,940
It's a break.

1907
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,780
Very necessary.

1908
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,760
This whole place too, it's such a little like prison

1909
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,000
in a good way because you can't,

1910
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,880
like your cell phone doesn't really work in there

1911
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,720
in the lounge for whatever reason.

1912
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,480
My cell phone doesn't work anywhere in Disneyland.

1913
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,360
I mean, it's a true vacation when I get there.

1914
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,120
Sprint, if you're listening.

1915
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,160
I have Sprint.

1916
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,200
I have called them about the Disney issue.

1917
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,920
Wow.

1918
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,960
They did nothing about it.

1919
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,760
And you demanded like install a cell tower in Anaheim.

1920
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,840
You know, I tried to get them,

1921
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,440
I was like trying to get a better deal.

1922
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,400
I was like, listen, I go to Disneyland a lot

1923
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,160
and my cell phone doesn't even work there,

1924
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,380
which could be very dangerous

1925
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,840
if I get separated from my friends and I can't find them.

1926
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,160
And I threatened to leave and they asked like,

1927
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,520
okay, so you want us to terminate?

1928
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,800
And I was like, oh no.

1929
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,640
Yeah.

1930
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,160
When you put it that way,

1931
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,480
that's a scary word.

1932
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,640
The companies don't care

1933
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,240
about your business anymore at all.

1934
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,080
Yeah, it's getting bad.

1935
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,600
And Disney's wifi is bad, unless you're in the hotels.

1936
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,840
The hotel ones have decent wifi now.

1937
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,880
But like- It's a weird thing too.

1938
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,500
You would think like they have so many apps

1939
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,480
and things that you can use.

1940
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,240
It's like they should,

1941
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,880
maybe it's just the number of users, everyone using it.

1942
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,320
Well, I think it's a combo with that.

1943
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,020
And then I heard the signal to like the stations,

1944
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,560
the wifi stations are by the rights

1945
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,040
because they need the FastPass Plus stuff to work.

1946
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,040
Oh, that's why my cell phone does work in Indiana Jones.

1947
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,160
That's the only place I've been able to text people.

1948
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,120
Just get a bunch of text.

1949
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,360
You get off that ride and ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1950
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,960
Yeah, it's when I'm in line, I'm like,

1951
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,400
ooh, I can check things.

1952
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,860
Weird, even though you're like under grant,

1953
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:45,960
you're in a tunnel, it feels counterintuitive.

1954
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,440
Oh my God, no, I just realized actually what it is.

1955
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,080
Isn't that, isn't Indiana Jones where all the like

1956
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,520
hieroglyphics, when they first open that ride,

1957
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,360
the hieroglyphics that are in, when you're waiting,

1958
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,760
it used to be sponsored by Sprint.

1959
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,720
And so you got these like, it was so silly

1960
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,200
when that ride first opened, you got these like

1961
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,280
cardboard things that had Sprint on one side

1962
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,080
and the other side, you could decipher like the message.

1963
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,800
And it was essentially a, it was an ad for Sprint,

1964
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,640
which was fairly different. Was it Sprint?

1965
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,800
I think it was Sprint, it was something,

1966
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,080
if it wasn't Sprint, it was AT&T maybe.

1967
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,000
Something like that, but it's also just the fact

1968
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,840
that they did that.

1969
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,280
I mean, I know they can change the meaning of those symbols

1970
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,080
at any time and then take it, but it's.

1971
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,340
It was something really tippet,

1972
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,080
like the power of communication.

1973
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,760
Yeah, really bad.

1974
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,760
Indiana Jones believes, Indiana Jones didn't have a cell phone,

1975
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,920
could have gotten himself out of a lot of messes.

1976
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,120
Today, we're luckier.

1977
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,120
He should have had his cell phone at the end of the ride.

1978
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,720
I should have used this.

1979
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,040
The real treasure was this.

1980
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,040
I'm surprised, it's almost shocking

1981
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,240
that they don't have that.

1982
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,880
Like now that they've added Johnny Depp,

1983
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,400
when are they gonna take that Me Too dude out?

1984
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,440
We've had that discussion, I feel like they've gotta be

1985
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,360
heading that way.

1986
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,320
I mean, as there's a franchise,

1987
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,960
as the franchise keeps going without him,

1988
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,560
maybe that's the justification.

1989
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,960
And then it's like, say goodbye to Captain Jack

1990
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,400
and they'd never, because they're never gonna say it.

1991
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,360
They're never gonna say, we're removing the canceled robot.

1992
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,960
It was just such a bummer to shove him in there

1993
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,800
in the first place.

1994
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,640
It's like, the movie came from the ride,

1995
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,480
then go backwards.

1996
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,320
Right, yes.

1997
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,680
And he's having this like unaffiliated plot

1998
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,720
that doesn't really intermingle with the rest.

1999
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,760
He's like so on the side.

2000
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,600
Yeah.

2001
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,480
Yeah, and all his mischief leads to riches.

2002
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,320
Yeah, he wins in the end.

2003
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,760
He can use those riches now.

2004
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,600
Yes.

2005
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,280
He's got so many lawsuits going.

2006
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,600
He's probably sneaking in there all the time,

2007
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,000
trying to pass himself off as a robot

2008
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,320
and get that gold out.

2009
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,040
Johnny Depp to pay off his debtors.

2010
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,480
Yeah, I mean he owns nine islands.

2011
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,000
Creditors.

2012
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,680
Hollywood vampires gigs are only gonna pay for so much.

2013
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,000
20 a head, I don't know.

2014
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,800
Yeah, they're not charging that much for his rock shows.

2015
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,040
Do you two have memories though

2016
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,360
of stuff we talked about at Carthay?

2017
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,040
I was trying to think about that.

2018
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,200
I mean I imagine it's a lot of the same

2019
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,320
UCB adjacent bull shit.

2020
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,680
Well sure, I'm sure we did our fair share of griping.

2021
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,680
But I remember good sort of relationship,

2022
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,080
childhood stuff.

2023
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,640
I remember learning some about your childhood

2024
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,280
and I obviously wouldn't say it on the podcast.

2025
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,800
But I just feel like we got into very good stuff

2026
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,400
and I was so curious if you guys had similar fond memories.

2027
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,000
I have fond memories but I don't remember specifics that well.

2028
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,960
But I have fond memories for sure.

2029
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,480
The three of us went down around my birthday

2030
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,160
like three years ago.

2031
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,120
And I just remember being happy to be out of the house

2032
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,640
sitting around, it was not a good time for me.

2033
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,280
We brought this up on an earlier episode.

2034
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,840
Do you do remember the photo shoot we got to have

2035
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,080
during Jason's birthday?

2036
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,960
That was pretty exciting.

2037
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,240
Were you there for the train photo shoot?

2038
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,080
Yeah, it was there.

2039
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:48,920
So that's the three of us.

2040
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,000
Oh yeah, yeah.

2041
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,280
So we got to go on because the train was parked

2042
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,760
because they were doing work on the rivers of America.

2043
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,360
So the photographer took us onto the train

2044
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,720
and then behind a little secret corner

2045
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:00,800
around the Haunted Mansion.

2046
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,920
Yeah, she took us around in the Haunted Mansion.

2047
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,280
That part wasn't as cool as you would think.

2048
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,200
I thought we were gonna get to maybe go into some real,

2049
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,840
I don't know, behind the scenes spooky stuff

2050
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,680
but it was more like you can go stand by this pillar

2051
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,520
that you would have stood by

2052
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,520
if you were waiting in line kind of.

2053
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,360
The mausoleum.

2054
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,880
It was just like one extra level down

2055
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,720
that would have been where the maintenance people go.

2056
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,560
But it was fun.

2057
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,920
Did you get photos as part of that?

2058
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,760
Yeah, yeah.

2059
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,600
Yeah.

2060
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,880
I guess so but now I don't, I mean.

2061
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,720
I sent them to everyone at the time.

2062
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,560
Did somebody have them?

2063
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,400
I'm sure you did.

2064
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,240
I have them, yeah.

2065
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,080
Because we got to add to that.

2066
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,240
Those are very popular on our Twitter.

2067
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,080
The Mike Jason photos were.

2068
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,320
There's a picture of Jason climbing the back of the train

2069
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,160
because she would suggest things to us.

2070
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,000
I think you must have sent them to me

2071
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,480
and then I probably just didn't open the file.

2072
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,800
I bet I forgot.

2073
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,640
I mean, I still have them.

2074
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,460
So there's a picture.

2075
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,480
I think there's a picture of all three of us

2076
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,400
with our heads sticking out the train window.

2077
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,240
That's cute.

2078
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,080
Were you post that?

2079
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:48,920
We'll post that.

2080
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,800
We'll post that.

2081
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,800
We're missing piece to this photo shoot.

2082
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,640
You had no idea.

2083
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,720
You were part of the magic.

2084
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,560
Yeah.

2085
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,400
Yeah.

2086
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,640
We used to go to Disneyland a lot.

2087
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,200
Did you ever pass for two years or a year?

2088
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,840
I think I did for two years.

2089
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,840
I'd go down sometimes.

2090
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,240
I went with you and Lindsay a couple times.

2091
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,100
I went with the three of us a few times

2092
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,800
and then we'd bring Marissa a bunch.

2093
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,080
It was you, me and Marissa went once.

2094
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:08,920
We did that too.

2095
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,760
Because you made me sit in Big Thunder.

2096
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,600
We made you sit in the middle.

2097
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,420
In between.

2098
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,260
Because it was cozy.

2099
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,200
All three of us went in Big Thunder.

2100
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,040
Three's company.

2101
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,280
We have a good picture of that too

2102
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,800
because Mike doesn't look happy but he was.

2103
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,400
It was a little tight

2104
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,360
and then there was a woman behind us photo bombing us.

2105
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,200
Truly amazing.

2106
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,040
When we were taking a photo.

2107
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,360
Truly amazing photo bomb.

2108
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,160
She was like throwing up a peace sign behind us.

2109
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,120
That may have also been the ride

2110
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,440
when the woman in front of us had such long hair

2111
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,440
that I was like, she's gonna die or kill us all.

2112
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,960
Oh no, this was, we talked to Mary Allen about this.

2113
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,440
The last episode that came out.

2114
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,280
Were you with her?

2115
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,120
She has a story that's very similar to this.

2116
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,320
Maybe I was with Mary because I have gone,

2117
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,000
yes, I went with wild horses once.

2118
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,400
That's what she was saying.

2119
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,480
That there was hair that felt like

2120
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,800
it was gonna get caught or something.

2121
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,640
Her hair was down to her knees.

2122
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,480
Yeah.

2123
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:59,000
And so she, and she very like empathetically,

2124
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,160
if that's the right word,

2125
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,960
like took her hair from her shoulders

2126
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,480
and like made sure it was like splayed.

2127
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,320
Purposefully.

2128
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,000
And it was like flying but it was definitely like

2129
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,240
when the train would slow, it was like it would fall a bit

2130
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,840
and go towards the track and I was like,

2131
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,000
this is, and this is it.

2132
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,600
I'm gonna watch her head get ripped off

2133
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,400
or the whole train's gonna derail.

2134
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,480
And I was hoping for head if I have to pick one.

2135
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,280
Okay, don't hurt us all.

2136
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,280
Turn the gun on yourself first is what I'm saying.

2137
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,560
If her hair had gotten caught on one of those branches,

2138
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,720
she would have been spinning around

2139
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,960
like one of those possums.

2140
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,760
I mean, that would have been cute.

2141
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,200
That's what I wanted to say last week.

2142
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,040
I didn't get to say it.

2143
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:30,880
Oh, well, so you got the mirror.

2144
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,000
I had that in the bank.

2145
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,720
I really wanted to talk about that woman

2146
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:34,560
spinning around like a possum.

2147
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,400
So thanks for the second chance.

2148
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,400
Yeah, it's not often that you get to use

2149
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,640
the line you think of later.

2150
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,480
Yes, that was my best answer.

2151
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,320
So it got brought back up.

2152
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,160
Okay, here we go.

2153
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,840
Oh my God, it's here.

2154
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,240
Just glad I didn't stumble.

2155
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,080
Yeah, you did it.

2156
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:45,920
You nailed it.

2157
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,200
You sure did, boy, historic joke.

2158
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,600
Yeah, so yeah, I remember.

2159
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:56,600
I remember that's my most vivid memory is that photo shoot.

2160
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,840
Yeah. Wow.

2161
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,400
I'm just so excited that more chapter,

2162
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,680
yeah, that we weren't done.

2163
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,280
Which people have asked people,

2164
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,680
I have seen people write us on Twitter and say,

2165
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,280
what was that phrase again

2166
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,720
that you have to say to get those photos?

2167
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,240
Which it's unclear now whether you.

2168
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,200
What was the phrase?

2169
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,280
Are you inspired, I had to say to the photographer.

2170
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,040
And it seems like the result is mixed.

2171
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:16,880
And now it seems like that's not quite.

2172
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,680
Some people don't know it, some people don't.

2173
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,440
They said like you can't, it's like not really,

2174
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,200
that's not really the phrase anymore,

2175
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,960
but the people that roam around,

2176
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,840
you could still get them to like.

2177
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,920
Were you inspired?

2178
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,320
Were you inspired at any time?

2179
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,040
If you were inspired, what would I say now?

2180
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,240
I haven't honestly tried it in a few years, so.

2181
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:43,040
So I think you guys went, as you're saying,

2182
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,120
you went to Carthay a lot.

2183
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,400
Have you ever gone off your usual path

2184
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,560
and tried any of the very old timey drinks

2185
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:54,840
they have, Pimm's Punch, a Negroni, a Sidecar, like.

2186
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,200
No, and I'm disappointed in myself.

2187
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,280
I love Negronis and I love Sidecars.

2188
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,120
Yeah.

2189
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,360
So I should, if I go back, I should try,

2190
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,880
especially if I'm doing a two drink thing,

2191
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,920
if I can ever drink again,

2192
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,080
I'll do a fun old timey drink.

2193
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,040
There's one called a Ginger Rogers,

2194
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:12,720
which is Plymouth Gin, Luxardo, Apricot, L'Cour,

2195
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,080
Noily Prat Dry Vermouth.

2196
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,040
I, of course, start every day with a glass

2197
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,880
of Noily Prat Dry Vermouth.

2198
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,200
And a.

2199
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,040
In your buttermilk.

2200
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,480
A hint of fresh lemon juice.

2201
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,160
That it's served up.

2202
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,000
That sounds good.

2203
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,840
Yeah.

2204
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,920
But not good enough that I want the whole drink.

2205
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,560
You know, like I wanna taste that,

2206
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,400
I don't wanna drink it.

2207
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,220
You could try.

2208
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,060
Yeah.

2209
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:33,900
Yeah.

2210
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,520
That's a problem with a lot of beverages, I feel like.

2211
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,320
With the non-alcoholic blue milk,

2212
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,280
I'm done with that after three sips.

2213
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,120
You, what?

2214
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:41,960
That's in Star Wars.

2215
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,800
Star Wars.

2216
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,640
Blue milk?

2217
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,640
It's more of a slushy-ish thing.

2218
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,760
It's more of like a fruit smoothie.

2219
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,600
Actually milk.

2220
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,720
It's alcoholic in Florida,

2221
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,720
and I'm excited to try it with alcohol in Florida.

2222
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,640
But here, it's just, you get the flavor,

2223
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,280
and then after a few sips, like I'm about to.

2224
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,120
It's not dairy.

2225
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,040
It's like iced rice milk.

2226
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,400
That does, I mean, that's better, but doesn't sound good.

2227
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,280
No, I liked it more than I thought,

2228
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,720
because I really don't like super sugary bullshit.

2229
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,800
Are you a milk boy?

2230
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,320
I'm not a milk boy, and it's not milk,

2231
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,320
so it's not a problem.

2232
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,160
I'm very much not a milk boy.

2233
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,080
Milk shakes have been a problem for me in the recent past.

2234
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,320
I don't drink milk anymore.

2235
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,360
Of the three of us, Aaron,

2236
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,080
who do you think's the biggest milk boy?

2237
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,200
Gosh, if I had to guess, I think it'd be this.

2238
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,120
I'm not making eye contact with you,

2239
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,280
because I can just feel it on me.

2240
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,160
I mean, it would be the guy

2241
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,040
who still orders full glasses of milk.

2242
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,400
I don't order a full glass of milk.

2243
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,680
There was a day during our city walk,

2244
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,240
when you had milk and cookies for dinner one time.

2245
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,200
You were adding me on Twitter.

2246
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,880
Someone had a joke about someone witnessing a date

2247
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,520
where someone ordered a full glass of milk,

2248
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,480
and you tagged me so quickly.

2249
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,600
Because immediately I was like,

2250
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,160
it has to have been Jason.

2251
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,480
I mean, there's a handful of men

2252
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,280
drinking milk as adults.

2253
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,840
There's not many women.

2254
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,800
It feels like a male thing to me,

2255
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,680
or maybe it's a Midwestern thing.

2256
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,720
Not that you're Midwestern,

2257
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,960
but I feel like I could more see a Midwestern woman

2258
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,600
drinking a full glass of milk.

2259
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,200
It's a very 60s thing.

2260
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,520
Yeah, for sure.

2261
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,640
Do you still do milk, a full glass of milk?

2262
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,840
I mostly do the almond milk.

2263
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,120
But you'll drink it as just a glass of milk?

2264
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,320
Not like a juice glass size thing with cookies.

2265
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,920
If I want cookies and milk, I'll have it.

2266
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:31,760
That is so funny.

2267
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,600
But I'm not solo drinking cookies.

2268
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,440
That's still the funniest to me.

2269
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,640
Cookies and milk solo.

2270
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,360
I mean, that's still a glass of milk.

2271
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:41,360
Like four to six ounces?

2272
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,200
Yeah, that's a glass of milk.

2273
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,040
Okay.

2274
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:43,880
It's a decent.

2275
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,720
It's a small pour, but.

2276
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,600
Most adults are putting it in coffee.

2277
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,720
I put it in coffee.

2278
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,040
I put it on special K.

2279
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,280
Okay, you put it on cereal.

2280
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,120
Yeah.

2281
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:52,960
I can't even do that.

2282
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:53,960
Maybe a splash with oatmeal.

2283
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,960
But you will have a cup, and there's milk in it,

2284
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,800
and you drink the milk.

2285
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,320
A small glass to dip cookies in.

2286
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,000
It is primarily dipping cookies.

2287
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,920
It's primarily a cookie dipping.

2288
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,600
I just never got.

2289
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,560
Milk is a cookie dip.

2290
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,840
I've disliked milk since I was a teeny tiny.

2291
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,600
It's never appealed to me.

2292
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,680
I did drink milk probably up through high school.

2293
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,760
Yeah, and then my now wife Erin,

2294
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,600
as soon as we started dating,

2295
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,160
I think I had her parents.

2296
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,040
I was like, can I go get a glass of milk?

2297
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,760
She was like, you want a glass of milk from my parents?

2298
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,280
And then all it took was her.

2299
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,640
She said, you still drink milk?

2300
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,480
Why?

2301
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,320
And then you saw it.

2302
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,160
And then all of a sudden,

2303
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,240
these came out of your body.

2304
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,080
Totally.

2305
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:35,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2306
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,680
It was just a surge of sobering up.

2307
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:39,520
Oh God.

2308
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,360
It's so funny.

2309
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,920
Those moments as an adult are really funny,

2310
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,600
because I feel like you have those moments a lot as a kid

2311
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,560
when you do something that you think is normal,

2312
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,640
and then everyone looks at you,

2313
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,480
and it's like, fuck,

2314
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,920
that was just something my family did,

2315
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,520
or just something I did.

2316
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,400
But it must be so funny as an adult.

2317
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,600
I feel like only occasionally now will I have that,

2318
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,360
but it's kind of a great feeling,

2319
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,200
because it's like, wow,

2320
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,400
I'm still learning about the world.

2321
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,680
There's still mysteries.

2322
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,280
It's not all done for me.

2323
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,520
It's all in the past.

2324
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,360
Yeah.

2325
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:11,280
Learning that hat headache is not a thing everybody gets.

2326
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,000
I'm just disappointed everyone didn't get

2327
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,800
that Easter morning jelly bean trail.

2328
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,640
You know?

2329
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,480
Yeah, no, I didn't get a trail.

2330
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,320
Do you maybe think everybody got,

2331
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,320
that was a standard issue, parent thing.

2332
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,400
I don't know about the jelly bean trail.

2333
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,520
I knew people got Easter baskets.

2334
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,040
I mean, we definitely, we had to search,

2335
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,400
we got an empty basket, and then searched the garden.

2336
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:32,960
For everything.

2337
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,480
So it was like, and my mom was pretty good

2338
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,560
at hiding things, like she would camouflage green on green.

2339
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,880
You know?

2340
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,720
You really had to hunt.

2341
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:44,240
My mother-in-law still does Easter egg hunts to this day.

2342
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,080
It's great.

2343
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,920
Like she hunts, or she makes them for people?

2344
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,680
She provides a hunt for my, for her daughter,

2345
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,880
my wife and me, and the other kids and cousins.

2346
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,680
Like it's adult Easter egg hunts on Easter every year.

2347
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:57,520
It's a blast.

2348
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,840
And they have these lottery tickets inside.

2349
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,120
That's a good little, yeah.

2350
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,800
So then you're at it,

2351
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,360
and everybody's scratching afterwards.

2352
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,200
So it keeps the celebration going.

2353
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,040
You guys are so on board for getting

2354
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,240
a lottery ticket as a gift.

2355
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,160
To me that is, no offense to your mother-in-law,

2356
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,080
but like the cheesiest.

2357
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,000
But man, if one, if one is a big one.

2358
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,280
But you probably don't.

2359
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,960
It's kind of a bullshit gift.

2360
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:19,800
But it's fun.

2361
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,640
She should just give you cash.

2362
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,680
I like it because it's like,

2363
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,280
it's one more hunt after the hunt.

2364
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,680
Yeah, it's the thrill of the chase.

2365
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:25,840
It's the thrill of the chase,

2366
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,880
then you get the thrill, oh my gosh.

2367
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,720
I could seriously see.

2368
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,120
I feel like I associate lottery tickets with,

2369
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,400
nevermind.

2370
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,240
Self-censoring.

2371
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,280
I'll be a nicer, I've grown,

2372
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,720
and I'll be nicer as well.

2373
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,120
I don't associate it with trash.

2374
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:41,960
No.

2375
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:42,800
No.

2376
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,000
So associate it with Charlie Buckets,

2377
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,880
with the, you know, it's the thrill of like,

2378
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,960
Yeah, but at least I came with a chocolate bar.

2379
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,800
Yes, he did get something out of it.

2380
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,680
If the ticket didn't work, you got candy.

2381
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,840
This is just a ticket.

2382
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:57,800
Yeah. Edwin.

2383
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,640
And a bunch of like,

2384
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,920
Edwin's freaking out.

2385
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,240
And a bunch of weird little like scratchy,

2386
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,080
what do you, like,

2387
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,680
the little wormy remnants of lottery ticket goo

2388
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,080
is horrible. That's gross.

2389
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:09,920
That I will say.

2390
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,960
That not as good as a big chocolate bar.

2391
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,840
Right. We can agree on that.

2392
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,240
Let's talk about, oh Jason.

2393
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,080
Carthay Circle.

2394
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,280
Oh, yeah, I was gonna bring it back.

2395
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,960
We hadn't really mentioned the inspiration for this.

2396
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,800
Sure.

2397
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,480
The building, the real life Carthay Circle.

2398
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,600
Yeah.

2399
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,680
Which used to be in Los Angeles,

2400
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,720
located 6316 San Vicente Boulevard.

2401
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,080
I checked a satellite map.

2402
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,880
It is now office buildings.

2403
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,520
And a really boring office building too.

2404
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,360
It's gone?

2405
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,200
Yeah.

2406
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,040
Yeah, it was demolished in 1969.

2407
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:38,880
Oh.

2408
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,720
Yeah.

2409
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:40,960
I didn't actually know it was based on anything,

2410
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,080
but now that I've learned that

2411
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,480
and then also learned it was demolished

2412
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,680
in the same sentence, I'm really sad.

2413
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,120
Roller coaster ride for you.

2414
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,720
It's like when I learned the stars of Twilight had dated,

2415
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,560
but then they broke up.

2416
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,920
I learned it all in one minute.

2417
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,760
Oh no.

2418
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:55,200
And I was so excited and then so sad for them.

2419
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,720
All the emotions at once.

2420
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,680
And our president had a lot of opinions on the subjects.

2421
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,800
Yes, he tweeted about that.

2422
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,520
He tweeted about it so many times.

2423
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,360
The Twilight?

2424
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,200
He tweeted about like,

2425
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:10,360
Stuart treated Pattinson like a dog

2426
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,600
or he had that weird phrase.

2427
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,720
Pattinson side, obviously.

2428
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,240
Yeah. Oh boy.

2429
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,480
Yeah, so many tweets about that couple.

2430
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,320
Anyway.

2431
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,160
Wow.

2432
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,000
Back to the 60s.

2433
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,840
So the real Carthay Circle took its name

2434
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,800
because the auditorium, it was a theater.

2435
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,080
It was a movie theater.

2436
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,560
The auditorium was a perfect circle

2437
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,520
inside of a square building.

2438
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,400
Like the Cinerama Dome today.

2439
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,240
Yes.

2440
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,080
Sort of an equivalent

2441
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,280
and probably like when those were both open

2442
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,520
at the same time, probably the two best places to see

2443
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,640
original like nice print movies in the 50s and 60s.

2444
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:49,000
Yeah, before, like it showed a lot of road shows.

2445
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,760
Like before multiplexes, there was like a more,

2446
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,680
a smaller number of prints

2447
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,160
and they were usually very high quality prints

2448
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,920
that would travel around.

2449
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,720
So this would show very high quality prints of movies,

2450
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,360
hosted movie premieres.

2451
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,720
The big Disney connection is that it hosted the premiere

2452
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,520
of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

2453
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,560
Also hosted the premiere of Gone with the Wind,

2454
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:15,080
the 1936 version of Romeo and Juliet

2455
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:19,320
and 1937 best picture winner, the life of Emile Zola.

2456
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,320
Yeah.

2457
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,160
Yeah.

2458
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,080
Hey, don't forget,

2459
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,520
let's show some love to the first premiere ever held there.

2460
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,640
Cecil B. DeMille's The Volga Boatman.

2461
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,480
Yeah.

2462
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,440
Yeah.

2463
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,320
Also where my Volga head's at.

2464
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,200
It's more, even more insane to me

2465
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,760
that they changed Tower of Terror.

2466
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,320
It fits so well with the time.

2467
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,160
Oh yeah, the era.

2468
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,280
Oh, like actually doing this 30s centerpiece,

2469
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,600
made it connect to a 30s hotel.

2470
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,440
That's true.

2471
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,400
It would have been, it's weird

2472
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,080
cause like the whole Hollywood street

2473
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:49,920
is supposed to be like that

2474
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,160
but it's still like not that well themed.

2475
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,600
It's still like kind of themed

2476
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,080
but the car today is so well themed.

2477
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,360
It felt like if they were like next to each other

2478
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,680
it would have been almost perfect.

2479
01:16:58,680 --> 01:16:59,520
But you get a bunch of that,

2480
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,360
you get that crap plastic Hollywood in between.

2481
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,120
But it just all had that old California feel

2482
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,600
which is to me what it's supposed,

2483
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,200
like that's what California Adventure's supposed to be.

2484
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,120
I mean, and don't get me wrong,

2485
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,760
I like Guardians of the Galaxy.

2486
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,360
I just don't understand why they had to shove it

2487
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,160
into a cool Twilight Zone ride.

2488
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,720
Like why did they do that?

2489
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,840
Why did they just build a new one?

2490
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,360
Cheap because it's cheaper.

2491
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,800
They don't want to license the Twilight Zone anymore.

2492
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,640
That's not true though.

2493
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,480
That doesn't matter.

2494
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,320
It's not that much money.

2495
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,160
It's not that much money.

2496
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,120
It's not that much.

2497
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,160
I'm just saying I think it was like they wanted it quick

2498
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,920
and they wanted it cheap or.

2499
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,800
Have you been on it?

2500
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,640
Guardians?

2501
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,480
I mean of course you have.

2502
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,320
Yeah it's great.

2503
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,160
Yeah.

2504
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,000
I haven't been on it.

2505
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,440
But the one in Florida is still Twilight Zone

2506
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,160
and it's the better version.

2507
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,880
I mean, who's gonna go to Florida?

2508
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,720
We're going in the mall.

2509
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,560
We're going in the mall.

2510
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,520
Tickets are still on sale.

2511
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,360
Oh yeah, you have a tour.

2512
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,320
I saw that somewhere.

2513
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,000
We sure do, so come see us in Orlando.

2514
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,200
In Orlando, the 24th.

2515
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,520
That's so exciting.

2516
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,360
Yeah.

2517
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,080
I know, we're all going to Disney World together.

2518
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,680
As early kids set in,

2519
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,320
we've been friends for two years

2520
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,640
and now our first en masse trip.

2521
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,480
Yeah.

2522
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,320
This is really exciting.

2523
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,160
It's gonna, we're a good boy.

2524
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,160
I hope a lot of photographers are inspired down there.

2525
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,400
And are you gonna do like on the road podcasts

2526
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,520
like as you're there?

2527
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,360
Like.

2528
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,200
No, probably not.

2529
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,520
We weren't gonna but.

2530
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,560
A little hotel room podcast after a day at the park?

2531
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,400
I mean maybe.

2532
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,360
Maybe we should, I don't know.

2533
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,200
Maybe perhaps.

2534
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,920
Sounds like there's not a lot of excitement about it.

2535
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,320
Not a bad idea.

2536
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,160
Yeah.

2537
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,360
We are staying at three different hotels

2538
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,120
on multiple different flights.

2539
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,240
Yeah.

2540
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,080
Yeah.

2541
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,440
We're split up.

2542
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,240
But if that's something people want, we could do.

2543
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,280
But then we're gonna take time out of being in the park.

2544
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,560
Yeah, the problem with that is that like

2545
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,560
we just want to do the live show and just go on rides.

2546
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,000
Well yeah, and you'd have to bring all your equipment which.

2547
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,440
Yeah, it's a little bit of a pain.

2548
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:35,280
It's a lot.

2549
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,080
We'll have to bring some of it though.

2550
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:37,920
We'll do a little.

2551
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,200
Because we have to record the live shows.

2552
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,720
Well, I could be wrong about this.

2553
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:42,840
Weren't they initially thinking

2554
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,000
maybe they would actually build the Carthay as a theater

2555
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,280
and have premieres there?

2556
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,200
Wasn't that an idea?

2557
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,040
I've seen floated.

2558
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:48,880
Maybe.

2559
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:49,720
That could be totally wrong.

2560
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,040
At California Adventure.

2561
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:52,880
Oh, possibly.

2562
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,720
Yeah, I don't think, and I think when it opened

2563
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,080
I wasn't even aware of what was inside.

2564
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,040
I knew there was this new centerpiece they were building

2565
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,080
but the fact that it was a nice restaurant and bar

2566
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,160
I don't think I was aware of.

2567
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:06,080
I also think a lot of tourists don't know

2568
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:09,800
because this is easy to get into.

2569
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,640
Like the lounge is very easy.

2570
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:12,480
Not after this podcast.

2571
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,320
I guess not after this.

2572
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,760
We've blown the lid off of it.

2573
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,080
But you have to get in line outside.

2574
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,920
Yeah, sometimes it goes and goes.

2575
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,760
Sometimes it can be 20-ish minutes.

2576
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:19,600
Yeah, but yeah, you're right.

2577
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,440
It's not terrible though.

2578
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,840
It's not like you need a reservation.

2579
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,680
Like the restaurant.

2580
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,160
I wonder if it's going that way.

2581
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,000
I don't know.

2582
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:25,840
Yeah, I don't know.

2583
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,400
Because it does feel like it's never so crazy bad.

2584
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,200
And so worth it no matter what.

2585
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,040
And yeah, for 20 minutes you're still.

2586
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,160
Like you need it.

2587
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,880
It's not something that we can pass up.

2588
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,720
No.

2589
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,400
It's funny, what usually has the longer line

2590
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,720
and I think because it's open air and people can see it

2591
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:46,720
is the bar at the pier, at what is now Pixar Pier.

2592
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,080
So many people.

2593
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,760
People might think that's the only bar there.

2594
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,040
Yeah, because you can see it's a bar

2595
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,680
with a view of the water.

2596
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,480
And people also probably just want to drink at that point.

2597
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,840
Like this is an experience.

2598
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,120
This is like we're gonna sit in a dark,

2599
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,760
like non-Disney feeling atmosphere

2600
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,640
and really like.

2601
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,480
That's true.

2602
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,240
It's like cutting the day in half.

2603
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,080
It's a very good point.

2604
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,120
It's great that it doesn't feel that Disney-ish.

2605
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:10,960
It doesn't feel Disney.

2606
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:11,800
Other than there's a little nod.

2607
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,620
Here's like the little,

2608
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:15,320
there's a little Oscar of Snow White or something or other.

2609
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,160
But like.

2610
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,000
Sure, I mean they have like,

2611
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,920
there's exactly like nicer hints at it.

2612
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,720
But there is not the like,

2613
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:26,720
we built this to look like a fake interior of a, you know.

2614
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:27,560
Yeah.

2615
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,400
It's just art.

2616
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,000
Because you need a break from the,

2617
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,640
like I can get my,

2618
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,720
when there's people who don't understand

2619
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:33,760
going to Disneyland all the time,

2620
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,240
I can understand needing the break

2621
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,280
from just like cartoons in your face all the time.

2622
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,200
It's just like a.

2623
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,200
It's nice though because it's like a break with ambience.

2624
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,520
It's not like going back to your hotel room

2625
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,600
and taking a break where you're just in like no.

2626
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,440
No aesthetic.

2627
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,280
Nothing.

2628
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,200
Like this really is like,

2629
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,720
you've traveled back in time.

2630
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,560
Yeah.

2631
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:52,400
It's art deco.

2632
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,800
There's a lot of pictures of old Hollywood stuff.

2633
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,120
Some very funny pictures of Walt Disney

2634
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,920
where they have very clearly

2635
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,480
Photoshopped a cigarette out of his hand.

2636
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,160
So he's just got two fingers.

2637
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,720
That is hilarious.

2638
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,560
Like this.

2639
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,400
Just waving his finger.

2640
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,720
Have I told you my Walt Disney story?

2641
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,800
It's not my Walt Disney story.

2642
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,440
My mom met Walt Disney.

2643
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,260
What?

2644
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,100
Really?

2645
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:15,920
This story you've told before.

2646
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,240
It's insane.

2647
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,080
It's insane.

2648
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,920
When my mom was little,

2649
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,160
her family went to Disneyland

2650
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,080
and so I don't know what,

2651
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,960
this probably was in the 60s.

2652
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:30,040
And she saw Walt Disney sitting there

2653
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,240
and like was so like thrilled

2654
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,800
and went over and she asked him for his autograph.

2655
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,440
And he said, Jesus Christ kid,

2656
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,240
can't you see him eating a hot dog?

2657
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:40,440
And like that was the interaction.

2658
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,600
And she walked away and was really upset.

2659
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,440
Sure.

2660
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,280
Wow.

2661
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,120
Yeah.

2662
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,200
That's not at all like Tom Hanks

2663
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,760
giving out little business cards

2664
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,280
with his autograph already on it

2665
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,480
like in that movie.

2666
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,500
And just to make people aware,

2667
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,640
that is what will happen if you approach Jason

2668
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,120
after one of our live shows.

2669
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,120
I've gotten that answer from Jason many a time.

2670
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:04,960
Okay.

2671
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,800
Aaron, I did a Harold

2672
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,800
and then I had to come down with a hot dog.

2673
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,640
It was bad enough.

2674
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,920
I had to listen to a rotating cast of dipshits

2675
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,560
and then they just give us notes.

2676
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,720
I just wanted to go through the scene one more time

2677
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,960
to be like, I'm sorry if you didn't get

2678
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,440
what I was going for.

2679
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,240
That classic Harold fight.

2680
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,640
I know.

2681
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,480
Noting you by apologizing.

2682
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,320
Yes.

2683
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,160
Yeah.

2684
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,280
Oh gosh.

2685
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,120
We at locally mostly didn't do that.

2686
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,840
Oxy improv truly is the highest form of annoyance.

2687
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,240
Yeah, no, we were pretty good about that.

2688
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,080
We were good about that.

2689
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,280
I mean, there would be occasions

2690
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,600
where I truly was apologizing

2691
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,480
because I was like, well, I fucked that up.

2692
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,480
I think we all did.

2693
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,320
Yeah.

2694
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,160
Yeah.

2695
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:53,200
I have another story about Walt being persnickety

2696
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:57,080
that ties back into the Carthay Circle Theater.

2697
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,720
In the early days, pre-Mickey,

2698
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:02,020
then the days of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit,

2699
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,800
there was the gentleman Fritz Freeling

2700
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,800
who went on to become a Warner Brothers legend,

2701
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,600
but he was an animator for Walt's in the 20s.

2702
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,080
This is all from Yesterland.

2703
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,840
He woke up to find a small but painful boil on his rear end.

2704
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,520
So he phoned in sick to the Disney studio.

2705
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,320
Fritz decided the best way to take his mind off his pain

2706
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,480
was to take an open air double decker bus

2707
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,840
to see a flick at the Carthay Circle at the real theater.

2708
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,080
So he's like, I don't feel up to animating today,

2709
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,760
but I'm just gonna get some fresh air

2710
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,600
and go see a movie,

2711
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,640
take my mind off of this boil on my butt.

2712
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,640
That's how you knocked the cobwebs out in the old days.

2713
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,120
According to Don Draper.

2714
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,440
Get on it.

2715
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,280
Here's what you do.

2716
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,640
This never happened.

2717
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,440
Just pretend this never happened.

2718
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,680
Get on a double decker bus and get to the movies.

2719
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,040
He was mostly dealing with people

2720
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,600
having boils on their butt.

2721
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,480
So this guy's on a double decker bus.

2722
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,840
Sorry, I'm gonna go relax a little bit

2723
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,760
to go see a movie at Carthay Circle.

2724
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,880
The bus stops at a stoplight

2725
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:13,080
and then next to him in his moon roadster,

2726
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,880
Walt Disney who turns, spots Fritz's eyes,

2727
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,680
gives him a look like, so sick, huh?

2728
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,680
They feel off in different ways.

2729
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,600
When he gets home, he is fired from the Disney studio.

2730
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,200
So a trip to Carthay Circle caused the firing

2731
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,920
of Fritz Frieling who, by the way,

2732
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,400
went on to direct 200 Warner Brothers cartoons,

2733
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,040
is the main person responsible for Sylvester Tweedy

2734
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,360
and Yosemite Sam among many, many, many other things.

2735
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,920
So he like a lot because of being mad

2736
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,120
about a boil on a butt, Walt lost one of the great talents

2737
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,080
in the history of animation.

2738
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:47,920
Geez.

2739
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,320
So it just goes to show folks,

2740
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:52,360
go to the doctors before the movies.

2741
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,720
Go to the doc because then you get the little note,

2742
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,320
you waggle your script or your note.

2743
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,160
Waggle the little note.

2744
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,000
Waggle the script.

2745
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,720
At your eccentric movie studio boss.

2746
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,720
You waggle the doctor's script.

2747
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,760
The doctor says I gotta ride the double decker bus.

2748
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,800
The doctor said I gotta ride the bus.

2749
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,200
Or at least ride on the side of the double decker bus

2750
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,480
facing the opposing traffic.

2751
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,640
But you can't control what lane the driver.

2752
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,760
You don't know which way Walt's coming from.

2753
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,000
Well, wear a hat and sunglasses is what you do.

2754
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,840
So your boss doesn't,

2755
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,440
your boss who also isn't at the office that day.

2756
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,360
Right, why was he out?

2757
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,200
Yeah, fuck you.

2758
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,360
Probably also at the movies, knocking the cobwebs out.

2759
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,960
He had a boil on his butt too.

2760
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,000
He had stress boils all the time.

2761
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,560
Boils on butts are more common than we realize.

2762
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,840
Yeah, especially in the old days.

2763
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:41,680
In the 20s.

2764
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:44,800
How do you know if it's a zit or a boil?

2765
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,640
No, you would never.

2766
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,480
I'm not sure I've had a boil.

2767
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,040
As it can probably become a boil.

2768
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,040
What's the difference?

2769
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,520
I don't know, is a boil like a bedsore

2770
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,240
or is it like a cyst?

2771
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,080
I'm not sure.

2772
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,200
I think it's closer to a cyst.

2773
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,440
Yeah.

2774
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,440
I don't think I've ever had a boil either.

2775
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,880
Have you had a boil out there in podcast land?

2776
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,640
Send us a picture, we'll evaluate.

2777
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,280
Tweet at us, at our personal accounts.

2778
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,800
Yeah, you know what, just send it to Jason

2779
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,320
and he'll show it to us.

2780
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,240
I was just gonna say that there's a secret lounge

2781
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,480
called the Terrace Lounge that I have yet to stay.

2782
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,400
I haven't, you have to ask for it

2783
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,640
and it's like outdoor a little bit up.

2784
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,480
At Carthay?

2785
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:18,320
Yeah, at Carthay.

2786
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,160
Whoa.

2787
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,000
And we haven't done it yet.

2788
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,840
We haven't done this yet.

2789
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,600
A newer condition.

2790
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,440
But you know what?

2791
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:27,560
I mean, I'd wanna sneak in and see it before I settled.

2792
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,520
Well, yeah, I think you'd wanna try it.

2793
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,480
Is it the upstairs, are you talking about upstairs

2794
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,320
or just the outside on the lower level?

2795
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,680
Try it to be too well lit.

2796
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:37,560
Yeah, you know what that is.

2797
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,400
I don't want the ambiance to be ruined.

2798
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,960
You know what the outdoors is like.

2799
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,600
You go to a specific place for a 30s vibe.

2800
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,920
Maybe that's the reason we haven't done it.

2801
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,040
Subconsciously, we're like, do we care?

2802
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,840
I can see the sky wherever.

2803
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,600
It might not be as good, but it's like a little tiny room.

2804
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,560
So it's one time you'd like to do it.

2805
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,080
Yeah, well, it's true, you gotta try it.

2806
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,760
Yeah, so you gotta try it.

2807
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,480
So anyway, we'll do it eventually.

2808
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,320
I wish the haunted mansion had a little cocktail area.

2809
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,160
Of course.

2810
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,120
I want a haunted cocktail.

2811
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,720
They really should, that is crazy that they're just,

2812
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,000
they're leaving so much money on the table not doing that.

2813
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,200
But again, it was Walt's wish to not have alcohol

2814
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,040
in this park.

2815
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,160
And we must obey the wishes of this man

2816
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,880
who yelled at children about hot dogs

2817
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,680
and fired people for having boils.

2818
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,560
I will say he has a point, because I think about like,

2819
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,480
if you have nice, expensive cocktails,

2820
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,320
you at least knock out the people who are gonna have

2821
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,080
like four beers and then throw up on a ride.

2822
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,560
Being thrown up on a ride is so horrible.

2823
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,040
I got thrown up on the Simpsons ride at Universal.

2824
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,000
Oh my God.

2825
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,120
That's close quarters too.

2826
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,680
And then you're just stuck, like just going up and down.

2827
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,920
The guy like leaned down and threw up between his feet

2828
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,600
and it was like sprayed up on my pants.

2829
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,600
And I was like, I was not nice.

2830
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,560
Did you know them?

2831
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,520
No, it was a strange drunk man.

2832
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,280
And you could tell it was a drunken thing.

2833
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,320
Oh, he was, he could barely stand up in line.

2834
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:54,440
God.

2835
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,680
So that level of drinking at a park, I do kind of go,

2836
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,560
I see why you would wanna avoid it.

2837
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,360
I think maybe you can avoid it if you do $18 craft cocktails,

2838
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,680
but I mean.

2839
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:05,520
Yeah, but still.

2840
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,720
That's what they've landed on with Oga's Cantina

2841
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,280
in Galaxy's Edge where it's you sit and there's a cap

2842
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,720
and it's not like walking around the park

2843
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:18,040
with like gigantic beers that you can refill

2844
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,080
and refill and refill.

2845
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,160
Maybe that's a pay avoid.

2846
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,200
Actually recommend like if you're gonna get two,

2847
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,920
what are them both now?

2848
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,440
And we need your card now and we're gonna close you out.

2849
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:30,800
Like it's a different procedure than a normal bar.

2850
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,720
But it's a smaller space

2851
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,560
and they gotta rotate people in and out.

2852
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,680
But it's still, I never felt rushed.

2853
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,960
Like I've never felt like.

2854
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,800
No, there hasn't been that moment where, yeah,

2855
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,080
we're wondering if a stormtrooper comes in.

2856
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,600
Can you hang out for a while though?

2857
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,080
Is it like a car day where you could spend

2858
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,400
an hour and a half talking?

2859
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,240
Not quite.

2860
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,080
Not quite.

2861
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,440
But you probably, they're probably eyeing you

2862
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:51,640
after an hour.

2863
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:53,160
But we don't know what that means, maybe not.

2864
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,800
Right, I was thrown up on in sixth grade

2865
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,560
by my friend on the Tilted Whirl.

2866
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,680
That's a really bad ride to be thrown up on.

2867
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,480
Yeah, because that just gets pushed on you.

2868
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,520
And there were like five of us on the ride.

2869
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,600
I was like five or six kids on the ride.

2870
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,440
Jesus Christ.

2871
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,280
Crammed.

2872
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,120
That's a trauma.

2873
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,880
And he was like, whoa.

2874
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:11,720
He was next to me.

2875
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,720
He was on the far right and then I was next.

2876
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,800
And then no one got any throw up on them except for me.

2877
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,200
That's one of the few times where it's worse for you

2878
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,680
than the person who threw up.

2879
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,760
Yes, I think so.

2880
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,600
I mean he was.

2881
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,080
He probably felt better and also it landed all over you.

2882
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:29,640
Yeah, he was not full of, I mean he was very upset.

2883
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:30,480
Sure.

2884
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,320
But yes, I was humiliated.

2885
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,600
There was like a girl my age on the coaster.

2886
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,760
That would be like a stand by me issue for me.

2887
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,960
Like I'd throw up, the person who saw me throw up

2888
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,280
would throw up.

2889
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,120
Yeah.

2890
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:43,960
Big trail.

2891
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,680
My sister was on the ride and then a girl my age,

2892
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:48,520
I was humiliated.

2893
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,600
It was, ugh, anyway.

2894
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,440
It's just so.

2895
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,280
He wasn't drunk though.

2896
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,520
Is this what Mike opened up about at Kurt Day?

2897
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,360
I don't think I talked.

2898
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,720
No, I don't think I had known.

2899
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,080
I don't think I knew about that one.

2900
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,440
The throw up incident?

2901
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,280
Yeah.

2902
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,520
Where it all went wrong.

2903
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,320
This has become such a, it has been a gross episode

2904
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,400
for being about this classy.

2905
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,040
Well I like to bring my brand.

2906
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:10,800
You've placed some.

2907
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:11,640
The brand is strong.

2908
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,200
Actually if I could keep it a little,

2909
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,800
I missed one, we missed one thing about original

2910
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,160
Carthage Circle, the theater, is that perhaps

2911
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:21,000
this was the place that had Disney's first attempt

2912
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,320
at a themed environment you could walk around in

2913
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,960
because if you went to go see Snow White

2914
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,280
and the Seven Dwarfs there, you first had to walk

2915
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,720
through a place called Dwarfland.

2916
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,560
Ooh.

2917
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,200
And here's a picture of Dwarfland.

2918
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,040
Oh.

2919
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,200
See you say aw.

2920
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,160
I think these are scary.

2921
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,080
I'm scared of these dwarfs in Dwarfland.

2922
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:38,920
Oh.

2923
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,240
I think they look like the dwarfs.

2924
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,360
I think the facade looks really good,

2925
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,160
but it's clearly early days of like.

2926
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,440
Costume characters.

2927
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,960
Well and also of note, the Snow White premiere

2928
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,280
is the first place that Walt ever attempted

2929
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,000
costume characters of any kind.

2930
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,160
It's the only place that a costumed Mickey and Minnie

2931
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,600
showed up, which I have a picture of,

2932
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,040
which I'll try to remember to post.

2933
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,560
But they look very bizarre.

2934
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,720
Not scary quite, but they just have like really odd,

2935
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,960
narrow snouts.

2936
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,720
They look, Mickey and Minnie look like weasels or something.

2937
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,240
Are these people playing dwarfs?

2938
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,720
Do you think they're little people?

2939
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,560
Hmm.

2940
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,440
Perhaps, or children who caught Walt in a bad mood.

2941
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,120
Yeah, maybe my mom's in there.

2942
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:20,960
Yeah.

2943
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,520
Hey you, you're sleepy now.

2944
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,600
Over here.

2945
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:27,440
You wanna be around me, huh?

2946
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,560
I've been sleeping all day.

2947
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,960
And then she's trapped in a costume.

2948
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,080
She can't take it off.

2949
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,120
It's locked from the inside.

2950
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,600
It's locked.

2951
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,520
If we wanna keep talking about gross stuff,

2952
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,840
but this is not gross, the bathroom's at Carthay.

2953
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,680
Yeah.

2954
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:42,520
Unbelievable.

2955
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:43,360
Oh boy, unbelievable.

2956
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,120
Like it's a break within a break.

2957
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:45,960
Yes.

2958
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,640
Stalls that go floor to ceiling.

2959
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:49,400
And dark, dark wood.

2960
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,240
Dark wood.

2961
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,080
Perfectly lit.

2962
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,040
Like you look in the mirror and you're like,

2963
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,600
how after eight hours of walking around

2964
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:56,880
do I look like I'm glowing?

2965
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,720
Mm-hmm.

2966
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,000
You look like a star in one of your old Hollywood films.

2967
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:01,800
And it's quiet.

2968
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,640
Very quiet.

2969
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,120
I don't think, I mean maybe, is there music playing?

2970
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:04,960
There is.

2971
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,440
Okay, well it's definitely not like,

2972
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,160
do do do do do do.

2973
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:11,040
It's jazzy versions of Disney songs.

2974
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:11,880
Oh yeah.

2975
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:12,920
Oh I just remember being so calm.

2976
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,240
Yeah, but I mean it's very low.

2977
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:15,080
It's not allowed.

2978
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,400
Slow down, very.

2979
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,720
Slow down, jazzy.

2980
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,760
Jazzy, bare necessities in there.

2981
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:23,080
La la la la la.

2982
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,520
Not like movie trailers, slow down.

2983
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,400
Oh yeah, the scariest thing.

2984
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,360
It's so scary every time you hear it.

2985
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,280
Yeah.

2986
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,520
Yeah, that is just,

2987
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,720
and you walk down such a long, beautiful hallway.

2988
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,040
I wanna say it's like that dark red carpet.

2989
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,000
Yeah, you go up those stairs.

2990
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,280
And then on the left and right are the bathrooms.

2991
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,480
Yeah, and there's like, there's photographs right?

2992
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:44,320
Like black and white photographs on the sides.

2993
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,960
Walton Shirley Temple I believe is right there.

2994
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:47,800
Mm-hmm.

2995
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,280
And it's always very quiet up there.

2996
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:52,240
You could easily stand and hang out in that hallway

2997
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,720
and one or two people would pass you.

2998
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,520
It's not like a, it's jam packed.

2999
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:59,680
There's one stall I believe in the male bathroom.

3000
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,440
I assume there would be like at least two in the female.

3001
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,680
But there's more, it's like six.

3002
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,160
Is it that many, wow.

3003
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,000
That's great.

3004
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,840
I mean, I think, isn't that my wrong?

3005
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:07,680
There's only one?

3006
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:08,520
There's two.

3007
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,360
Maybe there's two.

3008
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,800
Ours is a pretty, it's a big hallway shaped,

3009
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,760
like a large hall kind of.

3010
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,280
Oh yeah, but those are the best bath,

3011
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,120
I think those are the best bathrooms in the park.

3012
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,400
I think, now I'm like maybe I'm picturing it wrong.

3013
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,520
It might just be three or four.

3014
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,360
Sure.

3015
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,880
Yeah, so clean, so chill.

3016
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,160
I actually, I have the opposite.

3017
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:28,200
I don't feel like a movie star when I look in that mirror.

3018
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,160
I feel like self conscious for perhaps being in shorts

3019
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,000
and a visor in this fancy place.

3020
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,440
The thing about that place is like you walk in

3021
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,840
and you're like surely they're not gonna want us to come in.

3022
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,960
But then it's like everyone there's at Disneyland.

3023
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:39,800
Right.

3024
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,560
No one is dressing up to go just there, probably.

3025
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:43,600
Maybe, maybe.

3026
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,920
But like, it's mostly tourists who look worse than you.

3027
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,760
Yeah, yeah.

3028
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,000
But it does feel like you should have a top hat on.

3029
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:51,880
It does, yeah.

3030
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,480
And then you kinda wish you did.

3031
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,760
Yes, yes.

3032
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,160
I guess if we have a dinner reservation,

3033
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,000
we should all wear our top hats.

3034
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,440
We all get fancy, go to.

3035
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:00,680
I do sometimes wanna do dinner there.

3036
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:02,440
Yeah, well maybe that's the sequel to this

3037
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:05,120
is we all go in tuxes and tails.

3038
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,440
Yeah, yeah.

3039
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:07,520
And then just be hor,

3040
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,880
or like just so uncomfortable on the rides.

3041
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:13,680
Yeah, our like $200 top hats go flying off the coast.

3042
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:14,520
Maybe it's like a.

3043
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,360
Doesn't fit in the basket on a credit coaster.

3044
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:18,000
No, shit.

3045
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,520
I think we'd have to do a locker situation.

3046
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,920
We'd have to have a change.

3047
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:21,760
Oh yeah.

3048
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,600
That's true.

3049
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:23,440
That's a whole thing.

3050
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,260
All right, nevermind.

3051
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:25,620
We can go, but not the top hat.

3052
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:26,540
Yeah, no.

3053
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:27,820
Except for Jason.

3054
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:29,220
I have a top hat.

3055
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,060
Do you?

3056
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:31,340
For the live show I had one.

3057
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,180
Oh yeah, you're right.

3058
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:33,260
For the live show I bought a top hat.

3059
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:34,820
You gotta wear that top hat more.

3060
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:36,460
Yeah, every time we record.

3061
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:37,780
I want you to be a fancy,

3062
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:39,820
I want you as you get into your older age,

3063
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:42,020
getting to be more of a fancy man in general.

3064
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:43,660
Like a Paul F. Tompkins.

3065
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:45,380
Yeah.

3066
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:46,620
Whatever that means to you,

3067
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:47,900
whatever your spin is on that.

3068
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:48,980
A lot of hat headaches though.

3069
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:49,820
Oh yeah, nevermind.

3070
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:50,660
Does he offer lessons?

3071
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,100
Does Paul offer like sartorial lessons?

3072
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,700
Yeah, he's a PF teacher.

3073
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:55,540
Yeah.

3074
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:56,380
Yeah.

3075
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:57,220
All right.

3076
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,060
Great.

3077
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:03,620
We haven't talked about the food

3078
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:05,260
that you can get in the lounge.

3079
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:06,940
It's shuffled what the food is a lot,

3080
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:08,260
I feel like in the many years.

3081
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:09,860
You know, it's always fine.

3082
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:11,860
I have this thing with Disneyland,

3083
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:13,340
I don't, like you're always,

3084
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,220
you always end up sitting at these places

3085
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:18,060
and buying flat breads that are three times

3086
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:19,620
more expensive than what you get.

3087
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:20,820
But I don't mind it.

3088
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:21,780
It's like part of it.

3089
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:23,060
I'm satisfied by them.

3090
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:25,380
I know it's stupid, I'm paying too much.

3091
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:26,940
But I'm usually in such a good mood

3092
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:28,780
from the alcohol consumption

3093
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:30,660
and from the taking the break that.

3094
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:31,980
Yeah, you're really more just excited

3095
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:33,700
to have someone bring something to you

3096
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:34,540
while you're seated.

3097
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:35,940
Yeah, it could be almost anything.

3098
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,980
It could be a plate of poop and I'd still be.

3099
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:38,820
All right.

3100
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:39,660
Okay, Scott.

3101
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:40,500
Brought to me by a,

3102
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:41,340
he's gross.

3103
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:42,780
He's even a gris.

3104
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,700
This is gonna be another moment for you.

3105
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:45,740
Like the milk.

3106
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:48,380
Other people don't like to eat plates of poop.

3107
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:49,220
No.

3108
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:51,660
I'm sorry to humiliate you on podcast.

3109
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:53,380
But my family.

3110
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:55,980
Yeah, it's just your family thing.

3111
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,580
It's just your family.

3112
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:58,420
The flat breads,

3113
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:00,940
Disney I think got into flat breads like 10 years ago

3114
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:03,820
because they realized the margins on them are incredible.

3115
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:06,660
Like the ingredients are so cheap

3116
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:08,940
and you can charge like 15 bucks for them

3117
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:10,700
and make it look a little nice.

3118
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,260
Yeah, and you can say with olive oil,

3119
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:13,100
like the cheapest thing,

3120
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:16,340
you're just dipping bread in olive oil.

3121
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:18,340
Which is like a delicious thing.

3122
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,180
I feel like we,

3123
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:21,580
I feel like they had some kind of like Korean taco

3124
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:23,340
that we got a few times.

3125
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,180
The Vietnamese tacos.

3126
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,340
Yeah, those are pretty good.

3127
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:27,500
They're very salty and I love salt.

3128
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,780
So I was like a shock that it was too salty for me.

3129
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:33,380
I think also they have like a chips and fondue type thing.

3130
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:34,340
Yeah, we would get that,

3131
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:36,860
but for me we had to get it without a lot of things.

3132
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:37,700
Right.

3133
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,980
I can't do the jalapenos or the sour cream

3134
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:39,980
or whatever it came with.

3135
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:40,820
Yeah.

3136
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:41,860
Cheese plate's fine.

3137
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:43,340
Cheese plate I've had, yeah.

3138
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:44,180
Everything fine.

3139
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,140
They were crisp I like.

3140
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:45,980
Fine, everything.

3141
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:47,020
But better than the park.

3142
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:47,860
I mean better.

3143
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:48,700
Yes, 100%.

3144
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:49,540
Yeah.

3145
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:50,820
But it's a lot of small but,

3146
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:52,140
it's hard to fill up.

3147
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,260
I do wish that they'd let you order off the menu

3148
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:55,100
in the lounge.

3149
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:55,940
They don't do that.

3150
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:57,220
It's a specific lounge menu.

3151
01:36:57,220 --> 01:37:00,020
You can't be like, but I wanna order a burger.

3152
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:00,860
Right.

3153
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:01,700
No.

3154
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:02,520
No.

3155
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:03,360
Too bad.

3156
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,180
But you get to sit and you know what's,

3157
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:06,340
I think the chairs are nice, the table,

3158
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:07,980
just literally everything around.

3159
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:08,820
There's different ways to sit.

3160
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:10,820
So you can sit in the little smaller tables

3161
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:13,100
which have the nice kind of cushy chairs

3162
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,100
or you can sit at the high top tables.

3163
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:17,340
Yeah, we've done both based on what was available.

3164
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:18,460
What's available.

3165
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:19,780
Both of them have their,

3166
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:20,860
they have their pluses.

3167
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:22,700
I have to say, I mean,

3168
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,060
I think the first time we were there,

3169
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:25,700
we sat at the high table and so I really liked it.

3170
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,180
But then when we got those low chairs,

3171
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,580
I mean that is comfy.

3172
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:30,420
Yes.

3173
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:31,260
Link.

3174
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:32,860
And sometimes you get seated just outside the lounge

3175
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:34,260
and sort of the lobby,

3176
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:35,860
which at first I thought would be kind of sad,

3177
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:37,500
but I liked that atmosphere too.

3178
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,340
That's good too.

3179
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:39,180
Good to stare at that.

3180
01:37:39,180 --> 01:37:40,020
You're still like in a corner.

3181
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,340
You're still like cozy.

3182
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:42,180
Yeah.

3183
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:43,000
Nice staircase.

3184
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:43,840
Yeah, you're near the staircase.

3185
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,100
The elevator, you can watch that.

3186
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,660
Not really be used probably,

3187
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:48,940
but they give you that option.

3188
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:51,980
Truly anytime I'm taking someone there

3189
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,220
and they haven't been in a while,

3190
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:56,820
this is the spot and this always work.

3191
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:58,860
It's literally never failed,

3192
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:02,860
whether it's like when I first kind of took my mom out here

3193
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:04,540
or when like my buddy from back home

3194
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:05,380
and I was like, let's go to Disney.

3195
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:06,340
And he's like, I don't know,

3196
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,180
I don't really want to go.

3197
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:09,980
I go, trust me, the day will be good.

3198
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:13,460
And then we do a midday there and it always works.

3199
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:15,300
Everyone loves Carthay.

3200
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,340
It's always a hit.

3201
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:18,300
I think it's peak adults Disney.

3202
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:19,660
It's the best.

3203
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,340
It's the thing that makes that click.

3204
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:23,980
Like you can be an adult at Disneyland and it rules.

3205
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,220
And then they, yes, as you were saying,

3206
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:26,340
then they get it.

3207
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:29,500
It like clicks and you go, oh, I know why these people go.

3208
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:34,340
And Erin, I think you said like it re-energizing you.

3209
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:37,420
It is the adult equivalent of like when I was a kid

3210
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:39,380
and we would go to the parks in Florida

3211
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:41,300
and it's like, okay, three o'clock rolls around

3212
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:43,340
back to the hotel for the kids to take a nap.

3213
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:44,180
Yeah, you take a nap.

3214
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:46,220
You get your lunch or whatever or snack.

3215
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:47,580
And then you're ready to come back

3216
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:49,140
because you gotta do the parks at night.

3217
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,660
It's all different at night.

3218
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:51,500
It's so, and I mean,

3219
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:54,020
Thunder Mountain at night is one of the most magical.

3220
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:57,740
You get to see the little village or the little town.

3221
01:38:57,740 --> 01:38:59,820
Yeah, Old West town.

3222
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,540
Yeah, and Splash Mountain at night.

3223
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,620
And it's better when you're buzzed on a Manhattan.

3224
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:07,020
It really is.

3225
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:09,660
I mean, we did Tower of Terror after which was brave.

3226
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:12,020
Like you don't really wanna do that

3227
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:13,020
when you've just had alcohol.

3228
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:15,220
But I felt, I mean, I've told you,

3229
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:16,060
we've talked about this,

3230
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:19,260
but that ride is the only time I've ever experienced joy.

3231
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:22,860
Whoa, heavy.

3232
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:24,460
I didn't realize it till it happened.

3233
01:39:24,460 --> 01:39:26,340
But when your butt is two inches out of the seat

3234
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:28,020
and you're just free falling with your friends

3235
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:31,660
on each side of you and it's so smooth that up and down.

3236
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:32,500
Oh boy.

3237
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,980
If you look at pictures of me

3238
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:36,500
from the ride photos over the years,

3239
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,900
everyone's like, you make the same face every time.

3240
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,580
And I'm like, yes, I'm happy.

3241
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:42,940
I'm carefree for once.

3242
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:44,060
And you're the same person.

3243
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:45,900
I mean, why would you make different faces?

3244
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:50,180
I don't really switch up my smile for joy.

3245
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:51,020
No, no.

3246
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:53,340
I don't think about doing a bit.

3247
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:56,060
Like when the camera's coming up, gotta do a bit.

3248
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:59,100
Like I gotta do a little, I don't know, my brain.

3249
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:02,900
I think in true joy, you're free of bits.

3250
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:03,740
You don't have the pressure.

3251
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:04,860
Free from the tyranny of bits.

3252
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,540
I knew that would resonate in this room.

3253
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:07,380
Bits are stressful.

3254
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,200
Bits and gay.

3255
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,940
Well yes, because you can't really mix joy with irony.

3256
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:12,340
Yeah, too much.

3257
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,180
Right.

3258
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:15,300
It's not pure if there's irony in there.

3259
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:18,180
You're not exactly sure when that photo's being taken,

3260
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:21,020
so you're captured in this very earnest moment.

3261
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:22,300
Well yeah, and whenever you see people

3262
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:24,540
who did the bit in the photo,

3263
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:27,140
you know they held that pose for quite a while

3264
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:28,500
because you don't know the exact second.

3265
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:31,260
So they're like shades down on the nose,

3266
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,500
shades down on the nose, shades down on the nose.

3267
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,100
Snap, there's the picture.

3268
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,660
I mean, I'm guilty of doing like

3269
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:38,580
shades down on the nose before.

3270
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:39,940
Listen, we've all done it.

3271
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:42,660
We've even planned them on Space Mountain.

3272
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:43,540
Oh yeah, what did we do?

3273
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:45,140
I can't remember now, but we definitely,

3274
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:46,820
we definitely did something.

3275
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:48,820
I'm not against the like doing the pose and the thing,

3276
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:51,500
but like sometimes you're just not in that frame of mind.

3277
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,900
You want to be free of that pressure.

3278
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:57,020
Just be having a date for yourself.

3279
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:58,940
Well especially now that you,

3280
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:01,340
like there's so many planned pictures

3281
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:02,980
and pictures being posted everywhere, anywhere.

3282
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:06,060
It's not like, back when there wasn't social media,

3283
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,980
a picture on a ride was sort of like a big funny deal,

3284
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,700
so it did make sense to sort of do some kind of thing.

3285
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:14,300
It was like, how often are you getting photographed?

3286
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:16,660
And it was going to be displayed in the house probably.

3287
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:17,940
It was only for the house.

3288
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:19,540
Now it's like you took nine million pictures

3289
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:20,380
of Disneyland that day,

3290
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:23,460
so it's like you don't need to do another funny thing.

3291
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:24,740
That being said, check our Twitter

3292
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:26,860
for the rest of the, the photos of us.

3293
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:27,700
Are you inspired?

3294
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,500
For the professional photo shoot, yeah.

3295
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,540
The only other thing,

3296
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:32,980
or like when we took a picture with Chewbacca.

3297
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:34,660
Oh, that was great.

3298
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:36,060
That was great.

3299
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:41,220
Oh my God, and when I cried because Kylo rejected me.

3300
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,500
Yes, and Kylo was mean to Erin.

3301
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,580
Well, I had a whole plan where like,

3302
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:46,740
I was like, it'll be really cute

3303
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:50,020
if we did like a prom style picture, me and Kylo Ren.

3304
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:50,860
Kylo Ren, yes.

3305
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:52,660
Yeah, I forgot his last name because we're so close.

3306
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:53,500
You love him, but.

3307
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,340
I just call him Kylo.

3308
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:56,420
And we waited in line for so long,

3309
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,420
and at first I was saying to Mike like,

3310
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:00,060
I can't believe you're standing in line

3311
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:00,940
to meet a fake character.

3312
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:02,100
Like, you know there's nothing in there.

3313
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:02,940
It's just like a person.

3314
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:03,780
Yeah, he was trying to humiliate me.

3315
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,660
But like, but then halfway through the line,

3316
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:08,740
like the anticipation of meeting him,

3317
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:12,540
I started forgetting it wasn't the real one.

3318
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:14,660
And so we got in there and I was so nervous.

3319
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,660
And I was like, will you pose romantic with me?

3320
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:20,820
And he goes, no, and like swipes his hand across.

3321
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:23,020
And I like truly my eyes filled with tears.

3322
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:25,580
We just take this sad picture where like my little shoulders

3323
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:27,260
and my arms are totally straight by my body.

3324
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:29,020
And I'm like not really looking at the camera

3325
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:30,980
because I was so embarrassed.

3326
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:31,820
Oh God.

3327
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:35,900
Mike afterwards goes, this is character.

3328
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,460
Yeah, I was like, he's mean to everyone.

3329
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:38,860
He was like, he was doing you a favor.

3330
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:40,100
Like that's how he'd react.

3331
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:40,940
Yeah.

3332
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:42,660
He'd try to eat a hot dog.

3333
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:44,420
If I'd been like a hot 25 year old,

3334
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:46,420
he would have been like, yes.

3335
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:49,180
I don't know.

3336
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:50,020
I don't think so.

3337
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:52,460
But then Chewbacca really turned that around.

3338
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:55,300
Then he was like, Chewbacca wants to do a million poses.

3339
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:56,860
He wants to hug you in all of them.

3340
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:58,140
He like plays with your hair.

3341
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:59,140
It's very cute.

3342
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,740
Was it me, you and Marissa?

3343
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:03,220
I want to say Lindsay was in those pictures too,

3344
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,220
but we might've done it twice.

3345
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:05,260
We may have done it twice.

3346
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:07,180
Cause I remember Marissa squealing

3347
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:09,060
when Chewbacca came around the corner.

3348
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:10,380
He was really a thrill.

3349
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:13,460
Hug from Chewbacca is really special.

3350
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:15,500
I still remember the way his hair smells.

3351
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,340
It smells good.

3352
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:17,180
Oh jeez.

3353
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:19,660
I don't have a good memory of the smell.

3354
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,580
It smells a little bit like popcorn.

3355
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:23,780
My memory is that it's musty.

3356
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:25,220
It was musty, but like old,

3357
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:28,260
like you know when you walk into an arcade in the 90s

3358
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:30,420
and it's like with the flat carpet

3359
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:32,900
and it kind of has that like ground popcorn smell,

3360
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:33,780
like old popcorn.

3361
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:34,620
That's what he smelled like.

3362
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:35,460
Interesting.

3363
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:36,300
I liked it.

3364
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:37,220
I'll have to smell him next time I see him.

3365
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:39,700
Is the best smell at Disneyland Chewbacca?

3366
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:42,900
Chewbacca's first, pretty good.

3367
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,260
Probably depends what time of day it is

3368
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:46,900
and how long he's been hugging.

3369
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:48,340
I just want to go right now

3370
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:49,940
and get some Carthay Manhattans

3371
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:51,620
and then hug Chewbacca for a while.

3372
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,460
Smell him.

3373
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:53,300
I know.

3374
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:54,140
Yeah.

3375
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:54,980
We could.

3376
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:58,060
Well, it's up to us to decide whether or not to do that,

3377
01:43:58,060 --> 01:43:58,900
but before we can do that,

3378
01:43:58,900 --> 01:43:59,940
we have to end the episode.

3379
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:02,260
So Erin Whitehead, you survived Podcast the Ride.

3380
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:03,100
Oh my God.

3381
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:03,940
Thanks for being here.

3382
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:04,780
Yeah, you did it.

3383
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:05,740
Let's exit through the gift shop.

3384
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:07,700
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

3385
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:10,180
You can just follow me on Twitter,

3386
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:11,140
at Girl with a Tail.

3387
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:14,180
It's also at Girl with a Tail on Instagram.

3388
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:15,020
That's it.

3389
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:16,500
Cool.

3390
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:20,380
Yeah, so you want to plug all of our stuff?

3391
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:21,220
You've got the list.

3392
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:22,700
I don't have the system yet down

3393
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:24,300
where I've been trying to be tighter with this,

3394
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:26,740
but then I haven't been putting them in the new documents.

3395
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:27,980
So I'm letting you down.

3396
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:28,820
Well, that's okay.

3397
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:29,780
You can follow us on Twitter,

3398
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:30,780

3401
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:34,100
When does this air?

3402
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:36,100
This will air in a couple weeks, a few weeks.

3403
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:37,460
So in early October.

3404
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:39,140
Okay, then no.

3405
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:39,980
Okay.

3406
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:42,020
But it's still within the time frame

3407
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:44,900
that you can see us in Chicago and Orlando.

3408
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:46,820
Chicago the 19th,

3409
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:49,660
part of the Chicago Podcast Festival,

3410
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:51,500
and then the 24th in Orlando.

3411
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,340
Sac Comedy Lab.

3412
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:53,180
Sac Comedy Lab.

3413
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:56,020

3414
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:58,420

our Instagram, our Facebook.

3416
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:00,100
I found the thing.

3417
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:01,740
I pulled it up on the document, so now I can say.

3418
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:03,860

Ring a ding ding.

3423
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:11,580
How about it?

3424
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:13,540
Hey, yeah, cha cha.

3425
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:14,860
Okay.

3426
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:16,780
It's 30s way to end it.

3427
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:17,620
All right.

3428
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:18,460
Yeah.

Thanks for listening, fellas and gals.

3430
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:22,380
Knock those cobwebs out.

3431
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:24,660
Knock those cobwebs out.

3432
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:25,500
Follow.

3433
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,500
Careful on those double decker buses.

3434
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:29,020
And careful on the jelly bean trail of life.

3435
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:29,860
Click clack.

3436
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:30,700
Yeah.

3437
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:32,580
Forever.

3438
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:33,420
Woo.

3439
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:34,260
Woo.

3440
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:35,100
