1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:10,320
When your town has made you frown, When your square has made you swear,

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:19,900
When life gives you one more punch, You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge,

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:29,540
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol, A place that features part of the Berlin Wall,

4
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:37,560
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks, A place where you can tattoo your lower back,

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:47,540
So let's go take a walk, let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight, tonight.

6
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:55,220
Podcast The Ride presents the City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness, a daily,

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,060
extremely necessary series, exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder,

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,420
that make up universe,

9
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,980
Oh guys, I don't like the look of this place one bit.

10
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:29,000
full of the rotting ruins of things that used to be at Universal City Walk Orlando.

11
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:36,560
This is no good for our morale here as we start this new first paywalled episode of

12
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,620
the City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness.

13
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,240
Oh, I don't even want to say the names or do the host business.

14
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,820
This place is so grim.

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,420
Oh, my name is Mike Carlson and I'm here and I'm in pain.

16
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,740
I hurt, every part of me hurts from the sad, mostly from the sadness,

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,880
from the depressing nature of where we are.

18
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,540
I know a big dunking basketball player and his hand is about to snap off,

19
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,860
and a NASCAR car that's being overtaken by nature.

20
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,820
No, I hate it.

21
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:17,560
It's like the War of the World set on the studio tour, but with businesses that have fun novelty

22
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,940
pieces that are sticking out of the walls or the front of the building.

23
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,420
It is.

24
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,700
It's not just, it looks like fog machines, but I think that actually is like the stench

25
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,120
of the bowels of the earth.

26
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,160
I think that's like volcanic activity.

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,600
Yeah, I think so.

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,480
It's not fun like a set would be.

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,920
Hey, it's Jason Chardon.

30
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,440
I'm here.

31
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm just transfixed by this giant, shattered, partially brass, mostly exploded basketball

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,580
player that used to lurk outside the MBC, MBA city restaurant thing.

33
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,360
I know.

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,860
The giant multi-block restaurant.

35
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,020
It's really, it's a big shame.

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,620
It's like Planet of the Apes, like I'm staring on my knees looking at the statue.

37
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,660
Yeah, you are.

38
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,780
You're on your knees right now.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,260
You blew it up.

40
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,940
You blew it up, you bastards.

41
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
How dare they take anything away from us ever.

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,280
I know.

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,160
Of course we anxiously await the arrival of new activity in stores and restaurants at

44
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,640
this place.

45
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,300
That doesn't mean the old ones have to go away.

46
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,780
Just keep building next to it.

47
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,140
Keep building.

48
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,800
Keep adding.

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,000
Keep building on top.

50
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,060
Yes, they should have built Toothsome on top of NBA city.

51
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,620
That's what I think.

52
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:38,040
Yeah, and of course it should go without saying this entire place stinks like stale cigars

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,240
from the dead cigar bar that is now the constantly dying sandwich shop.

54
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,420
Yes, yeah.

55
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,520
Actually there's kind of something like a little like rich and pleasant about the cigar

56
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,900
smell.

57
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,940
The sandwiches are a little more suspect in my mind.

58
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,160
Maybe that part of it is an upgrade actually.

59
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,920
Kind of oaky, kind of musty.

60
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,680
Not so bad.

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,820
Yeah, because all the cigars are on fire like perpetually.

62
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,780
Oh yeah, yeah.

63
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,560
So you're getting such a rich blend of smells.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,200
Because you know actually, if we go stand by them, maybe it'll be like we're getting

65
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,580
to smoke expensive cigars.

66
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh yeah, okay.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,440
Nonstop.

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,180
Okay, so not all…

69
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,440
Oh hey, oh speaking of, there's the familiar coughs as we know that…

70
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,680
Oh well god, this is…

71
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,320
I've been so scared here.

72
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,840
It's been so grim that I…

73
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,820
It's just nice to see a familiar face.

74
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,200
Hey, there he is.

75
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,260
It's the Sector Keeper.

76
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,000
Hey Sector Keeper.

77
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,740
Baze, baze.

78
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,100
I'm no Sector Keeper.

79
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,640
But you look like him.

80
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,100
He looks exactly like him.

81
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,780
Sector Creeper.

82
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,140
Oh no.

83
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,940
Oh god, wait a minute, we should have known we're in an alternate dimension.

84
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,680
Why would it just be the regular Sector Keeper?

85
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,200
Jesus Christ, it's the Sector Creeper.

86
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,580
Where are my stogies?

87
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,080
Whoa, these are all around you I guess.

88
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,580
You just pick them up and grab them as you need.

89
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,090
Please don't blow smoke in our face though.

90
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,250
Oh god, this guy's smoke blowing is so much more unpleasant than the real Sector Keeper.

91
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,430
Yeah, really.

92
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,190
I know Sector Keeper.

93
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,650
Yeah, I know Sector Keeper.

94
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,390
So you do know you're like part of the…

95
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,650
Because we're all part of the vast connected multiverse.

96
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,030
So you have run into the good version of yourself?

97
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,910
I knew him for a little bit, but he stopped coming to my poker night.

98
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,030
With good reason, he's a good boy.

99
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,230
He wouldn't gamble.

100
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,650
You might have found out he was like eight or nine.

101
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,670
He's like a child, yeah.

102
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,890
Yeah, don't be inviting kids to your…

103
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,910
Wait, so you as opposed to…

104
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,610
Because wait a minute, this is some kind of like…

105
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,850
This is like a Star Trek thing.

106
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,930
This is like Evil Spock or something.

107
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,730
Where it's this bizarre cracked mirror version of the other.

108
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,890
So if the Sector Keeper we know and love is a child, you're not a child?

109
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,270
No, no, I'm like 62.

110
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,650
Oh, you're like an older guy.

111
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,170
Okay.

112
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,330
That's different for us.

113
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,670
I feel like we usually use the whimsy.

114
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,290
Like a shadow version of what you're used to.

115
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,870
Shadow Link, Evil Spock, Chris Gaines.

116
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,170
Oh, that makes some more sense now.

117
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,450
Oh wait a minute, yeah, look at him.

118
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,550
He's got a soul patch.

119
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,310
Oh my God.

120
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,230
That's like, that's where if you ever…

121
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,930
That's where, that's my, that's my tail.

122
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,010
Oh, that's you or your soul patch.

123
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:38,870
I got a soul patch.

124
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,290
I couldn't see through the mist.

125
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,730
I got a ponytail if you could look.

126
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,210
I got a long ponytail.

127
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:43,750
Oh, God.

128
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,050
And it's always wet.

129
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,990
Yeah, it's really…

130
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,770
Why is it wet?

131
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,470
Because of your sweat or does it just like pick up humidity from the air?

132
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,390
That's so weird.

133
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,870
Yeah, no, it's like a dehumidifier.

134
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,930
Picks up the humidity.

135
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,070
It's really gnarly.

136
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,630
Soaks it up.

137
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,870
He just whipped it at…

138
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,630
So sad.

139
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,150
God, why'd you whip your ponytail in our faces?

140
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,730
Sorry, I was looking…

141
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,530
Have you seen my stogies?

142
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,610
They're everywhere.

143
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,650
Just bend down and put your hand out.

144
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,230
I don't know which ones yours are.

145
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,590
Okay, okay, let me see, let me see.

146
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,070
I'm gonna leaf through these.

147
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,590
You guys want a Coors Light or…?

148
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,770
I'll take a Coors, sure I'll have a Coors.

149
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,090
I actually hate Coors Light.

150
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,790
Really?

151
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,470
Yeah, I hate it.

152
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,570
What are you, you're a Miller Light man?

153
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,270
What are you?

154
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,630
Yeah, I mean, I guess so if I had a choice.

155
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,290
It just tastes so sour to me, Coors Light.

156
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,470
Sour?

157
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,010
Sour.

158
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,450
Like, it just tastes bad.

159
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,490
Like, I don't know, it just has like a thing.

160
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,930
Jason, wait a minute, the longer you describe this,

161
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,250
the more likely you are to have to drink a ton of Coors Light.

162
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,550
This guy's like the devil.

163
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,290
Yeah, man.

164
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,250
Oh man, silver bullets coming my way for sure.

165
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,630
Like you're a werewolf?

166
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,450
No, that's their like motto.

167
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,150
That's a Coors Light branding thing.

168
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,850
I thought you were gonna shoot you.

169
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,990
Well, maybe, I don't know.

170
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,470
Wait a minute, what's in his pocket?

171
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,250
Oh, he's got a gun.

172
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,110
It's a revolver.

173
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,110
Oh no, there's silver bullets in it?

174
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,190
It's filled with silver bullets.

175
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,990
Oh, shit.

176
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,750
So maybe there are werewolves in this terrible place.

177
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,670
There's gotta be, I think.

178
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,990
They're probably all the characters they haven't brought back for Halloween Horror Nights.

179
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,570
That's right.

180
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,410
Waiting to find all the tombstones we see all around us.

181
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,310
Oh yeah.

182
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,550
Oh gosh, now I'm scared.

183
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,410
This guy's blowing smoke at us, whipping his ponytail.

184
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,950
Oh, wait a minute, his ponytail goo tastes like Coors Light.

185
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:34,570
Yeah.

186
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,090
See, did you cause this, Jason?

187
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,390
Well, you know, serves me right.

188
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,590
Where exactly are we though?

189
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,950
What is this?

190
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,950
Oh yeah, wait a minute.

191
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,630
Do we still do, I know you're the evil sector keeper, but do you still?

192
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,770
Hey man, sector creeper, man.

193
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,290
Sorry, god, this is heading nowhere good if I don't respect the guys

194
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:54,790
name.

195
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,270
Okay, sector creeper.

196
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,350
I know you don't do everything the way that the usual sector keeper does,

197
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,950
but do you still give us like an assignment?

198
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,170
So there's some rules down here, you know.

200
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,750
First up, no running around the pool.

201
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,370
Oh, okay.

202
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,990
That's kind of a rule everywhere.

203
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,830
Yeah, but you know, I just gotta cover this shit, all right, man?

204
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,970
Second thing is like the keep creeper down here.

205
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,270
Oh, sorry, you guys are in the land of fallen brothers and never built.

206
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,230
Did you see the sign coming in?

207
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,270
Yeah, yeah, no.

208
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,830
I propped it up with a parking cone.

209
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,610
I guess you got, I don't know, everything there again, there's so much like,

210
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,690
there's so much mist or volcanic ash or whatever it is.

211
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,690
It's hard to read anything.

212
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,710
And you gotta imagine what I'm going through, man, like.

213
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,650
Just living out here.

214
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,270
Shit is gonna be closing constantly.

215
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,790
So, you know, what you're experiencing is stuff's just closing up there.

216
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,850
Shit's just constantly being built down here.

217
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,290
Oh yeah, that makes sense.

218
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,550
You've had a couple of big boom times down here.

219
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,650
It's always a boom time down here.

220
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,190
Oh, that's what happens.

221
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,790
Every one of these restaurants is terrible.

222
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,890
It makes everybody sick.

223
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,970
So you get your pick of the litter of like all the restaurants

224
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,310
that have ever been too horrible to stay open.

225
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,350
Yeah, and I see there's just a bunch of like boxes of unused merchandise,

226
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,610
unsold merchandise that just gets thrown down here.

227
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,230
That's for sale.

228
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,930
Oh, we can buy it?

229
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,610
You want to rifle around through that?

230
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,750
You want to look at that?

231
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,210
I want to look at it.

232
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,250
Yeah.

233
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,710
What's it going to take to get you to buy one of these shirts today?

234
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,330
Oh, the shirt for the Ghostbusters show from 1992?

235
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:36,970
Yeah.

236
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,190
Oh, I don't know.

237
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,630
$20.

238
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,470
You flip those.

239
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:43,670
You want one?

240
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,010
Yeah.

241
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,370
What do you want?

242
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:46,790
What do you like?

243
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,690
What do you like to see?

244
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,710
You got any Jaws ride stuff?

245
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,170
It's empty.

246
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,830
You want Jaws?

247
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,430
Yeah.

248
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,230
Jaws ride is still in operation, motherfucker.

249
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,010
In Japan?

250
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,190
Oh, is it down here?

251
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,430
Yeah, it might be down here, man.

252
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,430
Down here, actually.

253
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,030
Unless you only have the like all of the because the real hell would be if all you get are closed

254
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,690
stores and restaurants.

255
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,470
Getting all the old rides sounds great.

256
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:12,910
Actually, that does sound good.

257
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:19,130
But all I see around me is I just see like a big broken record that used to be at the Motown Cafe.

258
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:19,950
Right, right.

259
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,410
You want to buy that?

260
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,310
It's so big.

261
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,110
There's no way you're going to give me that for cheap.

262
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,990
But it is broken.

263
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,710
Does that help?

264
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:27,790
Yeah, sure.

265
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,270
I mean, if it doesn't help, does it?

266
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,190
Do you like it more?

267
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,010
You are not great at haggling.

268
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,090
I got to tell you.

269
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,430
I know.

270
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,470
Oh, you're aware.

271
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,190
He's a mess.

272
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,250
He's breathing ash all day every day.

273
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,810
I've got a big family.

274
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,610
All right, you two.

275
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,590
I guess you have that in common with the Sector Key.

276
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,270
Jesus, everybody's down in their luck in this multiverse.

277
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,330
Yeah, that's true.

278
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,570
Who are they?

279
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,590
Does that mean you like…

280
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,610
So wait, if Sector Keeper is family with all the representatives of other malls,

281
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,330
you are probably family with people with defunct malls?

282
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:03,830
Yeah, that's right.

283
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,430
The keepers of defunct malls.

284
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,790
Keepers, yeah.

285
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,250
Wow.

286
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,330
So if you've died at a defunct mall, this is where you're at.

287
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,270
Oh, okay.

288
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,350
Oh, okay.

289
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,930
A lot of sense, yeah.

290
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,210
Oh, God, if we don't get out of here, Jesus.

291
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,050
I mean, look, I love dead malls and stuff,

292
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,990
but that doesn't mean I want to…

293
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,370
I love the promenade where I grew up,

294
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,770
but does that mean I want to do a bunch of ghostly sectors

295
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,770
about the old Walden books I used to go to as a kid?

296
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,510
I don't think so.

297
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:32,730
I don't think so.

298
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,610
That sounds like a bummer.

299
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,250
I agree.

300
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,850
Baze, baze, you can get out of here.

301
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:37,910
Wait a minute.

302
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,810
What are you calling us?

303
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:42,970
Baze.

304
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,870
Oh, I missed that.

305
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,190
That's right.

306
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,250
He doesn't call us boys.

307
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,870
Boys, he calls us baze.

308
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,170
It's like Beyonce, like baze.

309
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,010
Baze, baze.

310
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,030
Or is it more just like you're playing

311
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,050
a song with an A?

312
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,190
Because you're so twisted.

313
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,490
Like we're babies, like swingers, you know?

314
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,830
Yeah, like baze, like my baze, my baze.

315
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,670
Oh, okay.

316
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,650
Wait a minute.

317
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,170
My beautiful ba-baze.

318
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,030
Oh, this is getting sleazier by the moment.

319
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,290
Is the only movie you get down here the movie Bae-Baze Kids?

320
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,670
Oh, it could be.

321
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,590
It could be an E or an A.

322
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,490
Oh, we got Bae-Baze Kids.

323
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,370
You want to buy it?

324
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,230
The movie?

325
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,970
I don't know.

326
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,070
You can just rent that on Apple or something.

327
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,710
I don't know how you call it a voodoo.

328
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,530
Wait, it's holding out a cop.

329
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,590
Wait, no, I'm not going to spend, what does that say?

330
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,030
$650 on a whole copy of Bae-Baze Kids?

331
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,670
That's a pretty good…

332
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,030
Is that a Betamax copy?

333
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,230
It's a Betamax.

334
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:38,930
Oh, okay.

335
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,150
He uses dead formats.

336
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:40,730
It makes sense.

337
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,730
We use dead formats.

338
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,050
We only used, yeah, dead formats.

339
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,910
We got LaserDisc, Betamax.

340
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,450
Oh, you've got the actual film reel from when Bae-Baze Kids

341
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,990
was playing at the movie theater.

342
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,910
We got the film reel.

343
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,050
Of course, the re-release from 2002.

344
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,590
Because it wasn't there when it first came out.

345
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,730
Hey, you know your shit, man.

346
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,470
Hey, I know.

347
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,010
I'm a film buff, so I know.

348
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,730
You're a Bae-Baze Boy.

349
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,010
I'm a Bae-Baze Boy.

350
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,650
Oh, you're a Bae-Baze Boy.

351
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,750
I am a Bae-Baze Boy.

352
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,490
What can I tell you?

353
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,090
You do use boy in that context, but otherwise it's bae.

354
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,370
Yeah, I know boy.

355
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,330
I know the word boy, but you guys are my baes.

356
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,510
Okay, all right.

357
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:13,870
Okay.

358
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,550
Oh, God, it's a little sexual.

359
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,550
This guy's like a little lascivious too.

360
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,850
Oh my God, he's in a bathrobe too.

361
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,210
Wait a minute, a worm just crawled through.

362
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,290
Oh, man.

363
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,250
Crossed his chest.

364
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,750
This guy's got a Beetlejuice thing about him.

365
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,050
Look, I was not going to say it,

366
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,830
but he's got a Beetlejuice thing going on.

367
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,730
It's a gummy worm.

368
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,470
Oh, Jason ate it.

369
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,950
I ate, you know, ate this.

370
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,990
Hey, man, that was my best friend.

371
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,430
He was a living, just because he's a gummy worm

372
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,530
doesn't mean he's a dead, a not alive can.

373
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,230
I don't know.

374
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,050
I just went on autopilot at some point.

375
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,890
How do we get out of here?

376
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,870
You're not nearly there, man.

377
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,130
All right, this is how you get out of here.

378
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,370
Listen.

379
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,570
Jason is an early bae.

380
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,170
Listen up.

381
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,430
Listen up.

382
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:56,850
Listen up.

383
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,350
Listen up.

384
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,830
You want to get out of here,

385
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,110
you got to talk about the shit you see down here, right?

386
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,550
A little different, a little different than what you guys are probably used to, right?

387
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,790
Yeah, no, usually.

388
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,150
So you see it, you talk about it and spend as much time as you need.

389
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,230
And then, you know, I'll get you guys out of here.

390
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,750
Oh, God, that is hellish.

391
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,250
There isn't the pressure of time with the sector keeper.

392
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,890
I'm like, oh, my God, this could go for hours.

393
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,890
Yeah, yeah.

394
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,350
Yeah, that's how we do it.

395
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,770
Well, I'm going to call it.

396
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,110
Can I talk about that really new thing that ended up down here?

397
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,250
Oh, yeah, yeah.

398
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,610
The newest brother.

399
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,210
Wait a minute.

400
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,250
The newest fallen brother that was a regular location when we were there.

401
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,430
But in the time it's taken to start making these episodes has since closed.

402
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,010
The universal legacy.

403
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,170
So, oh, yeah.

404
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:45,650
Oh, yeah.

405
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,410
Get into that one.

406
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:52,510
That one, when it dropped in your world, it fucking shot up in mine, blew out my fucking toilet.

407
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,510
That's what happens.

408
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:01,170
As soon as it closes, it just shoots up down here and messes with your plumbing.

409
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:01,550
Yeah.

410
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,710
I mean, I'm my life.

411
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,650
My life fucking sucks.

412
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,110
God.

413
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,010
Okay.

414
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:07,850
Okay.

415
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,250
It's hard down here.

416
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,570
So, yeah.

417
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,590
So you can imagine it's a disarray.

418
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,150
So again, you know, if you want to talk about it, yeah, go.

419
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:15,630
Jesus.

420
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,750
Well, it adds to the stink, I guess.

421
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,450
Everything has to go through the sewage that travels from the regular world to hell, I guess.

422
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,450
Fuck.

423
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,290
Well, hopefully it kept some of that cool retro merchandise.

424
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,570
Still looking a little bit sharp.

425
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,530
Keep in mind, all the bad restaurants are open down here.

426
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,250
Yeah, right.

427
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,230
So people are shitting up a storm.

428
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,570
As opposed to the regular city walk where you're only shitting up half of the city.

429
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:42,530
Yeah.

430
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:42,990
Right.

431
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,130
You're shitting up a parley cloudy up there, but.

432
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,810
Well, there's also a lot of demons down here.

433
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,790
So they like shit fire as well.

434
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,390
That's right.

435
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,190
So it's in addition.

436
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,470
You know your stuff, man.

437
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,650
Hey, what can I tell you?

438
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,890
Hey, you know your stuff.

439
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,090
So yeah.

440
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,770
I know, this bae was saying something.

441
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,270
Okay.

442
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:01,670
Yeah.

443
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,230
So the Universal Legacy store, it was only around for a few years,

444
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:11,790
Seemed pretty well liked because it had like a lot of throwback merchandise.

445
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:18,850
Yeah, this was a location meant to appeal to the retro universal fans.

446
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,270
Right.

447
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:19,910
Yeah.

448
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,210
In its merchandise, but also decor.

449
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,430
A lot of like tributes to the old King Kong jaws.

450
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,590
The inappropriate for where we are right now.

451
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,210
Ride props and recreations of ride props.

452
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,630
They also had a thing I really like and I did buy this.

453
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,350
They had a mold of Rama machine.

454
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,310
Are you guys familiar with mold of Rama?

455
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:45,830
Yeah.

456
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,310
Yeah.

457
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,770
Black mold of Rama.

458
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,950
So this is I have a mold of Rama thing here too.

459
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,510
It is a print on demand.

460
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:07,330
Basically these were big in a lot of them in the Chicago area, museums.

461
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:07,690
Sure.

462
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,430
I did it there.

463
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,190
This is the back to the future clock tower.

464
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,830
I got another one too.

465
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,350
There was one in the Halloween boutique at islands of adventure.

466
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,010
I bought a little boo, the little pumpkin boy.

467
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,690
This shit's going over my head, man.

468
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,270
What is this?

469
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,290
What are we looking at?

470
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:34,790
So you pay like five bucks or so and it like the machine operates it molds like molten plastic.

471
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,150
Well, we've talked about this situation.

472
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:37,710
Yeah, we haven't.

473
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,650
We still haven't figured it out if those pests.

474
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:45,330
We had a whole conversation to fill you in about because I've got a theory that those pennies are already pressed.

475
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,310
Oh, you do.

476
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,650
Okay, that's what we were saying.

477
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,270
Oh, wow.

478
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,330
Hey, yeah.

479
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,630
What if this thing's already just sitting in there?

480
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:57,030
Well, it was nothing and then it was pressed together and then it comes out the bottom.

481
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,170
You saw it?

482
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,610
Hey, you saw it?

483
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,810
I saw it.

484
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,290
Yeah, I saw most of the pressing, but they could have pulled a fast one on me.

485
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,210
It was very hot when it came out.

486
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:07,870
We did not.

487
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,670
It is hot.

488
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,850
So if they were faking it, there would have to be a little heater to heat the plastic piece.

489
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,310
Yeah.

490
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,510
And that's an expense.

491
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,290
Why would they need?

492
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,470
Why would they put in a plastic heater at that point?

493
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,830
Just do a plastic molder.

494
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,410
Jane reached for it too fast, too fast.

495
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,350
And we were doing the hot potato in our hands and put it back.

496
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,630
Just trading a little clock tower for two minutes.

497
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,090
But there is a Moldorama website.

498
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,230
Moldorama, it still exists.

499
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,870
It came about.

500
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:43,710
It was the division of this company, Aura, which is now called AuraMark.

501
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,550
You've probably seen it on the signs of buildings.

502
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:54,430
One of those food service companies that supply large quantities of food to restaurants.

503
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,710
It's one of those behind the scenes monopolies.

504
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,590
The logo is a little guy.

505
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,430
It's a little guy.

506
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,170
We've seen a little guy before.

507
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,190
It's a little red guy.

508
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:07,710
I know that.

509
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,330
Famous AuraMark red guy.

510
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,910
We'll be hanging out with him if AuraMark ever dies.

511
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,390
I've seen him come down here every once in a while.

512
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,890
Yeah.

513
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,790
He pops in.

514
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,110
He brings his family through here and they go.

515
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,410
Eat some cheap food in the realm of the beyond.

516
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,330
Universal has a few of these Moldorama machines, usually in the tribute store.

517
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,030
There was one in the Universal Legacy store, which hopefully they'll just move a lot of

518
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,850
that stuff into the main CityWalk store, which was a little boring.

519
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,530
Although, don't get on my story, guys.

520
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:48,350
That dude, does stuff ever get shot down here and shot back up all the time?

521
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,490
Oh, okay.

522
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,770
Great.

523
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:50,970
All the time.

524
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:51,510
All the time.

525
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:57,890
I mean, the kitchen for most of the food you guys have been eating is actually it's an offsite kitchen.

526
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,970
Is that explains to us?

527
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:02,910
Yeah, absolutely.

528
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,770
It's sent through a dimensional sewer and then back.

529
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,210
Oh, my God.

530
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,190
Now I understand.

531
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:07,650
Oh, yeah.

532
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,250
And it's they got their grade posted in the window and it's not a name.

533
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,230
What is it?

534
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,630
Is it a B?

535
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,050
It's not a B.

536
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,830
Is it the same letter that Flounder Almondine starts with?

537
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,830
That not very good dish that Mike had the other day?

538
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,250
He knows his stuff too, huh?

539
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,270
Yes, I'm a smart bae.

540
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,830
He's a smart bae.

541
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,230
Yeah.

542
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,730
In lighter news, so I did.

543
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:34,910
Lighter news.

544
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,570
Well, lighter news, you might like this creeper.

545
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,410
I did go to the Moldorama website when I was trying to learn more about it and I was trying

546
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:49,790
to see they had a cute little mascot at the top and I did find out about Melton, the Moldorama.

547
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,410
Another shirt reveal.

548
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,870
Another shirt reveal.

549
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,810
Shirt reveal.

550
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,110
He's just a cute little guy.

551
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,030
He's a cute little man.

552
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,270
You bought a shirt of a living Moldorama guy who's got Mickey Mouse eyes.

553
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,690
Yeah, I found this a while ago.

554
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,230
How much?

555
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,030
Can I ask how much is the shirt?

556
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,010
Like 20 bucks.

557
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,250
It's pretty affordable.

558
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,750
Do they have multiple designs?

559
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,230
They have a few different shirts, I think.

560
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,170
Wow, look at that.

561
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,830
But his name is Melton, which I only learned.

562
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,250
Melton.

563
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,810
Yeah, M-L-T-O-N.

564
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,730
T-O-N, okay.

565
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,590
Because they melt the plastic.

566
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,390
That's pretty good.

567
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,930
Melton, wow.

568
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,990
He's a cute little guy.

569
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,930
I like Melton.

570
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,090
I like Melton, yeah.

571
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,210
Melton might be a scammer because he might just be heating up the plastic instead of

572
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,750
actually molding it in real time.

573
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,090
That's true, yeah.

574
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,330
But this nice face lie to you?

575
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,250
He looks so friendly.

576
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:44,490
So Melton, if let's just take him at his word, Melton, his insides are hot.

577
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:50,010
And he is like, one of his organs has just like a liquid plastic in it.

578
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,370
So he secretes liquid plastic or it comes like, say he has like it in his liver or something.

579
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,870
He's full of liquid plastic and then it goes down into a different organ,

580
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,910
which is like a piece of machinery and then it molds a different design.

581
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,590
So he is, I guess he's part, like part character, part machine.

582
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,890
Are you saying that's his shit, man?

583
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:19,350
I guess what I am saying is that the way Melton shits is that his liver secretes

584
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,310
liquid plastic.

585
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,230
Hot liquid plastic.

586
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,330
Hot liquid plastic and then his shit is a hollowed out toy.

587
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:33,870
So you're saying that Jason just held up his, Melton's shit hardened into a clock tower.

588
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,330
He played hot potato with.

589
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,090
Played hot potato with a mascot's shit.

590
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,490
I mean, Melton's shit.

591
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,510
I guess that's where this was always going, right?

592
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,150
When I was a child, I got many of Melton's shits at the zoo.

593
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,710
I got a lot of like a zoo.

594
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,830
You got a lot of mold aromas?

595
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:51,590
Yeah.

596
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,790
A lot of them still going at like the Museum of Industry in Chicago Zoo.

597
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,610
Guess Matt Mazzani got me a Donald Duck like plastic thing.

598
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,910
I forget where he even got it from some store or something.

599
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,670
I always, uh, one color.

600
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,150
Uh, I don't think so.

601
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:07,690
Usually.

602
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,590
Gray, but I think the Donald Duck one was orange.

603
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,670
Orange or green.

604
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,330
Like you can't have a color.

605
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,810
Single color.

606
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,390
Single color.

607
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,210
Very simple.

608
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,230
Too complicated.

609
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,330
Really depends on what Melton eats.

610
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:26,210
I did have to feed it and I did feed it flounder almedine.

611
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,290
And so maybe that gray is shrubbily.

612
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,050
This is the rare machine.

613
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,510
You don't put a dollar bill in.

614
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,130
You put in a cooked flounder.

615
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,550
I don't know why I didn't just get him a pretzel.

616
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,710
It would have been much more cost effective for me

617
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,650
and it probably would have settled better with him.

618
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,610
You should be able to put like in that penny machine anything you want

619
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,690
and they'll be able to press it.

620
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,050
Like you should be able to put a piece of flounder in the penny machine

621
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,750
and it gives you a piece of pressed flounder.

622
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,070
You should be able to get a universal logo on anything you put in there.

623
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,330
This does end the back to the future logo on it.

624
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,790
So in his agony he was getting like correct logos.

625
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,090
Do you think it hurts him?

626
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,130
Every time Melton shits it hurts.

627
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,470
He has to use part of his colon to as a…

628
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,190
He has to arrange it into the shape of a logo and press it.

629
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:21,670
Yeah, yeah.

630
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,030
This could be a gross area even for the sector.

631
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:24,970
Baze, what else do you think?

632
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,090
Well, the legacy store, like I like the legacy store.

633
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,950
I'm a little bit upset that like they close a legacy store so quickly.

634
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,110
Do we say it turned into the preview center for Epic Universe?

635
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,290
We haven't said that yet.

636
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,170
Which I like.

637
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,210
Obviously that's great.

638
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,390
Yeah, still being built but it is…

639
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:47,370
It's a little small because the islands preview center was multiple.

640
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,170
Like every island had its own route.

641
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,570
Well, that means I'll see it in a year.

642
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,960
I look forward to seeing a bunch of concept art of a park that we already have and you never will.

643
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,450
Unless things go really bad for Epic Universe.

644
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,450
Yeah, no, maybe.

645
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,290
But it's just like I guess that…

646
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,450
Because we're the target audience for legacy store.

647
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,690
We're the types of people that want the legacy merchandise.

648
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,050
But I guess they feel like it's not such a big market.

649
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:18,890
Still most people want the sort of generic modern merchandise.

650
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,550
Or they just needed to kick something out to put the center somewhere.

651
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,990
It might not be a cultural trend.

652
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,010
Well, it felt like an insult to me.

653
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:29,090
I guess our ways aren't wanted by the universal big wigs.

654
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,430
I want to be treated better and I want them to keep things like that open for me

655
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,170
whenever I decide to go next.

656
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,550
But they don't care.

657
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,830
There are things like there's like corners of stores that have the old logos.

658
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,350
There's definitely those.

659
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,730
I think they're aware.

660
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:49,430
The legacy store that used to be the main universal city walk store.

661
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:55,410
And then that shifted when they closed like a skate shop, surf shop thing.

662
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,070
Oh, it killed your uncle?

663
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,470
Closed down, shot right up through him.

664
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,770
Oh, gosh.

665
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,770
You got to be careful.

666
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,690
Your whole family has to be careful ever being on Tollwood.

667
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,530
You guys are with me right now.

668
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,610
Oh, wait, you're right.

669
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,410
Something could close during this record.

670
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,570
Oh, shit.

671
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,890
That's a very ticking time bomb.

672
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,410
We have to get it.

673
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,110
We finished talking about this before.

674
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,950
Yes, given the quality of any city walk place close.

675
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,630
Anything else about the legacy store?

676
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,370
Can we move on?

677
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,090
It was nice.

678
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,010
Okay, great.

679
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,130
Yeah, I liked it.

680
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:32,850
I liked it.

681
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,530
It was nice.

682
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,170
All right.

683
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,350
Speed reviews from Jason Chariton.

684
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,490
Okay.

685
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,050
You know what I see?

686
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,590
Oh, my God.

687
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,790
I didn't think I'd ever see this anywhere off in the distance there.

688
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:51,550
I see an old sign, not for City Walk, but a sign for the City Walk that never was.

689
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,010
Yeah.

690
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:52,890
Do you see that over there?

691
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,230
I see it.

692
00:27:53,230 --> 00:28:01,610
Big letters and it says E-Zone because of course, City Walk Orlando when announced was supposed to

693
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,310
be called the E-Zone.

694
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:03,810
The E-Zone.

695
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:09,510
And by 1997, they realized that name was stupid and they used the City Walk brand

696
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,090
that was already so strong.

697
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,730
City Walk existed in Hollywood.

698
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,210
City Walk Alpha.

699
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,410
Had already been created.

700
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,150
Yes, Alpha is ours, the Hollywood.

701
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,550
And then they already got a logo, this brand recognition.

702
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,950
It doesn't mean they did float E-Zone a little bit.

703
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:34,130
Here's a mock-up of the logo as you can see it back there, but big stripy letters.

704
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,890
And this would have aged well, I think.

705
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,050
I mean, I love it.

706
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:38,630
I do wish.

707
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,090
I know.

708
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,370
It says Universal City Flora under it, which I don't think they ever call it.

709
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:42,670
Yeah.

710
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,390
But I love that.

711
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:50,870
And then here is an E-Zone logo and a map of kind of the City Walk that we know,

712
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,070
but they're calling it E-Zone then.

713
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,930
And this is being held up by all the members of Boys to Men.

714
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:01,690
They are all, this is at a press conference and they're in front of a big E-Zone sign.

715
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,490
Boy, what could have been?

716
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:10,130
Imagine if this was the E-Zone enigma and not the City Walk saga.

717
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:15,250
I have something that likely would have been an E-Zone that as a kid,

718
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,390
I was a weird little kid talking to every team member who would listen to me

719
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:26,190
because when at the preview center for Islands of Adventure and City Walk,

720
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,130
they said there was going to be a Marvel Mania restaurant.

721
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,590
Right.

722
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:30,990
Right.

723
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,290
Yes.

724
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:37,070
So when I got down there in 1999, no one knew what I was talking about.

725
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:44,970
And I have found no proof for years that this was anything other than presented.

726
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,850
And I remembered it until this morning.

727
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,890
I found a post on the website, Spiderfan.

728
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,150
org.

729
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,170
Florida Marvel Mania restaurant canceled.

730
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,670
And does it have a date on it?

731
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,510
It just says 1998.

732
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:08,870
And there was speculation like, oh, there's all this Marvel stuff in the park.

733
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:16,050
And then this user, the editor, it just says, oh, I know him.

734
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,110
From Spiderfan.

735
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,590
org.

736
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,630
He'll edit you out of existence.

737
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,890
He's still in Poker Night.

738
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:30,850
The real reason the parent company for the Marvel Mania chain, Planet Hollywood,

739
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:36,390
has expanded too quickly and is now feeling the financial toll.

740
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:40,210
They have put a hold on all their future expansions.

741
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,170
So that's the reason that Marvel Mania is not built.

742
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,430
It's Robert Earl's hubris.

743
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,490
Wow.

744
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,950
That must upset you.

745
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,770
So what you're saying is that you have been hyped for at least a year, if not a few years,

746
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:59,050
to go to Florida, to go to Marvel Mania, and you didn't check any, like there was no way

747
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,370
to check that it wasn't there.

748
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,370
So you went down there going, oh my God, we're going to Marvel Mania.

749
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,250
Yeah.

750
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,830
Well, and then, and yeah, so I got the maps and I don't see it on the map.

751
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,790
Obviously, Islands is a million Marvel things.

752
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,250
Right.

753
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,710
And then I just start asking everyone because they used to have a weird system where would

754
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,890
there would be a podium in CityWalk.

755
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:24,390
And like in the morning, you would make your dinner reservation there as you were walking

756
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,630
from the parking garage.

757
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,350
This was a very confusing system.

758
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,670
Oh, there's the podium.

759
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,810
Oh, there's a podium.

760
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,390
That's, oh no, a bunch of possums just crawled out of it.

761
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:35,910
Oh, shit.

762
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,550
Gross.

763
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:42,110
So you were, the fact that you had these moments in your life that were you, there was like

764
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:48,330
a year where you were being like, your hope was being buoyed by and soon I'll be there.

765
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,830
And there were pictures in Wizard Magazine, you know, the comics magazine.

766
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,910
But not of the one out here for sure.

767
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,790
Like concept, are you think, or just was it maybe?

768
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,050
I think it was of the one out here opening and being built.

769
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:07,750
There was an interview with like Joe Cassata and some writers where they were eating a meal

770
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,530
at the Marvel Mania out here.

771
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:14,630
So it was like, oh boy, I can't wait till we get one of these because I'm not going

772
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,170
to Hollywood.

773
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,650
It's on another planet.

774
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,470
That's right.

775
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,830
Well, it's here.

776
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,130
It's here.

777
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,710
It's never built and you're looking at it.

778
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,650
How do you feel emotionally?

779
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,210
What do you think?

780
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,270
I mean, what could have been?

781
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,490
Do you want to give it a little kiss?

782
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,530
I do want to give it a little kiss.

783
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,090
I will say I kissed it last week and I did not feel good.

784
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,910
Maybe don't kiss it.

785
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,650
Give it a fair heads up.

786
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,530
Some users on Reddit though were like, I spent a birthday party there once.

787
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,650
Cyclops showed us to our table and Storm was our waiter.

788
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,270
I was like, I mean, that would have been pretty cool.

789
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,230
They were the characters of the waiters.

790
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,170
I know we talked about that.

791
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,570
That's what I don't remember that.

792
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,470
That's why I wanted a Disney.

793
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,410
Is everyone waiting and waiting on me?

794
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,570
But no, no, you get your food and then you watch them waving.

795
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,930
They're waving, not waiting.

796
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,850
Waving, not waiting.

797
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,050
You want them working at the Ant-Man bar.

798
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:08,770
Yeah.

799
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,070
Well, I want, yeah, I wanted like when you get to Disneyland,

800
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,450
I wanted like Pooh Bear at the booth, like taking your money.

801
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,110
Oh, you wanted it every step.

802
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,750
Yeah.

803
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,650
And one of the employees working for you.

804
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:18,850
Yeah.

805
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,270
I guess we'll talk about this a little bit.

806
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,670
But yeah, apparently Marvel Mania is where that really happened.

807
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,350
Wow.

808
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,850
They all had to take side jobs.

809
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,630
Last the dream of Silver Surfer, spilling a bunch of drinks.

810
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,130
Was he on a skateboard?

811
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:33,090
Maybe.

812
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,330
The silver spray paint.

813
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:35,970
That was the mistake.

814
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,210
Should have been another character.

815
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,750
Character just walks.

816
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,410
Beast making sure your time cards filled out.

817
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,710
Yeah, yelling at somebody inappropriate.

818
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,790
Making sure no one gets over 40 hours because then for full time.

819
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,990
Professor X like rolls up and he like tries to take your order,

820
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,350
but mentally, like telepathically.

821
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,790
That's the equivalent of not writing it down.

822
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,170
Teen playing him was wrong every time.

823
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,330
His bald cap.

824
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,550
Yeah, his bald cap.

825
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,470
Ripping sweat.

826
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,810
Scott, anything else like shout it out for the E zone?

827
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,610
Oh, yeah.

828
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,910
You know, there's not much else.

829
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,810
What does E mean?

830
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,450
What is that?

831
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,710
Oh, entertainment.

832
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,410
Oh.

833
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:22,970
Question.

834
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,990
The entertainment zone.

835
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,270
There's that.

836
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:32,970
And also in terms of like name waffling, this is a little interesting.

837
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,490
Eventually they got so Universal's like, OK, we're committed to walk.

838
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,550
This is our retail identity is walk.

839
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:44,250
So then in 2011, Universal sued a planned Orlando development

840
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,650
that was supposed to be called I walk Orlando saying that it's too similar.

841
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:49,990
Universal wouldn't add the wheel.

842
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,730
We got City Walk.

843
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,670
We can't let I walk open.

844
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,630
And I bring that up because that ended up being called Icon Park.

845
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:00,170
And that's the place where we did our live show earlier in the saga.

846
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,390
That place got sued by Universal.

847
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,610
Pretty cool.

848
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,050
Huh?

849
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:05,450
Yeah.

850
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:05,830
Wow.

851
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,010
We were not only we were on we're on both sides of the line.

852
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,810
Yeah, we are not.

853
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,950
We don't have loyalty to anyone.

854
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:16,290
But I do have actually, Jason, you reminded me that there is a pretty good segue here

855
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,290
because you're just left to wonder what would the Ezone have been like?

856
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,950
Would the Ezone have been different than the City Walk that we know?

857
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,570
And I'll read you this quote that's speculative.

858
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,150
The Ezone is going to be a rock and roll place.

859
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,270
It's going to be a rap place.

860
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,610
It's going to be a fun place.

861
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,210
And that is a quote from Shaquille O'Neal,

862
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:46,210
who was going to open a restaurant at the then Ezone called Shaq's Place.

863
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,170
This is probably the biggest.

864
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,830
This is a looming giant.

865
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,090
This was Shaq.

866
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,790
Shaq weighed in on what the Ezone would have been.

867
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,570
The three tenets were rock and roll, rap, and fun.

868
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:06,570
I mean, if you are alive on this earth and you can't find something to like about one

869
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,950
of those three categories, I don't know how to help you.

870
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,290
Yeah.

871
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,870
Not basketball, though, or sports.

872
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,990
That is not what Shaq's Place is about.

873
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,410
He leaves sports on the court.

874
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,470
This is his place to rock and roll and rap out.

875
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:20,930
Yes.

876
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,030
I met Shaq once.

877
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:22,990
Oh, OK.

878
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,490
Before you lived here?

879
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:25,810
No, down here.

880
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,930
Yeah, the General is my neighbor.

881
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,910
Oh, the General lives down here.

882
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,730
Oh, OK.

883
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,630
That makes sense.

884
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:38,210
So when we see the General in ads, it's a ghost appearing in the apparition from beyond.

885
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,690
We probably get a lot of Shaq's businesses because he opens dozens and dozens every year.

886
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,070
Oh, yeah, it's got its own zip code down here.

887
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,950
Not a bad idea for an episode.

888
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:48,890
All of Shaq's.

889
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,830
That is a good idea for a business for an episode.

890
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,530
Could vanish businesses.

891
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,250
A little Shaq saga.

892
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:01,690
But Shaq's Place, billed by Universal as a giant nightclub for a giant, will feature food,

893
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:07,830
live entertainment, a billiard lounge, all billiards for Shaq, and what's described as a

894
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:12,790
high tech game room cut to a bunch of crews in the US that don't always work.

895
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:17,050
It's one of nearly a dozen restaurants and entertainment outlets anchoring the 12-acre

896
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,650
complex, which is set to open in January 1998.

897
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,410
That's not what happened.

898
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,110
They had a lot of ideas here.

899
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:28,390
It'll feature a half-corked dance floor modeled after a basketball court.

900
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,950
No, got that.

901
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,930
And live performances by recording artists, including from time to time, Shaq himself.

902
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,730
That's right.

903
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:39,190
This is so, this is like, there's articles appearing in the Orlando Sentinel in 1995.

904
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,570
Four years before you'd get an opening.

905
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:46,370
Like, did you also get a temporary Orlando Sentinel subscription?

906
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,270
That's what you have to do.

907
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,230
The Orlando Sentinel wants you to pay and I understand you got to support journalists.

908
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,770
Let us not, yes, let no one say we didn't put the prep in.

909
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,050
I paid the Orlando Sentinel.

910
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,850
I also got these quotes by the E-Zone.

911
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,970
These are important journalism.

912
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,470
So I just love-

913
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,230
We're still another week from appearing down here.

914
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,070
Yeah, unfortunately.

915
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:05,630
Yeah.

916
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:08,230
If we hadn't paid them that six bucks or whatever.

917
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,470
I spent a fortune to access the Spiderfan.

918
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,070
org archives.

919
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,190
Thousand dollars a month.

920
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,070
This editor is demanding.

921
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,510
Well, it is Jonah Jameson.

922
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:27,330
So he was screaming at me as I completed the PayPal transaction.

923
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:28,970
It's just-

924
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,590
We're gonna business story.

925
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,750
They were all in on Shaq.

926
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:35,090
Shaq was the face of CityWalk at this point, essentially.

927
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,430
Like that was gonna be the whole driving point for the place.

928
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:45,030
The legitimizing of, I mean, because I don't know at what point Emeril came on board.

929
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,330
Yeah.

930
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,110
But, you know, I think at this point, you know, and I think feel like CityWalk,

931
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:53,550
the original CityWalk got to open without all these distracting celebrity names.

932
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:58,130
But by the time 1995 rolls around, all we care about is stars.

933
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,190
It's star fucking.

934
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,010
And everybody wanted to fuck Shaq.

935
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,010
Yeah, of course.

936
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,710
And there we were.

937
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,810
This place was gonna be built around Shaq.

938
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,850
It was gonna be Shaq's spot.

939
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,290
Yeah.

940
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:16,430
Now notable to us because that space earmarked for Shaq once vacated became what?

941
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,010
Well, Margaritaville.

942
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,010
Jimmy Buffett fills the Shaq void.

943
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:26,230
Perhaps there is not this anchor location of Jimmy Buffett's franchise.

944
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:26,630
Right.

945
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,190
A name and a face you associate with CityWalk at this point.

946
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,850
Shaq was Ezone and Jimmy Buffett is CityWalk.

947
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,190
Right.

948
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,430
And it's 97 when the switch happens.

949
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,570
So we're still like a ways out from it opening.

950
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,670
So like there's people following the news.

951
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,330
They're riveted.

952
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,930
What's gonna happen at this new outdoor mall?

953
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,490
And they're seeing in 97, oh my God, like honey, honey, come quick.

954
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:55,650
Shaq will not have a presence at this new Ezone of now renamed CityWalk like the one on the other coast.

955
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:02,030
They need it but walk in the name of it because when you go from the parking garage

956
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:06,830
all the way through CityWalk, it is a little bit of a hike, you know?

957
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,650
There's moving walkways though.

958
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,370
When you get out of the garage.

959
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,650
But not, so your complaint is that there's not moving walkways the entire way.

960
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,090
If there were moving walkways in CityWalk, I would just ride those nonstop.

961
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,010
Darling, you know why they call it CityWalk?

962
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,450
Because you gotta walk a lot.

963
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,570
It's a warning.

964
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:26,730
It's not a name.

965
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,330
It's a warning.

966
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:27,610
Yeah, yeah.

967
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,530
Be prepared.

968
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,310
Here's what's funny though.

969
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:37,790
Okay, so he wants to do Shaq's place and we start announcing Shaq's place.

970
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,550
Shaq's place.

971
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:42,090
But then some other people are reading this news.

972
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:46,030
Actually, not far from what you're saying, Mike, other important Orlando denizens,

973
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,330
and they're like, wait a minute, Shaq's place.

974
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,490
What does this do to Shaq's world?

975
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:57,230
Because apparently Church Street Station, the shopping complex that Disney stole the idea of

976
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,430
for Pleasure Island and put into the ground.

977
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,010
I see all of the functioning Church Street Station businesses everywhere here.

978
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,350
If you want something from over there, just take it.

979
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,370
Oh yeah, yeah.

980
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,330
But probably, so yeah, PFO Grady's good time old place.

981
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,890
That is the name, right?

982
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,190
It's something like that.

983
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:14,950
Yeah, Uncle Mo's.

984
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,590
Some straw hats with red, white, and blue stripes.

985
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,450
Uncle Mo's family feedback.

986
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,290
PFO Grady was Church Street Station.

987
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,110
Did I get that right?

988
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:25,650
Is that correct?

989
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,170
I don't know.

990
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,210
It sounds right though.

991
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:27,630
It's something like that.

992
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,470
It's definitely like that.

993
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,130
And the wagon wheelery was that city one.

994
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,830
I've got an old compact for sorry if I can look that up.

995
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:33,810
Oh great.

996
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,390
Oh, that's right.

997
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:34,770
No internet here.

998
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,910
I'll look that up while you keep.

999
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,570
Yes, thank you.

1000
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,610
Yeah, fire that baby up.

1001
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,070
It is loud, that cooling fan.

1002
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,670
Yeah, let's edit that sound out.

1003
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,170
Oh god.

1004
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,670
Are you picking up on my Presario's fan?

1005
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,410
Where the process?

1006
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,490
Let's just shift the mics.

1007
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,450
Let's move on this way.

1008
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:55,350
Anyway, Church Street Station has been struggling ever since Michael Eisner looked at demographics

1009
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,630
said, what can we put out of business in Orlando?

1010
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,270
Saw that.

1011
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,090
All right, do it.

1012
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,010
Build me one of those.

1013
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:00,710
It worked.

1014
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,550
Church Street Station struggled ever since.

1015
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,170
It's Rosie O'Grady's good time Emporium.

1016
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,990
Whoa, I got a lot of the words right.

1017
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,770
Fortune, but I'd get a couple of those words up there.

1018
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,590
So sorry, my presario was a little slow.

1019
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,710
I couldn't get it.

1020
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,990
You got up to typing the letter S for Shaq.

1021
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,450
Accidentally opened solid there and it crashed.

1022
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,990
Boy, sorry, boy, that's the shit of living down here.

1023
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:32,090
So anyways, you know, they need a new identity.

1024
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,030
What are we going to do?

1025
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,550
They reach out to Shaq.

1026
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,110
Will you open?

1027
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:35,690
We have an idea.

1028
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,710
What if you open like a nightclub and he's like, all right, yeah, great Shaq's World.

1029
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,210
And then city Ezone comes to him.

1030
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,030
All right, sounds good.

1031
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:42,690
Shaq's Place.

1032
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,910
And I think genuinely they were like, what is it?

1033
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:47,270
Where does this leave us?

1034
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,170
So we we needed a Shaq restaurant.

1035
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,650
And then sure enough, they never got the Shaq.

1036
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,050
They didn't get Shaq's Place.

1037
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,930
Oh, wait, sorry.

1038
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,550
They didn't get Shaq's World as he's never got Shaq's Place.

1039
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,930
Years go by, the place keeps languishing more and more.

1040
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:05,010
And as we may have covered at some point, it took years and years before

1041
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:09,210
Church Street station finally said, oh, we have somebody to revitalize this area.

1042
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,010
It's boy band impresario Lou Pearlman.

1043
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,250
We're giving him all of it.

1044
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,750
And this will be where he does all his boy band auditions,

1045
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,270
where he conducts all his not shady business.

1046
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,530
And then he didn't.

1047
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,170
In addition to just crumbling and going to jail, he also didn't like open.

1048
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,130
I think he opened one steakhouse.

1049
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,390
The only guy of 86 from this place.

1050
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,410
Oh, you won't let Lou hang out here.

1051
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,610
No, Lou's not welcome.

1052
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,510
Oh, man.

1053
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:39,010
He started trying to recruit all of your family members to be in his new group.

1054
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,850
His all demon boy band.

1055
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,010
This one's going to be on the level.

1056
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,470
It's like five, five handsome demons.

1057
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,030
He's telling them what to do.

1058
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,550
The Church Street base.

1059
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:52,910
Oh, wow.

1060
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,950
In sync, you might call handsome devils, but these are literal handsome demons.

1061
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:07,270
Um, anyway, this was not the end of the Shaq chicanery because then

1062
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:12,890
Disney World did open something called the official All Star Cafe.

1063
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,550
Yeah, some of it was we didn't have time for this in celebrity,

1064
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,310
but there was this restaurant owned by a bunch of athletes.

1065
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,470
And Shaq was one of them.

1066
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,950
He's a partner in that company.

1067
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:26,490
And they announced and then did open this, I believe, at the Wild World of Sports.

1068
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,290
That one did get off the ground.

1069
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,770
I think that's a Planet Hollywood restaurant.

1070
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,290
Money went into that and away from Marvel Mania.

1071
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,110
Sorry, Jason.

1072
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,710
And some lose some.

1073
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,290
But anyway, apparently they were asked, he was asked like,

1074
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:45,310
so how does this restaurant differ from the one that you're going to open at Universal's E-Zone?

1075
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,370
And he said, oh, the All Star Cafe is going to be a whole lot better.

1076
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,350
So then Orlando Sentinel reaches out to Universal and they say,

1077
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,150
I think he's just got a great sense of humor.

1078
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,690
What a kidder, eh?

1079
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:05,230
So Shaq is playing three Orlando establishments against each other.

1080
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:09,350
I said this when we did the Shaqtoberfest episode that I truly, no joke,

1081
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:13,130
love Shaq's approach to all of his business ventures.

1082
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,590
Because you get the sense that all these famous people,

1083
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:22,050
Wahlberg, Rock, it's so calculated and they're doing such like careful planning of tequila.

1084
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,830
And now they have this and now they're buying into this and they want to be moguls.

1085
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,110
Shaq just seems like he's letting it fly.

1086
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,150
They go like, hey, you want the general?

1087
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,710
Yeah, I'll do the general, whatever.

1088
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,070
Yeah, Papa John's take.

1089
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:32,710
Yeah, whatever.

1090
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:34,850
Going to him and him saying no.

1091
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,090
Yeah, you'd feel bad.

1092
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:39,650
Shaq's chicken.

1093
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,610
Yeah, great.

1094
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,330
Let's do it.

1095
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,610
It doesn't matter.

1096
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:46,930
And it's the best, I don't know, it's the most fun way for a celebrity to throw his name,

1097
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,910
play three different locations against each other.

1098
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,310
And then accidentally by that, like accidentally maybe.

1099
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:54,110
Yep.

1100
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,730
I just think he wasn't thinking about it.

1101
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:56,950
He didn't think there were conf, you know,

1102
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:00,550
sometimes on Shark Tank, Mark will go, well, I already have a business that's similar to this.

1103
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:00,770
Right.

1104
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:01,330
They compete.

1105
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,730
So for those reasons, I'm out.

1106
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:03,650
Shaq would never do that.

1107
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:04,910
Shaq would never be out on anything.

1108
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,810
He would go, they should get him on Shark Tank because he'd just go, yes, yes, yes.

1109
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:10,930
Shaq, you've hit a new.

1110
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:11,710
Before the pitch.

1111
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,090
You've hit a new.

1112
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,910
They don't even make it all the way down the hallway.

1113
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:18,970
Shaq says yes to.

1114
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,990
Local businessman from Dallas.

1115
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:22,610
Yes.

1116
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,170
Go ahead, turn around.

1117
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:26,110
I'll talk to you later.

1118
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,290
He doesn't even realize some of this.

1119
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:33,350
It's like prayer Apple launch and just blow Walbers out of the water.

1120
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,250
Scott has now found a new show called Shaq's Tank.

1121
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,970
That would be very entertaining.

1122
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:41,890
That's good.

1123
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:42,490
Yeah.

1124
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:42,890
Yes.

1125
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,690
And you get turn around, you know, all those Shark Tank segments take like 10 minutes.

1126
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:50,330
This you, you can bang through 300 businesses every hour.

1127
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,670
Shaq could probably just like, we could call this Shaq's podcast, the ride.

1128
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,250
If we made him the right offer.

1129
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:56,990
Oh, how do we do that?

1130
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,370
Let's figure out, let's find his business manager.

1131
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:04,490
Like a month of just Shaq's podcast, the ride, like the Dana Carvey show will be like the

1132
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:08,110
mug root beer Dana Carvey, like just Shaq's podcast, the ride for at least a month.

1133
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,570
Oh man.

1134
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:09,390
This is the answer.

1135
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,870
Look, you're hearing this on Patreon and listeners.

1136
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,650
We appreciate your support and your financial donations.

1137
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,810
But if you could help us figure out Shaq, then we could just make like

1138
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:22,890
500K a month and not need the listener support.

1139
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:23,150
Yeah.

1140
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:24,610
That fixes the entire.

1141
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:25,110
It does.

1142
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,210
last eight months, but it's going to be a lucrative.

1143
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,150
We're going to tear it up in those eight months.

1144
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,770
Spoiler podcast, move over to Shaqrion.

1145
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:44,550
It's a slam dunk.

1146
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,310
So yeah, what could have been, would Shaq have still had a presence there?

1147
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,150
If, if all of this had gone down.

1148
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:57,150
But then as sector creeper mentioned off Mike, then he left Orlando entirely.

1149
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,490
So maybe he wouldn't have, and when he's open businesses and, and haunts, obviously.

1150
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:05,530
Although, well, he doesn't, he doesn't play at all and he doesn't play in Los Angeles,

1151
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,550
yet he's willing to give the good people of Long Beach Shaqtoberfest.

1152
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:09,830
Right.

1153
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:10,210
Of course.

1154
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,710
So, you know, maybe, maybe it all could have been there.

1155
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:13,530
Should have done it all.

1156
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,350
Shaq's place, Shaq's world, Ulster cafe.

1157
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,390
It sounds fun.

1158
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,970
It sounds really, I'm not being, I'm not joking.

1159
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:19,850
It sounds great.

1160
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:20,490
You're really lucky.

1161
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:24,950
I'm glad Margaritaville's there, but Shaq's place sounds really fun.

1162
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,130
Let me move over a little bit and give a mention to,

1163
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:33,290
earlier, if you were wondering why is boys to men holding a picture of the E-Zone,

1164
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,170
that is because they were investors in the Motown cafe.

1165
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:37,650
Yeah.

1166
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,870
This is not a never built, this was built.

1167
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,530
And not only was it there, we didn't talk about this in another sector, did we?

1168
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:46,210
Because we talked about where it resided.

1169
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:50,650
Because it looked massive.

1170
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:57,440
This was both the Red Coconut Club on the nightclub level and Bubba Gump below it.

1171
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,470
Motown cafe was three stories.

1172
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,250
That's how it filled that.

1173
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:05,650
So they ended up splitting it and that Bubba Gump's is big.

1174
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,350
It's so interesting because I feel like they, like, when they started making these things,

1175
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:20,610
I guess city walks, like Wizards, of course, which is a fallen brother, was three stories, correct?

1176
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,550
I think so, yeah.

1177
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:25,390
So like they obviously were very ambitious when they started and then, of course,

1178
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,850
Margaritaville out here, we were like, well, there's two stories,

1179
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,030
of course, that's what's going to happen.

1180
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,490
And it's like, no, no, no, one story.

1181
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:31,630
Like they certainly-

1182
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,310
Fatal decision.

1183
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:36,270
I agree, fatal decision, but they also probably learned some sort of a logistical lesson

1184
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:40,590
about maybe we shouldn't make these things so massive.

1185
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,650
This might be the place to bring up this observation.

1186
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:46,610
This occurred to me in many, many places that we went in our city walk voyage.

1187
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:47,110
Yeah.

1188
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:52,150
When I was a kid, I used to think the bigger the restaurant is, the better,

1189
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:56,250
because I loved Planet Hollywood, loved Hard Rat Cafe.

1190
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:59,410
If it's giant, that means it's the best.

1191
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:00,950
That means they have the best food.

1192
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,410
It's the most in demand.

1193
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:07,210
And this thought occurred to me and was corrected by when I, when Mike, when you and I,

1194
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:12,250
as addressed several days ago, were hanging out in the kind of clearing out NBC Sports Grill.

1195
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:12,570
Yeah.

1196
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:17,930
And I'm like, this has room for 250 more people than they have.

1197
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,170
And it's, so when, when it's not full, it's just sad.

1198
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:27,190
And then also, as with so many of these places, it's like, no, it's not better if it's bigger.

1199
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,190
You just, what happens with the bigger restaurant is you just feel the stress.

1200
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:34,670
You feel that there's like, there's 70 people working tonight and they're all yelling each

1201
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:38,610
other and on headsets and like, I need somebody at 13, we got to spell on nine.

1202
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:44,150
It's like, it becomes like, now it's like a, this like nightclub that has to be organized.

1203
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,210
No one's having fun.

1204
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,470
Nobody has time to do anything correctly.

1205
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:50,210
Big, big restaurants are like disasters.

1206
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,010
Like tiny restaurants are probably what you want.

1207
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,870
You don't see a lot of little restaurants down here, dude.

1208
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,990
It's all hulking.

1209
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,070
All the biggest buildings I've seen in a long time.

1210
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,210
likely sliced zucchini.

1211
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:11,890
Absolutely.

1212
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,130
You get a lot of meals that just recap like get it out, get it out.

1213
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,050
They've been waiting 20 minutes.

1214
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:16,710
Get it out.

1215
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:17,890
And that's not a good day.

1216
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:23,430
This isn't like a bar that needs to be rescued by a taffer on like a regular calm day.

1217
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,050
It's pitched up to a hundred.

1218
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:26,530
Everyone's mad.

1219
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:30,270
I don't know that I ever consciously thought of like bigger is better with restaurants,

1220
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:34,510
but it certainly was more fun to go to a big place because generally a big place was full

1221
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:35,290
of nonsense.

1222
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:39,650
So it makes sense that a kid would be like, well, this is like the planet Hollywood is

1223
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,430
the finest dining on the planet.

1224
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:42,490
This is the greatest place.

1225
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:47,890
This is so special what we're doing today because when we went once to the one that

1226
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:54,350
was was at Oakbrook or whatever, it was near the Six Flags near Gurney, I was like, well,

1227
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,730
this is like this.

1228
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:57,360
I'll tell my grandchildren about this.

1229
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,030
Well, hang on.

1230
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:00,830
You will.

1231
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:02,670
We all will.

1232
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,510
We all will.

1233
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:05,850
You don't understand.

1234
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,310
They didn't use Italian bread crumbs.

1235
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,970
They use crushed up Captain Crunch on the tendies.

1236
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:18,370
It's a naked mannequin of Sylvester Stallone in a big first reuse of tendies.

1237
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,390
I knew it was coming.

1238
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:20,350
Yeah, yeah, it's coming.

1239
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,650
That's in the lexicon.

1240
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:28,430
So yeah, I get what you're saying, but yeah, I'm trying to think what is the biggest

1241
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:31,930
new place they've built even dining wise.

1242
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,310
They've turned things into other things.

1243
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:35,650
Yes.

1244
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:40,770
But I think from the ground up, because Toothsome was NBA City, we'll get into NBA City, which

1245
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:41,990
isn't Shaq's place.

1246
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,170
But yeah, I don't know.

1247
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,890
I don't think anywhere does build giant restaurants anymore.

1248
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:53,190
Yeah, I mean, Toothsome obviously is the newest one that has just a huge capacity in Orlando.

1249
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:58,750
But you really got to think about when CityWalk opens in 99, has there ever been a place with

1250
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:02,630
more massive two story restaurants at once?

1251
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:03,370
Right.

1252
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:07,050
On the same day, suddenly there's like 12, right?

1253
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:14,870
It's like the Batman Forever Gotham where there's a skyscraper and a statue holding

1254
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:15,950
the observatory.

1255
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,290
That might be from Batman and Robin.

1256
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,110
It is what it's like.

1257
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,190
That's why I like it.

1258
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:19,410
Right.

1259
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,230
Wow, you just really crystallized that.

1260
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,690
It's full of fit men holding giant items.

1261
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:27,010
Yes.

1262
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:31,190
And then like tributes to ancient Greece and Rome.

1263
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,970
CityWalk is Schumacher's Gotham.

1264
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,070
they're putting a diamond in a big telescope or something.

1265
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:43,750
The observatory is held by a big man.

1266
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:50,470
I believe a big statue man is on top of a skyscraper and then he's holding the observatory

1267
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,450
like this and that's where they are.

1268
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,210
They're all in that little thing he's holding.

1269
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,990
But that is our dream.

1270
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,830
Wizards and things like that were the closest you'd get.

1271
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,490
This is why we like all of this shit, isn't it?

1272
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:04,310
Because it's so fantastical.

1273
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,350
It's like being in the 90s Gotham.

1274
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:12,870
I never got to go.

1275
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,430
How did it fall?

1276
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,450
I didn't get to go but I'm so upset.

1277
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,290
It seems unimpeachable.

1278
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:22,790
Now the only things you see ever built in the world that are above three stories are

1279
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:26,470
boring, ugly, expensive apartment buildings you've ever seen.

1280
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:28,890
We had imagination back in these days.

1281
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,670
Or even like Toy Story.

1282
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,590
Toys R Us in Times Square.

1283
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:38,010
It was like six stories and there was a big Ferris wheel and that feels like Schumacher

1284
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:41,490
Gotham where it's just like this is so excessive in here.

1285
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:46,570
It is not a practical use of the space to put a Ferris wheel in the middle of a big store.

1286
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:52,230
It doesn't make sense but we're doing it because it's fun and that seems to be out.

1287
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:55,310
That seems to be not the way of the world at the moment.

1288
00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:01,010
I found a City Walk location that is closed that I remember the signs for.

1289
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,690
It was a nightclub called The Groove.

1290
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:08,570
I specifically remember The Groove because some nights were teen night.

1291
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,030
15 to 19 only.

1292
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,450
Which is an odd range looking back.

1293
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:16,330
Seems problematic.

1294
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:17,170
Yeah.

1295
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:24,310
That's a good way to like maybe it was all meant as a trap for this was a sting operation.

1296
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:24,790
Yeah.

1297
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,390
That's how they got him ultimately.

1298
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,290
You forget that.

1299
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,830
But like on this write-up on Hotels.

1300
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,590
com the very first thing

1301
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:38,070
The Groove Dance Club is a multi-level party venue.

1302
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,290
So that also had multi-levels.

1303
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:41,130
Multi-level.

1304
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:42,410
Bars and rooms.

1305
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,990
Baze look around do you see one story?

1306
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,330
Everything's multiple stories.

1307
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:53,410
I see nothing but crumbling giant buildings all around me.

1308
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:56,010
Anyway Motown Cafe was so gigantic.

1309
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:05,110
You walk in as I see it here it's the big 28 foot tall like wide version of like the record single

1310
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:09,510
of the Jackson 5s ABC that was on the roof when you walked in.

1311
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:12,970
They had so much like memorabilia.

1312
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:17,270
You start to add up all the everything that the Hard Rock had and there's another one with a lot

1313
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:23,650
of memorabilia I'll bring up and then just like among them like this was like the sixth thing in

1314
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:30,350
a list that this is the Motown Cafe in Orlando is where had Michael Jackson's what Michael Jackson

1315
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:33,170
wore in Motown 25 when he debuted the Moonwalk.

1316
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:33,450
Right.

1317
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:35,790
That was at this restaurant in Orlando.

1318
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:36,670
That's down here.

1319
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:40,270
And we'll probably better kept down here.

1320
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,790
That pile of t-shirts that I was trying to sell.

1321
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,130
So I would have if I just had agreed I would have had that.

1322
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,190
You would have owned that.

1323
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:46,690
Okay.

1324
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:52,730
So wait there's just a pile of Woody Woodpecker shirts and in the middle there is a Michael Jackson.

1325
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:53,910
Yeah it's in there somewhere.

1326
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:54,690
Okay.

1327
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:56,150
Where are my Stokies?

1328
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:59,010
Oh I think they're hanging around here.

1329
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,370
I don't know which ones are yours.

1330
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:02,870
Anyway that's Motown Cafe.

1331
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:08,130
Anything else anybody wants to I mean I'll look for my next one but we can go in any order.

1332
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:09,130
Yeah.

1333
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,270
We don't have that sector keeper way in a state.

1334
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:15,830
Sometimes actually it's kind of a nice change of pace to have you sector creeper because

1335
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:18,910
sector keeper can be a little like you know he's demanding with the whole.

1336
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,730
We like to chat.

1337
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,620
I can't even remember my own phone number.

1338
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:24,390
Geez I kind of like this.

1339
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:25,390
This guy is a little more free with.

1340
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:25,970
Like this guy.

1341
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,430
I'm a little free wheeled yeah.

1342
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:32,930
Yeah I like he's a Beetlejuice like the Beetlejuice character is a little bit like kind of out of

1343
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:34,650
control this guy's a lot more chill than you.

1344
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:35,530
Yeah I'm a little chill.

1345
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,330
Well I've had like four or five quarters since you guys got.

1346
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:40,750
Oh okay all right.

1347
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:42,490
I got a little buzz going.

1348
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,070
Yeah his ponytail is extra wet I see too.

1349
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:46,770
Yeah it gets wet more and more wet.

1350
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,750
Like your head must secrete some of the beer.

1351
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,790
I wrap it around and I suck on it.

1352
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,870
Okay wait we're heading back into bad territory.

1353
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:56,830
Yeah okay.

1354
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,110
Sucking on a I mean you could just have the beer why is it better.

1355
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,650
Keep the buzz going man.

1356
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:04,370
It's like a lollipop a beer lollipop.

1357
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:05,890
This guy knows what he's talking about.

1358
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:10,170
I know what I'm talking about it's like because hair really soaks up liquid well.

1359
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:10,930
Yeah.

1360
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:15,090
So well when you're washing your hair you know hair gets really wet.

1361
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:15,690
That's right.

1362
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,210
Your skin dries slower than your hair does when you're dry.

1363
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,570
That's right so I suck on my ponytail keep the buzz going.

1364
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:22,470
Ew ew.

1365
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,950
What did you want to do in front of us though.

1366
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:29,130
I care and beer together and not a good beer maybe if it was a better beer.

1367
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:29,930
Yeah.

1368
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:34,350
Oh ew not on my people hate that and I don't like looking at it.

1369
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:34,970
Yeah.

1370
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,330
Jason says something he wants to talk about.

1371
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,410
I just found some old pictures of the groove entrance.

1372
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:41,510
Oh yeah the groove.

1373
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:47,570
And I think they left up the big tall tower but the groove next to Fat Tuesdays

1374
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:50,270
and a step away from the hot dog hall of fame.

1375
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:55,470
So if you stumble out of the groove after drinking a lot of like.

1376
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,370
On a teen night.

1377
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,550
Yeah well on a teen night.

1378
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:04,330
On adult night yeah if you're drinking like some Midori cocktails that's the watermelon one right.

1379
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,730
Makes it green like a sour.

1380
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,230
I don't know the answer that because I don't drink bullshit.

1381
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:16,670
Well we're talking about the groove so you could stumble out for a night cap at.

1382
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:21,210
A fat Tuesdays and then eat a big Chicago hot dog.

1383
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,070
Yeah sure that sounds like it sounds good I would do it.

1384
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:24,770
Yeah sure.

1385
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,810
By night cap you mean like a yard.

1386
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:33,090
Yeah no oh you're you're not going to bed for a while you're getting the yard you know.

1387
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:38,270
The yard of the multi-story restaurants of drinks.

1388
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:43,830
The yard of the drink that is literally labeled as orange slush and green alcohol.

1389
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:47,710
I'm so glad there aren't more fat Tuesdays to go through.

1390
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:51,650
The original plan was for them to build 17 of them.

1391
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:58,810
I do have okay so another place with music memorabilia and you'll in Shaq's list you'll

1392
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:01,830
notice that one of the things is not blues and one of the things is not jazz.

1393
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:02,230
Right.

1394
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:05,690
A never built is BB King's Blues Club.

1395
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:06,090
Yeah.

1396
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:10,030
That was announced possibly in the Islands of Adventure preview center.

1397
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,410
Didn't end up happening.

1398
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:13,050
Here's a quote from an article.

1399
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:19,270
BB King is the master of blues but his club lost out in negotiations to a jazz combo club.

1400
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:22,630
They pitted blues and jazz against each other.

1401
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:29,930
Yeah they ended up going with City Jazz which is a combo of a lot of things they wanted to do.

1402
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:35,830
It's a jazz venue then the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz.

1403
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,770
I haven't really thought about this since copy pasting it.

1404
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,770
There was a jazz school.

1405
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:48,390
City Walk Hollywood has a UCLA extension and City Walk Orlando has a jazz school.

1406
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:56,110
Also learning it seems like it negates the like vibe of jazz to go learn it in a strip mall.

1407
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:58,030
Well.

1408
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:01,310
Also the vibe of Thelonious Monk.

1409
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,550
Yeah you don't think he would have.

1410
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:10,190
Our professor emeritus Thelonious Monk says pay us a thousand dollars a month and you'll be

1411
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:11,130
jazzing in no time.

1412
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:15,690
Cheeseburger in paradise on your way out of the door to get to class.

1413
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:18,410
All the best music resides next to each other at this place.

1414
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:21,850
Motown, Thelonious Monk, Jimmy Buffett's Cheeseburger in Paradise.

1415
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,330
You know you get all the genres which is really something.

1416
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,770
You know they were trying stuff out.

1417
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:30,870
That's what you like about these early days is they're experimenting and that's what we

1418
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:35,510
were trying to figure out the other day about UCLA and what the actual presence at

1419
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:36,790
City Walk Hollywood is.

1420
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:41,090
And why if it hasn't existed in many years is the sign still there.

1421
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,330
many other businesses and other things.

1422
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,410
Is the sign for UCLA extension?

1423
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:51,130
Yes.

1424
01:01:51,130 --> 01:02:00,410
I feel like I had a lot of professors in school and then recent LA transplants go like well if

1425
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:04,350
you really want to get a good you can always go to UCLA extension anytime.

1426
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,250
You do they have really good screenwriting.

1427
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:11,850
If you'd like to continue your education but not fully go to grad school.

1428
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,690
And you think that was maybe they were directing you to City Walk?

1429
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:15,750
No.

1430
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:20,050
Specifically the City Walk signs said UCLA.

1431
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,630
Specifically that phrase you're saying and that's what they were saying to you.

1432
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:23,210
Yeah.

1433
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:26,710
Well that's one of the big mysteries of the saga.

1434
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:28,370
It's still not really solved.

1435
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:28,930
It's still not solved.

1436
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:29,950
How open was it?

1437
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,770
How great were the courses you could take?

1438
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:32,330
Right.

1439
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,270
Next to Wizards.

1440
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:34,730
I'm not sure.

1441
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:35,790
Right next to where Wizards was.

1442
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:39,570
I'm adjunct actually adjunct professor at the UCLA extension down here.

1443
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:41,190
Okay.

1444
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:42,610
Well you give back.

1445
01:02:42,610 --> 01:02:42,990
Yeah.

1446
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,550
Other ghosts and spirits and devils.

1447
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:46,650
No tenure?

1448
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,490
Brother I wish.

1449
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,050
You'll get there keep working at it.

1450
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:57,130
It's kind of a holdover situation where there was an accident I heard.

1451
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,850
Kind of like a similar situation to that.

1452
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:04,270
You guys are like my holdover boys in a way.

1453
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:05,230
A little bit.

1454
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:05,610
A little bit.

1455
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:08,490
You know what because we're all forced to come here.

1456
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:08,790
Right.

1457
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:10,090
Now we're kind of bonding.

1458
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:10,550
That's right.

1459
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,330
And having a nice little time.

1460
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,650
It's kind of a holdover situation.

1461
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:16,030
I don't know which of my eyes is fake or not.

1462
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:20,530
Wow.

1463
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:20,930
Wow.

1464
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,850
It's the feel good sector of the saga.

1465
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:24,490
That's right.

1466
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:26,210
Okay.

1467
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:31,250
And then also as part of this thing there was the Downbeat Jazz Hall of Fame.

1468
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:34,190
So there was a Jazz Hall of Fame in this also.

1469
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,250
And then there's like a bunch of like jazz items.

1470
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:41,750
And these are you know we get maybe spoiled with our like

1471
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:48,770
you know that's the guitar that belonged to Vince Neil or whatever.

1472
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:52,370
Cool stuff that you would find at Hard Rock or wherever.

1473
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,470
These things are a little more mundane.

1474
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:58,090
Like Count Basie's health insurance card.

1475
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:05,270
A payment ledger to pay the Woody Herman Orchestra in 1948.

1476
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:10,590
I mean then there's some like then there's some musical instruments.

1477
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:11,170
That's good.

1478
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:16,760
But then the like hang on Stan Kenton's shoes.

1479
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:21,650
Art Blakely Seniors hat.

1480
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:26,550
A Sun Ra walking stick and Miles Davis's high school diploma.

1481
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:31,090
This was what a magical place.

1482
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:32,870
There was this is real good.

1483
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:38,290
What what Michael Jackson wore when he like shot into the stratosphere as a superstar.

1484
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:41,810
And then a couple feet away Miles Davis's high school diploma.

1485
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:45,270
And nobody ever thought about any of this or noticed it.

1486
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,090
No no one talked about it.

1487
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:49,950
Their brain barely even allowed the information in.

1488
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,170
They just kind of wanted to buy it.

1489
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:54,910
It's so wild.

1490
01:04:55,470 --> 01:05:01,030
This is almost all these items just feel like oh this would be like a part of a full exhibit on this artist.

1491
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:02,830
You go that would make sense.

1492
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:05,770
You saw like them go through school and where they went to school.

1493
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,390
Exhibits and museums that are worse that have worse things.

1494
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:14,670
Of course but like another all like the sum of its parts you would go like get a picture of the person

1495
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:18,710
and what they did or whatever versus just taking a little piece out and going

1496
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:22,690
well this was their uh this was their Lowry's card.

1497
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:26,470
Art Tatum's Lowry.

1498
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,290
Dave Brubeck's unused condom.

1499
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:34,730
Always prepared.

1500
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:36,690
Yeah it's so wild.

1501
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:38,390
Kets in his instrument case.

1502
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:40,030
Well of course yeah.

1503
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,330
Yeah really weird and then City Jazz.

1504
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,370
I found this on the website.

1505
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:50,310
Every Thursday through Sunday night City Jazz turns into Bunkers Comedy Club.

1506
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:51,250
Bunkers.

1507
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:58,550
Bunkers is the same brand that had a stat that we wanted to play at the Margaritaville resort

1508
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,610
where we named where we did the street names.

1509
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:01,010
Right.

1510
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:03,150
That was their comedy club and it's not there anymore.

1511
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:06,690
God I'm looking around now there's so many bunkers comedy clubs.

1512
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,230
So many locations of bunkers.

1513
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,790
There's some more over there too.

1514
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:11,330
And you could smoke in bunkers.

1515
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,230
Oh and you have to get in.

1516
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:14,370
Cigar bar yeah.

1517
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:15,150
In comedy clubs.

1518
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:18,390
It's a two drink minimum four pack minimum.

1519
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:19,950
Four pack of cigars?

1520
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:24,430
Oh wow that's like four cigar how many in a pack?

1521
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:25,430
I don't know.

1522
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:26,930
Is how many Stogies are in a pack?

1523
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,190
Where are my Stogies?

1524
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:31,950
I think you usually say so Stogies are probably singles I'm guessing.

1525
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:33,570
I really don't know.

1526
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:35,410
No yeah no I think you're onto something.

1527
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:39,330
Yeah probably like expensive Stogies are like one you buy one at a time.

1528
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:40,890
I'm again guessing here.

1529
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:45,970
There's such a cigar presence that it makes sense there's cigars down here

1530
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,490
because there was the cigars with a Z that we talked about.

1531
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:51,450
Emeril's had a cigar room apparently.

1532
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:55,630
Big enough space in Emeril's restaurant for the full cigar room.

1533
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:57,670
Maybe I will.

1534
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:01,190
I kind of love it like you'd be like honey excuse me.

1535
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:03,590
I'm gonna go hang out in the cigar room at Emeril's.

1536
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:07,890
Would you mind like the boys and I are hitting Emeril's tonight.

1537
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:10,290
Oh okay yeah well they've got the cigar room there.

1538
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:16,770
So like as I would assume it's a dude maybe I'm wrong but it's dude a dude room.

1539
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:20,550
And it might have been what Jason's dad did on the family trips.

1540
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,210
Oh yeah.

1541
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:25,430
Because Jason now it's hour 10 of Jason going but I saw it in the brochure

1542
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:27,750
but then they didn't end up opening Marvel Mania.

1543
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,390
I mean I like the Marvel rides but Marvel Mania is its own.

1544
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:34,030
I'm gonna go even if I sneak off to Emeril's cigar room.

1545
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:37,870
He was I think at the time would have been smoking a pipe.

1546
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:39,830
Oh wow.

1547
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:46,430
So he might have you know you just get a plate of etouffee and a packed fresh pipe.

1548
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:52,010
Are you allowed to smoke a freshly packed pipe in Emeril's cigar room?

1549
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:52,410
I don't know.

1550
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:53,630
Is there any smoking available?

1551
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:54,910
I feel like there must have been.

1552
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:57,670
Why have a cigar room if not the ability to do that?

1553
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:00,110
I would think so but like cigarettes in there.

1554
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:04,370
Cigarettes I feel like generally smell like a cigar can smell at least okay.

1555
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,710
A little earthier.

1556
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:10,210
But if you go if it's a cigarette room I feel like the smell would be really bad.

1557
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,670
I don't think anywhere offered cigarette rooms.

1558
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:13,970
That doesn't sound good.

1559
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:17,590
So but you probably a pipe though because pipe tobacco would smell better probably.

1560
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:20,990
Yeah it did smell more fragrant.

1561
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:22,230
Pipe tobacco.

1562
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:23,130
Not the room.

1563
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,270
You never went to the room.

1564
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:25,650
No I never went to the room.

1565
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:27,690
I don't really remember the room.

1566
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:33,130
I didn't know the room existed until yesterday.

1567
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:39,250
We ate at the bar once before like we were you know checking out and going to the airport

1568
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:45,110
that day and there was like a solo business traveler and I don't know if he knew the chef

1569
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:51,290
or they were just like oh this guy's still but they just kept giving him small plates like.

1570
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:56,270
You remember like a solo business traveler just getting little plates.

1571
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,690
I don't think he's paying for it that's why he didn't remember it.

1572
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:03,010
No he was gonna pay but I was just like we just ordered off the menu

1573
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:07,010
and they were like oh you can walk in sit at the bar if you just.

1574
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:08,570
This is a childhood memory.

1575
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:12,050
This is like 15 16.

1576
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,350
It's still a long time ago.

1577
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:23,910
I don't know who this guy was it was like when I was at Napa Rosa the great California once

1578
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:31,390
and sat in a local from Orange County at this Disneyland restaurant this local asked for his

1579
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:32,770
usual bottle.

1580
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:35,010
Well I had that at Trader Sam's.

1581
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:36,010
I've said that before.

1582
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,870
That's a thing that happens at restaurants that's not weird.

1583
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:41,370
It's a little weird next to a theme park.

1584
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:43,390
No it's not that's a really nice restaurant.

1585
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:45,010
That's completely reasonable.

1586
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:49,570
Remember I told you at Trader Sam's before WonderCon the guy walked in and he goes hey Bob like what

1587
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:53,750
do you have in the usual and I was like holy shit there's a guy at Trader Sam's with the usual.

1588
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:57,550
I am interested though did you go to like a hypnotist that uncovered this memory.

1589
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:00,530
This is so specific for like when you were 15.

1590
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:05,530
This is a formative memory man I'm talking about your first home run your first kiss

1591
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:08,890
first time seeing a businessman get small plates in an airport.

1592
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:13,510
Okay well the first one didn't happen the second one happened a lot later.

1593
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:18,590
I had to fill in some things at 15.

1594
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,610
You gotta fixate on something.

1595
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:25,930
It's so funny.

1596
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:32,930
I guess I heard was the donut at the at a carnival I want the donut stuffed donut

1597
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:35,410
and I guess I gave it a little kiss.

1598
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:38,470
First human kiss.

1599
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:39,950
Yeah that's a different story.

1600
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:47,650
The businessman getting small plates and you were upset about it or just confused or curious.

1601
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:53,390
Probably he ordered like a prefix menu or a chef's table menu.

1602
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:58,310
I'm trying I'm doing my best I'm trying to remember if I have anything like that.

1603
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:03,110
I'm trying to remember the closest thing I can remember to anything like this is I remember

1604
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:08,630
being like six or seven and I was in Woodfield mall at a restaurant called John's Garage and

1605
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:13,930
I just have this memory that's not remarkable at all but it's a memory of there was a like a painting

1606
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:19,110
of a man with his tie in soup and I remember this disturbing me.

1607
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:23,050
I remember just eating my meal and I had to be like six or seven.

1608
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:26,910
I just remember being like disturbed by the idea that his tie was now ruined

1609
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:32,510
and it is stuck with me until this very moment which I've now said on this podcast but I'm

1610
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:36,150
trying to think of something along those lines where that no offense to what you just said

1611
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:42,010
is not a remarkable story neither is what I said but they stick with you from childhood.

1612
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:50,950
Yes I also specifically remember my meal which was like an arugula salad with fresh crab and

1613
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:54,810
candy lime rinds and I've never had that in my life.

1614
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:59,390
Hang on a second you remember this from 15 you remember the specific order and all the plates

1615
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:06,770
that you got and yet when there was an ice cream place that you loved loved enough to do an entire

1616
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:10,330
dough boys about it you couldn't remember the name of the restaurant.

1617
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:16,250
You did a two hours of podcasting about it and that only happened like four years ago.

1618
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:20,150
What is that place called it went totally under.

1619
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:21,390
You don't remember it now?

1620
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,190
Ample Hills.

1621
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:22,950
Ample Hills.

1622
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:28,090
But somehow you remember the entire arugula salad an unremarkable item

1623
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:30,530
that you ordered at Emeril's when you were 15.

1624
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:33,950
Well there's been a lot of ice cream places open and closed in LA.

1625
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:36,690
Sweet where it was creamery and studio city clothes.

1626
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:37,150
Oh yeah.

1627
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:41,610
Some of these gelato there was gelato place in Los Feliz I really love that's gone.

1628
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:46,950
My mom barely remembers what happens she can't barely name the name of this podcast I do but

1629
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:53,930
she can probably tell you who Susan Day from the Partridge family dated because she read Teen Beat

1630
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:56,330
in at a certain point in her life.

1631
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:57,250
I would like to know.

1632
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:01,330
Well I don't know that off the top of my head so I'm just saying the formative years

1633
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:04,890
that's when they really that stuff imprints on you in your brain.

1634
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:05,530
You're a sponge.

1635
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:08,250
Did you date David Cassidy actually question mark?

1636
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:12,510
Well David Cassidy famously went on a date with what's her name the mom.

1637
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:16,690
Did that happen too I know Florence Henderson and Barry Williams but it also happened to

1638
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:22,830
wait no no are you confusing it with that because Shirley Jones was married to his dad.

1639
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:25,110
Maybe I'm confusing it with a Brady Bunch.

1640
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:28,370
They were family members basically so if they went on a date that's

1641
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,310
fucked up.

1642
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:33,970
You might be right yeah I think I'm confusing the Barry Williams.

1643
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:37,270
David Cassidy you better not have gone on a date with your stepmom

1644
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:39,750
who's also your mom on a show that's double weird.

1645
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:43,690
Barry Williams dating Florence Henderson is only one weird because it was a stepmother.

1646
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,530
That's a double story like a giant restaurant.

1647
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:46,590
Yeah yeah yeah.

1648
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,370
Baze you are a wild group.

1649
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:55,510
Dude we'll let it we'll let it all out old arugula salad Susan Day dating information.

1650
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:56,670
Little plates.

1651
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,890
We go fucking nuts in here.

1652
01:13:58,890 --> 01:13:59,650
Crab chunks.

1653
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:04,190
All right let's keep it let's keep it moving.

1654
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:05,030
What else do you see?

1655
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:05,650
What else do you see?

1656
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:10,610
Uh uh uh they there was they were gonna build like a like E entertainment was gonna film shows down

1657
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:16,490
there that never happened um and what's next what's big in the list NBA City let's talk NBA

1658
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:20,890
City yeah yeah which is not Shaq's there was an NBA restaurant that today is Toothsome um but

1659
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:25,650
that's the reason Toothsome is so huge is because this one went away and they needed to fill right

1660
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:31,350
how did they like Toothsome does fill up you kind of understand why Toothsome and there was a line

1661
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:37,970
out the door it's crazy yeah Toothsome so popular two stories full all the time I don't understand

1662
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:43,490
how this was initially built for NBA City this is the most cursed kind of thing because it didn't

1663
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:48,550
downtown Disney had this NBA thing that opened and closed very quickly oh yeah it just sounds

1664
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:55,630
like something that wouldn't do well well now it's especially does especially because of what

1665
01:14:55,630 --> 01:15:00,990
Bob Iger has been excited about for a decade is that NBA thing opening up the experience

1666
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:07,490
and then closing now I feel like does the NBA does it not translate to outside of a theme park mall

1667
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:14,010
well maybe they should you know focus on the bread and butter basketball yeah I get it in concept in

1668
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:19,310
the same way that any other uh dumb thing with entertainment or sports might work but then this

1669
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:26,810
I feel like would you believe I think food was not good sure uh shocker um this was the first of a

1670
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:31,910
proposed 10 of these I don't think any of them opened that's always the thing too where it's

1671
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:41,230
gonna be so many um they the bathrooms said NBA for the men and WNBA for women that's I guess that's

1672
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:51,350
I and then they had rims and nets over the trash cans I was one of their touches good I think we

1673
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:57,030
all agree that's good that's fun that's all I have about NBA everyone likes to make a basket

1674
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:06,090
shooting poorly that night then damn damn over dead is over so many people else yeah what did

1675
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:11,630
encourage if you were kind of near one for you to like throw a napkin like was there like a big

1676
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:18,770
mess developing if like dad wanted to prove or dad versus his teenage sons any sort of combination

1677
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:24,590
of competitiveness a competitive people sorry in you you may yes you're doing a little dunk contest

1678
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:30,990
your son you're like burnt from the sun all day but like you're a little lit and dad is now

1679
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:36,970
gonna try to sink a couple shots from the table how many dads tore their ACLs at the NBA city

1680
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:43,090
like fall trying to dunk what they thought would be like a funny thing to dunk and then trip over

1681
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:49,650
trip over the garbage they were all everybody was fighting all day and like I want to go in

1682
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:54,270
men in black and I want to I need to show this family who's boss yeah watch this

1683
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:56,310
oh

1684
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:03,930
just kneecaps explode sir I think your bone is showing

1685
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:11,630
just give me my Miller genuine draft I'll feel better did they have a doc there was there a doctor

1686
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:17,410
in there a court-side doctor oh yeah that could help in case everything needed that yeah for all

1687
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:23,470
the overzealous dads this is a frequent problem I I think though that might have helped it in that

1688
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:30,750
as soon as you left both theme parks you would hit our drought cafe and NBA city yeah those are in

1689
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:36,010
between like yeah across the lake you need to eat like I just I don't care I just need to eat

1690
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:41,310
something here's my might have benefited from that then you go there wait on half hour line

1691
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:47,450
you're then order and then your food shows up one hour later now you really need to prove who's boss

1692
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:54,290
the family six Miller genuine drafts deep they have four quarters to get your food

1693
01:17:57,410 --> 01:18:00,830
all right and we're at the half and it's zero zero again

1694
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:11,710
my buzzer at the buzzer ice cold mozzarella sticks

1695
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:21,250
never I think giant screens probably helped and it's just this basic stuff probably helped

1696
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:28,850
to compare to the Disney NBA experience which I was believe was about 50 or 60 dollars yes did

1697
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:36,150
not have that much to do what could you take a picture I seen or remember images of people

1698
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:42,990
taking picture with like an Adam Silver wax figure I don't think that was like well that was

1699
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:50,590
one of the drawing wax figure read of NBA head Adam Silver what I hope that's true I don't know

1700
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:56,110
if it is my plus up for this is what I think they should have built a full-size NBA court

1701
01:18:56,110 --> 01:19:01,090
and had the tables on the court it should have been lit in there like it was an arena

1702
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:05,610
and then like I guess you could have some people depending on how big it was you would have some

1703
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:09,650
people like sort of sitting in the stands but a lot of like that would be the prime dining location

1704
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:15,450
would be on the court and there would be the noises going on around your waiter would come out like

1705
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:23,650
from North Carolina yes yes standing five eight Shane there would be a little show like it at

1706
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:28,430
rainforest cafe or something maybe the waiters would come out as if yeah all once right yeah

1707
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:33,130
that's what you're saying okay yes Alan Parsons project yeah I was in the partisan project everybody

1708
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:39,290
like once an hour Jason's right there was indeed a photo app with a wax

1709
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:46,830
maker of the abyss over at the NBA experience this was Bob Iger's pet project he was so excited

1710
01:19:46,830 --> 01:19:56,110
about it he was so bold like nondescript man I why would they make a wax figure of him

1711
01:19:56,110 --> 01:20:04,650
dad can I get a picture with Adam's yeah 50 bucks for you 50 for mom and 50 for dad

1712
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:12,350
and this will occupy two and a half hours maybe Bob Iger isn't the smartest man on the planet

1713
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:16,170
oh god we got all right let's file this away we got yeah we got to talk to you

1714
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:23,690
and maybe Adam's silver wax figure is a separate episode um uh anything else about NBA city no

1715
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:32,110
giant statue that giant like brass statue outside of a nondescript player of a nondescript player

1716
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:39,930
it's not particularly dynamic oh I think there was a three point shot like fenced in area where

1717
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:49,250
you could try your luck that's like a half court shot contest to get like a free you know potato

1718
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:54,090
oh yeah that would be good yeah yeah yeah that's what they do that I don't know they should have

1719
01:20:54,090 --> 01:21:00,490
and and the regular restaurant service continues during all that it spills drinks than it does

1720
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:06,690
yeah some of the um I think the message board rumors this was eyed it's like well maybe

1721
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:13,590
there's talk this could be the wwe hall of fame oh yeah yeah oh there's a never built

1722
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:19,290
oh yeah it wasn't ever built for sure but a big problem was they had contracts for taping

1723
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:25,810
other promotions that's right uh at the sound stages in between the parks so there was a

1724
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:30,630
conflict of interest oh oh gotcha okay I mean one of the closest things now to hall of fame

1725
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:37,990
has just been opened in Saudi Arabia really it's not a hall of fame but it is like a theme parkie

1726
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:44,090
through the undertaker section thing that is just recently open there yes and he uh gave an

1727
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:52,290
a sports the undertaker came out in costume with his music during like a football a football match

1728
01:21:52,290 --> 01:22:00,290
or sock american soccer yeah yeah christiano renaldo was like laughing oh you saw this yeah

1729
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:06,390
I saw I watched for some reason they flew the undertaker out to do this to give the trophy

1730
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:12,910
yeah I don't it's not a wrestling they love the undertaker it's the kingdom of saudi of ravi

1731
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:19,670
yeah they do I mean what you which place doesn't love the undertaker yeah it's kind of kind of his

1732
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:25,990
vibe a little bit yeah that's true I love the tagger yeah yeah um I had some cool long hats like

1733
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:31,370
that um I I'm gonna do this one because it's a little maybe the last one's a little funnier

1734
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:35,770
and you know we're in kind of the neck of the woods we're over uh across the lake

1735
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:44,450
and uh right around here was something that got um the rare move of being sectioned off rezoned

1736
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:51,010
you might say from the theme park into city walk despite being a long walk I apologize

1737
01:22:51,930 --> 01:23:00,410
from the main city walk uh and that being when they opened a new entertainment uh uh production

1738
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:07,590
uh out of the former nickelodeon studios turning that into the blue man group the blue man group

1739
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:12,430
had a residency for a long time yeah it's really you know that's technically in the park but they

1740
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:18,750
did they created a new entrance they like re uh you know re landscaped it down there that looked

1741
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:23,290
nice so that's but that was city walks I do feel like we have to talk about it yeah anyone ever see

1742
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:29,630
it I never saw it uh it seemingly is very successful you know like because it lasted so long

1743
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:38,590
I saw their show at their uh theater in astor place in Manhattan okay in like the early 2000s

1744
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:43,910
and it was really fun this is one of those things where I feel like I would have not bet a lot of

1745
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:48,430
money that this is going to be a lasting thing but the blue man group is going to be something

1746
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:53,470
that will have like different shows in different parts of the country many outposts many outposts

1747
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:58,990
many blue men like it doesn't feel like dad is gonna love this on especially on a vacation but

1748
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:03,910
boy would I have been wrong yeah like blue man really has probably made a lot of money

1749
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:10,250
it's silly it's funny it's not pretentious uh yeah you know it feels like culture but then is

1750
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:16,170
sort of theme parky I watched a video of what was some of what was at this show when I think it's

1751
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:22,150
like they like enter video screens and then leave perfectly synced up yeah you know play a big

1752
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:27,710
xylophone a bunch of pipes I have no problems with anything that happened at this blue man

1753
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:32,550
group show as far as I can tell they do a lot of physical comedy they shoot a lot of streamers and

1754
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:38,890
I think they shoot like I don't want to say toilet paper but they shoot like paper in the audience

1755
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:42,990
and people like that and then they do a lot of stuff with paint and paint balls

1756
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:46,990
not they don't shoot the audience with paintball but they shoot each other

1757
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:52,910
and there's like funny little gags have I told this story before on the show that I used to edit

1758
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:57,690
clip show I've said this I guess but have I said that I edited a clip that was so revolting once

1759
01:24:57,710 --> 01:25:03,470
I felt physically sick and almost threw up it was for the show whacked out videos all right warning

1760
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:11,850
and I guess that's a whole channel down here you get most of what you watch pluto tv down here

1761
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:19,370
oh yeah yeah a wax so whacked out sports was the original that was a big big uh big uh ad mover it

1762
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:27,690
would like beat leno in certain markets and it was sports accidents and then they had a spin-off

1763
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:34,250
very much so they were like that that's why I got the job uh and they just had a clip library of

1764
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:42,470
almost like snuff film level like weirdness nobody died as far as I saw but you would find clips in

1765
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:49,210
there and go oh my god what is this and there were two clips of a person with a blue face dressed like

1766
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:54,830
a blue man and I'm like well what is this clip so I'm watching it and the guy is is like sitting

1767
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:58,410
there like silently or he's lying down I can't even remember and he just starts going

1768
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:09,230
and then he throws up blue paint all over his face and it's like this looks like a grainy

1769
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:14,550
home video from like 1998 quality I don't know what year is from and then there's a second video

1770
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:21,170
where he has like just like a bright yellow face and he throws up yellow paint same guy I

1771
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:26,910
like the same guy and he throws it up all over himself and it really made it seem like he wasn't

1772
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:33,570
in his mouth he had it in his stomach and he was like regurgitating it up and the way the reason

1773
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:40,610
it made me feel like I was gonna get sick is because it took so long the like like and I'm

1774
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:51,150
just like watching this going what is that like and I remember thing up fluid he was barfing up

1775
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:56,430
I put off editing it for a couple weeks and then at a certain point everything was just there was

1776
01:26:56,430 --> 01:27:00,850
only a couple things left in the pile and at that point I had seen the video so I was not I was

1777
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:04,630
a little used to it and we see a cut of the we haven't seen a cut of the paint guy yet yeah

1778
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:10,770
puke guy puke paint man put it after uh cow ripken jr getting hit with a ball in the crotch

1779
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:21,130
Jason that is too expensive footage for this situation you are more likely to see like a

1780
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:26,930
no no name crotch hits that's right yeah yeah so so every time anybody talks about the blue man

1781
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:33,570
group now my first thought is these these clips your blue man is a man regurgitating there's a

1782
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:40,330
man who threw up paint slowly job was that on a cot like a prison cot in one of them lying down

1783
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:45,710
and you watch for two minutes while he's just trying to summon this paint back up

1784
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:50,250
do you think he was doing this of his own will or was he being forced to by somebody who was

1785
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:57,610
going to pocket the money from whacked out videos I have I have many jokes that I won't say about

1786
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:03,450
people who ran whacked out videos but it's anything is possible I'll say that and anybody

1787
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:08,990
could have gotten these clips from this could have been a prisoner of war this could have easily been

1788
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:15,390
footage obtained after some sort of a raid and their vhs in the yeah in the tape library I'm

1789
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:19,950
worried I mean I wonder do we need to contact some sort of human rights organization because

1790
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:24,030
I feel like the conditions that this person was living under were totally whacked out

1791
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:31,090
well I think you're correct about that I felt that they were whacked out for sure I feel like

1792
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:37,650
I have done a you in a bit where they like dribble paint out of their mouth yes but I don't know that

1793
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:42,890
anyone is trying to regurgitate it in agony on a journey I don't think that happened to a blue man

1794
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:47,170
this was a failed audition tape the you here well quick I have to make a joke I was about to make

1795
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:53,330
the UN oftentimes classify situations as whacked out so you have to make sure

1796
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:58,310
there's unhealthy there's dangerous and there's whacked out right so they have a sort of a board

1797
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:04,310
to decide that yeah flag different humanitarian crisis crises has whacked out was it whacked out

1798
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:08,870
sports he said well whacked out sports was original I was working in this instance on whacked out

1799
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:15,450
videos oh brother now I would go on to work on sports crash which was a different sports

1800
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:21,650
accident show but that was not whacked out sports and not whacked out the accidents were less whacked

1801
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:25,750
out I guess yeah a little more grounded you were kind of like editing phases of death

1802
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:34,490
in many ways I was yes there were other shows too but we don't have time that was your job was to

1803
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:39,170
sift through the ones like this one's funny this one started funny but then the person died yeah

1804
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:45,630
I think to be honest the main editor I would not be shocked if he went through all these clips

1805
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:52,150
and took the ones where people died out so the assistant editors didn't see them I wouldn't be

1806
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:56,750
shocked if that's sort of what was going on the Orlando mayor shot himself that was that was sent

1807
01:29:56,750 --> 01:30:04,690
in as a whacked out video no no it was a Pennsylvania politician you're thinking of our bud Dwyer

1808
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:11,990
killing himself who was not buddy Dyer the mayor of Orlando wow I might be after an episode we just

1809
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:16,890
did the episode this is like ample hell you're right you're right I apologies we just went through

1810
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:21,750
this and yet I presented that as an Orlando mayor you said it so confidently is that the Orlando

1811
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:27,050
mayor who killed him you know what it's like bud Dwyer and buddy Dyer and they're both politicians

1812
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:33,630
our very nice why everyone killed himself on camera but he's not current Orlando mayor buddy

1813
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:41,950
Dyer now buddy Dyer didn't has not died our bud Dwyer died yeah so you got to keep that straight

1814
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:49,370
see podcasting is like that jazz club that used to be at city wall yeah podcasting is like jazz

1815
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:56,090
we know that we say it all the time you're saying the memories you forgot yeah

1816
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:04,570
that is like soloing that's when you solo is when I tell the soup the soup uh tie story that's a solo

1817
01:31:04,570 --> 01:31:09,150
I did on this show this is like you know well it's like that you know there's this joke I don't know

1818
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:15,270
if you know it the aristocrats and when a comic tells it it's basically like a jazz guy doing some

1819
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:21,830
it is like that yeah anyway you can buy a DVD of a home video movie about the aristocrats

1820
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:29,430
that's true I um okay blue man group um the I don't know there was a poncho zone

1821
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:34,230
when they gave you the poncho they didn't charge you so you'd be yeah to wear a poncho in the first

1822
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:38,790
first few rows or you'd get wet possibly with regurgitated paint I'm not sure I'm all mixed

1823
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:45,190
up on this now uh it was at the sharp aquos theater Nickelodeon became the sharp aquos theater that is

1824
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:52,450
type of television yeah that is still around um I this is all fine except that it was done over the

1825
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:58,330
husk of Nickelodeon studios which I love very much and seeing I felt a betrayal seeing those

1826
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:05,890
curious blue faces yeah instead of the Nickelodeon splat that I love very much um this is one of those

1827
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:12,190
things that uh got screwed by covid this it ran it was very successful it ran from 2007 to 2021

1828
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:17,690
in 2017 blue man group was acquired by Cirque du Soleil for 65 million dollars which doesn't

1829
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:22,410
sound like enough honestly pretty cheap uh so maybe that wasn't good but that gave uh

1830
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:27,950
suddenly there was a blockade of Cirque du Soleil presence in Orlando there was no man group and of

1831
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:32,770
course the downtown Disney there was Cirque du Soleil's La Nuba so you could of course too we all

1832
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:38,210
know of course La Nuba um so you could take your pick but then covid was really bad to Cirque du

1833
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:42,630
Soleil they shut everything down they were already I think having some financial troubles

1834
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:47,610
and then covid exasperated it but yeah so they uh they shut down everything fired everybody although

1835
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:54,790
I think they've bounced back yeah I think they've rehired a ton um La Nuba went away uh gave gave

1836
01:32:54,790 --> 01:33:01,330
over to uh gave away to drawn to life as we know uh but uh blue man group I think after a year it

1837
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:06,970
was like uh yeah we're never doing that again that's not coming back yeah um so uh RIP covid

1838
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:12,570
fallen brother right you might not like really didn't die of co no blue men died of covid as far

1839
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:20,830
as we know but the the show did this another one like journey into imagination where like uh I know

1840
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:29,590
theme parks don't bring back stuff usually but if you put a little bit of money into putting that

1841
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:37,390
geyser back in and you read did the Nickelodeon studios as like a nostalgia museum

1842
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:44,510
oh that's true I think the uh you know older millennials with disposal income would be there

1843
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:48,370
in a heartbeat but if they're getting rid of our legacy stores do they really think that we're a

1844
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:51,810
long term I don't know I'm I don't I like what you're I look I like what you're saying they don't

1845
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:56,310
think that we're a long they don't think we're long term yeah they think our generation's gonna

1846
01:33:56,310 --> 01:34:01,650
give up yeah what we care about doesn't matter that's what they did by closing that store

1847
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:09,890
is there any chance of Comcast buying Viacom oh yes there's a chance of Exxon mobile buying

1848
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:17,490
Viacom uh-huh there's a chance of Byron Allen buying of an Exxon station buying Viacom I'll

1849
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:26,010
be watching gas tv oh I love gas station tv now that's the quick bites that Quibi should

1850
01:34:26,010 --> 01:34:31,610
yeah it was already taken care of by gas tv I just suck when they crack down we can't share our gas

1851
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:40,050
station tv oh yeah yeah um okay a ramping of speed as we can get to the end appropriately ramping

1852
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:47,250
of speed as we talk about the nascar sports grill uh that came that they had that too I know I mean

1853
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:53,170
you know you're around all of it yeah yeah but every every sport and every music all were represented

1854
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:59,610
uh there was a nascar restaurant it's uh what is now NBC sports grill which I referred to

1855
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:06,890
there are room for 530 people in there um it's one of when painted that way and not in the current

1856
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:11,590
NBC style which I think is okay graphically the nascar style made it one of the ugliest buildings

1857
01:35:11,590 --> 01:35:20,050
I've ever looked at giant checkered flag weird bad this something claims that uh the in front

1858
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:25,890
of the restaurant was the winner's circle where the reigning nascar Winston cup champions car is

1859
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:32,270
on display when it opened it was Jeff Gordon's du Pont Chevrolet the 1998 champion there's no

1860
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:38,190
fucking way they ever changed that car right yeah they are not changing a car every year

1861
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:43,990
far beyond the kind of thing anywhere but correct me if I'm wrong I don't know how often these

1862
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:52,070
changed their frying oil and the fries let alone I have a suspicion how much um you led me into the

1863
01:35:52,070 --> 01:36:00,150
food which sounded uh spectacular um you know nachos with squeezy cheese uh sour cream is extra

1864
01:36:00,150 --> 01:36:08,490
of course yeah that's 12 that's 12 dollars the nascar spirit you know um they had uh uh something

1865
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:16,570
called ruben rolls which were egg rolls but the innards more like ruben sandwiches and you could

1866
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:23,010
dip them in russian dressing oh and I think that's where I'm thinking a big meaty ruben sandwich

1867
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:27,810
it's the breakfast guy who sucks beer out of his own ponytail that's disgusting

1868
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:33,990
you know you know what scott I hate to tell I'm looking at different photos and there are

1869
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:39,890
different cars really in different photos maybe they did it yeah like just so callous

1870
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:45,250
I know we're doing any change out that they said that's white and then there's one with a blue one

1871
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:50,290
here and there's one they're just painting the same car I'm not sure oh there's two here at this

1872
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:54,950
point huh and they're not always two was there a tie that year maybe there was a tie yeah because

1873
01:36:54,950 --> 01:37:00,230
here look there's only one here this year huh and then so maybe they were driving the cars did they

1874
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:05,550
forget to take the key out of the ignition well probably all the time you could just tool around

1875
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:09,830
you could just steal a nascar drive it into the river that's why there was only one in that one

1876
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:16,650
shot because some kids stole it the other the runner-up was stolen we have maybe I don't know

1877
01:37:16,650 --> 01:37:25,830
um the here's some other menu items points leader chicken alfredo rate ruben is racing barbecue ribs

1878
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:33,770
ruben is racing ruben is race calculate that what that means like a dry rub I guess

1879
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:41,150
I guess so is it why but why is ruben a guy but is a rubber is it rubber I don't think so ruben is

1880
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:49,930
racing ruben is racing ruben is race wait okay ruben is racing is the name of a nascar podcast

1881
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:56,590
so it is a phrase it's something that's said in days of thunder so that's something I don't

1882
01:37:56,590 --> 01:38:01,530
know what it means though and I think the phrase is weird there's a quote of someone saying it to

1883
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:10,290
his son ruben's son is racing oh you get it now well now we all know ruben is racing now we know

1884
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:17,570
ruben is racing um is it like if you're real close you're rubbing like bumper bumper to bumper oh it's

1885
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:22,170
yes you're like rubbing up against you're like aggressive yeah you want to be you want to be

1886
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:26,530
rubbing you want to rub and rub and bumpers how many videos did you edit of two cars rubbing

1887
01:38:26,530 --> 01:38:33,730
then crashing well it wasn't nascar footage it was some sort of drag race from teams yeah yeah no

1888
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:39,390
you can't clear no mlb and no nascar drag racer chokes on ribs flips car

1889
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:54,750
oh it was just footage of his widow outside of a hospital all right i'll put it i guess i'll put

1890
01:38:54,750 --> 01:39:07,210
it in the final cut folder beat leno last night man's real dev both choking and car crashing

1891
01:39:07,210 --> 01:39:13,940
pj leno um the one that i could really could not process in my head is this this menu item

1892
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:22,380
nobody calls me chicken ranch salad nobody calls me chicken ranch salad and then behind that is

1893
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:28,680
something you can order it with which is boogity shrimp nobody calls me chicken ranch salad boogity

1894
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:34,400
shrimp well nobody calls me that's back to the future i mean i don't know right just general

1895
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:39,220
aggression like nobody calls me sure but it's the most famous is the back to the future right that's

1896
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:43,680
the most famous use of that i know chicken is a general term that was used like a green salad

1897
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:48,320
chicken breast on top or like chicken tossed with mayonnaise i don't know how was it tossed

1898
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:53,500
i don't i don't see the tossing the ranch is in the name but i don't know and you probably ask

1899
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:58,420
for it to be tossed however you want but then under that is a there's a separate item boogity

1900
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:04,760
boogity boogity shrimp okay apparently that's something that somebody says also that is some

1901
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:10,960
sort of nascar that's like a nascar commentators racing catchphrase yeah there it is yeah country

1902
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:16,680
music it sounds honestly it sounds weird or bad but that's you know i don't know i don't know all

1903
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:22,160
i all i know is i just i if i need to have that information coming in and i'm staring at the phrase

1904
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:28,300
nobody calls me chicken ranch salad boogity shrimp yeah i just i don't know it it gives me a headache

1905
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:34,780
it feels like is out my brain would you would you be more comfortable having like the um the things

1906
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:39,180
oatmeal at marvelmania i mean you don't even you're not you don't have so much affection for that

1907
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:47,100
property either don't but would it be like cyclops chowder would that be better or worse than these

1908
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:51,900
phrases i don't know i'm afraid is cyclops bad no he's a good he's the one of the leaders of the x-men

1909
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:57,480
okay just like would you eat cyclops's chowder he also takes you to your seat and

1910
01:40:57,940 --> 01:41:02,980
and he makes okay well if i can look him in the presumably one eye does he have one eye well he

1911
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:08,000
has two eyes but he has a visor a ruby quartz visor that protects his eyes because his eyes are out

1912
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,560
control when he opens them they shoot lasers okay so you'll see you'll look into his visor he's got

1913
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:21,820
a visor like jordy laforge similar uh-huh who's friends with data well he's you're close you're

1914
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:26,160
close that's all i'll say we're gonna see the comment i have unsubscribed from the podcast due

1915
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:32,420
to the way scott says data that was the last straw for me uh uh yeah you were close you were close

1916
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:39,080
uh anyway that's yeah yeah i don't know i'll eat this i'll i'd love to eat the cyclops's chowder

1917
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:43,660
as long as he doesn't as long as he doesn't burp it up from his mouth scott's scott's lying on his

1918
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:50,460
chowder um i we're getting towards the end or if i missed any like quick hit fallen brothers let's

1919
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:56,300
look around us what do we see um what do you see take it in take it in you might have noticed

1920
01:41:56,300 --> 01:42:04,860
a doomsday clock there we're two minutes to doomsday that's uh when inevitably toothum shoots up from

1921
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:13,460
the ground oh god i hope yeah well i'm really hoping there's a ticking clock at this point

1922
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:17,360
yeah yeah i know too some not we haven't gotten there yet but i don't feel great about the

1923
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:22,860
franchise you're gonna be chased around by the boston dynamics robot dog when that happens

1924
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:27,440
uh i think the florida location has since given that away

1925
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:35,560
or sold it to another institution of some type there's a different steampunk restaurant that is

1926
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:43,840
a robot now yeah they adopted it for it either went to another themed restaurant or like the

1927
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:53,980
indianapolis pd uses it to terrorize suspects yeah it's a killer we're i well we're almost there

1928
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:59,980
i i mean if you i have one little quick one go for it um my my favorite thing on any fallen

1929
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:06,460
brothers list that i saw and now i'm like worried i didn't keep the the photo i wonder if i can find

1930
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:14,020
it really quick but there's like a lot of odd ones um like nobody documented basically like

1931
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:20,020
the any of the little places but my absolute favorite one that i found is something called

1932
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:27,760
captain crackers and the official description on the website is this is on universal's website the

1933
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:35,540
world's funnest in quotes toy store and then now i can't find like my picture of it i actually do

1934
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:42,260
like captain captain crackers was a character he was like a big like bird or a bear or something

1935
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:47,800
uh-huh poked out from the sign i'll try to figure this out i'll try to find captain crackers is it

1936
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:53,820
this that is him you found him there he is is he like a koala what is he he looks like a dog with

1937
01:43:53,820 --> 01:44:00,560
a hat oh wow that's not what i picture a doctor looking like that's crazy he has like a beanie hat

1938
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:04,880
he's got his tongue and he's got colorful whiskers he's got blue yellow and red whiskers

1939
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:10,660
wow that's crazy i actually didn't see that that was part of the skyline at one point wow i like

1940
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:16,620
him that's whacked i love that i love him and it looks like really like expanded like it looks

1941
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:21,240
he looks good yeah really well molded i don't know what's going on inside of the store but it's a

1942
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:25,780
great sign i want to know more about captain crackers want to know why he's crackers despite

1943
01:44:25,780 --> 01:44:30,940
being a dog i want to know how he became a captain i want to know the full mythology of

1944
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:38,100
captain crackers that's all yeah oh he rules yeah yeah i really like him um so i don't know that

1945
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:44,900
that's it for me i feel like we're um uh i think we're winding it down here um i want to make a

1946
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:51,020
quick note about one of these old just to uh sum up what you had said before about we were talking

1947
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:57,480
batman and schumacher this looks like the riddler's like machine that you put on people's

1948
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:02,080
brains like from this old city walk concept art do you know what that is i'm looking at it's like

1949
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:05,640
like the kiosk i think it's the kiosk where you get information and it's still there

1950
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:10,580
but it's like it really makes sense looking at the skyline now to underline that point that this

1951
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:17,240
looks like schumacher yeah world yeah um i i think that's really at the core of it that might be why

1952
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:21,980
we like these stupid places captain crackers is straight out of gotham yes he could have been
