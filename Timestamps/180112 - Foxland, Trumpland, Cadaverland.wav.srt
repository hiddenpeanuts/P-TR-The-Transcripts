00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Warning, today's podcast may include surprise appearances by the Capitol critters and fish

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,400
police, fanciful fun-alysis of ad hoc cadaver surgery in hotel ballrooms, and a roundup of

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
theme park news, including the Donald Trump robot and Disney's purchase of Fox.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,340
Stay seated and refrain from protests.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:43,200
This is Podcast the Ride.

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
Hello everyone, welcome to Podcast the Ride, the podcast about theme parks hosted by three

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,000
men who have had fewer sexual partners than there are Disney theme parks.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,560
Correct me if the numbers are wrong.

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,560
No, they're not.

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Jack's with me.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm not adding a lot to that pile, but there's also a lot of Disney theme parks, and are

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,480
you counting water parks?

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,480
We can discuss all of it.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
We'll cross-check numbers later.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,160
Anyway, hey, I'm joined by Jason Sheridan.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Hello.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
And Mike.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,160
I said hi to Jason's name.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,080
Sorry, I was really counting numbers in my head.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,680
They're very low, so I was really thrown off.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,120
Can you guess at home?

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
Let us know.

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,920
Hey, well, this is that we've released new episodes in 2018.

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,560
This is the first one that we're recording in 2018.

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,200
And also, we've tended to do a lot of episodes that are recorded well before they come out.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,460
And this is the first one where we're putting it out the week of, and we felt this was very

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,840
necessary because theme park news has been just bonkers lately.

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,480
There's so much to catch up on.

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,560
And the beginnings of January have just been absolutely bat shit, and we wanted to tell

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,760
you all about it.

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,960
And not necessarily good news.

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,400
Yeah, in fact, a lot of it not.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
But it's definitely happened.

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Yeah.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,880
Hey, I mean, among other things, this is only tangentially theme park news, but our podcast

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
network fell apart.

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,440
There's one thing that happened on Christmas Day.

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,680
Yeah, that was great to deal with over the holidays.

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,760
A lot of fun.

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,080
We had a blast, you know, because going indie is, you know, there's just a real thrill to

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,840
getting back into the into the grime and the muck and, you know, being freed up, I think

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,960
has been a real pleasure for all of us and a fun thing to deal with.

43
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,040
I think we're a bunch of podcast cowboys now.

44
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,280
And that's the way I'm looking at it.

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,400
You know, just going from town to town.

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
We'll record anywhere.

47
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,040
We're doing this in my living room.

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,680
There's a dog floating around.

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,800
You may hear him on the track.

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
I don't know.

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,520
I want to wander in here and bark at me.

52
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,160
Yes, we got your letters.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,760
And finally, we now have what you've all been clamoring for.

54
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,040
More talk about the logistics of recording a podcast, baby.

55
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Yeah.

56
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:01,080
So we're talking more referencing trucks that go by sirens outside, humming and construction

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,200
work at nearby apartment complexes.

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,280
We're bringing you all of that new for 2018.

59
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,480
Finally, we get to do all the technical stuff that we spent months trying to get with a

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,320
network to avoid having to do.

61
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
Yeah.

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,400
So I guess we're saying, look, hey, if you have a network out there, hey, let us know.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,320
I mean, we're listening to any network.

64
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,880
If you have a theme park specific network, there could be one that we don't even know

65
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,560
about that wants to take us and put us under your delightful wing.

66
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Is your wing warm?

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Let us in.

68
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Is your wing warm?

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,280
Hey, but our RIP Ferrell Audio and thanks for the snacks.

70
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,240
Yeah, I sure did eat a lot of free snacks that I may not have supposed to have eaten.

71
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Too late.

72
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Never stopped before.

73
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Can't sue you now.

74
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
They don't exist.

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,280
Hey, but anyway, but yeah, that among other things, just a crazy couple of weeks.

76
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,480
I don't even need to tell you about most of these stories.

77
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,040
I'm sure you know about most of them.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,520
We're talking about the outbreak of Legionnaires disease at Disneyland.

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,480
Two coolant towers had to be shut down to prevent the Legionnaires outbreak.

80
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,800
I don't think they're not sure it came from Disneyland, but they're pretty sure.

81
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,440
So like people just are getting sick in Anaheim and then they traced it back and they're

82
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,440
like all these people with Legionnaires disease all went to Disneyland and they had to clean

83
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,200
out two towers.

84
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,720
And then, you know, Scott and I were there yesterday and so far I haven't contracted

85
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Legionnaires disease.

86
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,200
I don't know what the symptoms are, but if being in a great mood and feeling fine are

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,840
the symptoms, then I got them.

88
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,400
Jason, do you know what Legionnaires symptoms are?

89
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,920
I don't know the symptoms, no.

90
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,720
I think it's probably fever and shortness of breath.

91
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
It's the same symptoms as every other disease.

92
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,960
You get a fever and you feel like crap.

93
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Coughing.

94
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Yeah, cough.

95
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,880
Wasn't there, there was several years ago, this is very old news, but there was an outbreak

96
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,520
that started from a kid who had not been vaxxed.

97
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
That was measles?

98
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

99
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Yeah.

100
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Uh huh.

101
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,080
It was a small child, yeah, that had not been vaccinated and went in fantasy land.

102
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,120
And if your kid had not been vaccinated or you, you could go to Disneyland, touch the

103
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
wheel at the teacups and get measles.

104
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Boy, wonderful.

105
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,960
It's a very touchy park in general.

106
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Yeah, there is.

107
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,880
Everything that kids do is like have fun, jump around it, touch it.

108
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,520
Touch all the levers and buttons and do that.

109
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,280
It's right in the middle of a state where people have some sometimes kooky ideas on

110
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,760
child rearing.

111
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,160
Anyway, Jenny McCarthy, great job.

112
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,800
This year's Rockin' Eve.

113
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,520
Thanks for ringing it in.

114
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,080
Fine work as always.

115
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Blood on your hands.

116
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,540
I will not allow the innocent Disney company to take the blame.

117
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
It's all Jenny.

118
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
What else happened?

119
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,720
There was also a blackout at Disneyland that took out most of, took out all of Toontown,

120
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,200
a lot of fantasy land, left people stranded on it's a small world for a number of hours.

121
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,400
Also notable, it happened on the day both teams playing in the Rose Bowl were there.

122
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Oh, didn't know that.

123
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Yeah.

124
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,600
And in addition to like, wasn't it the 26th?

125
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,160
It was Christmas week, it was a big crowd day already.

126
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,480
And then there was another thing going on and then the blackout happened.

127
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,440
People had to walk off, right?

128
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,440
Yeah, I think there was some walk-offs, some rides, sure.

129
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,600
Have we talked on the show yet about walk-offs and what a sort of a treasured thing it is?

130
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,640
What a valued, yeah, if you get stuck in an attraction and then possibly the hope of seeing

131
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,960
some backdoor weird alleyway part of the attraction that people don't otherwise get to see, that's

132
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
pretty exciting.

133
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,360
Like that, like if it was a walk-off and you were on pirates, the dream would be like you'd

134
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,600
have to get off the boat in the town.

135
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Yeah.

136
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Like that would be a dream to get to go up close and see the horrible pirates.

137
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,840
Yeah, to like pass right by one, get to plant a kiss on one of them or something.

138
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Yeah.

139
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
I'm sure that's not allowed, but.

140
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,640
But you, but all bets are off when things close.

141
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,600
Yeah, anything where you'd have to like, you know, straddle water or like, you know, do

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
some death-defying jump.

143
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Absolutely.

144
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Yeah, that'd be.

145
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,960
So the blackout was bad, but it was good for those folks that probably got to walk through

146
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
a few of the attractions.

147
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Ah, yes.

148
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,200
If it happened to you and you're listening, let us know.

149
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
Tell us your tale.

150
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
Share any photos.

151
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,200
Share any kisses you planted on robots.

152
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,920
Tell us all the sultry details.

153
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,400
That treat is like the opposite of what happened to me when I went to Another Park in like

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,880
mid-December and a woman kept holding up her giant dumb ass phone to try to take a picture

155
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,960
during the ride, Space Mountain, a pitch black ride, trying to get pictures and a pitch black

156
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
ride.

157
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
And I'm scared to death.

158
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,800
Like, I'm going to get a concussion when that giant Android phone flies out of her hand

159
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,960
and right up my head.

160
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,840
And then as we pulled back into the station, she went, wow, it sure was dark in there.

161
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
Like a cartoon character.

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,080
You would have been like Fabio and the bird, but a phone would have been a phone.

163
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
Oh man, that fucking bird.

164
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
It would have bloodied your nose.

165
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,440
It's been a lot, yeah, just lodged straight into your head, just a corner wedged in there.

166
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,120
And then we still do the podcast with you, but it makes very little sense.

167
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Yeah.

168
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
That said.

169
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,160
That was, I did not wait at all.

170
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,760
I walked right onto Space Mountain because I used the single riders line at the Space

171
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Mountain Disneyland.

172
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Another piece of news.

173
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Another news story.

174
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Oh boy.

175
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
News.

176
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
That I, are they still doing it?

177
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
Are they not?

178
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Was that a test?

179
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
I forgot to check.

180
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
We didn't even go on Space Mountain.

181
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,080
It was very ad hoc when I was there.

182
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,760
A lot of folding signs and like back, back, went through a back alleyway I hadn't seen

183
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
before.

184
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Oh yeah, there you go.

185
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,720
Splash Mountain 2 is like that where it was not intended.

186
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
They don't have a special single rider.

187
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,480
You just kind of go through the exit and then they just plop you next to somebody.

188
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,400
So yeah, another exciting thing that happened while we were gone.

189
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Changes.

190
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
They're shutting down.

191
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,560
We, Mike and I went yesterday to bid farewell to Paradise Pier at California Adventure,

192
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,760
which is set to become Pixar Pier, which I'm sure will change everything.

193
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,040
You'll hear all of the earth-shattering details here on the show.

194
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,320
Yeah, what actually happens there?

195
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,720
The California Screamin' turns into the Incredicoaster.

196
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,900
They put some stuff, it looks like they're going to put like some characters on it.

197
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,300
So like you'll go through a tube and Mrs. Incredible is stretching.

198
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,180
So like there'll be something, but it's the exact same ride.

199
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,380
There's going to be no change to what you're feeling.

200
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,240
But like there'll be a few nice, there'll be nice paint.

201
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,280
You know, there'll be new paint.

202
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,400
They're going to make the Cove Bar into something like Frozone's Bar.

203
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,440
We came up with a good, yesterday we came up with a good re-theming for the Cove Bar,

204
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,840
which is over on Paradise Pier.

205
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,360
Theme it to the up, no up, Jesus.

206
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,920
Theme it to Wally's Captain.

207
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,080
Oh, so it's a glutton place?

208
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,560
Yeah, so we assume he likes to drink.

209
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,680
So like the Captain from Wally's Bar.

210
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:13,800
Voiced by Jeff Garland, the fat Wally guy with the little bones with the most authority,

211
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,880
who I assume probably loves to eat and have a good time.

212
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Sure.

213
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,680
Yeah, yeah, so just big old food trays you just dip your head into.

214
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,640
We need to get the Wally stuff into the park finally, because people want to see a giant

215
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
trash pile that a robot collects.

216
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,640
But this is a better version of it, so that was our blue-skying yesterday.

217
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,200
Sorry, by the way, Jason wasn't there because his past is not good enough.

218
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,320
I don't have the Saturdays, okay?

219
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm not throwing money around left and right like these two, you know.

220
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:52,680
You can check out more frugal theme park texts on my upcoming podcast on our own network.

221
00:10:52,680 --> 00:11:00,120
Yeah, Theme Parks on a Budget, the frugal rider.

222
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
I like this.

223
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
I want this.

224
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,920
This is our Patreon side project.

225
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
It's an exclusive.

226
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm totally into the frugal rider.

227
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,120
Only go to the parks on a Tuesday morning.

228
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
I mean, it does rule.

229
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
That's what I did.

230
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,200
I got down there at like eight in the morning on a Tuesday in December.

231
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,960
You did do a Tuesday morning, right?

232
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,200
Yeah, Tuesday or Wednesday morning.

233
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,480
Did you hitchhike your way down there?

234
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,360
No, that would have been more pleasant than driving in that morning rush hour traffic.

235
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,600
But I wish.

236
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,240
I did ride like six rides by 10 in the morning.

237
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,240
That's the one time when people go like, when is it not crowded?

238
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,920
And it's like before 10 a.m. is pretty much your only guaranteed thing anymore.

239
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,800
I think this would be really an ultimate tip.

240
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,080
And one, I don't encourage anyone to try, especially not yourself.

241
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
But you could.

242
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,720
The real way to save money would be to get somebody to fly a helicopter over the park

243
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,520
and then try to sneakily skydive down into the park.

244
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,720
And you're skipping that admission altogether.

245
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Maybe see if you can land in the lake that might be a shallow lake, though.

246
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,280
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's true.

247
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Depending on how high you're coming down from.

248
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,640
I think top of Matterhorn I would go with.

249
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

250
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
Yeah.

251
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,360
And then you and then you're coming down and people think you're one of those mountain

252
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
climbers.

253
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
That's right.

254
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,920
People think, oh, the mountain climbers back, but he's got a American Apparel sweatshirt

255
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
on.

256
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,320
Surely this is what would happen and not like as soon as you're within a thousand feet,

257
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,720
you get shot down by Disney snipers.

258
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,240
Well, somebody I don't know.

259
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Give it a shot.

260
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
See if you can.

261
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Yeah, somebody tried airdrop into Disneyland.

262
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,520
Well, it's not just in Disney.

263
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,680
Changes afoot everywhere.

264
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,560
The Johnny Rockets at Universal City Walk is closing.

265
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,560
I would heartbreaking news that I'm sure you're already really.

266
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
No, it's not actually.

267
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
It's closing for a few weeks.

268
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Is it not?

269
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,440
It is a it's closing for a few weeks for a refurbish.

270
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,160
It is a refurbishment closing.

271
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
OK, OK, I see.

272
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,080
We saw different news stories on the theme park Twitter.

273
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
I think they updated.

274
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
What was the account?

275
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Was it Inside Universal?

276
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,000
Inside Universal for catching that there were walls around it and then correcting that it

277
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,280
was just being refurbished.

278
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,400
OK, thank God.

279
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,440
Because this is no folks, if you haven't been up there, if you're not Los Angeles natives,

280
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,360
this is no ordinary Johnny Rockets, why it's one point five times the size.

281
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
It's a sprawling campus.

282
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,880
It used to be a daily grill.

283
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
All right.

284
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,720
Here's the way that they reported.

285
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,680
So Inside Universal, which is a Twitter account that follows the universal news exclusively

286
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,200
that the three of us all follow and know people personally that we know people recently.

287
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,280
So I guess we're kind of I'm sure they were jumping on the back of their scoop.

288
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Yeah.

289
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,880
So they tweeted Johnny Rockets at Universal City Walk.

290
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,400
Hollywood has closed.

291
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,160
And that was and they put a put a article up about it.

292
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,680
And then an hour later, Inside Universal has learned that the closure of Johnny Rockets

293
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,180
is for refurbishment.

294
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,280
The restaurant should open in a month.

295
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
OK.

296
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Oh, thank God.

297
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,900
They retracted their story.

298
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,480
What a start that gave me.

299
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,200
They have been closing a lot at the city walk in Hollywood and replacing it with either

300
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:22,200
like fast casual stuff like, you know, your smash burger, your ludo chicken or like slightly

301
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
nicer stuff.

302
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,760
I think at some point he's coming.

303
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,320
But they still have a sock store.

304
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,400
They still have a story and a stock market.

305
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Socks.

306
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Yeah.

307
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,360
And a store where you can buy the same garbage that you could buy in Hollywood Boulevard

308
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,720
like there's Hollywood that say best teacher.

309
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Yeah.

310
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
Yeah.

311
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:49,080
So I think myself and upcoming guest John Daly had a had a pitch at the similar also

312
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,560
defunct company CISO, RIP, Feral and CISO.

313
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,320
And we went to City Walk before Angus.

314
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,000
They were near they were nearby each other.

315
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,360
And we went to that store and bought shirts that say I heart Hollywood.

316
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Oh, yeah.

317
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,800
Properly decorated for our pitch.

318
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,040
They were the shirts were met with a lot of forced grins.

319
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,020
And our show was not picked up.

320
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,760
But if it had been, we still wouldn't be making it because CISO is dead.

321
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
So hey, thanks.

322
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Store.

323
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Yeah.

324
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Upstart Crow is the name of I was just going through my receipts for tax purposes.

325
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,320
That shirt was a business write off for a meeting.

326
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,960
So I now know it was the Upstart Crow.

327
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,400
Thank you for helping the pitch.

328
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Yeah, you're helping keep them in business basically.

329
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Mm hmm.

330
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Yeah.

331
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,880
I'm legitimizing it and I encourage everyone to go there.

332
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
So yeah.

333
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,400
Oh, you know what else you can get there are like what you can buy license drivers licenses

334
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:58,920
for like movie stars or Elvis Presley or Marilyn Monroe, Dr. Evil.

335
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,120
And there's a bizarre like some of them like there's a space for occupation.

336
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,440
And in the case of Dr. Evil, it's like mad genius, but in the case of Beyonce, it's like

337
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,100
single ladies.

338
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,920
Like it's there's no consistency to what the occupations are.

339
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,340
So I will try the Upstart Crow for that.

340
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,000
My memory is that half of it is also just Betty Boop merchandise.

341
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Is that wrong?

342
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, that's a lot of Betty Boop merchandise.

343
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,960
I mean, a lot of those generic Hollywood souvenir stores are Betty Boop and James Dean and Marilyn.

344
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:38,080
Maybe the easiest license to get possibly that might just be floating out there.

345
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,080
Well, but so there are lots lots of stories.

346
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:49,600
But there's another tiny one that we should probably fit a little bit of time of the podcast

347
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,840
to talk about, which is the arrival of Donald J. Trump into the Hall of Presidents.

348
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Are we doing that one first?

349
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

350
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Are we doing the?

351
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:05,880
Why I just don't want the well, we can we can hit the cadavers as well.

352
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,080
Which order?

353
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
I think let's do cadavers.

354
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Let's talk cadavers.

355
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
OK, OK.

356
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,080
Trump teaser, but cadavers.

357
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,200
I want to take the lead on this.

358
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
OK, OK.

359
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,600
So this is one that I feel like a lot of theme park news sites did not pick up on.

360
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
But Scott.

361
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,400
Oh, yes, I was aware of this because of Matt Wyatt, a friend of the podcast.

362
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Thank you, Matt.

363
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,080
I sent sent this to Scott.

364
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:36,280
And this is part of a Reuter series called The Body Trade Cashing in on the Dead.

365
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,640
And I have some of it in front of me.

366
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,560
The summary of this this series, this is part six cadavers in the ballroom.

367
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,320
Doctors practice their craft in America's favorite hotels.

368
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,240
Big names in hospitality have a little known sideline.

369
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,840
They rent space to physicians who drain on cadavers and body parts.

370
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,880
There is scant regulation and some public health specialists warm up of biosafety risks.

371
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,560
So this is the opening of the article.

372
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,400
And I think you'll quickly see why we're talking about it.

373
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,560
Just outside the operating theater, the organizers of a medical conference wore Minnie Mouse

374
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
ears.

375
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,840
Inside, as doctors practiced on three cadavers, blood from one of the human specimens seeped

376
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,680
through a layer of wrapping.

377
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,980
I guess we should have had a wording before that.

378
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,840
They leak a lab technician set of the bodies.

379
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
This session.

380
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,360
So mouse ears, blood leaking already.

381
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Yeah.

382
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,440
The sessions held last month attended by a Reuters reporter weren't at a hospital or

383
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
medical school.

384
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,320
They were part of a so-called cadaver lab.

385
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,120
It was one of scores of such events over the past six years that have been held at a hotel

386
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,400
or its convention center.

387
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,120
And now here it comes.

388
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,440
In this case, doctors practice nerve root blocks and other procedures on cadavers in

389
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,320
one of the Grand Harbor Ballroom salons at Disney's Yacht and Beach Club Resort Convention

390
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,360
Center.

391
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
That's right.

392
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
There's the twist.

393
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,280
A cadaver lab at the beautiful Yacht and Beach Club Resort.

394
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Yes.

395
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,880
Which if you haven't been down to Disney World is kind of the, what do you, it's sort of

396
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,960
the New England themed, very, very picture, picturesque.

397
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
One of my favorite hotels that I stayed at when I was a kid.

398
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,720
Very upscale and.

399
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Yeah.

400
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Yeah.

401
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
A deluxe resort.

402
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,120
In fact, it is classified as and the ballrooms were also just conventions and weddings are

403
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,880
held are also being used to take actual dead bodies and do tests and practice operations

404
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
on them.

405
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,840
Online Disney refers to ballroom, their ballrooms at this particular place as regal and resplendent.

406
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,040
And offered no comment on this cadaver lab story.

407
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,240
And so what's crazy to me is this resort just got like a top to bottom refurbishment and

408
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,040
this is already, and it was already like one of the most expensive properties in Orlando.

409
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,720
And knowing that just feet away from your room or just like bone pieces going flying.

410
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Yeah.

411
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,800
That was part of this article is that whatever, whatever tests and operations are being done,

412
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,960
they do like put down plastic and sanitize the room to some extent.

413
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
But also.

414
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Yeah.

415
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,320
But also just, you know, surgeries are pretty wild and little bone pieces can go flying

416
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,520
up and hit the ceiling.

417
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,800
And one of the concerns in the article was for people who think that this is, you know,

418
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:40,280
it's basically like not these events are not really under the purview of health code regulations.

419
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,480
Health code.

420
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,720
Also like any convention, people forget to shut doors.

421
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,720
So I think the reporter was like, I was standing outside in the hallway, which was a public

422
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,840
access hallway and I could see a corpse.

423
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,960
Like this is crazy.

424
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Disney doesn't need this money from cadaver labs.

425
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,160
Like there's so many hotels in Orlando and there's so much convention space.

426
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,560
And also this is a very weird part of like these bodies come from like after they, you

427
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,640
know, Oregon donors or if you donate your body to science and after they're done with

428
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,480
it, they're like, well, does someone else want to turn with this body?

429
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,800
Like you end up going to Disney World for the phrase body brokers was used in this article.

430
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Yeah.

431
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,760
So you go to a body broker and you get a body for whatever you want.

432
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Oh my God.

433
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,360
There's a horrifying thing.

434
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,520
I think in the same article that said the writer's reporter witnessed one participant

435
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,400
who was operating on this dead body because this is what it's for.

436
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,720
They're trying to learn how to operate on or test out new like medical devices that

437
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,520
are for sale or one of the people that was operating like, you know, just had a hand,

438
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,520
a hands full of blood and he was trying to wash and there's no sink in a lot of these

439
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,680
places you have to go to the bathroom and he had to go arms outstretched out into the

440
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,400
hallway like covered in whatever.

441
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,200
I mean, I don't know his blood still, it depending on how old the cadaver is.

442
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,440
I don't know what that would happen to blood after a while, but there's gotta be some

443
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
liquid.

444
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,960
There's gotta be still some liquid in these bodies and they have to be kept fresh.

445
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,140
So yeah, you could be walking through with your family and there's a young medical student

446
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,160
just dripping with like goo.

447
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,760
A kid who was like, you know, the snow white ride was too scary for me.

448
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,200
I don't want to go on that again.

449
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Oh, that's OK, honey.

450
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
You don't have to quit.

451
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Get me to a bathroom.

452
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I need to I need to be sanitized.

453
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,800
Blood dripping off guys as he walks by goofy and yacht captain attire.

454
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,280
Yeah, the other features of this hotel are a big pool area with a water slide that comes

455
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,000
out of a ship wreck called Storm Along Bay and a snack stand called Beaches and Cream.

456
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Hugely popular.

457
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,160
Both of these things hugely popular among Disney loyalists.

458
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Steps away.

459
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,560
Blood and bone exposed.

460
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,780
I imagine that it's like you're eating at Beaches and Cream and just think of the scene

461
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:04,080
in the Ghost and Ghostbusters two when they come from the sewer covered in goo and they

462
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,240
interrupt Bill Murray, who's eating there and they're getting goo over all these rich,

463
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,420
fancy people.

464
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,320
That's exactly what happens at Beaches and Cream when you're trying to eat one of the

465
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:17,800
kitchen sink floats, which is there like fifty dollar giant mess of ice cream.

466
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,080
You know what I'm talking about?

467
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,600
Yeah, you can only assume also with the New England theming that someone there speaks

468
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
in that tycoon.

469
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,180
Oh, well, my heavens, I never.

470
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,600
This for five hundred dollars a night.

471
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,880
Yeah, I really didn't say else of the fact that see the so just to give the body brokers

472
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,080
credit, the bodies in this operation are screened for HIV and hepatitis.

473
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,980
But there's certain things that you can't really pre-track like tuberculosis.

474
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,800
So there could be tuberculosis filled bones flying around this room.

475
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,520
And also, as the article points out, you know, like a little a little piece of bone ends

476
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,800
up in a carpet that they didn't put plastic down on.

477
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,720
And then in two days, there's a wedding there and there's a one year old crawling around

478
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,560
on the floor who's like, you know, nobody's nobody has eyes on and is like, you know,

479
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,320
he's like licking the carpet or something.

480
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,880
I'm describing a very grim scene.

481
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,000
This is why this article was written.

482
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,560
It's why people are concerned.

483
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,440
And yeah, and it's it's I don't know.

484
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,880
I mean, it's another just insane branch of health care in our country.

485
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,120
It's just another insane dark side story to how America deals with health stuff.

486
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,640
But like, it's crazy to me that like Disney, I mean, they must have known when they're

487
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,880
booking these events, like they would have to know someone's going to someone's going

488
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,360
to find out about this at some point.

489
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,420
But like, I really haven't seen much uproar about it.

490
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,440
So we might be helping break this.

491
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Oh, yeah.

492
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Yeah.

493
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
In our world.

494
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,560
But reading the Reuters website all the time.

495
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Yeah, yeah.

496
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,640
I'm not too constantly on Reuters just once in a while.

497
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:08,280
And yeah, the maybe though Disney, maybe the body brokers have a little situation, a little

498
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:14,980
backdoor situation with Disney and maybe there's maybe Disney has needs for before dead bodies.

499
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,360
Maybe like maybe you're like, you know, that's the correct amount of weight to test roller

500
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,760
coasters with or I don't know.

501
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,080
No other way to do that.

502
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
Yeah.

503
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Yeah.

504
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,880
How else could you wait sewing together?

505
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,360
And couldn't do the same job.

506
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
No, no, no.

507
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,680
Well, look, you'd have to like stack them up and make you have to make sand arms and

508
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
legs.

509
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Who knows if that's complicated.

510
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,400
Why not just go straight to the source?

511
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,400
And I think they need the bodies because they need to refresh the skeletons on the Pirates

512
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,080
of the Caribbean every once in a while.

513
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
So what other way are they going to get those?

514
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,880
There's no way to make a fake skeleton.

515
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,360
It's expensive and expensive.

516
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,800
Yeah, you can.

517
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,600
But it's like five hundred thousand dollars for a fake skeleton.

518
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,120
Michael, that sounds like mere Tom Fulary to me.

519
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
No.

520
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,240
I'm being very highly serious.

521
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,000
Well, this I think there is there is one recent audio animatronic that very well that very

522
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,240
likely may be a reanimated corpse, which is the new animatronic of Donald J. Trump in

523
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,560
the Hall of Presidents.

524
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,560
Yeah, here we go.

525
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Here we go.

526
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Disney World.

527
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,760
Now that we got the cadavers out of the way, we can we can we can get on to this.

528
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Cut to the chase.

529
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,980
I mean, look, this is a this is a story that's been out there a bunch already.

530
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,040
If you're listening to this podcast, I can only assume that you've seen photos, perhaps

531
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,160
a number of photos of the of the glorious Trump bot.

532
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:41,160
But anyway, it was they they snuck it in very just under the white, maybe thinking that

533
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,840
you slide it into the holiday season and people don't really pay attention.

534
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,040
People's trips are pre booked and families are there and they don't attract a lot of

535
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
trouble.

536
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,040
I was I was just always I was wondering if this was ever going to open.

537
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,240
I can't believe it did in 2017.

538
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,960
And suddenly one day it happened and we dropped everything and we had a little emergency session

539
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,560
of what to tweet about it.

540
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,000
Our own tweet store.

541
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,680
It was our little The Post style.

542
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
All right.

543
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
What do we do?

544
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,880
Roll your sleeves up, gentlemen.

545
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
But it's there.

546
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,160
Trump's Trump's there and he's making his speeches and waving his hands around every day.

547
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,060
Ugliest Donald John Trump, as he says, Donald John Trump.

548
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,400
By the way, and I think people mentioned something like this, but I don't know.

549
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,820
I haven't seen anyone say his name is Don John, the same as Joseph Gordon Levitt's character

550
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,280
in the movie Don John, where he's like, I like to eat things by women.

551
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,920
Whatever my cars, my phone.

552
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,600
I like lifted weights and I like porno.

553
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
And that's Don John.

554
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
But that's the same name.

555
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
I don't know.

556
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,520
He's Donald Trump is Don John.

557
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
I know.

558
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Yeah.

559
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
You never hear the John.

560
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,920
Yeah, it's only it's only Jay.

561
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,720
And he says it on the ride or on the on during the show.

562
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Yeah.

563
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Donald John Trump.

564
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,680
So, I mean, a lot of people have seen the the the character and it's, you know, we don't

565
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,520
we only have audio here to do.

566
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,360
It's hard to describe, but he's it's it's it's grotesque, certainly.

567
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Coolish.

568
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
In credit.

569
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
It were me.

570
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
I'd be incredibly insulted.

571
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,880
I mean, it looks it technically it's a good life.

572
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,760
Another generation of lifelike animatronics, but it really, really makes him look like

573
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
shit.

574
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Yeah.

575
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,880
The only speech he gives is probably the most coherent speech Donald Trump has ever given,

576
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,640
probably because it wasn't written by one of the fucking white supremacist speechwriters

577
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
he has on stand.

578
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,200
It wasn't written off the top of his dome.

579
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
It wasn't just coming off his dome.

580
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Yeah.

581
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,200
Imagine yours wrote like a pretty safe spiel about America.

582
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,960
Oh, Jason, let me correct you.

583
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,000
Steve Bannon didn't really have anything to do with the presidency.

584
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
That's that's come.

585
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Oh, is that what we're going with?

586
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
No, no, no.

587
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,840
He was a he was a coffee boy.

588
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,200
Basically, he was an overblown.

589
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
He was he was there.

590
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
He was in the room.

591
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
I think he was just fetching people snacks.

592
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,400
So just to correct your oh, you're right.

593
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
I think I forgot.

594
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
So he is sloppy.

595
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Yeah, obviously.

596
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,320
I think he was probably going to get people coffees and that's why he's now he's sloppy.

597
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
Steve.

598
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Yeah, God.

599
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Yeah.

600
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
The speech.

601
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,680
It's I mean, I don't not to just read it.

602
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
I'm trying to remember.

603
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,200
I mean, the part the part that I noted and have written down is specifically the line

604
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,400
being American is to be an optimist.

605
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,120
Yes, that's what I was going to say, too.

606
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,960
Yeah, because I don't think he's ever he's he is not an optimistic man.

607
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
No, no.

608
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,520
At the I put that side by side to another prewritten speech of a rare prewritten speech

609
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,240
of his, which is from his inauguration address, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones

610
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,600
across the landscape of our nation.

611
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,520
Though I guess that's him describing the past and the optimist saying no more.

612
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,320
And I after the last year, yeah, no more of those factories.

613
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,360
He scrubbed them all up.

614
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Rust be gone.

615
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,120
That was apparently a thing revealed in that.

616
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,440
What is that book that everyone's going nuts on?

617
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,680
The fury of fire and fury just released.

618
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
Yeah.

619
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,400
That inauguration address was supposed to be like a rousing victory cry.

620
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,880
But because like Trump is such a grumpy gust and he looked so unhappy, it like he came

621
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:23,440
out as like just a just a horrifying like, oh, well, and it was the weather was the weather

622
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
was the people.

623
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
No one was there.

624
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
That too.

625
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,880
No one was watching.

626
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,040
But people seemed like they were lining up for this.

627
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,440
All the presidents and why not?

628
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,640
Why not watch?

629
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Watch the train wreck.

630
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
Why not check it out?

631
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Oh, yeah.

632
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
I mean, well, the day that it broke on Twitter was very excited.

633
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,440
We did all just have to drop everything.

634
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,480
We were texting each other and refreshing Twitter every two minutes.

635
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,680
And like because imagine being in the park when that happens.

636
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Oh, yeah.

637
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Oh, my God.

638
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
It's happening with no announcement.

639
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
We can be the first in this audience.

640
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,360
Yeah, for sure.

641
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,520
Friend of the podcast, Bugsy Malone, Bugsy the gangster, as he is canonically known on

642
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
our podcast.

643
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
I'd call him a friend.

644
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,400
The way he threatened us.

645
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
So easy on Bugs.

646
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,480
I loved his skeleton dance, his graveyard dance.

647
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,160
But he's a skeleton now.

648
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,360
So Bugsy Bones was there, presumably for a cadaver operation.

649
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,520
Checking on some of his buddies from Sing Sing.

650
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I know him.

651
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,200
I was in Sing Sing with him.

652
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
He was there.

653
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,960
He happened to be there on a pre-books trip like a week out and like a lot of a lot of

654
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,720
Manga hats, he said, a lot of folks very excited to go represent and check out their guy.

655
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,240
And he alerted me to two things.

656
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,640
I mean, you can everybody can watch video of the attraction if you haven't already.

657
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,800
It's this odd, stiff speech that is pretty nothing other than the fact that it's not

658
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,240
in line with how he talks otherwise.

659
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,600
But this I would not know without Bugsy that when he when they in the roll call, when they

660
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,240
get to Abraham Lincoln, he does this odd.

661
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,160
He like gestures to Lincoln, who's sitting pretty close to him with kind of this attitude

662
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,400
of like, huh, pretty good, huh?

663
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
There he is.

664
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,400
There he is.

665
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,600
Hey, I ain't heard a lot of these other folks.

666
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,280
I don't know about no John Tyler, but hey, Lincoln, pretty good.

667
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,760
Abraham Lincoln classic best class act winner.

668
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,920
But there's another thing that I haven't seen written up anywhere, which is almost odder

669
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,720
than the than the gesture to Lincoln.

670
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,720
And I'll just I'm going to turn the laptop and show you guys look up a video.

671
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,440
If you look up like close up Trump and watch his watch what Trump is doing for the entire

672
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,760
roll call, because if you don't know in the Hall of Presidents, they say the name of every

673
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,840
president, right robots of all of them.

674
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,760
And right around the middle, they get to I'm at a backtrack right around the middle.

675
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,080
They get to Teddy Roosevelt and just watch the video of this.

676
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,120
Look what he does during Teddy Roosevelt.

677
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:05,320
He kind of holds up his hand and starts counting or like he puts his fiddle with fingers.

678
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
I notice this too.

679
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
I have this I have this written down.

680
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,800
He has his middle finger and his thumb and he like rubs them kind of together.

681
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
And it's this real odd.

682
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,400
He only does it once.

683
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,360
The only robot does it once.

684
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,320
And I don't know if that's a thing Trump does.

685
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
I'm confused by it.

686
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,000
I don't.

687
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,920
It's not I'd be concerned if it were something.

688
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,920
It's I was concerned it was going to be the OK sign.

689
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:35,320
You know how the alt right has adopted to be like, you know, OK, simple.

690
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,520
But it's not some dog whistle something.

691
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
No, I don't.

692
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,640
I can't imagine them putting that in there.

693
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,720
Like that's horrifying.

694
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
But it's not.

695
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,240
It looks like more like he's rubbing like when you know, like hey, you owe me money.

696
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,080
Like when a mobster like rubs their fingers together, they're the money.

697
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,360
It feels like there are a few other in addition to this subtle digs at him.

698
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,040
Obviously, just the way he looks.

699
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,960
But also like we were looking at close up like video of of the other presidents who

700
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,320
all have an odd look on their face and do like kind of slightly roll their eyes once

701
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,880
in a while while he's talking.

702
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Yeah.

703
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Yeah.

704
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,600
And we went back and my girlfriend and Lindsey, we went back and we looked at like the Obama

705
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,880
one and they don't seem to be moving their eyes at all when Obama was speaking.

706
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,500
So there feels like there's some subtle stuff.

707
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,600
Also I noticed when watching that same video, Trump looks away when the other like so they'll

708
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,520
announce a president and everybody looks to all the robots look to the right.

709
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
Trump will look to the left.

710
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,200
Trump will look a different direction like and look like an idiot because they're all

711
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,400
looking at one president except for him who kind of looks or like kind of looks bored

712
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,960
or like looks over.

713
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,520
He's like kind of just staring into the distance.

714
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Yeah.

715
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
He's not really focused on anything.

716
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,480
And yeah, you can watch every single president goes hard right to hard left and only he's

717
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
just staring at.

718
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,400
I yeah, I think he's I think he's bored.

719
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,440
There's he's very he does a very odd like thumbs up gesture.

720
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
That is so funny.

721
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,960
If you haven't watched this whole video at the very end when the music soars, his little

722
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,120
like his little hands and this like tiny gesture where he's just like giving the thumbs up

723
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,020
like this barely has his thumbs up from his stomach.

724
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,560
Like there's probably like six inches from his thumbs to his stomach.

725
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
And it's so funny.

726
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:23,920
I mean, it's it's funny to think they captured his dumbass long tie and his stupid open jacket

727
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,940
that his jacket is just always open.

728
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:31,320
It's never buttoned like he never talks like this and he never dresses like this.

729
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,840
And I've never seen him in anything other than the like I'm sure he wears other ties,

730
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,640
but I only know like big bright red long, long.

731
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
Yeah, usually.

732
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,480
And they dressed him up a bit.

733
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
He's I don't know.

734
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,040
He's still one of the the dumber looking ones on the stage, despite people being in like

735
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,040
patterned wigs and frilly collars and 18 hundreds clothes.

736
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,720
Disney really, you know, with this attraction, like this is one of the ones that it's like,

737
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,240
you probably can't ever close it like they painted themselves into a corner by like,

738
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,840
yeah, we have to add the current president.

739
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,460
And then like in the 90s, it's like, and now the current president has to talk.

740
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,760
And like there's all these like artifacts in the lobby.

741
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,700
Like they couldn't demolish this building because they would have to protect all these

742
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:20,200
artifacts and then they'd have to destroy all these robots of like American heroes.

743
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:26,160
Although that said, if you look at them cumulatively, it is a real hodgepodge of like rapists, sociopaths,

744
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,680
outright racists, genocide committers, drone drone strike enthusiasts like all the presidents

745
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,520
is full of vassals, full of horrible assholes.

746
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,560
They don't maybe they wouldn't deny that, though, it's not as if they're say these

747
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,440
are the 45 greatest men that ever know that.

748
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,680
Yeah, that's true.

749
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
But it's certainly.

750
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
Yeah.

751
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,560
When you think about who's in there and what they've done, it's like, oh, there's Andrew

752
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Jackson, the butcher.

753
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Yeah, there he is.

754
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,080
And he's looking at Trump, but he's like rolling his eyes and you're like, hey, don't roll

755
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,600
your eyes, Andrew Jackson.

756
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,880
Who do you think of the 45 presidents and then let's just take like 45 random pirates

757
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,200
from Pirates of the Caribbean who have done worse things?

758
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
We don't know.

759
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,880
We'd have to make up the backstory of the pirates.

760
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
But right.

761
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,400
I mean, cumulatively, when you have the arm, the might of the United States military at

762
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
your hand.

763
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Yeah.

764
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,280
And all Jack Sparrow's got is a bottle of rum.

765
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,400
And that and they also a lot of the pirates seem nice.

766
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Yeah.

767
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,120
Yeah, that's they are Disney by the pirates are disney by the presidents.

768
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,240
You cannot know no matter how much you wash away, you can't wash away those sins.

769
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,320
I think it's possible somebody might buy one of those brides at that auction and just like

770
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
take them out to some nice.

771
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
Oh, yeah, they're very nice.

772
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,880
Those guys are too goofy looking to have to too bad intentions.

773
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,680
They couldn't dream of course.

774
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,520
Of course, those pirates are just nice guys.

775
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,880
They burned down the city.

776
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Sure.

777
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,800
When it comes down to it, they just want to goof around.

778
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,520
There are Caribbean town carnage rusted out, rusted out restaurants.

779
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,000
And if they did, if they get rid of all the presidents, which I think they if they want

780
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,200
to do it, they have to get rid of it like in the in an election year, probably like

781
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,280
at the end of a president's tenure.

782
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,400
So no one accuses them of being bipartisan or saying, well, you're getting anyone's running.

783
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,400
That's well.

784
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Yeah.

785
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Yeah.

786
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,600
I think that's a good thing, though, maybe unless there's like a crazier guy than Trump.

787
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:38,720
If they if by some bizarre stretch of the imagination, Trump is impeached and Pence

788
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,040
gets in there, I could see them going, all right, you know what?

789
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,340
If this is the way the president sees going to be, we're going to have to be changing

790
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,240
these out every year and a half.

791
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,600
Then maybe we don't do this anymore.

792
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,520
Also, if they have a replacement ready, they're like, you can't tear down the hall of presidents.

793
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,120
Well, see X-Men's mansion now.

794
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,280
OK, well, does it destroy it?

795
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,880
Left can agree on that.

796
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,680
We want to go to the danger room.

797
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,160
You just put masks on all the existing ones.

798
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,920
Millard, Bill, Maher, and yeah, damn it.

799
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,880
Yeah, got to get straight in there.

800
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,800
Oh, man, that would be great if it was just a show showing all the X-Men like all of the

801
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
X-Men.

802
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
We're getting ahead of ourselves.

803
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
We should do this in the last second.

804
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Yeah, yeah.

805
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
We'll save the hall of X-Men.

806
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,640
The last thing about the Trump thing, a hearty jeers to that one idiot who protested it,

807
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,720
to that one idiot who already in the lamest way possible stood up when Trump started talking

808
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,160
and started yelling, lock him up.

809
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,460
And it's like you see the picture of this guy and he's like the biggest dipshit looking

810
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,460
white dude.

811
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,360
Boho, bohemian looking white dude.

812
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,160
And then when reporters asked him, like, what do you say to the criticisms of like you kind

813
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,760
of ruined a lot of people's fucking vacation or what like ruined people's days like these

814
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,320
people should check their privilege, said the man who paid money to go to Disney World

815
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,040
and yell, lock him up.

816
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,360
He even I found a bigger interview and it's even one step beyond, which is that he went

817
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,880
he was already going there with his family.

818
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
Yeah.

819
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,280
And he says, you know, because, hey, I couldn't afford it.

820
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
My son, are you kidding?

821
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
I could.

822
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,720
So he's being taken there by his family.

823
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Family.

824
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,600
And he says he's on a parent paid Disney World vacation yelling about, check your privilege.

825
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Exactly.

826
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,000
And like there's there's there were probably people in that room who like saved up for

827
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,160
years or maybe this is the one time they got to go.

828
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,800
Maybe there was like a family reunion.

829
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,320
And it's like, come on, dude, you're not changing.

830
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,400
And it's like, shut up.

831
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,440
Like fair go protest.

832
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,000
There's plenty of real things to go protest and go protest the president for real.

833
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,600
Where he go nonprofits.

834
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,080
But it's like, come on, man.

835
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,800
Like most people are taking a nap during this ride.

836
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,880
You probably just startled a lot of sleepy dads and like kids and stuff.

837
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,400
I feel like this whole time I've kind of been looking forward to maybe protests happening

838
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
in that thing.

839
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,760
And then it happened and I didn't like it.

840
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,840
It's like the way it went down version of it.

841
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,560
I don't know what you can do other than like hop on stage and try to steal the robot.

842
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,560
Like other than just trying to disrupt the show.

843
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,560
I've said it several times, but I know that there's big old turkey legs right next to

844
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
the Hall of Presidents.

845
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,000
I remember them specifically in the Liberty Square area and just nailing it real hard

846
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
in the face.

847
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,720
Yeah, I mean, that would be that would be fun.

848
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,800
Like that's true.

849
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,680
There are funny ways to do this.

850
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,920
I mean, you feel a lot of nice imagineers put a lot of time, but I think even they would

851
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,640
have to go, oh, that was really funny that you cleanly took the head off of the Trump

852
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,200
robot with a turkey leg.

853
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,720
They'd have to admire it.

854
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Yeah, they would have to go.

855
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Well, I get it.

856
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,560
Like, but aren't there rumors that there's security in these shows as well?

857
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
Oh, maybe they have been.

858
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,240
They have plainclothes security officers in the.

859
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,000
Well, there are spikes that we know there's like not like hard pointed spikes, but they

860
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,040
did add like a layer flourishes or little.

861
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,080
They almost look like Fleur de Lis, but they look like they're made out of fucking balls.

862
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,920
So yeah, I don't think those are really dissuading anybody.

863
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
They built a wall.

864
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,920
They had to fill the wall.

865
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,920
They built a wall.

866
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
All right.

867
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,440
I mean, there's a thousand things to say about this, but the other thing they seem to be

868
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:21,880
doing to try to quell the potential outbursts is that they don't really provide a point

869
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,560
for the booing to happen.

870
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,120
I mean, this protester found one.

871
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,480
He just started yelling, lock him up.

872
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,200
But as opposed to I've watched now just to make sure I watch a video of the previous

873
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,400
presidents who all actually gave speeches, Clinton, W. Bush and Obama.

874
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,520
And for sure, in all of the previous iterations, they say, ladies and gentlemen, the current

875
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,100
president of the United States blank.

876
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,960
And I watched one of George W. Bush from 2009 where he gets a rocket surplus.

877
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,440
People are like, George W. Bush.

878
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,320
Yeah, it's like it's huge for him.

879
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
But they don't.

880
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,720
So so they kind of downplay that by having nine.

881
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,720
Yeah, yeah.

882
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,600
Like I said, January, like when he was getting right before watching the video of like his

883
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,040
last appearance before they closed, right.

884
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,360
Sending him out, I'm not sure.

885
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,720
But so they sort of don't give you a boo point, which they've never done in a previous

886
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,640
iteration of the ride.

887
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,240
And they they kind of get around it by having Washington make a little speech, which he

888
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,960
also did for Obama.

889
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,600
And then Trump says his own name as part of saying his own oath of office.

890
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,640
It's like, and now we go to the present.

891
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,560
That's all that's all the narrator says.

892
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:35,340
It doesn't they don't announce the president, which they weirdly all they also did for Obama.

893
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:40,160
But then they also said Morgan Freeman, who hightailed the fuck out of this riot as soon

894
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:47,920
as Trump appeared, he says, ladies and gentlemen, Barack Hussein Obama and Hussein in it.

895
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,440
And I'm sure there were booze for no bomb.

896
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
There were.

897
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

898
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,840
That's why they've been worried about this thing is that they're ever since the president

899
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,160
started talking, and especially with Bush and Obama, people have been like actively

900
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,440
cheering or booing.

901
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,780
Yeah, but no one knows President Baby Man broke our brains so much.

902
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:12,960
No one knew how people would react to him because everything is chaos now.

903
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
Everything is insane.

904
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,760
So like looting our dear theme parks.

905
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
Yeah, looting our Dean.

906
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,480
But you know, this is this.

907
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,440
We're all going to forget he's in there soon enough.

908
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,200
I mean, like, you know what?

909
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
I'll say they did a good job.

910
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,160
The fact there's only been that one protest, I think that will just swayed other people

911
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,160
from doing it.

912
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,320
Yeah, nothing else made you out.

913
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,040
We didn't see anything else major.

914
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,880
The real quick to go quick.

915
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,000
I also think that the only one of the only presidents Trump looks at is Nixon when they

916
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
announced Nixon.

917
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,080
I think I think we can look at it again.

918
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,080
Look at it again.

919
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
He looks at Nixon.

920
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,720
The other thing also, they they make a big this has never been in a previous iteration,

921
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,080
but they they very specifically point out in the narration that it's really it's more

922
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,720
about the idea of a president.

923
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,360
They say this several times.

924
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360
Oh, goody.

925
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,860
Once again, we place our trust in the idea of a president.

926
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,960
This also after a lot of at the very beginning, they mentioned Walt Disney a lot, which I

927
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,080
think is a way to say shut up nerd, settle down.

928
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
Walt wanted this.

929
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,960
Yeah, that's in the lobby, too.

930
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,140
There's like a corner.

931
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:18,200
There's like here's James K. Polk's vest and here's Lincoln's hat.

932
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,480
And here's a corner about Walt Disney.

933
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,040
Our 47th president, my president.

934
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,040
Geez.

935
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Oh, yeah.

936
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:34,000
I think invoking him is this way like he would have wanted that he loved American history.

937
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,320
Even if it's not a guy you love, don't you?

938
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,320
He belongs here.

939
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
Right, guys.

940
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,800
He has to be here.

941
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,440
This was Nixon when it opened.

942
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,440
What do you want?

943
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,440
Yeah.

944
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,440
Yeah.

945
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,440
Yeah.

946
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,540
Here's we'll show you a video of Nixon dedicating the monorail with Walt.

947
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,540
They were buddies.

948
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,920
You're going to complain now.

949
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,520
Yeah, he was a he loved piece of shit.

950
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,520
Conservative politicians.

951
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,000
What are you going to do?

952
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
He was Walt Disney.

953
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,320
He'd be so happy about all this.

954
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Yeah.

955
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,000
Not like Iger turning his back on leaving the counts, the special.

956
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,600
Oh, the special business council.

957
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,600
Business council.

958
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,080
Does he want to run?

959
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,080
What would Walt?

960
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,080
No, that's all the councils are disbanded by this.

961
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,080
No more.

962
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,080
No more.

963
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,040
By the way, also, another real quick thing, although we can't let's talk for 45 more minutes.

964
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,080
There's a ton to say here.

965
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:27,440
But the I was I got curious if there was any real if there were any Google results for

966
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,400
Donald Trump Disneyland before 2015, like before he was literally in the park.

967
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Right.

968
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,120
Is there any association between Trump and Disney?

969
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,480
And I found two things.

970
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,840
One to speak of the heads of Disney, Michael Eisner in actually when Trump started campaigning,

971
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,520
Michael Eisner said Trump expresses what a lot of people have in their unconscious, nightmarish

972
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,520
thoughts.

973
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,480
I don't think that style of insulting people, everybody you can insult should be representing

974
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,480
our country.

975
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,160
Michael Eisner, hard against hard against Donald Trump, although he also made his company

976
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,640
made a giant deal with Sinclair broadcasting the right wing fake local news syndicate that

977
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,200
John Oliver's railed against.

978
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,160
So Eisner talks to talk.

979
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,640
Maybe doesn't walk the walk.

980
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,600
But the but the other I think I then I broaden the search to just Donald Trump theme park.

981
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,320
And here's here's a fact that I never heard.

982
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,760
There's something called Steeplechase Park, which is a part of Coney Island.

983
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,760
Oh, sure.

984
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,240
I'm one of three zones of Coney Island.

985
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:33,640
And in 1965, this area, this beloved seaside amusement park was bought and torn down by

986
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,640
Fred Trump.

987
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,640
There it is.

988
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,640
Wow.

989
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,640
Pretty crazy.

990
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,680
Old man, Fred Trump shutting down the guy arrested at a KKK rally.

991
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,680
Is that right?

992
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,680
In Brooklyn?

993
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,680
Was he?

994
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,600
Yeah, I feel like there's there's some weirdness in the family.

995
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
If we get if we.

996
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,920
Oh, there's some weirdness in the family.

997
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,840
I feel like there's a little bit.

998
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,840
And he hate I bet.

999
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,000
I mean, for sure, he hated fun.

1000
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,360
Yeah, he hated fun.

1001
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,480
He was like Art Carney from the Christmas special.

1002
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,640
He was a cartoonish old man who only liked business.

1003
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,120
He liked the day's business and he liked the Klu Klux Klan.

1004
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,760
He was another character.

1005
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,320
So many characters have been based on Donald Trump in cinematic history.

1006
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,040
Maybe Art Carney's character from the Disney.

1007
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,080
Gramps Gramps was probably based on old Fred Trump.

1008
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,480
Yeah, I think that's probably right.

1009
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,000
Oh, an old man who destroyed an amusement park.

1010
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,800
He's a literal Scooby Doo.

1011
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,800
Yeah, really.

1012
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,800
And the and the end he ended up then like the zoning for the area didn't let them put

1013
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,440
up housing developments, which is what he wanted to do.

1014
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,400
So they just he sold it back to the city for a frustrated state three years later, having

1015
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,040
torn down all the fun.

1016
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,040
Wow.

1017
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,040
Yeah.

1018
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,040
Crazy, right?

1019
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,160
So we hate the Trump's hate theme parks.

1020
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,200
Yeah.

1021
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,720
And look what they've done since we're here.

1022
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:55,720
Now we're all mad and talking about our little escapist theme park podcast has now become

1023
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,920
all politicized because of the because of the Trump family again.

1024
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,840
But why don't we segue into something lighter?

1025
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:07,640
Absolutely possible anti trust media media company marriages.

1026
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,640
Yeah.

1027
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,400
So our validation of all media.

1028
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,920
Our final story that we have to talk about is, yes, we is a horrible thing, probably

1029
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,360
for everyone involved.

1030
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,760
Media news, everything.

1031
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,440
The merger between Fox and Disney or I guess Disney's buying Fox.

1032
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
What do they want to call it?

1033
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
It's not really a merger.

1034
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,880
I guess buying their assets of 21st century Fox, which is like the creative wing of the

1035
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,880
Fox company.

1036
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,160
Fox News, Fox, the broadcasting channel is not going with them.

1037
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,160
Yeah, no.

1038
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,160
Some of the shows are.

1039
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,160
Some of the shows are.

1040
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:51,280
So the way television movies get made is insane to look at from two normal people.

1041
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,560
And it's kind of complicated to explain.

1042
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,200
But there are studios, there's channels, there's production companies, there's.

1043
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Yeah.

1044
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:04,880
And confusingly, Fox, the studio is not necessarily affiliated with Fox, the channel.

1045
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,880
Right.

1046
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,880
Very confusing.

1047
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,200
I've learned some of these things, by the way, because I have a project in the works

1048
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,520
that now I believe because of this deal is owned by Disney.

1049
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,120
So I'd like to say I'm all for it.

1050
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,360
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

1051
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,520
Thank you, Disney, my beloved new overlord.

1052
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,920
Well, if you get a free pass out of it, of course, it's good.

1053
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,920
Sure.

1054
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,920
No matter.

1055
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,440
You don't want to ask for that?

1056
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,440
Renegotiate now.

1057
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:36,320
If you don't give me what I want, maybe I'll speak ill of this whole thing on my podcast.

1058
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,480
You don't want that, do you?

1059
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,400
So Mike, so what are some of the things Disney would get out of this deal?

1060
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,640
Well, I mean, I know when everyone's really speculating.

1061
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:50,640
So I don't really know exactly what everything is perfectly, but they're going to get like

1062
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,640
Avatar, they're going to get Alien, the Alien franchise.

1063
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,080
They're going to get Simpsons.

1064
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,260
They're going to get Family Guy.

1065
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,920
They're going to get Die Hard.

1066
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,160
They're going to get like a ton of like back catalog of TV show and movies because it's

1067
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,460
very confusing because sometimes you look at the Wikipedia and it says like this was co-produced

1068
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,540
by two studios.

1069
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:12,380
So I'm not exactly sure everything, but I think most of the things I just mentioned,

1070
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,440
they're going to get like full control over.

1071
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,000
And of course, the big thing and probably the big reason they wanted to do this was

1072
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,720
all the Marvel characters from Fox get to finally come home to Disney.

1073
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,040
We're talking X-Men.

1074
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,920
We're talking Fantastic Four.

1075
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
And we're talking Deadpool.

1076
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,920
And we're talking Deadpool, folks.

1077
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,920
Talking motherfucking ass Deadpool.

1078
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,920
Yeah, he's irreverent.

1079
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:42,200
The merc with the mouth is finally back home at the House of Ideas.

1080
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,280
Everyone's favorite, like everyone's fifth favorite 90s character that is somehow like

1081
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,520
a giant star now is, yeah, he's coming home to Disney.

1082
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,840
Which and so the big question is, does this does the Disney ownership affect, I can't

1083
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,720
like, will it affect how these properties are released or do they have to be more family

1084
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,720
friendly or anything?

1085
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,720
I can't imagine they will.

1086
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,880
Well, Bob Iger was asked about Deadpool.

1087
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,440
Some reporter was like very concerned.

1088
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,560
Like, is Deadpool going to go away now?

1089
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,560
We're going to get more Deadpool.

1090
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,040
He's going to get to say bad, naughty words.

1091
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,960
And Bob Iger is like, yes, Deadpool will still have his wit and his irreverency.

1092
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Our rated still.

1093
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,200
I think there's still room for our rated.

1094
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,720
We don't allow a sides to camera here at the Disney Corporation.

1095
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,480
No more, no more comments.

1096
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,480
He's going to be in.

1097
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,480
Yeah.

1098
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,800
He can't say like, what is this Rosie O'Donnell over here?

1099
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,360
Like one of his famous quips where he he's like for some reason in 1997.

1100
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,360
Oh, Rosie.

1101
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,360
He can't do.

1102
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:45,640
He can't do a bunch of jumps and flips to third eye blind semi charmed life.

1103
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,640
Yeah.

1104
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,040
It's going to have to change a little bit, but it remains to be seen because because

1105
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,480
they have a whole Marvel apparatus that makes look and Jason and I are big Marvel boys as

1106
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,840
we've said on the show before.

1107
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,840
We were kids.

1108
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,840
Yeah, we were kids.

1109
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,240
Um, uh, and they make now they make three movies.

1110
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:09,720
This is made three Marvel movies a year and they vary from like, you know, oh, good to

1111
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,640
okay.

1112
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,440
And we'll see what happens.

1113
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,080
We don't know if Deadpool, it will throw things off because no one has said the, no one said

1114
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,000
fuck in Marvel yet.

1115
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,560
So when will Deadpool come in and say that and will it just upset everything?

1116
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,280
Well, and it'll be the new, uh, uh, now I can't go.

1117
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,360
What was the first talkie line?

1118
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:36,400
Um, it's not, I was going to say here's looking at you kid.

1119
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,960
That is no hard incorrect.

1120
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,960
Heard nothing.

1121
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,960
You ain't heard nothing yet.

1122
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,520
It'll be a you ain't heard nothing yet moment.

1123
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,240
The first time fuck is said in a Marvel Disney.

1124
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:50,040
Hey, fuck off Robert Downey Jr. and he'll say his real name and then people will, I

1125
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,040
don't know.

1126
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,040
I have a feeling it's going to be separate.

1127
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,520
I feel like it's going to be a thing and then maybe he like winks at the camera or maybe

1128
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,440
in like 10 years when there's another like mega Avengers crossover movie, Deadpool shows

1129
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,960
up for a couple of minutes.

1130
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,760
I think they're separate, but I think X-Men and Fantastic Four movies go back to one.

1131
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,760
I think they relaunch.

1132
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,200
I think they burn off this dark Phoenix one.

1133
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,440
Well, they got a lot of movie that what's weird about this is like when you buy a movie

1134
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,360
studio, they have a year or two worth of movies.

1135
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:23,040
So they have like three X-Men movies, they have Deadpool two already shot and made.

1136
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,360
Yeah, so that has to come out via Disney.

1137
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,360
New Mutants.

1138
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,440
This deal is also going to take like a year to fully, I think, process.

1139
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,120
I think Trump's already like, hey, great.

1140
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,120
This is this sounds good to me.

1141
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,160
Like he doesn't see a problem with only Disney owning everything.

1142
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,960
Is there any chance it gets shot down by your right?

1143
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,480
Probably under the Republican government.

1144
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,080
But yeah, for it shouldn't.

1145
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,080
There's no it should know.

1146
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:51,760
I mean, it's bad for like, yeah, the monopoly like media corporation monopolies.

1147
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,760
It's a bad thing.

1148
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:59,160
And is it happening because the the Murdoch children are fail sons and daughters?

1149
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,840
I would like to fucking idiots.

1150
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
That's what I assumed.

1151
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,720
It's like Murdoch is going to die one day and doesn't trust any of his children with

1152
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,720
this stuff.

1153
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:14,640
I'm just going to parrot what I heard a fellow podcaster, Jim Hill, say on his podcast is

1154
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,440
that they're concerned that like content is the is the thing that's going to move, you

1155
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,480
know, whatever streaming service you have.

1156
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,400
And they were looking ahead and they're like, we're going to lose to Disney.

1157
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,160
We may as well cut our losses now and make 60 billion dollars.

1158
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,800
And because that's how much like the deal.

1159
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,900
It's like a 60 billion dollar deal.

1160
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,640
They're going to keep their news network.

1161
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,400
They're going to still keep their organizations of evil.

1162
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Those are going to happen.

1163
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,920
Apparently does not go anywhere.

1164
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,920
And a lot doesn't.

1165
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,920
Yeah.

1166
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
Yeah.

1167
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,920
They're going to keep that there.

1168
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,880
And this is a weird thing, too, with modern family is a Fox owned show, but it airs on

1169
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,880
ABC.

1170
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,480
So then Disney gets control of modern family and gets all their residual money and all

1171
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,480
that shit.

1172
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,280
Disney gets control of Avatar, which they have had to license for the parks.

1173
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,760
And now they will save all this licensing money because they'll own it outright.

1174
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,800
And they will put out the Avatar films.

1175
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,720
If they are.

1176
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:12,880
I think this is like Trump and his fake news award show that he's like stalling on because

1177
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,280
he doesn't know how to actually do it.

1178
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:20,360
I'm worried that there is no Avatar to there will never be an Avatar to does the Disney

1179
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:24,240
thing, but the heat on him to actually put his money where his mouth like he hasn't shot

1180
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,800
a single inch of film or anything.

1181
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,000
And he's just like in a submarine going, I don't know what to do.

1182
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I don't know.

1183
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
God, oh, God, oh, God.

1184
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,440
I got to show up at his house shows up.

1185
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,440
I think he shows up.

1186
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,440
Oh, hey, man, was that today?

1187
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,680
I think I girl show up underwater in a sub is another submarine.

1188
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,720
Oh, another open hail him.

1189
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,640
He didn't make it like they were hitting Mickey or.

1190
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1191
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,640
Oh, no, that shape.

1192
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,640
It's no.

1193
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,080
It looks like the Nemo sub from Disneyland.

1194
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,080
That's Bob Iger sub.

1195
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,080
Oh, yeah.

1196
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,080
He's like, surrender the film.

1197
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,080
Surrender the outline.

1198
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,080
The unobtaining.

1199
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,400
What are the kids doing?

1200
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,520
Why are there kids in Avatar now?

1201
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,760
Tell us when will we see the mighty Akron again?

1202
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,760
Yeah.

1203
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,160
Mighty Banshee.

1204
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,200
They saw us.

1205
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,880
We want to see them.

1206
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,640
Yeah, there's going to be a lot of that going on.

1207
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,280
Iger having to shake people down for the movies they promised years ago.

1208
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,280
Yeah.

1209
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,640
Twenty eight dresses will finally get 28 dresses.

1210
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,760
Now, do you guys know I was reading about movies?

1211
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,360
20th century, 21st century Fox's release.

1212
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:31,360
Marley and me and Brideswords, both Brides Bride Wars, Bride Wars released on the same

1213
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,360
day.

1214
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,360
Isn't that interesting?

1215
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,360
I thought that was interesting.

1216
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,360
I suppose.

1217
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,360
I guess.

1218
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,720
They're kind of cutting in on the same market, aren't they?

1219
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,320
A dog movie and a wedding movie?

1220
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,320
Yeah.

1221
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
Bride Wars is raunchy though.

1222
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,640
Yeah, I guess it was a little raunchy.

1223
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,240
I think they're going to get like 24.

1224
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,600
They're going to get that franchise.

1225
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,680
Oh, right.

1226
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,640
So you're going to see I think all these we're going to get diehards for we were probably

1227
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,240
already going to get diehards for the rest of our lives.

1228
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,520
We're going to get everything.

1229
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,520
Everything's coming back already.

1230
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,520
And now Disney is the king of doing everything again over and over again.

1231
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:12,080
I would like to put Mike and my name in the hat to write a big, loud, dumb 90s X-Men movie

1232
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:18,040
with characters with giant guns and lots of patches and bright colors and lots of explosions

1233
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,920
because I think that's what those X-Men movies are missing.

1234
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,400
Yeah, I think that they need the outfit.

1235
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,440
I mean, a big thing with me is the outfits.

1236
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,040
Yeah, you got to have the outfits.

1237
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,760
Well, that's that squealing that rock guitar that.

1238
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,760
Oh, man.

1239
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,760
Yes.

1240
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,200
And you bring the theme back.

1241
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,040
You bring the theme back from the 90s cartoon.

1242
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,160
You like make put the orchestra behind it.

1243
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,160
It's all melodrama.

1244
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:44,960
Every character is screaming like melodrama soap opera melodrama lines about their powers

1245
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,880
and there's love triangles.

1246
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,640
Jubilee's got a giant yellow trench coat.

1247
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,640
Yeah.

1248
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,640
Yeah.

1249
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,640
This sounds much better.

1250
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,720
It sounds like a lot of fun.

1251
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,960
Then the joyless black leather costumes that they've been stuck in the in their singer

1252
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,640
verse made for so long directed by international sex criminals.

1253
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,640
I wonder how he's doing in international waters.

1254
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,640
Maybe he might.

1255
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,080
His submarine is going to bump with Cameron one of these days.

1256
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,080
These guys are in submarines.

1257
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,200
Kevin's spacey submarine is one place I'm safe.

1258
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,920
The bottom of the ocean.

1259
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,920
Yeah.

1260
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:27,640
Also, Fantastic Four was so odd and joyless in the last round, but you've also seen Fantastic

1261
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,400
Four iterations that are so bright and colorful that they seem kind of silly.

1262
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,240
But like I would argue that that's not the problem with those movies being bright.

1263
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,240
No, no, no.

1264
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,240
Probably.

1265
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,000
There was a way to do bright, but nobody I think anybody knows that everybody's doing

1266
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,560
this like this this Nolan ripoff.

1267
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:50,640
I guess Guardians is a good example of a bright, fun movie that doesn't feel stupid.

1268
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,880
And like Thor Ragnarok has a ton of color.

1269
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,200
It's just a lot of Jack Kirby design and color.

1270
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,320
And like the least like that's that's another reason why I like the Marvel movies is because

1271
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,400
they're not like your joyless affairs.

1272
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,400
Yeah.

1273
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,400
Yeah.

1274
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,320
The Incredibles is essentially a great Fantastic Four movie.

1275
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,560
Like a lot of that.

1276
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,720
I mean, the family elements and even in some of the hours they ripped off all the powers.

1277
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,120
Yeah, they just stole it.

1278
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,000
It's exactly the Fantastic Four.

1279
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,280
That's what you would do with that movie.

1280
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,280
Pretty much.

1281
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,280
So they have to just do that again.

1282
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,320
So the Incredibles and the Fantas are in the same family.

1283
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,320
Meet now.

1284
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,320
Yes.

1285
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:30,720
I actually if it was CGI, Incredibles and live versus live action.

1286
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,720
Yeah.

1287
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,720
Yeah.

1288
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,760
I think it'll I think everything is collapsing, too, even though these companies are getting

1289
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,760
bigger and bigger.

1290
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,080
I think everything is collapsing.

1291
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,080
No one knows.

1292
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,000
Like we're bringing back the office on NBC.

1293
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,520
Like barely been gone two years later.

1294
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,600
The office is back and everything's like they're good.

1295
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,360
They wanted to bring 30 rock anything that and 30 rock they're trying to bring back maybe.

1296
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,480
And like that wasn't even a hit at the time, but it was a bigger hit than what they're

1297
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,760
making now.

1298
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,760
Everyone's desperate.

1299
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,480
The walls like all these networks are going to collapse.

1300
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,400
But I think that that'll probably happen with movies.

1301
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,760
And you'll see like stuff like that.

1302
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:09,440
The last gasp of entertainment will be throwing like Fantastic Four, Incredibles, Star Wars

1303
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,560
meets the Deadpool.

1304
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:18,680
Like it'll just be this disastrous, gross crossover stuff, which, you know, will be

1305
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,800
that does sound fun.

1306
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:26,560
But like, you know, just occurred to me, the entire Simpsons Family Guy crossover series.

1307
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,560
This will happen.

1308
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,560
They did.

1309
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,400
They've done little crossovers and they did the big episode.

1310
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,880
I think we're about seven years away from an entire new show where they just reset the

1311
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,320
rules and they all live there.

1312
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,320
They're next door neighbors.

1313
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,320
They just merge everything.

1314
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,320
Doesn't that seem?

1315
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,800
Yeah, I mean, you probably should edit that out because it's a good idea that you could

1316
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,680
pitch and they'd be like, yes, of course.

1317
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,880
You can show run it.

1318
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:54,280
And I'm just given four billion dollars immediately.

1319
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,280
And you have to get it.

1320
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,240
And Matt, don't get a cut.

1321
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,240
But you have to do it.

1322
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,240
You'll have to.

1323
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,240
Seth will still do the voices.

1324
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,240
Yeah, yeah.

1325
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,200
And I'll have to meet him and say, say, sorry, you didn't get a cut.

1326
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,200
But hey, thanks for coming in.

1327
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,720
We got a hundred dollar check for you.

1328
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,600
Man, that Peter voice so funny, dude.

1329
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,840
We did see in your contract we will get you crooning.

1330
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,840
You will.

1331
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,840
Lie to Rose.

1332
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,840
Lie to Rose.

1333
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,840
I'm home again.

1334
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,340
We'll get that in there.

1335
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:26,920
Seth can now perform on the on the Disney holiday specials more and more readily.

1336
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:32,240
He starts going down Main Street like Regis Philbin used to do, but he's doing the Peter

1337
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,080
voice or the quagmire voice.

1338
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,080
Oh, God.

1339
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:41,000
This is this episode, by the way, a lot of references to our own continuity.

1340
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,800
We're declaring it.

1341
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,160
Yeah, we can we can make insight.

1342
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,520
We can make references to our old episodes.

1343
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,960
Sure we can.

1344
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,680
Seth McFarlane, I saw he commented on this because he was like he's like, it's fine.

1345
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,680
Who cares?

1346
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
Like he doesn't.

1347
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,080
But also he was called by Bob Iger.

1348
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,320
Like, oh, he had to.

1349
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,320
He got a call.

1350
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,320
Wow.

1351
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:07,000
As did I believe Ryan Murphy because my Murphy has so many shows, Fox shows and also FX is

1352
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
part of this as well.

1353
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,960
Like they'll get Disney will get American Horror Story and like whatever else is on.

1354
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,160
So like Ryan Murphy got a call, McFarlane got a call of like, hey, you know, just checking

1355
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,160
in.

1356
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,560
We're going to buy you and it doesn't matter if you're all right with it.

1357
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,120
But you know, fuck you.

1358
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,760
So to bring it back to to our fate.

1359
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,920
So what does this mean for the parks?

1360
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,220
Oh, well, and this is I'm going to probably I just listened to this Jim Hill podcast.

1361
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:40,240
So by the way, the plug Jim Hill for shout out to our boys, the OGs Jim and Len, Len

1362
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,360
Testa, they do a podcast called the Disney Dish Podcast.

1363
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:50,560
And so I did my Disney Dish podcast hosted by Lentesta featuring Jim Hill.

1364
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,920
It's a long title.

1365
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,920
It's a very long.

1366
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,920
It's not as long as Guardians of the Galaxy.

1367
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,280
And the logo is in for some reason.

1368
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,800
Yes, it's the touring for plans, touring plans.

1369
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,800
It's touring plans.

1370
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,800
Unofficial.

1371
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,920
That'd be my only comment, guys, is decide the name.

1372
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,000
But otherwise, we listen to it all the time.

1373
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah.

1374
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,560
So yeah, and also if like listen to that podcast, if you want people that really know what they're

1375
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,760
talking about, like we're we're half.

1376
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,760
Yeah.

1377
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,760
Casual conjecture.

1378
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,760
Yeah, yeah.

1379
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,760
Yeah, yeah.

1380
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:23,600
Also, non shout out to that one iTunes reviewer who said we don't do enough research.

1381
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,600
Oh, that's right.

1382
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
We saved it.

1383
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,840
We didn't comment on it on the Twitter or anything.

1384
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:33,400
We got a three star review ruined our perfect record way to give us a lot of stink coming

1385
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,400
into 2018.

1386
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,000
We had five stars for every review and then this guy gave us three and was like, these

1387
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,040
guys are funny, but man, they are inaccurate.

1388
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,040
Yeah.

1389
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,400
And we're just here to say we will never do more research.

1390
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,760
This is the amount you're going to get.

1391
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,760
All right.

1392
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,120
This is about it's part of the spirit that makes that makes the fans come back again

1393
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:59,200
and again that and the inside references to things we've done before.

1394
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,200
Ain't that right?

1395
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,200
Bugsy bones.

1396
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,200
Anyway.

1397
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,440
So back to back to so the park.

1398
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,920
So he was saying Jim Hill was saying that he thinks that right now the Imagineers or

1399
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,240
according to his sources, because he is like, we are yet to have sources on this show.

1400
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,680
We don't know people in the inside, but he apparently has these sources and they say

1401
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,520
that, you know, there was a chance that they were going to build a big Marvel and in California

1402
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,040
adventure right by that Guardians of the Galaxy ride.

1403
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,960
But now he's saying there's a chance they may slow it down and build an entire Marvel

1404
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:30,960
park.

1405
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,520
So he might just do a full sized thing with all the properties at once, put them all in

1406
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,520
the same place.

1407
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,480
Because right now there's only so much room in California adventure and you know, you're

1408
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,240
going to get a few things, but you're not going to get all of it because now they have

1409
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,240
access to all of it.

1410
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,380
Now you can make the X-Men's mansion.

1411
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:49,040
Now you can make the Baxter building, the famous skyscraper that the Fantastic Four

1412
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,040
live in.

1413
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:53,680
Like you can do all of it and hey, maybe we wait.

1414
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,680
Maybe we maybe we'd use that Toy Story lot and just do all Marvel.

1415
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,320
Maybe that's the step.

1416
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,240
So it's there's that's what it could mean for the parks.

1417
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,520
But in the short term, yeah, maybe Cyclops shows up.

1418
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:11,360
Maybe you can shake Cyclops's hand and California adventure in front of award wieners in front

1419
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,600
of the hot dog store.

1420
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:17,240
You can meet the apes, Caesar and the Coba.

1421
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,600
Yeah, I think I'm wrong on that name.

1422
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,280
I know Caesar is doctor.

1423
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,640
I have not seen any of the new apes, which I hear they're very good.

1424
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,120
Is Dr. Zayas in them?

1425
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,120
No.

1426
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,040
But they will own he's going to get that's right, because they're like prequels.

1427
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,040
Yeah.

1428
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,520
So like Dr. Zayas comes in later by the time.

1429
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,800
Well, then by the end of the first original.

1430
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,240
Yeah, they're they're they're they're now at a point where they're going to go build

1431
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:45,720
their society and probably Dr. Zayas will be part of the but there's no young Zayas

1432
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,600
either like his grandfather.

1433
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:51,240
Not unless somebody we've not unless a little baby ape we've met already is a burgeoning

1434
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,240
Zayas.

1435
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,160
I think that's a big I think they should have had a young Zayas.

1436
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,320
Well, now they can have in the parks, they can have a walk around Zayas.

1437
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,600
There's so many they can have the old one.

1438
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,600
They could have a young old.

1439
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,560
Yeah, they could have the Charlton Heston era Zayas.

1440
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:08,560
Yeah, they are multiple, multiple fantastic force.

1441
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,200
You could go to Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

1442
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:19,020
Well, that's that evergreen comedy reference Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium.

1443
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:23,800
Unless we had anything else maybe to speculate that leads us into this next segment.

1444
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,520
Because did anyone else have any thoughts before we do it?

1445
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,520
All right, we're going to do it.

1446
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,520
So here we go.

1447
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:33,640
We are going to now build a Fox land, a Fox theme park.

1448
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,880
Now I've decided maybe we leave the Marvel characters out because they all belong in

1449
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,240
their own thing.

1450
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,920
But using all the Fox properties, we're going to sort of just sketch out what we think blue

1451
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,920
sky is what they call it.

1452
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,520
What they could legally do.

1453
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,520
Legally now.

1454
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,240
Yeah, Disney could do with all these properties that they're buying and it's going to be

1455
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,240
called Fox land.

1456
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,320
I think we all agree on that.

1457
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,640
It's nice and simple, simple, love it.

1458
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,840
I was thinking, where does this thing go?

1459
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:03,280
And my first thought was they, Iger should call Rupert Murdoch up and say, look, we want

1460
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,000
that Fox lot over in Century City.

1461
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,800
It's about 56 acres.

1462
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,160
It's a little smaller than Disneyland, but that's perfect.

1463
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,160
I think for the spirit of Fox.

1464
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,160
Yeah.

1465
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,160
OK, does everyone agree with that?

1466
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,720
That's where it all is where it all began.

1467
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,800
I think you demolish all the sound stages where the famous movies were.

1468
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:27,920
There's this fave over that one giant steamroller rolls over and everybody's kicked off.

1469
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,200
Bye bye, modern family set.

1470
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,200
You move somewhere else.

1471
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,200
Bye bye, Simpson's office.

1472
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,080
This is writers go to hell.

1473
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,360
Go find another place.

1474
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,840
Go to the Disney lot.

1475
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,120
Everyone go to the Disney lot.

1476
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,720
We're building a theme park, a Fox theme park.

1477
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,040
And I think you got to walk.

1478
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,540
So when you walk into a theme park, that's Fox.

1479
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,760
It's got to have the big famous 20th Century Fox logo with the spotlights up on the top.

1480
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,760
Yeah.

1481
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,760
That's what I was thinking.

1482
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,760
That's the castle.

1483
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,760
That's the castle.

1484
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:02,800
The big attraction that leads you down 21st Century Avenue.

1485
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:08,160
And I think that you light that thing up, you got those spotlights going and you're

1486
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,560
playing the fanfare.

1487
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,720
Brum, bum, brum, bum.

1488
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:16,320
Maybe at least once an hour, you light it up like the small world clock or maybe once

1489
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:21,480
every 15 minutes or maybe just all day, all the time.

1490
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:26,640
Live band is what I have a marching band playing the 21st Century Fox theme.

1491
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,640
Uh huh.

1492
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,760
I think that you have to go live band.

1493
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,880
Yeah, that's a Disney Disney type thing.

1494
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,120
You could trade them out in shifts, just kind of in way.

1495
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,120
All right.

1496
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,960
Now the drum bone players leave and we slide in the next shift and you do you do eight

1497
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,280
hours of straight horn playing straight drumming because there's been people in the played

1498
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,480
with the title like in their movies.

1499
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:49,200
They sometimes do a different type of theme or if it's a futuristic theme, it's like an

1500
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,200
EDM Fox theme or something.

1501
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:55,080
I don't know that's real, but I assume Don John probably if it were if that was Fox.

1502
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,520
Wait, is Don John Fox?

1503
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,520
I don't know.

1504
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,520
I can look up Don John in there.

1505
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,520
Oh, fingers crossed.

1506
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,680
There's a very funny on YouTube, like somebody doing it.

1507
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:10,560
That theme is a recorder, just like in the 20th century hard to control recorder, the

1508
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,280
20th century Fox theme or the Don John theme.

1509
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,880
Oh, not Don John.

1510
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,880
Oh, OK.

1511
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,880
The general Fox theme.

1512
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,880
Don John is not Fox.

1513
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,880
All right.

1514
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,880
You're out.

1515
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,880
You're out of Fox.

1516
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,880
So there won't be a walk around Don John.

1517
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,880
OK, OK.

1518
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,400
But we have the giant the logo.

1519
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,440
That's yeah, that's yeah, we can all agree.

1520
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,280
That's a simple that's a that's a gimme.

1521
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,280
Yeah.

1522
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:35,760
In now I'm thinking like we can start with like land ideas or ride ideas.

1523
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,760
Do you have Jason?

1524
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,760
You have one?

1525
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:43,080
Well, I've got some legitimate stuff and then I've got some goofy bullshit.

1526
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:47,000
So well, to be fair, Jason, this is all goofy bullshit.

1527
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Yeah, that's podcast.

1528
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Everything we're doing here.

1529
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,360
OK, well, here's here's a deep.

1530
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:56,800
Well, here's like a real nerd answer is that we could finally get the very original iteration

1531
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,280
of Alien Encounter.

1532
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,280
Yeah, sure.

1533
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:05,720
This this didn't come up earlier, but Stitch's Great Escape, the Disney World Ride has like

1534
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,680
officially closed now.

1535
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:13,800
And you know, that was built on the bones of the Alien Encounter ride, legitimately

1536
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:20,760
the scariest ride Disney ever built, which in a very early version was supposed to be

1537
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,840
the aliens from Alien.

1538
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,400
I forget what is what are those things called?

1539
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,400
They have a name.

1540
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,400
Oh, the xenomorph.

1541
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,400
Yeah.

1542
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,880
So you were supposed to it was supposed to be an alien teleported in and it was supposed

1543
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,400
to be like a xenomorph.

1544
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,600
So like that is 20th Century Fox.

1545
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:46,160
So we could get a Prometheus or aliens like themed ride or walk through or show or something.

1546
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,520
This is good because this is this sex into an idea I have.

1547
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,660
I think there should be a whole sort of space land at because there's we have lost also

1548
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:57,280
Lost in Space is a property that they have to and they're going to do a new series on

1549
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,280
that.

1550
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,540
So I think this alien ride would be perfect.

1551
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,840
You put a fun sort of Lost in Space ride.

1552
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,320
And then because I'm a thoughtful person when it comes to corporation and synergy, I think

1553
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,760
you put in a new ride based on the TV show, the Orville.

1554
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,280
So and what the thing about the Orville ride is you're riding and you're going, well, is

1555
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,720
this supposed to be funny?

1556
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,520
Is this supposed to be a serious ride?

1557
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,200
And it sort of straddles the line between you're riding it and it's fun and it kind

1558
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,860
of looks good, but not good.

1559
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,240
And you're like, it's just you're not sure.

1560
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,360
So you're done with the ride and you're like, oh, I kind of like that.

1561
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:29,560
And you just you're scratching your head.

1562
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,520
And it's a different type of an experience that you're getting when you ride on this

1563
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,440
ride and of course, it's innovative.

1564
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,200
It's innovative in that respect.

1565
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,720
So I think that's a good idea.

1566
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,840
I think that would be a whole space section.

1567
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,840
Nice.

1568
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,840
Titan A.E. perfect.

1569
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,840
I had Titan A.E.

1570
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,840
Great.

1571
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,840
We can throw all of that in there.

1572
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,840
Great.

1573
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,440
Do you know more about Titan A.E. than I do?

1574
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,560
I certainly don't.

1575
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,560
We're going to teach the world.

1576
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,560
We're going to revitalize the franchise.

1577
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,040
No, I remember I don't think I saw it on theaters.

1578
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,020
I think I saw it on videotape, but I remember liking it.

1579
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,720
We can merge the Titan A.E. characters and the Treasure Planet characters finally.

1580
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,280
Well, well, here's my idea.

1581
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:12,840
Speaking of Titan A.E., Titan A.E. comes up on one of mine.

1582
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,800
It's called Fox's Cartoon Street.

1583
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,800
OK, go ahead.

1584
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:20,360
Because like Mickey's Toontown, all of your favorite Fox cartoon characters live with

1585
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,360
each other.

1586
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:27,560
You know, so all of your favorites from The Simpsons and Family Guy and Titan A.E. live

1587
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,880
on the same street.

1588
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:29,880
And who's that?

1589
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,600
Why it's the gang from Ice Age at the zoo.

1590
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,140
And who's visiting them today on a class field trip?

1591
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:38,800
Why it's young Alan Gregory, the child genius.

1592
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,800
Of course.

1593
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,800
Yes.

1594
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,800
Hello, Alan.

1595
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,960
And will the fish police are keeping an eye on everything?

1596
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,440
The fish police are keeping an eye on everything.

1597
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,440
I think that's great.

1598
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,560
I think people are going to love that.

1599
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,720
You know, you know, I want to see in there the Gracie Films silhouette.

1600
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,800
Shushing everybody.

1601
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,800
That's great.

1602
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:01,160
And I would, if I may, I think we should also see the Capitol Critters there.

1603
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,160
Also on the box.

1604
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,160
Sure.

1605
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,160
Yeah.

1606
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,300
And the Airdine ABC, I believe, but owned by Fox.

1607
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:10,720
So will Capitol Critters, capital famous 90s under one political satire cartoon all under

1608
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:16,040
one glorious roof and simulate a different kind of cartoon.

1609
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:22,400
And this I am legitimately think would think I legitimately think would be cool.

1610
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,400
They own.

1611
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,360
They made the Fantastic Mr. Fox movie.

1612
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,120
And I really like that movie.

1613
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,280
I think it's got a really cool look.

1614
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:33,720
And that I feel like would be a great dark ride or walk through attraction.

1615
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,640
Yeah, that would be fun.

1616
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,660
I'm looking at mine and they're all goofy bullshit.

1617
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:47,840
So look like the famous superstar television at Disney's Hollywood studio where you would

1618
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,440
get to be part of the TV show.

1619
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,040
I think that it's fun.

1620
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,020
That's fun to see your mom up there and she's doing fun stuff.

1621
01:14:55,020 --> 01:15:00,240
So I think you take maybe some talk shows that Fox owns and you put those up.

1622
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,480
I'm talking Magic Hour.

1623
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,360
I'm talking the Chevy Chase talk show.

1624
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:09,200
I'm talking we get actually Magic Johnson and Chevy Chase to do shifts in the park,

1625
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,300
interviewing your mom or your dad about what's going on.

1626
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,480
How are the kids behaving?

1627
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,040
How hot is it out here?

1628
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,440
Although Culver City, it's actually not that hot because it's kind of close to the ocean.

1629
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,160
So maybe the answer will be it's fine.

1630
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,760
The temperature is fine.

1631
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,680
Both of them basketball involved in both of those shows.

1632
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:31,880
They could probably use the same set, Magic Johnson, an actual basketball player, whereas

1633
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:38,160
Chevy Chase would come out and do a take a shot at the beginning of every episode so

1634
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:41,000
they could just leave that up for either of them.

1635
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,800
Chevy missed very often.

1636
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,400
Also, we also just like the I want to see the full recreation of that set with the fish

1637
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,240
tank behind him.

1638
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,580
Keep that basketball away from that fish tank.

1639
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:52,580
That's a potential spillage.

1640
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:55,160
How's the vacation going, Grandpa?

1641
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,360
Like Chevy would say.

1642
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,200
Then yeah, I think this would be great.

1643
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:03,560
I think you could sell a VHS copy of the appearance after for everyone if they wanted it.

1644
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,560
Not even DVD.

1645
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,560
Nope.

1646
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,560
VHS.

1647
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,560
Me and Chevy.

1648
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,160
I mean, I'll run through my other ideas here real quick.

1649
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,320
I think that they have guides at Disneyland.

1650
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,880
If you're rich, you'll have a guide.

1651
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,600
I think that all the guides should be dressed like Mr. Belvedere.

1652
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,860
I think they should be helping you and finding things you want.

1653
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:22,240
I think that's a good idea.

1654
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:27,320
I think that, let's see, here we go.

1655
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:33,400
Okay, this is actually my favorite idea is a whole, let me backtrack.

1656
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:39,320
Fox owns MTM Enterprises, which is Mary Tyler Moore's production company.

1657
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:44,600
So when Disney buys this, I'm assuming they now own all of these shows.

1658
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,240
And there's a lot of shows here.

1659
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:51,120
And I have some ideas for them like, for instance, New Heart.

1660
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:54,600
New Heart was a show by starring Bob Newhart where he owned a bed and breakfast and there

1661
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,200
was a whole host of weird characters.

1662
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,200
That's the hotel.

1663
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,200
Oh, wow.

1664
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:03,160
New Heart is the hotel you stay at and then there's the people, the famous wacky characters

1665
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,160
that come in.

1666
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:10,240
I think that you can, when you go into this Mary Tyler Moore land, which I'm going to

1667
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:15,200
call it, you're greeted by the cartoon cat Mimsy, which is the famous title card for

1668
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,200
MTM.

1669
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,720
I'm alienating anyone who's under 50 right now.

1670
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,040
Instead of it's not a lion in the logo, it's a cat.

1671
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:27,200
Actually in fact, here's my pitch for this area, Disney MTM Studios.

1672
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:31,720
I think that's great.

1673
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:35,120
Sue Ann from Mary Tyler Moore, you'll eat at her restaurant.

1674
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,240
You'll learn newspaper making from Lou Grant.

1675
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:42,200
And there'll be a Mary Tyler Moore e-ticket where it's like an omnimover ride where you

1676
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:47,480
go through the streets of Minneapolis, aboard a news van trying to break stories.

1677
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:52,960
You could do a parachute ride that shoots you up real fast where you're on a giant Mary

1678
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:53,960
Tyler Moore hat.

1679
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,600
She's throwing you up in the air.

1680
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,600
That's great.

1681
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,600
That's all ages.

1682
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,920
This omnimover one, you have to be like 14 to ride.

1683
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:00,920
Okay.

1684
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:01,920
So there is now.

1685
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,640
I've got a bit of a saucy one that we might have to put an age gap on or an age limit

1686
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,640
on.

1687
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,720
Oh, go ahead.

1688
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,480
We all know Mike and Dave from Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.

1689
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,480
Yes, of course.

1690
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,480
Right?

1691
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,480
Yeah.

1692
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,000
Well now Mike and Dave need your help.

1693
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
That's right.

1694
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
You are the wedding date in this new 4D gross out simulator adventure.

1695
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
That's good.

1696
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,520
I like that.

1697
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,480
You got a ride component.

1698
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,520
You're jumping on mopeds with those goops.

1699
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,920
Oh man, you kidding me?

1700
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,920
Yeah.

1701
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:42,240
You know, you could maybe do an entire sectioned off area that is 18 and up, which is where

1702
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,360
Deadpool can live, but more importantly.

1703
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,360
Deadpool is everywhere.

1704
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,960
There's walk around Deadpool's everywhere in my mind.

1705
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,640
Well he can be like he's, there's him in a space suit and him as a cowboy.

1706
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,640
Oh perfect.

1707
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,240
There's just multiple, you know Deadpool will be in every land.

1708
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,280
You just don't know where.

1709
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,040
He can be in Mouse Ears over in regular Disneyland.

1710
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:08,040
But I think you take the, maybe you call this area Fox XXX with all three X's.

1711
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,040
Oh yeah.

1712
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,560
This is the 18 and over area and this could be the home of an area that I want to see

1713
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:19,440
which is Silk Stocking Square.

1714
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:26,120
The famous Crime Time and Prime Time started on CBS and moved over to USA.

1715
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:31,600
You know, a 90's crime show is very sultry and very sexy.

1716
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,600
Fox I'm unclear on it.

1717
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:37,320
It looks like they only produced the season six through eight.

1718
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,240
So you would have to pick up just the characters from season six.

1719
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,240
So late period.

1720
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,240
Yeah, yeah.

1721
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,240
Towards the end.

1722
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,160
We're talking like 96 to 99.

1723
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,660
So you would have to center on detectives Tom Ryan and Cassandra St. John.

1724
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:53,240
But that gives you a lot of great plots to work with and I think maybe you could do kind

1725
01:19:53,240 --> 01:20:00,040
of a live show, there was a Dick Tracy show in the 90's at Disneyland.

1726
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,200
You could do a thing like that.

1727
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:05,040
Maybe not quite a stunt show because I don't know that USA could afford a lot of stunts

1728
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,360
by that point in the run of Silk Stockings.

1729
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:16,080
You could watch Tom and Cassie solve mysteries live on stage and you could slide out different

1730
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,000
formative episodes of Silk Stockings.

1731
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,040
I'd love to see a live experience based on their episode where somebody is committing

1732
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,120
murders based on who he meets in a chat room.

1733
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,040
That episode of course called Call Me at Murder.com.

1734
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,500
So let's see the stunt show off of that.

1735
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:37,440
Also another one called Do You Believe in Magic where Tom and Cassie's only clue in

1736
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,140
a murder case is a ventriloquist dummy.

1737
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:43,640
So that lends itself pretty perfectly to a theme park environment.

1738
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:47,600
So yeah, a lot of sexy fun waiting in Silk Stockings Square.

1739
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:54,320
Hey and buy your gal some lingerie and some garters while you're over there.

1740
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,240
Some steamy 90's goods.

1741
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,240
Sure.

1742
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,200
Vox has always been very salacious.

1743
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,880
But I think we shouldn't forget the company's rich history.

1744
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,520
I mean they have been releasing movies since the 30's.

1745
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:14,000
And so I know I said we could bring something back earlier but I think this is just too

1746
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,800
perfect.

1747
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,480
And we were talking about stuff going away and coming back too quickly.

1748
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:24,880
I think you've got to bring back the great movie ride just exploring the history of Fox

1749
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:31,240
all the way from early classics like Red Heads on Parade and Steamboat Round the Bend to

1750
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:37,440
Oscar nominated Golden Age films like Heaven Can Wait and the Oxbow Incident.

1751
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:42,960
All the way to your favorite movies of today like Why Him and the Murder on the Orient

1752
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,720
Express.

1753
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:49,520
And let's not forget all your favorite Fox produced TV shows like Ally McBeal and Judging

1754
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,760
Amy and the current hit Sleepy Hollow.

1755
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:53,760
They're on the movie ride?

1756
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,760
They're all on the movie ride too.

1757
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,440
This is a good catch all to fit them all on.

1758
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,440
I agree.

1759
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,620
And the ride culminates in an incredible climax featuring a very accurate and very graphic

1760
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:09,000
rendition of the crucifixion from the Passion of the Cross.

1761
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Is that them?

1762
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Is that Fox?

1763
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
They get Christ.

1764
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Fox has Christ.

1765
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,280
And the whole ride is hosted by your good friend Deadpool.

1766
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,520
He's not letting anybody get out of there scuffery.

1767
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,280
The only thing I would say I have one improvement is if you could put a show scene on there

1768
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:32,560
from the hit Fox show Drexel's class starring Dabney Coleman.

1769
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,000
I mean we might have to dial back the perfect.

1770
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,040
Wait was it Boston Comet?

1771
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,040
I forget.

1772
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,040
Oh yeah.

1773
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,040
There's still a 90s thing.

1774
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:46,800
But you know we were sort of roughing out an idea yesterday that I think could fit within

1775
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,800
this.

1776
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:48,800
Oh yeah.

1777
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:56,920
Which is that with these purchases we now have between Disney and Fox a myriad of Samuel

1778
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,840
L. Jackson characters and films.

1779
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:08,320
So I think that this iteration of the great movie ride should have the hall of SLJ.

1780
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,560
You can pass through the hall of SLJ where you can meet I mean remind me of Nick Fury

1781
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,000
and Frozone from the Incredibles.

1782
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,400
He's Mace Windu which Lucasfilm's owned by Disney so you can get Mason there.

1783
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,840
Put out by Fox and now totally owned by.

1784
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:32,720
You have his character from Die Hard 3 whose name is available on Wikipedia for you to

1785
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:33,720
look up at home.

1786
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,720
Oh Zeus Carver.

1787
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,720
Oh yeah.

1788
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:36,720
Of course.

1789
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,720
Of course.

1790
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:45,320
And imagine passing by every within the company's ownership Samuel L. Jackson character.

1791
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,480
Yeah I mean that's great.

1792
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,240
I think all of them badger you as you.

1793
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,600
I'll tell you those are the only guys who are going to be able to put Deadpool in his

1794
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,600
place.

1795
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,400
Yeah Deadpool is like oh I'm cutting out of this part of the ride.

1796
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,440
I'll see you guys at the end.

1797
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:06,040
But you know this might get a little heavy the history of an esteemed movie studio and

1798
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:10,280
that's why I think next to it should be something a little lighter a little area called parody

1799
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:16,920
land because Fox put out both Meet the Sparks and Vampires Suck.

1800
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,920
Oh no.

1801
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:23,360
You can see some of the hilarious skewerings of the pop culture of what was that the mid

1802
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,600
2000s early 2000s.

1803
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:33,360
The Seltzer the Seltzer Friedberg franchise of quickly pumped out parody films.

1804
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,360
Yes that one.

1805
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,360
Great.

1806
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,360
Are you watching the movies.

1807
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,360
We're live.

1808
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,360
Oh there's a land.

1809
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:42,800
You're maybe they could be it could be a land that is parodying existing Disney.

1810
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,800
That's good.

1811
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:44,800
Oh yeah.

1812
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,800
Uh huh.

1813
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,280
Meet the land meet the theme park land.

1814
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:52,740
It's like here's the actually how about a great movie ride that's like the highlights

1815
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:56,040
of all of the Disney the main Disney attractions.

1816
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:00,320
But you know you say you're going through the room the room with Madame Leota and the

1817
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,720
crystal ball in the haunted mansion but inside is Snooki.

1818
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,240
Oh boy.

1819
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,120
That wouldn't be the first Snooki reference in a theme park.

1820
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:13,080
Snooki famously appeared in the Disney California Adventure Aladdin show.

1821
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,080
I mean the.

1822
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,080
Oh right.

1823
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,280
Yeah now we're getting back to that.

1824
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,520
So yeah that's not our way to get topical reference.

1825
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,520
That's not without.

1826
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,520
Yeah without precedent.

1827
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,520
Back in the same park.

1828
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:29,480
You know you're there's sort of a Star Tours kind of section but your pilot is Borat.

1829
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,520
Oh yeah they do own Borat.

1830
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:37,800
And you know but but the parody films also that's that's the fun of those movies.

1831
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,440
It'll just cut to Borat not even a parody of it.

1832
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,040
Just here's Austin Powers.

1833
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,040
Here's Borat.

1834
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,920
So I think that's all fair game now within Paris.

1835
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,320
So really in parody land.

1836
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:50,160
Yeah you can have every character ever because you can hear whatever you want outside apparently

1837
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:56,120
land while you could get your pictures with the monument men and then inside parody land

1838
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,680
the monuments men Jason.

1839
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:04,560
Oh excuse me the monuments multiple monuments there's a there's a sharp sharp witted takedown

1840
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,840
of the monuments men in parody land.

1841
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:07,840
Wow yeah both.

1842
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:14,040
So you can yeah real Borat and then fake fake just off enough different mustache widths

1843
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,040
so that they get sued.

1844
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,040
Borat.

1845
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,040
Wow.

1846
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,040
I love it.

1847
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,040
That's great.

1848
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,520
I mean the only the only last thing I have is that I want there to be a live show based

1849
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:27,880
on Kelsey Grammer presents the sketch show from seven or eight years ago with with local

1850
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,640
improvisers headed by one Jason Sheridan.

1851
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,640
Oh boy.

1852
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,640
Oh really.

1853
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,640
Yeah.

1854
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:34,640
Oh wow.

1855
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:35,640
I mean the show he was not on the show.

1856
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,640
I wasn't on the show.

1857
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,640
He's in the theme park version of the show.

1858
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:38,640
Oh I see.

1859
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:39,640
Oh OK.

1860
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,360
I thought we had wait that show was a while back.

1861
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,960
It would be funny if you didn't know Jason was the star of Kelsey Grammer presents.

1862
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,440
Oh Kelsey Grammer was the sketch show when I was like 20.

1863
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:52,120
And as far as I know as far as the world knows about Kelsey Grammer's the sketch show.

1864
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:58,520
Yeah you know I'll put in one more which is a you know a more hallowed Fox television

1865
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,520
franchise.

1866
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:05,680
There's going to be an area called Mash Mountain and it's kind of a kind of a camp Snoopy.

1867
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:11,800
It's actually I think it's with all of the vehicles famously used in Mash you can have

1868
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:16,200
it's you can have a lot of fun little little kids rides but the kids can also learn about

1869
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,640
the horrors of the Korean War.

1870
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:25,320
Hawkeye's helicopters radars racers Trapper John's tanks maybe a merry go round.

1871
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:30,320
It's all scalpels and different surgical instruments and you can form your own conclusion about

1872
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:34,080
whether that's a war we should have been in or not.

1873
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,640
I think that's to use another reference to our old show much like your Christmas pitch

1874
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:43,800
for the submarine ride where Santa's the North Pole's been destroyed as a way to teach children

1875
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,800
about global warming.

1876
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,800
I think this is great.

1877
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,800
I think kids are going to learn a lot from it.

1878
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:54,320
I want more lessons and I think that the property the IP mash really lends itself to that.

1879
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:02,240
This is yeah I think this more adults issue oriented park is the is the way of the future.

1880
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:07,480
Kids will learn about parody and skewering at an earlier age and and about about war

1881
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,960
and there's there's there's a lot of possibilities here.

1882
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:16,520
So come to Fox land which is right off Avenue of the Stars which is the street in call and

1883
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,560
it's in an incredibly inconvenient location.

1884
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,440
It is and if you've ever been there they try to make you park at a parking garage.

1885
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,440
It's 25 minutes.

1886
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,840
That's a little inside baseball but I've had to walk literally a half hour from a parking

1887
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,560
garage to get to the lot.

1888
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,560
It's insane.

1889
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:32,840
But so they're all ready.

1890
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,440
It sounds like Disneyland already.

1891
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,000
That's a good point.

1892
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,480
It's really just add a tram or a gondola and then we're good.

1893
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,520
Yeah Foxland's right.

1894
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:49,040
I think we just I think we gave them enough information to get started on it now and I'm

1895
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:54,200
going to leave here and immediately make some calls and get the Simpsons Meet Family Guy

1896
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,200
series going.

1897
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,080
So we're willing to invest.

1898
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:02,040
I'll toss in a little toss in like a billion or so to start it off of my personal funds

1899
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,600
and then I think we'll have Foxland up and running in no time.

1900
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:08,840
I think we're all getting on the phone with our teams after this right.

1901
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:09,840
Yeah.

1902
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,600
The ball moves started start triangulating.

1903
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,600
Yeah.

1904
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,600
Yeah.

1905
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,600
It's it's it's time.

1906
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:21,880
We're and then and of course because we thought of it there will be statues of the three of

1907
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:28,160
us in front of the Fox logo like Walden Mickey the statue in Disneyland but it's all three

1908
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,640
of us holding hands.

1909
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:35,280
Yeah and microphones and also trying to find the person in the middle is getting the most

1910
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:39,280
screwed because he's got a because yeah well he has a cordless headset mic on.

1911
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,280
Oh great.

1912
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,280
Perfect.

1913
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:46,880
So we can solve problems so quickly in no time.

1914
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,960
So hey we'll see you in Foxland.

1915
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,360

You will notice no different.

1922
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:05,960
We're trying to do a little more on Instagram post videos of weird stuff that we're talking

1923
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:06,960
about.

1924
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:11,560
We're trying to do this on iTunes but only say nice things and say give us five stars.

1925
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,680
We don't want any like criticism at all.

1926
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:14,680
Don't you very sensitive.

1927
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:18,480
We call our little review zone Avenue of the five stars.

1928
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,840
No no threes no threes.

1929
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,560

01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,000
We've gotten some really nice emails.

1931
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,720
We have to talk about those in a future date.

1932

Yeah.

1933
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,720
Future episode ideas throw away.

1934

Thanks.

1936
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,560
Anybody on Twitter said let's talk about Stitch's great escape.

1937
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,160
I think that one's probably coming up soon.

1938
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,160
Yeah.

1939
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,160
