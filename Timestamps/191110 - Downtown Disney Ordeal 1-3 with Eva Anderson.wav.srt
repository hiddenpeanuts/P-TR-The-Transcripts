1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil rears its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried doughnut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Beignets.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, With secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Glory's board is my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, he will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of them all.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We have 15 daily very necessary episodes and much to do so. I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic for...

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
...boring.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Downtown Disney ordeal level one, stage three.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm Scott Gardener, joined by Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And Jason Sheridan as well.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hi.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You guys feel a little nervous? This is the first boss level.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, I'm feeling very nervous. I used to as a kid, I would get very stressed out when I'd have to fight a boss.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Me too, still to this day.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Agreed.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even just like casually playing Super Mario 2 that I've played a thousand times.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You see that big mouse, I'm gonna have to jump on some bombs.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It would just like, yeah, like when Bowser was in that big Super Mario world, remember he had like a big face thing with a propeller on the bottom?

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sure.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, that, oh my God, I felt like I was going to die by getting hit by a propeller like in real life.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just seeing it on the map, just seeing the airship on the map and knowing it was coming ruined my enjoyment of all the other levels.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So will today's boss be as fearsome as Bowser?

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I, there's no way of knowing, we don't even know who the boss is yet or really how this works.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I'm a little nervous, but that's why I feel lucky that we are joined by a favorite guest of ours and a veteran of the City Walk saga.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So glad she's here for this journey.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Eva Anderson is with us.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hey guys.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hello.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm really happy to be back.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hey.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And quest with you.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, wonderful.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes, the stakes are higher if you don't know.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The Sector Keeper's back.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You know about the Sector Keeper.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My friend.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes, sure. Yeah, yeah. A good buddy of all of ours, but it's not about him.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's about the Level Keeper who is a cousin.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His cousin.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The Sector Keeper is a cousin who's been captured and his name is, or he or she, we actually don't know who this is.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So the Sector Keeper doesn't know, neither do we.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Doesn't know. He's been vaping a lot, so that's kind of affecting him.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He's really juuling a lot nowadays.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay, juuling tobacco.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Flavored to there.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Whatever it is, I'm not even sure.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But so we got to find the Level Keeper.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The Level Keeper could be around any turn.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It could be in this stage if we get to the end, but I have a feeling it will not be until there's as many episodes as possible.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That seems right.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Probably.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But we don't know.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Scott is holding out hope that this will all get wrapped up quickly.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Of course it won't.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's going to be today, but if I don't carry that spring in my step, what's going to take me there?

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What did you mean by boss level?

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
For today's episode or when I was a child.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, I know what bosses are in video games, but how can Downtown Disney have a boss?

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It doesn't make sense to me.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Evil spirits have invaded Downtown Disney.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is what's going on right now.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes, yes, you explained that.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And they kidnapped the Level Keeper and they've sort of inhabited all of our favorite places.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So this is necessary for us to do because by discussing and reviewing, we're going to be, of course, freeing Downtown Disney of evil spirits.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And you were warned that there might be a big spirit here?

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think that in every level, there's three stages in every level.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And we're told that at the end of every level, there is a boss that we have to do battle with, but we don't really know what that means, how that's going to manifest itself.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So we're all sort of in the dark.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The game has changed.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Last year, there was one boss of all five boroughs, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx, and his name was Gotti.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There are multiple bosses, multiple families, some might say, controlling Downtown Disney.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
OK, OK, I got it.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is more of a games of New York situation.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you think Gotti would think that Downtown Disney is the greatest fucking outdoor shopping center in the world?

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I think he might think this part of it is the greatest fucking, you know, true.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, real paisan.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, yeah, I got some some genuine Italian.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I feel like he would like Chelsea Piers or something like like local South Sea Port.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah, I mean, it wouldn't be bad to have John Gotti's Jazz Kitchen down at Downtown Disney.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That wouldn't be bad.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Italiano.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Right. A little more. Not the New Orleans flavor.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
More than Italiano.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
John Gotti cleaned up downtown Disney.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Free John Gotti.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, I missed you guys.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Nice versa.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're so happy to bring you back to talk about a bunch of boring shit.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, yay.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I starting with.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, oh, wait, we have to get our mission from the sector keeper who's not here, but we'll summon him in just for, you know, 20 seconds or so.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Right.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We'll get him in just for the sake of the paper.

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Boys, boys.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hello, Eva.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Today's stage is Mickey and Friends Tram loading California Churro Cart religious pamphlets Naples Restorante E bar Napolini.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Good luck.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All right.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So I know it's nice to talk to him again.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He's moody or than he was, he's not the white eyed child.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's had some real character development.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Did he hit puberty?

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He still likes like kids stuff.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But then again, so do we.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He's kind of getting pulled.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He's simultaneously about our age, but also still like has a lot of catching up to do.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, yeah.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sure happy to fill them in.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, I'm like the little girl from the act.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The way that she got munchausen.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
She got munchausen to thinking she was younger than she was and sick and then she got out.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But then she killed her mom.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So she had to go right to prison.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But now she loves it because she's like catching up on culture and just stuff in general.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Great.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
She has friends.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Maybe we should show the sector keeper the act as kind of a guide of what he can do.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, I guess so.

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, no.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Killing us with secondhand vape.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's really slow death, but it's happening and killing us with boredom, I think, because

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the first thing we have to do is the Mickey and friends tram loading.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, thank God.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah.

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Tram loading zone.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I do.

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I guess it is part of it.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It is part of it.

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah, it is.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It is within the boundaries of the security checkpoint by the hotel and the Honda Odyssey,

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
promotional Star Wars Galaxy's Edge Honda Odyssey that forms the other border of downtown

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Disney.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can see La Brea Bakery from it.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yep.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Uh huh.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes.

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't take the tram, guys.

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I walk.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Every time.

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I like to walk from the parking structure where you walk by those little bushes.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's nice.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It warms me up.

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's much more superior now thanks to the bridge.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Have you gotten to go on the bridge yet?

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No, I haven't.

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This time I, well, this time I parked in the downtown Disney parking.

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, I see.

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Sure.

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But so, and the last time I was there was like a year ago, so I guess I missed this bridge.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's only a few weeks old.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's new.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's like weeks old.

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's as it goes over the street.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Ooh, so you don't have to wait.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And it's a new path.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's wonderful.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It is wonderful.

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Is the bridge part of this, do we know?

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We'll have to find out.

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We'll have to find out when we get closer.

184
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Check again later when vape smoke clears.

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,680
So, well, and you taking a walk means that you get to pass through downtown Disney, beautiful

186
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
downtown Disney.

187
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,360
Yeah, you can see all of it.

188
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,000
Any favorites outside of your stage?

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Fantastic Sephora.

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,240
I think you've mentioned this before.

191
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,000
It's one of the best ones I've ever been in.

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Sure, sure.

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's coming out of the bend.

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I think the sector, he were mad, but after I'd had a couple drinks at the, in my sector,

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,200
I bought a whole bunch of shit at Sephora and I just had so much fun.

196
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,480
I was like, just went cam in there.

197
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Oh, great.

198
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Oh, man.

199
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Got to get that parking validated.

200
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Yeah.

201
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,080
So that was great.

202
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,800
And I also, I like looking at, I mean, I don't know, like the bowling alley is okay.

203
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,360
People seem to really enjoy it.

204
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm usually surprised by how many people are just like hanging out in downtown Disney,

205
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
like eating.

206
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,920
So I got there, I went early.

207
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,760
I went at eight in the morning and people were just sitting, having breakfast at Earl

208
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,720
of Sandwich all over the place.

209
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,440
I find that I'll be walking around downtown Disney and I'll just be thinking like these

210
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,920
lucky people, I bet they live around here.

211
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, I think that they're all, it makes me, I think more like these people have been at

212
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,960
the park for too long and they're just trying to do something else with their kids.

213
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Like.

214
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,040
I'm imagining like five minutes away living and they're like, you know what, let's go

215
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,800
to Earl of Sandwich for breakfast.

216
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
You're jealous of that?

217
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
A little bit, yeah.

218
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,640
I don't think there's anywhere nice to live by Disneyland, right?

219
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,320
Well, Anaheim Hills is a little bit farther, but that's what was really pretty nice.

220
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Okay.

221
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,440
There's an Anaheim, there's a richer section, I guess you'd call it, of Anaheim.

222
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Yeah.

223
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,800
Cause I think I talked to you, was it with you guys?

224
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,360
That I did the Disney marathon.

225
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Oh yeah.

226
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,960
With Jess Jarden and we, you run around Disneyland and it's very.

227
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Crimey.

228
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Yeah.

229
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh, it's like part of, it goes through the neighborhood too.

230
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Yeah.

231
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,280
Cause there's only about two miles you can run through the parks, maybe three.

232
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,320
And then they have to fill all this space.

233
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,800
It was a half marathon, but there was like 10 miles through just downtown Anaheim and

234
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
it was bleak.

235
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Yeah.

236
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Oh, right.

237
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
That's fair.

238
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,880
I mean, our beloved Buena Park is not maybe the best area to live.

239
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,920
Oh man.

240
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,140
One time when I was in college, my boyfriend and I at the time, this is bad guys.

241
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,500
We took acid at Knott's Berry farm and then we stayed overnight in a hotel we could walk

242
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,920
to a motel, which turned out to be a very, very bad place, especially on drugs.

243
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,560
But there was a guy, it was just, it was a terrible place.

244
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,220
And at one point my boyfriend, Travis peaked out on the balcony and there was a guy just

245
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,920
holding an unplugged phone, like a hotel phone, having a conversation on it, like doing a

246
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,520
deal, but there wasn't, it wasn't connected to anything.

247
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,040
And he was like, Hey, Oh, excuse me.

248
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,680
A man just walked by and I'll ask him this question.

249
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
He turned to Travis was like, excuse me.

250
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,120
And Travis just like slammed the door and locked it.

251
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,600
He was just trying to get in a scheme on an unplugged phone.

252
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,800
It was terrifying.

253
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
So that's, that's what's around Knott's Berry farm.

254
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Oh no.

255
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Wow.

256
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,080
If only the Snoopy tuck in was an option for you guys.

257
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,120
Oh man, we didn't even think about it.

258
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
That would have been crazy.

259
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I don't think it was there yet.

260
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
I don't think you could have.

261
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,720
We could have just, we should have just stayed at that hotel.

262
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
I don't know what we were thinking.

263
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,960
We could not stay at the hotel was clearly the move.

264
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,000
More interesting than anything that happened to me in four years of college.

265
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Really?

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,120
I taking acid at Knott's Berry farm, witness an insane man have a phone call to no one

267
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
is, yeah.

268
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,440
I mean, also rides on acid are not.

269
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Is it all more stressful?

270
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,800
Yeah, you, you can smell all the oil and like, and then like it'll go backwards and kind

271
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,520
of leave you where you were.

272
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,080
Your soul stays at the bottom and you go up.

273
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,280
Have I said this in the focus before about how when I'm assigned that I have not been

274
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,160
like, uh, I've been pretty off weed for a while.

275
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,800
And part of it was cause I was watching a lot of movies and realizing I was like seeing

276
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
through to how miserable the set must've been.

277
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,640
I was making me flash past the film and the fun story that's being told to just like,

278
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,320
I'm just seeing the cruddiness and the faking and the general depression of long film shoot

279
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
hours.

280
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Yeah.

281
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,240
And I'm choosing to do this to myself to ruin movies.

282
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,280
Watching like, uh, I just, I watched a beyond the sea that Kevin Spacey movie and I was

283
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,660
like, man, they had to like choreograph this whole number where he's like being Bobby

284
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,440
Darren and people had to like learn this dance.

285
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
21 year old Bobby Darren.

286
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,640
21 year old Bobby Darren with his dyed hair.

287
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,800
And it's like, he's probably harassing everyone on set.

288
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,600
And so, and like, uh, uh, did he direct it too?

289
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Oh yeah.

290
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
And he wrote it.

291
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
There's a child.

292
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Have you not seen it?

293
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I made you watch it, right?

294
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,840
It takes me or were you, was I seeing scenes you were posting on Instagram or vice versa?

295
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Yeah.

296
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
Yeah.

297
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Yeah.

298
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Cause there's the kid version of themselves like Bobby, tell them all about this.

299
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Like, oh yeah.

300
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
He speaks to his child version.

301
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Doesn't he do a dance number with his child version?

302
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
No, I'm not.

303
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
I don't know.

304
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,000
And then you realize he's stupid.

305
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,720
It was just like, that's a whole new level when you know Kevin Spacey is stupid.

306
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,160
Like he's not smart.

307
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,280
He's dumb and he's bad.

308
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
And he's like a bad person who's dumb.

309
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,720
He really terrible taste.

310
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,320
I don't know how like, I mean, we could, I could do it all Kevin Spacey novelties podcast,

311
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,760
but that when he, the, the, the Bobby on the sea in general, when he, uh, sings mind games

312
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,440
in the nine 11, uh, memorial,

313
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,040
You introduced me to that and I watch it like once a year.

314
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,080
We used to watch it in the comedy bang bang writers room.

315
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Oh wow.

316
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Yeah.

317
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Because of you.

318
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Yeah.

319
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
It was like a favorite.

320
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,520
Oh, I'm so glad I found out about it from the Conan writers room because they told a

321
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:32,360
story where he, uh, apparently was like, uh, like I want to sing, uh, I'd like to sing

322
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,880
lady Madonna and they said, well, that's a McCartney song.

323
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,200
And like, ah, God damn it.

324
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Yeah.

325
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Well then I don't know.

326
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Bluebird, blackbird then.

327
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,640
Um, just named another McCartney.

328
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
He like, it was crazy.

329
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
He had no way.

330
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,040
It was an all John Lennon tribute show and he had no idea what was a John Lennon song.

331
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
It was a bonkers.

332
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,440
I like when he has a, that he's wearing that weird, you should post this link.

333
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,800
He is wearing a weird button up shirt, like, like slacks, very like business casual.

334
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Yeah.

335
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Yeah.

336
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Just as like my dad.

337
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,600
And he start comes out and says, he's really pissed off and then he sings mind games with

338
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,200
a full orchestra and he keeps jumping up and down like hitting all the,

339
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,080
We all have to do what we can to restore New York city.

340
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,600
And that includes your host.

341
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
And then he jumps and that's the reveal that he's going to sing.

342
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,720
I could really, that's like a, that's like twice a year at least for me.

343
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,760
And then when he sings a black eyed peas parody at a British sports awards and it's supposed

344
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,800
to be one of those openings where he's like going around the backstage and like fixing

345
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,000
things up and fixing this guy's tie and he takes a basketball and throws it in a hoop

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and he misses.

347
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,280
Did I tell you that in high school I was in love with him?

348
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
What?

349
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,680
I was like deeply crushing out on him.

350
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,560
We won't say who it is, but Jason and I have a good friend who, when I said like, who's

351
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,040
your number one guy, you're crushing Hollywood.

352
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,440
She was like Kevin Spacey.

353
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Oh my God.

354
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Recently?

355
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
No, year, three years ago.

356
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Okay.

357
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
So our, before time.

358
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
After all this stuff came out.

359
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Then she's like now more than ever.

360
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,500
No, but I like, I watched every single movie he was in up to, cause this all was like the

361
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,680
year of usual suspects and swimming with sharks and seven, which was all one year.

362
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,640
And I got hugely crushed out on him and I watched every movie he had ever been into

363
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
that point.

364
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Wow.

365
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
And it was like pre internet.

366
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,080
So I had to like find these things, I had to rent them.

367
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,680
I watched, yeah, I watched rocket Gibraltar.

368
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,920
I watched consenting adults to the erotic thriller he's in with Kevin Klein where he

369
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,200
wife swaps and then murders someone.

370
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
What?

371
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,440
I watched, I mean, he's in one scene in working girl, which I watched.

372
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,280
He's in a, oh man.

373
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,040
You ever see him accepting his MTV movie award for seven.

374
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,360
Oh, I didn't have that recorded as a clip on my computer at all.

375
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Whoa.

376
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Whoa.

377
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
He's wearing a Kangol hat.

378
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Oh God.

379
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Yes he was.

380
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,880
He's wearing like a cool vest and sunglasses he doesn't take off.

381
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
I know.

382
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
So cool.

383
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
I know.

384
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,760
Didn't he have a two season like procedural show?

385
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,680
Uh, yes, it was called, um, wait, he was the bad guy.

386
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I have not heard about that.

387
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
It was called profit.

388
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Yeah.

389
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
Yeah.

390
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
And he was the bad guy on profit.

391
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,720
I couldn't get a, I couldn't get a hold of that one.

392
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Yeah.

393
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
That is on DVD now.

394
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,680
You see it every now and then like walking through a Best Buy.

395
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,680
Yeah.

396
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Like in the TV show section.

397
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,200
Oh, he's the bad guy in See No Evil Hear No Evil with a.

398
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Is he really?

399
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Yeah.

400
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Yes he is.

401
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Like don't, are you really questioning me?

402
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
No I'm not.

403
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
No I'm sure.

404
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Yeah.

405
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
No that's a surprise.

406
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
That's me being delighted.

407
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,240
He's kind of a Boris and Natasha sort of duo.

408
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
He's got a British accent.

409
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
Oh my God.

410
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
And a little pencil thin mustache.

411
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,920
Does he count as theme park entertainment now enough that we could do an episode all

412
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
about Kevin Spacey?

413
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
Is he in the voice?

414
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
He's in Bugs Life, right?

415
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
Yeah.

416
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,920
He doesn't do it in the, in, um, in It's Tough to Be a Bug.

417
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Okay.

418
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
I think maybe Andrew Stanton does the voice.

419
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,760
I think you should do a podcast episode about Kevin Spacey novelties.

420
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,720
It's enough like the Green Goblin and stuff.

421
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,320
Like it's, I think he's theme parky enough at this point.

422
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,320
He, did you see the recent video of him playing La Bamba in the streets with a Spanish band?

423
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
No.

424
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,520
Should we cancel plans and just do this, the Kevin Spacey episode right now?

425
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,160
It feels like we need a lot of prep for this.

426
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Yeah.

427
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
I think we need to.

428
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
Yeah.

429
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Yeah.

430
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
The most delightful prep we could ever do.

431
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,440
I was sad I never could see him in, uh, um, Guys and Dolls.

432
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
What?

433
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Yeah.

434
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,720
He was on Broadway in Guys and Dolls.

435
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Was he Sky or Nathan?

436
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
I think he was Nathan.

437
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
He Sue me, Sue me.

438
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Yeah.

439
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
He couldn't be Sky.

440
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Peter.

441
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
No.

442
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Gallagher?

443
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
Yeah.

444
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
It was like, it was right before the one up.

445
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
It was Peter Gallagher and Nathan Lane were right after him.

446
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Okay.

447
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
But before that he was in, yeah.

448
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,320
I just want to show you a shot from the video.

449
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,880
Oh man.

450
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,200
Joyously holding up an acoustic guitar.

451
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
It's like on the day.

452
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,600
In the way only like non-guitar players hold guitars.

453
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Yeah.

454
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,840
On the day one of his court cases was dismissed, I think.

455
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,200
Not one of the days when one of his accusers ended up dead, which is also something that

456
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
happens.

457
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,560
Are we allowed to laugh about him when things like that are happening?

458
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
He's a vile creature.

459
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Yeah.

460
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,640
Check out the second gate episode on Let Me Be Frank.

461
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Yeah.

462
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Even that.

463
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,440
It's, all right, we're doing it.

464
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
We're doing it.

465
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,400
Prespa, you'll come back if you're down and we'll, let's talk spacey.

466
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,160
I used to have a shrine like my friend made for me as a joke, but I kept it like until

467
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
like a year ago.

468
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,640
It was like a wooden shrine with his photo on it.

469
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Oh man.

470
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
I was so confused, you guys.

471
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,040
I was really confused.

472
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
This is where you're, I know.

473
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,200
And then for all that to happen, like what that does to your psyche.

474
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,000
By then, I mean, K-Pax started the slide and I was like, oh, he's done.

475
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,280
I remember being, I saw K-Pax opening weekend because everyone, spacey fever, with usual

476
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,160
suspects and American beauty.

477
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Yeah.

478
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Everyone was jacked.

479
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,640
He burned all his American beauty goodwill making Beyond the Sea.

480
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
Uh-huh.

481
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,160
And America could not have cared less.

482
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,240
And also what's that one with Haley Joel Osment where it's about pay it forward.

483
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,640
Where he like we're ups his shirt open and shows like his, his burn scars to Helen Hunt.

484
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,960
If you like, cause it's, it's, he does this, you would love, okay.

485
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,440
She like, what's, there's something up with her in that too.

486
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,800
She's just like heavily tan.

487
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,960
She's heavily tan.

488
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,440
He does a monologue about a stepdad lighting on fire, which is, it's going to go in the

489
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
novelties episode.

490
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Oh my God.

491
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,320
And I thought, why would water smell so bad?

492
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,760
Why would water smell so bad?

493
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:36,400
And I looked up and he was holding a red gas can and then he lit a match.

494
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
So the Mickey and Friends triplet area.

495
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
This is coming up.

496
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
We will do this.

497
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
We will do this.

498
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
All right.

499
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
I can't wait for that episode.

500
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Okay.

501
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
2001.

502
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Oh boy.

503
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Mickey and Friends.

504
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Mickey and Friends.

505
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Oh no.

506
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,080
I'm just going to be staring out the window thinking about that episode the whole time.

507
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,600
We talked about the, we've already talked about that garage.

508
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,440
And we got to talk about the tram loading.

509
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,240
This is where the payoff is.

510
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,160
This is where the tram lets you off.

511
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,440
This is, here's my problem with talking about it is that I sort of have to reveal a little

512
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,800
bit about my feelings on the new parking structure because the parking structure shows a better

513
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,480
way to do certain things.

514
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,640
The parking structure is outside of the confines.

515
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,200
We're not, until there's permission given, we can't go assuming we can do the parking

516
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
structure.

517
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Okay.

518
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
So, all right, fair.

519
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,680
Let me then hypothesize of a better way to make it so that it's not just this big mass

520
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,480
of people and there's a little bit uncertainty of who's going to get on the tram because

521
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
when there's that big group at the end of the night, you're fighting with teens, you're

522
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
fighting with families.

523
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Just hoof it, man.

524
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Yeah.

525
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Which is what we do a lot of the time.

526
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
But if I'm reviewing this experience.

527
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Much better option usually.

528
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,360
Kind of kid with you then you have to go on the tram.

529
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,280
Single file rows is all I'm going to say.

530
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Wouldn't that be better?

531
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,720
Isn't that how you board the tram at Universal?

532
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
Isn't that like a little more clear who's getting on the tram at Universal?

533
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Oh, the tram tour tram?

534
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Yeah.

535
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Yeah, there's stars and the system.

536
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Yeah.

537
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
It's like a ride.

538
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,560
It's a single file line and they just load you in.

539
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Yeah.

540
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Yeah.

541
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,000
That mass where you feel like you got cheated, like I should have been first, but somebody

542
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,680
kind of veered in front of me.

543
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Some pushy mom.

544
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Oof.

545
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
You know.

546
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
Get it.

547
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,600
It's just a little, because you see those groups and it's just very intimidating.

548
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,760
It doesn't look good.

549
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,360
It looks like just a big mob.

550
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,760
And it's so, yeah, when you're leaving the park and you see all that, like, oh God, we

551
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,600
got like another mile to go then I guess we got to walk in.

552
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Yeah.

553
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Yeah.

554
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,280
My only note for this thing is I'm bummed when I have to be there.

555
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Yes.

556
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Leaving.

557
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,400
If I arrive, then I'm happy for all the fun that's in store.

558
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,480
But like, yeah, I don't wait to leave in that area very often.

559
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
No.

560
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,360
I always think the only thing that makes me think is like, do I like La Brea bakery?

561
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
We weren't sure either.

562
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Yeah.

563
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
I'm like looking at it.

564
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
I'm like, do I want that?

565
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,800
Do I want to just go in the park and get something?

566
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Yeah.

567
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
We said it's fine.

568
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
It's fine.

569
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,520
We declared do a drinking game with this podcast series when we call things fine.

570
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Fine.

571
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Okay.

572
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
All right.

573
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Yeah.

574
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
It's fine.

575
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
It's fine.

576
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
I don't think the tram is fine.

577
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
I think it's bad.

578
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
Yeah.

579
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,240
Again, I don't want to talk about the other side of the tram, but the other one is a little

580
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
better.

581
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
There's rows.

582
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
It's a row.

583
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
There's no rows now.

584
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
So I'm not, I'm pro that side.

585
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,240
This side is chaos.

586
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
But this side is chaos.

587
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
It's a little bit chaos.

588
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
I like all the plants.

589
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm always in favor of more plants.

590
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,400
More plants for sure.

591
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Yeah.

592
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,200
It's just mentally soothing.

593
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,840
Water features and plants are help keep people from going insane in these massive crowded

594
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
spaces.

595
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,480
I think that's very true.

596
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,680
That's nice.

597
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
So there's that.

598
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Water features and plants.

599
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
Great.

600
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
Is that it?

601
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
California churro cart?

602
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
California churro cart.

603
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
You did it.

604
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,160
I got a rose gold churro.

605
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Huh.

606
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Oh, interesting.

607
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Lightly strawberry flavored.

608
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
What'd you think?

609
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,920
A little, you know, it's warm, which is always a plus for a pastry.

610
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,440
I feel like I've, I don't have a strong opinion on churros one way or the other.

611
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,080
I think if they, I had a fresh one, like out of the oil.

612
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Yeah.

613
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,120
I think it would be incredible, but usually they're just sitting there all day and they

614
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,680
always taste a little stale.

615
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,320
Even if they're like the best churro, even the best churro in the world is just like

616
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
fine.

617
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
Inherent fine.

618
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Oh no, I'm sorry.

619
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
No, it's good.

620
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
No, keep it in mind.

621
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,480
This is also, I think the start of like a weird feature of downtown Disney.

622
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:34,560
These little kiosks of like, well, it's not a Disney churro and it's not a Disney hot

623
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
dog.

624
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
It's a diggity dog.

625
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,920
It's a diggity dog.

626
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,320
It's a lady trying to sell you Disney vacation club.

627
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Oh yeah.

628
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
And then it's like.

629
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Is that over here too?

630
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Should we be talking about that?

631
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
The vacation club?

632
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,320
There is a kiosk.

633
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Yeah.

634
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Yeah.

635
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
For vacation club.

636
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Did you, did anyone here belong to the vacation club?

637
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
I did.

638
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Jason.

639
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
How was it?

640
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,120
Are you, did you, I mean, you guys were like a hardcore Disney family, huh?

641
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:03,160
Uh, yeah, we, I mean, we were in it from like 95 to 2000 and I always joke, well, that

642
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,800
was the first thing going into divorce.

643
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,080
That was the first thing to fund the lawyer.

644
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,240
Uh, uh, but we, I mean, we had a lot of fun.

645
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,960
So it did let us go.

646
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,740
I think we went a handful of times.

647
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,560
There was a run in there where we, we went every summer.

648
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Right.

649
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
We went every year.

650
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
And then.

651
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
We go for like two weeks?

652
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,640
Only one time did we go for two weeks.

653
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Okay.

654
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
And that is, that was a trip.

655
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,000
Like that was like not leaving Disney world for two weeks.

656
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I mean, we went to Universal.

657
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We went to Sea World.

658
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,400
We went to like, yeah, we broke it up a little bit theme park theme park guy who was doing

659
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,600
a job at Orlando last time I was in Orlando.

660
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,720
So it was more than 10 years ago, but, um, he was shooting something there and I went

661
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,920
along and we stayed in one of those condos for the Disney vacation club and they were

662
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
wild.

663
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,080
Like they were, they had a kitchen and they were like, we would cook hot breakfast and

664
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
stuff.

665
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,080
That's nice.

666
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
It was nice.

667
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
Yeah.

668
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
It was nice.

669
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,400
And then we went for a week and got like a one bedroom, but it's essentially a one bedroom

670
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
apartment.

671
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
So that's cool.

672
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,560
And it was also like, now I think it's a little more unwieldy cost wise.

673
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,360
Like in the nineties, it just was like, Oh, this makes financial sense if you're going

674
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,960
to go even up like every other year.

675
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,920
And cause you could also, Oh, one thing we would do is we would get an annual, like I

676
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,560
was a Disney world annual pass holder for a little while.

677
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,560
It was like, well, if we come back next year in less than 12 months, we don't have to buy

678
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
tickets again.

679
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,200
They have a pretty sweet annual pass deal right now for SoCal residents.

680
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
I was eyeing it.

681
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,640
I was like, that looks good.

682
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
The $600 one.

683
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,680
No, it's like 20 bucks a month.

684
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Is that it?

685
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
Really?

686
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
That's what it said.

687
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,120
I'm in pack pass flux at the moment and I'm needing to decide my next situation.

688
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,600
Look into this one.

689
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,840
I almost bought one when I was there.

690
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,720
It was low price by then.

691
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,080
I just bought the day ticket.

692
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
She was stupid.

693
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:09,120
They are, I keep getting hotel offers for Disneyland and they're not super, they're

694
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
still not cheap enough.

695
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,400
They're very expensive still.

696
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,680
It's still very expensive, but like they're scrambling because they, uh, there's plenty

697
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,960
of great stuff about galaxy's edge, but they set their expectations too high.

698
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,720
So on the spreadsheets, they did not meet their financial goal or their guest number

699
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,400
goal because they set it too high.

700
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,440
So now they're like, Oh, what do we do?

701
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,680
And I spent too much money on the Honda elite.

702
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
That's sitting on.

703
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Yeah.

704
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Yeah.

705
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,520
I got an email today from the Disney vacation club person I met with a few months ago.

706
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Oh yeah.

707
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,280
Cause you sat through a seminar.

708
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,560
I sat through a full seminar to get four free fast passes.

709
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,920
And a Diet Coke.

710
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,160
You willing, he willingly went and sat through a presentation.

711
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
Yeah.

712
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,160
Yeah.

713
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,160
I got four fast passes.

714
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,000
And he goes on all these rides once a week.

715
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah.

716
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,520
It's a rare opportunity to get to go on Indiana Jones.

717
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
I also wanted to know.

718
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,280
You get snacks and you get to see sample hotel rooms.

719
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
That's fine.

720
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,960
And I'm a theme park journalist.

721
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,960
So I knew this was part of my job.

722
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,280
I mean, I want to go to Disney sea and I want to go to Hong Kong and stuff.

723
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,600
It makes, I mean, yeah, it makes sense.

724
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
It makes sense to do it.

725
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,400
If you're going to take like high level hotel vacations every year.

726
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Right.

727
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,040
But they had, then you have to go to a Disney property.

728
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
You don't.

729
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
They have partners.

730
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
They have partners.

731
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,800
It seems like you learned a lot during this presentation.

732
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
I don't want to bore everyone.

733
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,520
The other thing is that they don't really push.

734
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
There's an aftermarket.

735
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,320
So you can buy people's points because it is a time share.

736
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,800
So Disney can only regulate it so much.

737
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,080
There's federal timeshare laws.

738
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Okay.

739
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,920
So you can go to third party point sellers and buy points to use to stay at a Disney

740
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,800
property for cheaper than you would booking directly.

741
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,820
There's a whole secret sort of thing.

742
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,720
They don't like to tell you to about it where it's like Disney will buy it back.

743
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,680
They have right of first refusal essentially on your property.

744
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,600
If you want to get out of it, you have to offer it to Disney first.

745
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Right.

746
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
They won't necessarily take it.

747
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
It's like a first look deal.

748
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Yes.

749
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Talk about this on your Facebook group.

750
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,320
Shout out to the Facebook group.

751
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
Yeah.

752
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Yeah.

753
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,440
It's like the dues are like 28,000, you have to pay like $28,000 or something or maybe

754
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
$20,000.

755
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
A year?

756
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
No, no.

757
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
For like one time fee.

758
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
Yeah.

759
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
The one time fee.

760
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
And then yearly like $800.

761
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
You buy the points.

762
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
It's like.

763
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
Yes.

764
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
So it's like.

765
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
I'm so stressed out just hearing that part.

766
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,960
In 20 years, it's like a good deal if you keep it.

767
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Yeah.

768
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Well, it's like.

769
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
You can describe that way.

770
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
It can be good.

771
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,320
Well, it's the idea being like it is an investment.

772
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,520
It's essentially a vacation home that you pass down to your through your family.

773
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
Right.

774
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
And everyone gets a home resort.

775
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,520
Yes.

776
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,680
And that's how they're starting to screw people is like you your home resort.

777
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,080
If you didn't get in before a certain date, if you want to stay at the newer ones, that

778
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,700
has to be your home resort.

779
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,920
You can't use points for it.

780
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
Yeah.

781
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
But that.

782
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
Or some perks.

783
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
It's very.

784
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
I'm joining.

785
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
I'm going to do it.

786
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
You didn't even need to.

787
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,520
You did the last passes.

788
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Just give it to me.

789
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,400
I have the email of the gentleman I talked to.

790
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Oh, man.

791
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,280
I get the DVDs.

792
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,240
How long were you occupied by this presentation?

793
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,880
An hour and 15 minutes.

794
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,280
Here's the thing that is one of my biggest mistakes with the presentation.

795
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,960
At the end, he goes, do you need a ride anywhere?

796
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,320
And I said, what do you mean?

797
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,640
And he's like, like back to the parks or to a hotel.

798
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,160
And I was like, oh, no, no, I'm good.

799
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,200
I go, well, do people get rides places?

800
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,720
He goes, yeah, we can give you a ride anywhere you want.

801
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,000
I go, well, where does the where does it go?

802
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Where do I?

803
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,320
Because it's over by the Disneyland Hotel.

804
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,680
And he's like, yeah, just like in the back, the back area.

805
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
And I should have.

806
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
I didn't know.

807
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
I don't know why.

808
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
Yeah.

809
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,120
I think I would have been able to take a golf cart backstage.

810
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
Yeah.

811
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
I screwed up.

812
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
I really screwed up.

813
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
I'll take it.

814
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
That's a lot better.

815
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
I'll take it.

816
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Do those pass?

817
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,360
You can't take the golf cart ride until 20 years from now.

818
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,760
And he can buy it back from you.

819
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,760
All right.

820
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
So Jason, I'll go down.

821
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
You'll go do the presentation.

822
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
You'll be my guest.

823
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
You know, you can come along.

824
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
You'd be my guest.

825
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
That's a good point.

826
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
I'll be your guest.

827
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
He's my brother.

828
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
He's my big brother.

829
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
We don't even have to go that far.

830
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
We don't have to go that far.

831
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Oh, no, I like to have a narrative, so I have a character going in.

832
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
You could just be friend.

833
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
I love it.

834
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,320
I think it's better for my motivation if you play my big brother and we can make a joke

835
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
about how tall you are.

836
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Guys, just be married.

837
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
It's OK.

838
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Be married.

839
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
All right.

840
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
Fine.

841
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
Married and proud.

842
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Pamphlets.

843
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
OK, so I.

844
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
Religious.

845
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
We should wait.

846
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
We should explain this.

847
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
OK.

848
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,400
If you're going to downtown Disney, then why are you?

849
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,880
How are you getting through any of this?

850
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,200
And second of all, you there is an area that's pretty like undecorated.

851
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
That's just like Ivy, essentially.

852
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,780
And one of the only things that's there besides the sporadic treat cart is just a table and

853
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,160
chairs where Jehovah's Witnesses usually.

854
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
But I think there are some others.

855
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,720
But we tend to see Jehovah's Witnesses passing out pamphlets.

856
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,560
It's very odd to see in a Disney environment.

857
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Yes.

858
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,400
And you can see the park from the table where they are.

859
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Yeah.

860
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Yeah.

861
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Yeah.

862
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
You're like very close by then.

863
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Yeah.

864
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
And just the New Testament.

865
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
Not full Bibles.

866
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,200
Usually book copies of the New Testament and like pretty thin booklets.

867
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Yeah.

868
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,600
And such that you can take on the go and that, you know, door to door people can take on

869
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
the go.

870
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:37,680
Also, too, when I walked up, it was two ladies in very, very like overdressed, not overdressed,

871
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,920
but like religious clothing, long sleeves, big skirts, umbrellas to shield themselves

872
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
from the sun.

873
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
It's hot.

874
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
It was hot outside.

875
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Yes.

876
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Yeah.

877
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Yeah.

878
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
It's been a very hot summer.

879
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
Yeah.

880
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
And they were, yeah.

881
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,160
And they just sit there and panned out what I got, which is a copy of The Watchtower announcing

882
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
Jehovah's Kingdom.

883
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,640
It's the magazine of the Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints.

884
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
Okay.

885
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,160
It's very thin, what you're looking at.

886
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,200
This takes me back to church, like the thin ass bulletins that I would grab on the way

887
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
out.

888
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
They're different.

889
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
The Latter-day Saints is Mormons.

890
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,200
This is Jehovah's Witnesses.

891
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I see.

892
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
It's not bad.

893
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,840
Anyway, I'll just describe this magazine.

894
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,320
I read all of it when I was eating at my restaurant in the sector.

895
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
Wow.

896
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,200
You really did it all on top of each other.

897
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,360
I did.

898
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,840
So the cover just says, is this life all there is?

899
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,520
And it's a man standing in a graveyard.

900
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,000
And then the table of contents is the sad reality of death, the search for a long life.

901
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We are designed to live.

902
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
Why do we grow old and die?

903
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,280
Conquering the enemy death, dot dot dot.

904
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
How?

905
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,840
How can you have more than this life?

906
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,440
Making the most of life today.

907
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,520
What hope for the dead?

908
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:52,280
And then the sad reality of death is just like, this is just a paragraph.

909
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,440
Imagine yourself watching a video about a celebrity, perhaps a famous musician who you

910
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
admire.

911
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,920
It starts with scenes of her childhood, her music lessons, and her endless practice.

912
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,280
Then you see her performing in concerts, traveling far and wide, becoming an international celebrity.

913
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,160
For a long time, images of her golden years.

914
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,760
And finally, as the video ends, she dies.

915
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,960
And so just about how everyone dies.

916
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Oh my God.

917
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:21,120
This, by the way, is steps away from a store where you can buy a mini merchandise that

918
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,000
says rock the dots.

919
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,400
And she's, you know, she's clad in polka dots.

920
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,720
And you can read about the death of a hypothetical pop star from your feet away.

921
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,240
The anxiety of death in this thing is wild.

922
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,320
It's like the death is our enemy.

923
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,680
We cannot, we can't not die.

924
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,720
And we're going to get, we're going to suffer and die.

925
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,440
This is a hell of a way for me to find out in the middle of a, a mall series.

926
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,280
I know a man who rocked dots, two dots in his hands.

927
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
For our sins.

928
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,800
You'd be better at this table than the ladies.

929
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,280
Tie it into the environment.

930
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Yeah.

931
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,400
So I looked into this a little and there's really not a lot online.

932
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,040
I reached out to a reporter friend and said, do you know anything about, do you know why

933
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
this is here?

934
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,480
And he's like, no, that's a good, I've never looked into that.

935
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,440
But all I could find was people complaining about it on Reddit.

936
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,880
I thought I'd find like an OC register article, but it seems to be, cause they see every now

937
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,240
and then they're at city walk too.

938
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,200
And I think it is, and I think the city of Anaheim ruled they can be there.

939
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,200
And I think it has to deal with public private spaces, privately owned property that still

940
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,960
acts as a public area, like a mall or something like that.

941
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Yeah.

942
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
I've seen street performers at downtown Disney.

943
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,560
I once saw a guy playing a wild electric hammered dulcimer in the middle of downtown Disney

944
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,160
and remind me what a dulcimer is.

945
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,560
It's like a, a, it's like a bunch of strings.

946
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,320
It's almost like a zither or something, but you hit it with a hammer.

947
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,760
It's like a old school instrument and he had like, he had CDs for sale and stuff.

948
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Yeah.

949
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,600
So I think as long as you fill out the proper application and I don't know if you have to

950
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:10,240
pay Disney like, so they can't reject because that was my question where it's like what

951
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,440
Disney wants to be so neutral on everything, right?

952
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,000
But is it like, just because they have open submissions for you to sell or street perform

953
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,720
they have to allow religious, I think they can restrict content a little in terms of

954
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,960
family appropriateness.

955
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,520
But I am wondering like where the religious freedom like constitutionally they can because

956
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,080
there's no Scientologist.

957
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
Right.

958
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,040
And there's no like Hare Krishna.

959
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
No.

960
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Falun Gong.

961
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Yeah.

962
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Falun Gong.

963
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Yeah.

964
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Yeah.

965
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,080
No like really weird, like crazy graphic bloody signs that make me mad when I see them.

966
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,600
And they also, they do that.

967
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,880
The dance show is them.

968
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
I went to it.

969
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,880
Oh, you, oh, right.

970
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
Shen Yun.

971
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Shen Yun.

972
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Oh yes.

973
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Shen Yun.

974
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,480
And they also, they also, they publish the Epoch Times, which is the sells more ads for

975
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,640
Donald Trump on Facebook than any other organization.

976
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,360
Because they think that Trump will get rid of the Chinese government or help them be

977
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,240
free of the Chinese government, which he doesn't care.

978
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,960
But if you go to the show really quick, there's dancing and then all of a sudden they come

979
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,080
out and lecture you about Falun Gong and then they do a dance number about a girl whose

980
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,080
eyes gets gouged out by the government.

981
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:28,640
And then eventually later in the show they do a number about like people looking at their

982
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,000
phones and two guys are looking at their phones and they start holding hands.

983
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,040
They become gay from their phones, from technology.

984
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,360
There's also an opera singer who comes out and sings a whole like opera song, which translated

985
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,400
about how technology rots the soul.

986
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
And then- Holy shit.

987
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,360
Can you like- Why do they, the billboards just make it look like there's like one person

988
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
jumping.

989
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
This is a lot more interesting.

990
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Yeah.

991
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
Four people go.

992
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,020
And then there's like Billy and Jason Willner and the audience was just like at the Dorothy

993
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,520
Channel Pavilion, all just confused old people that did not know what was, it was so weird.

994
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
And yeah.

995
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,780
And the thing at the end is like, it's, they're all gay from their phones.

996
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:11,040
And then a giant wave with Karl Marx's face comes up and destroys the earth.

997
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
It like drowns them all.

998
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
What?

999
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Wow.

1000
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
How is that conveyed?

1001
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,880
There's a giant like video screen behind them that they claim to have patented this

1002
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,360
technology and it like, it just crashes up.

1003
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,240
It's a tidal wave and it washes the earth clean.

1004
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,560
And then- A lot happened in 5,000 years of civilization.

1005
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,560
Yeah.

1006
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Their motto.

1007
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,440
If this is an innovative screen, I feel like we need to renew it.

1008
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Theme parks.

1009
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,800
Anyway, you guys should go to Shenyang or maybe don't go because they, they are crazy.

1010
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
Maybe just- It's a cult.

1011
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Afraid?

1012
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Yes.

1013
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
I'll do it.

1014
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,760
Next time they come through, you should see it.

1015
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,680
And then the next episode is you guys, or you trying to convince us-

1016
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,840
Also the Chinese- To join their vacation club?

1017
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:00,520
There's always- Bank of America flags your visa for buying Kevin Spacey and Shen Yun material

1018
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,320
in one week.

1019
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,040
I bought these coasters that say, I love Shenyang.

1020
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,600
And my fiance was like, what the fuck is, what are you doing?

1021
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
I came home with them.

1022
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,400
He was like, why do you have this?

1023
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
You're being tracked now.

1024
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,640
I know where those things are going.

1025
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,360
There's three companies or four maybe doing a Shenyang show at any time somewhere on earth.

1026
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Wow, really?

1027
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,560
And the Chinese government follows them around and like slashes their tires on their vans.

1028
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
It's crazy.

1029
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,520
You can see that happen if you wait it around.

1030
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Yeah.

1031
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
They get harassed.

1032
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
Whoa.

1033
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
Jeez.

1034
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Okay.

1035
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Okay, sorry.

1036
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
So Disney- They're not there.

1037
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,280
Well, Disney's not going to allow that because Disney has business with China to do.

1038
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Yeah.

1039
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
So they aren't going to allow.

1040
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,840
Well, I think it's interesting too that like the part of the Jehovah's Witness thing is

1041
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,280
like you don't get birthdays, you don't get holidays.

1042
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,040
If you knew a Jehovah's Witness growing up, they don't celebrate their birthday.

1043
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,880
They don't do celebrations.

1044
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,600
Prince didn't believe in birthdays.

1045
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Yeah.

1046
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Oh.

1047
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,640
But I've seen- Wait, before he got religious though, I've seen the band lead a happy birthday

1048
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
to him.

1049
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Not after though.

1050
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,360
Not by like 95 or whatever.

1051
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,360
So then you're not allowed so they don't get, you can't trick or treat at their house on

1052
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,960
Halloween, all that shit.

1053
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,360
But are they allowed to go to Disneyland?

1054
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
That's a good question.

1055
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,360
I don't know.

1056
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
You can sit outside of it with a bowling table.

1057
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,760
Has anyone ever walked out of Disneyland, met those ladies and gone like, well, that's

1058
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
it for me.

1059
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,000
Like, this is my new thing now.

1060
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,640
Kids, we're Jehovah's Witnesses now.

1061
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,160
It's only the line at Space Mountain had been shorter.

1062
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,760
That's like the Comic-Con people that protest outside of like no false idols.

1063
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,040
And you're like, is there one single person that like walked out of Comic-Con and went,

1064
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,720
whoa, you're right.

1065
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,560
And then like they were just- Jesus, the original Batman.

1066
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Yes.

1067
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
They're right.

1068
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,520
He is like Bruce Wayne.

1069
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,960
Any comic characters came back from the dead.

1070
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,800
His parents were murdered in front of him.

1071
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Yikes.

1072
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:58,040
Oh, the other thing I read about the Jehovah's Witnesses at the table, they're not allowed

1073
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,240
to approach people or talk to people unless you approach them first.

1074
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,240
Oh, I talked to them.

1075
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
Yes.

1076
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
So you were allowed.

1077
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
Wow.

1078
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Yeah.

1079
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
How'd they go?

1080
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
How'd they seem?

1081
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
They were nice.

1082
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,160
I talked to them, I think their name was Bethany and I asked her what her name was and I said,

1083
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
how's it going?

1084
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,160
Bethany.

1085
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
I was like, can I have this?

1086
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
She's like, oh yes.

1087
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,960
And ask me, tell me if you have any questions and we're just spreading the word.

1088
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960
And I was like, cool.

1089
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,760
There's one interesting thing in this death magazine that if you go to JW.org, they'll

1090
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,120
come to your house and give you a Bible study.

1091
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
You can like-

1092
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,760
Did you arrange for that right now?

1093
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
In here?

1094
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Come on in Bethany.

1095
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
They're here.

1096
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
Wouldn't that be a surprise?

1097
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
They're all named Bethany.

1098
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,760
It would be so fun if they just showed up right now.

1099
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,840
Honestly, I would be delighted by that.

1100
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
Yeah.

1101
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,000
That we just, that's an hour of the Bible study.

1102
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,240
Get them on mic, get three other mics out.

1103
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
Yeah.

1104
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,960
So just so you know, if you are looking around, I also texted Scott, I was like, I can't find

1105
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
these pamphlets.

1106
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,960
Oh yeah, that was fun.

1107
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,960
It was like, ooh, this is going to be a fun episode.

1108
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,040
Even making a point of finding the pamphlets.

1109
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:12,040
I got a little book, more of a tiny little book called The Secret of Family Happiness.

1110
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,480
I got two bookmarks in it.

1111
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,160
So with some passages I want to read.

1112
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
It is from 1996.

1113
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,680
It is a family that looks disturbingly similar to my own.

1114
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,680
Oh nice.

1115
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:31,600
In you know, members, genders and floral button dresses.

1116
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,400
So this is a bit of a, it's a bit of a flashback for me.

1117
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,800
Let me see what I wanted to mark.

1118
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Oh right.

1119
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
It's been the caretaker.

1120
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,600
I, well, I didn't have time to read the whole thing.

1121
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
There's a lot of pages.

1122
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,400
This is 185 pages.

1123
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,960
I just skimmed through it to find the word sex and I found it a couple of times.

1124
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,960
God's view of sex.

1125
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,120
Let's see.

1126
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:04,320
The law frankly mentioned a number of sexual matters including menstruation, seminal emissions,

1127
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,720
fornication, adultery, homosexuality, incest and bestiality.

1128
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,240
Those last three of course all fit together.

1129
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
Homosexuality, incest and bestiality.

1130
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
Pretty much the same thing.

1131
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,240
Yeah, pretty much.

1132
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,240
That's a real 1996 religious attitude.

1133
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
It's been crazy.

1134
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,720
Looking back, don't you guys think it's odd how like now that we, now that the slippery

1135
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,800
slope has happened and we allowed gay marriage, just how many of our friends are married to

1136
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,080
the donkeys and the electric fans.

1137
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,880
It's just, it's all other world.

1138
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,040
I was then curious about the one that, I guess I know the word fornication, but I was never

1139
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,560
sure of the exact definition and elsewhere in the book.

1140
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,440
I looked at the like Amazon listing of this that pulled out some notable quotes and they

1141
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,280
say, in the eyes of Jehovah God, living together consensually without the benefit of marriage

1142
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,360
is fornication.

1143
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,400
So we're in a house of fornication as we speak.

1144
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
Uh oh.

1145
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,840
Mike, I know she's, I know your girlfriend's coming on tomorrow, but maybe you should consider

1146
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,840
marrying her before then.

1147
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Yes.

1148
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
Before the episode.

1149
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,840
Maybe on the episode.

1150
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
Yes, that's fair.

1151
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,200
Plus you've got that horned up dog of yours.

1152
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,360
Oh, bestiality.

1153
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:27,600
That's true, the dog humps my leg and that is I am sinning because I'm allowing it.

1154
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
I think so.

1155
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
Is that right?

1156
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
She's shameful.

1157
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,600
And a chick deuteronomy to be sure.

1158
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,080
Because you have a messenger, there's a prince poster looking at us.

1159
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,960
In front, there's always a witness staring at the dog humping your leg.

1160
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Yeah.

1161
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,960
How dare you.

1162
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,960
He's a Jehovah's witness.

1163
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
And it's a room of false idols.

1164
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,960
Yes.

1165
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,960
Batman.

1166
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,960
Leonardo.

1167
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,960
The hat box ghost.

1168
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,960
The hat box ghost.

1169
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
Ooh.

1170
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,680
The cookie, the dog, the chef from Hong Kong.

1171
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,680
Cookie from Hong Kong.

1172
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,680
The hat box ghost.

1173
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,680
Our Dr. T.J.

1174
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,080
Echolberg looking down on us.

1175
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,080
Judging.

1176
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,080
Went over my head with that one.

1177
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:11,200
The eyes and the great cat's feet.

1178
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,160
Maybe if you did a little, I think you should do a little reading of that book and read another

1179
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,160
book called The Secret of Family.

1180
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,120
I was hoping when you said religious pamphlets, that would be Jack Chick pamphlets.

1181
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,840
Do you guys remember Jack Chick pamphlets?

1182
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
Oh, sure.

1183
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
No.

1184
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,520
Oh, there are these little comic books that this lunatic made by himself for like 40 years.

1185
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,760
He died recently, but they're like little rectangular pamphlets and he's got his own

1186
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,560
weird take on everything.

1187
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,960
And he would update them.

1188
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,960
Like he would, you know, he did one on how Harry Potter's a warlock, but they're just,

1189
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,960
they're crazy.

1190
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,880
Like there'll just be a, there's a really good one where it's like a rock band that's, that

1191
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,880
signs a contract with Satan.

1192
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,360
And then he's like, I've got a, I've got a gift for you guys now, some aids.

1193
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,440
And so he gives them aids and then they, uh, there he is.

1194
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,440
Yeah.

1195
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,640
Never really evolved though past like the EC horror like style of art.

1196
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,640
Yeah.

1197
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,200
He always drew, he drew them, them the same forever.

1198
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,920
But uh, here's one just of the devil saying you were wrong.

1199
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,200
You didn't accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior.

1200
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,200
Yeah.

1201
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,920
He, it's always this like, I, I one time in college bought the full collection.

1202
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,520
It was like $20 and I had like 150 chick comics and they were all the same.

1203
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,560
And I immediately got really boring, but I was at the Albuquerque international sun port,

1204
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,920
which they call the airport.

1205
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,120
Uh, and I found one underneath a chair and I got really excited and I read the whole

1206
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,120
thing and then I put it back where I found it.

1207
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,360
And I was like, Oh, some kid's going to find this and it's going to blow their mind.

1208
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,760
Like I did when I was 14 and found one, I was like, what the fuck is this?

1209
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,360
And I showed all my friends.

1210
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,480
I used to find them every now and then and laugh and they're so fun.

1211
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,240
But then I think my little brother, like one of his classmates was like passing them out

1212
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
at school, sincerely.

1213
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,120
And he was like, what, what are you doing?

1214
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,120
Oh my God.

1215
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,120
Yeah.

1216
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,640
I guess they could make you Christian or something, which would be bad.

1217
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,120
Anyway, that's what I was hoping for.

1218
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,760
But instead I got this death obsessed watch tower.

1219
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:08,200
I have one more little passage, which is a, it's a, uh, it's basically about how, if you

1220
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:16,840
are a single parent, a widow or a divorcee that you should not partake in sexual activities.

1221
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:25,160
You should not experience the joy of sex if you've lost a spouse or gotten a divorce.

1222
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,160
Not for you.

1223
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,280
And it gives you a guide of how to get through that.

1224
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,560
This isn't even a quote from the Bible.

1225
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,960
It's just a Christian man said who?

1226
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,880
It could be somebody who like bailed on it the next year or killed themselves.

1227
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,960
Or Trevor said sexual urges are very strong, but you can control them.

1228
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,000
When a thought comes in your mind, you must not dwell on it.

1229
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,080
You have to get rid of it.

1230
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,760
It also helps to think of your child.

1231
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,560
Oh, that's good.

1232
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,720
So the next time you're sad about your divorce and trying to have sex with somebody, think

1233
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,400
of your child instead.

1234
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,280
Don't cross those wires.

1235
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,720
Yeah, I know.

1236
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,720
Yes.

1237
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,040
What a horrible moment there you're creating.

1238
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,120
Also, if you were trying to deaden your appetite for food, would you read magazines featuring

1239
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:11,080
pictures of delicious foods or would you associate with people who constantly talked about food?

1240
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,080
Hardly.

1241
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,560
The same is true concerning fleshly desires.

1242
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,160
So you don't look at porn.

1243
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,200
Yeah, I guess so.

1244
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,200
Just like Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition.

1245
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,240
Don't watch the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

1246
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,720
Those delicious shows.

1247
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,200
Don't watch Baywatch.

1248
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Oh, Scott.

1249
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
Hey, no, stay away from Baywatch.

1250
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,200
You're trying to dampen your appetite.

1251
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,880
How have you watched that delicious show?

1252
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,120
Everything you are describing is pretty much as a 12 year old Christian.

1253
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,320
This is my...

1254
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Do you think...

1255
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
That was all porn to me.

1256
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
The most innocent.

1257
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,000
Your epic rewatch of Baywatch that's going on right now.

1258
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Oh yeah, it's going to blast.

1259
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,480
Do you think there's something in the back of your mind that's like, I'm getting away

1260
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,480
with it finally?

1261
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,480
You weren't allowed.

1262
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,480
Like, this is my Christian rebellion.

1263
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,480
Yeah, a little bit.

1264
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,480
At last.

1265
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,920
Well, there's still morality lessons within it.

1266
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,920
Okay.

1267
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,920
Although, wait, no, they deter...

1268
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,360
Don't swim between the red flags.

1269
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:14,680
I had very lax parents and probably full access to pornography or whatever.

1270
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:20,360
And I spent all that time watching the Gary Glen Ross scenes with Kevin Spacey in them.

1271
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,400
Being like, this is my guy right here.

1272
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
I don't know.

1273
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,400
Maybe he should have chosen porn.

1274
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,360
The ref, his part where he destroys the Christmas tree and the ref with the fire poker because

1275
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,040
Judy Davis is telling the story wrong and everyone's fighting.

1276
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,720
So many wasted hours of my life.

1277
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,240
It's so weird.

1278
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,880
If we lined up all of your ex-boyfriends, are they all sort of like Spacey types?

1279
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,880
No.

1280
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,880
Not at all.

1281
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,880
That's too bad.

1282
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,880
If only, like, wait a minute.

1283
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,880
I was needed a captain of all the teams.

1284
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,880
Wow, really?

1285
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,880
All the teams?

1286
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,880
Yeah.

1287
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,880
Like, cross and soccer.

1288
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,880
Wow.

1289
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,880
Pretty good.

1290
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,880
We didn't have football.

1291
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,880
I went to a hippie school, but I was dating Nick O'Donkers, the captain of the teams,

1292
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,280
and I was lecturing him about Kevin Spacey movies.

1293
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,280
Oh my gosh.

1294
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,280
That's wild.

1295
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,280
Go on, hustle, O'Donkers.

1296
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,280
You got to get caught up on the show.

1297
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,120
You got to get caught up on profit.

1298
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,880
He ended up living on a tree platform.

1299
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,880
What?

1300
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,880
A tree platform?

1301
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,880
Yeah.

1302
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,400
Like in Santa Cruz?

1303
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,400
People live in the trees in Santa Cruz?

1304
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,800
He was, like, living on a tree platform, and I was like, are you protecting the trees?

1305
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,200
He's like, no, it's just a tree behind an apartment I rent.

1306
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,680
It's not even a tree house.

1307
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
It's a tree platform.

1308
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,680
It's a tree platform.

1309
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,680
Will you join me?

1310
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,360
Will you be Mrs. O'Donkers?

1311
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,360
Join me on the platform.

1312
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,360
No, Nick O was his first name.

1313
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,360
Oh, I thought it was Nick O'Donker.

1314
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,360
Yeah, that's what I thought it was, too.

1315
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,360
No.

1316
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,360
Nick O.

1317
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,360
How do you spell?

1318
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
I'm disappointed by that.

1319
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,360
How do you spell?

1320
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,360
Is it N-I-C-K-O?

1321
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,360
N-I-C-H-O.

1322
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,360
Oh, okay.

1323
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,360
Oh, man.

1324
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,360
Not Nick O.

1325
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,360
Nick O.

1326
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,360
Nick O.

1327
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,360
Interesting.

1328
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,360
Nice guy.

1329
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,360
Sure.

1330
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:02,760
He has no social media footprint, so I can't find out what happened to him anymore.

1331
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,240
Oh, unless this somehow brings him out.

1332
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,200
Yeah, Nick O, text me.

1333
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
Nick O.

1334
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
Nick.

1335
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,440
When I thought it was Nick O'Donkers, captain of all the teams, that was one of my favorite

1336
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,440
phrases.

1337
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,120
I think that's a false idol right there.

1338
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,520
He sounds like a superhero.

1339
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
Come on, Donkers.

1340
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,760
Pick up the pace.

1341
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,960
So religious pamphlet.

1342
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,760
And once armed with religious pamphlets and once you have a pure heart, you can make your

1343
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,680
way to have some pretty good Italian food.

1344
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,680
Oh, yeah.

1345
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,680
At...

1346
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,680
We're all thrilled.

1347
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,680
Is it Naples?

1348
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,680
Naples?

1349
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,680
Yeah, Naples is the ristorante.

1350
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,680
Is it new?

1351
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,680
It's recently redone.

1352
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,680
Because you guys usually go to Ovo Bar, right?

1353
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,680
Yeah.

1354
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,120
Which I'm sorry, Sector Keeper.

1355
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,120
Yeah, yeah.

1356
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:58,680
But it's closer and seems like a better selection of stuff.

1357
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,680
Yeah.

1358
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,520
Well, I don't think there was as much...

1359
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,520
Did they even have the...

1360
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,520
Is the bar...

1361
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,560
Is the walk-up bar new or has that always been there and I just haven't?

1362
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,920
I was just really impressed by their selection of local...

1363
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:17,080
They had a lot of Green Bar Distillery Spirits, which is a local distillery, make refined

1364
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,600
slow hand whiskey, the only LA whiskey, and it's pretty good.

1365
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,600
Really?

1366
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,600
Yeah.

1367
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:28,360
And I was just like, the selection in general, I got a trio of Italian mules, like a small...

1368
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,360
Oh, yeah.

1369
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,360
Yeah, it was great.

1370
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,360
That's great.

1371
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:36,320
It was like they had different types of Amaro in them and they were just very interesting

1372
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,640
and little tiny copper teeny mugs.

1373
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,280
Oh, sounds great.

1374
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,280
I loved it.

1375
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,280
Yeah, there was a...

1376
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,280
I think this is what the bar looked like before and it was just not as striking, you might

1377
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,280
say.

1378
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,280
This is tiny picture, I'm sorry.

1379
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,280
Uh-huh.

1380
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,280
It was just not as striking.

1381
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,280
Yeah.

1382
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,120
You could just pull up...

1383
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,560
Our night before Galaxy's Edge, we were all hanging out out there.

1384
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,480
That was a very chill, open air...

1385
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,480
This is upsetting.

1386
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,160
This is like one of the, I would say, better than fine places.

1387
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:11,680
I had a blast and I just got a little minestrone soup and a shrimp Caesar salad, but they were

1388
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,480
both great and my trio of mules was just so charming.

1389
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,040
It was truly like the kind of drink you get inside a Disney park.

1390
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,040
Yeah.

1391
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,440
It's like fun and there's variety.

1392
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
I liked my waitress.

1393
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,840
She was sweet and I just had a...

1394
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,240
I read my watch tower and I just chilled out.

1395
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,240
Yeah.

1396
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,240
Got some work done.

1397
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,240
I like the pizzas.

1398
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,400
My family is eating the pizzas there a lot.

1399
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,040
I especially like they have the little pepperonis that are crisp when they cook.

1400
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,680
That's a great idea.

1401
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:48,400
If you look up hashtag pepperoni cups on Instagram, you can find people posting pictures of different

1402
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,200
pizzas that have the little pepperonis.

1403
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,200
It's like a whole thing.

1404
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,200
I should have got that.

1405
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,000
I think Farley Elliott told me about that.

1406
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,520
I was describing it to him.

1407
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,240
He's like, yeah, pepperoni cups.

1408
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,120
Look up the hashtag pepperoni cups.

1409
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,120
But yeah, the pizza's good.

1410
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,640
There's a side of the restaurant that is just pizzas and salads, which is a pretty quick

1411
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,640
in and out meal.

1412
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,080
If you're waiting on...

1413
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,840
If you got a fast pass coming up or something.

1414
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,960
That's not Napolini.

1415
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,560
I think, well, what's the divide?

1416
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,480
Napolini is the quick service one.

1417
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,480
It's the quick service.

1418
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,480
Okay.

1419
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,480
Really, this is three restaurants.

1420
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,320
There's sit down naples.

1421
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,880
There's just pizza and salads naples, which I think the bar is part of.

1422
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,880
Yes, I think so.

1423
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,880
Yes.

1424
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,880
Maybe that's the only food you can get at the bar.

1425
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,240
I've done the sit down and the sit down's fine, but it's like you're pretty quick in

1426
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,040
and out with pretty quality food at the outdoor one.

1427
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,840
And then Napolini is the quick where you do pizzas to go.

1428
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,840
Where I bought two pizzas.

1429
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Yes, I bought two pizzas.

1430
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
That's cool.

1431
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
To Validay parking.

1432
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,840
I know it's that.

1433
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,200
You can also get beer and wine at the quick service.

1434
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,200
Yes.

1435
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,200
Oh, I wonder how's that?

1436
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,200
Yes, and hard seltzer.

1437
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,680
Oh, these are good tips.

1438
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,640
This is the most like...

1439
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,800
This doesn't sound like a compliment to call it functional, but for sure, you're right.

1440
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,120
It's not that far from the parks.

1441
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,520
You can get some pretty quality food.

1442
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,280
The pizza I've had there has been great.

1443
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,120
Not unreasonably priced beer and wine.

1444
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,720
It makes you feel like you want to live five minutes away.

1445
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,720
It makes this a place where you go.

1446
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,800
Are you moving to Anaheim?

1447
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,960
I say it a couple times to Lindsay once in a while.

1448
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:29,800
I've wondered if Orange County somewhere is some kind of secret to happiness, but I don't

1449
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,800
know where.

1450
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,800
I don't think it's Anaheim.

1451
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:37,200
Well, again, that Anaheim, the mythical Anaheim Hills, which I have not explored, but I've

1452
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,080
heard tell of it.

1453
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,080
So that might be it.

1454
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,080
You just want to live at Tony Baxter's house.

1455
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,080
You want him to adopt you.

1456
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,920
Well, of course, I'd like to wait for him.

1457
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,080
One of his houses on the block to open up, so we can move right in.

1458
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,080
So you're next door neighbor.

1459
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,080
My neighbor.

1460
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
Borrow a cup of sugar.

1461
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,160
Borrow original designs of the Alice in Wonderland ride.

1462
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,920
Hey, Mr. Baxter, I'd like to trip a little light fantastic in your backyard, sir.

1463
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,280
Does he live down there?

1464
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:05,280
He lives down there, but he also installed all these lights from Mary Poppins Returns

1465
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,000
in his backyard recently.

1466
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That's cool.

1467
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
There's a big article about it.

1468
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Have you driven by his house?

1469
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
No, I don't know where he lives.

1470
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm not insane.

1471
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
You definitely don't know.

1472
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
No, no, no, I don't know.

1473
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I don't know.

1474
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,440
You described looking at Mary Poppins lights as tripping the light fantastic.

1475
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,040
That's the name of the song from the movie.

1476
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,040
From the new one?

1477
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,040
Yeah.

1478
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,040
Yes.

1479
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,040
It's a killer joke if you knew it.

1480
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,840
It is a good joke.

1481
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,840
It's a good joke.

1482
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,080
My mom just said she likes it.

1483
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,200
He apparently was like obsessed with it and he put he decided to redo his whole backyard

1484
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,880
to look like the lamp lighter scene, the iconic lamp lighter scene.

1485
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,400
From the new Mary Poppins.

1486
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,040
A couple years ago, I did this thing where there's this immersive theater company that

1487
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,040
had a subscription.

1488
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,200
I haven't talked about this on the podcast, but I bought into the subscription where they

1489
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,400
were doing a play in my life for eight months and eight or nine months before they-

1490
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,400
Oh, right.

1491
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,400
You didn't know when they would show up.

1492
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,440
They'd show or they would warn me, but they kept calling me down to have experiences

1493
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,440
at midnight.

1494
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:10,080
But they were in Orange County by Biola University, around by Knott's Berry Farm in this weird-

1495
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,160
Yeah, I figured out pretty quick they lived there.

1496
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,160
I see.

1497
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:19,160
Because I kept having to go to this one area of condos and I was like, okay, you guys live

1498
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,160
here, don't you?

1499
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:26,000
I'd be like, so I'd have to drive down and it would take a while.

1500
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,760
There was one cool bar that I would go to and get food beforehand.

1501
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,000
It was the guy that now owns the Wolves downtown.

1502
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,840
It was his first place he opened.

1503
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:40,440
Anyway, but then I'd have to go up to a door and knock on it and then they would drag me

1504
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,640
into a garage and interrogate me and then send me home.

1505
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:52,920
I did that four times and then they moved away and they didn't finish my narrative that

1506
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:53,920
I'd paid for.

1507
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,240
I was like, I started lightly harassing them on Twitter about it.

1508
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,920
They're like, okay, come back.

1509
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,920
But then they made me go to Biola University.

1510
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:09,000
So I drove down again to finish my story and it was midnight again.

1511
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:15,240
Then they brought me into this conference room and they showed all my tweets to me that

1512
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,360
I'd written or being mean to them.

1513
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,400
They made you pay for your tweets-ins?

1514
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,400
Oh man.

1515
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,900
They really showed me.

1516
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,640
Is there anything fun to explore around Biola?

1517
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,680
I've never been there.

1518
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,320
I like a good New Orange County thing.

1519
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,320
I don't know.

1520
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,760
I mean, I wish Puzzle Bar was still there.

1521
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,760
You would love it.

1522
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,360
But now the guy just has the Wolves, but all of his drinks were named after like, uh, animes

1523
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,360
and stuff.

1524
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,760
He made all of his own, but you just go to the Wolves now.

1525
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,760
It's cool.

1526
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,760
Same stuff.

1527
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,760
La Mirada is where we're talking.

1528
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,840
I would go to La Mirada maybe once a month.

1529
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:53,480
And one time they came to my house and they arrested me for crimes.

1530
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:01,280
A thrilling immersive experience about your life that is convenient for us to travel to.

1531
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,280
Was it finished?

1532
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,880
Did he get finished?

1533
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,360
I did not feel...

1534
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,760
Is it time to start harassing them again?

1535
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:13,200
No, I will say that one of them came up to me and like apologized at the immersive design

1536
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,200
summit for never...

1537
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,280
He was like, we just got way in over our heads.

1538
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,040
And I was like, it's okay.

1539
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,200
I definitely got way more show than I paid for.

1540
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,440
So they were, I was part of an experimental process.

1541
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,440
Sure.

1542
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,640
How many other people do you think were?

1543
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,600
I, they said it was, there were a few more people.

1544
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,160
But under 10?

1545
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,160
Oh, under 10.

1546
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,160
Yeah.

1547
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,160
Wow.

1548
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,160
And yeah.

1549
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,160
Do you know the other ones?

1550
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,600
There was nobody that I know.

1551
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
Okay.

1552
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,360
But I sat on a podcast and I thought it was just me.

1553
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,200
And then they contacted me and said, there's a couple other people doing it.

1554
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,360
No, no, there's others.

1555
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,360
Anyway.

1556
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,360
Wow.

1557
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,040
But yeah, anyway.

1558
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,640
So there are some nice places in La Mirada.

1559
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,640
Okay, sure.

1560
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,640
Sure.

1561
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,000
But be careful of hijinks and get arrested.

1562
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Don't do that.

1563
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Other people in that condo complex, there was this one night we were all walking around

1564
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,960
with monks robes, with monks, like they must've been so annoyed with the sprinklers kept going

1565
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,280
off and hitting us.

1566
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,560
They made me leave my shoes in a tree.

1567
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:22,280
Man, it's one thing to use the rec room for an improv practice, let alone the costumes

1568
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,280
and monk robes.

1569
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,280
Oh my God, they're burning a witch puppet again.

1570
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,680
It's going to stink for days.

1571
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,680
Art collective.

1572
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:40,760
We should talk a little bit about the, this is the first of many restaurants we'll encounter

1573
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:46,880
that are part of the same shadowy restaurant group called the Patina restaurant group.

1574
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,880
Oh yeah.

1575
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:53,440
So Patina has a iron grip on Danta and Disney.

1576
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,440
What else is there?

1577
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,760
Stratia Joe's, Catal, Uva Bar, we'll be covering all of these.

1578
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,120
They are behind the upcoming Epcot space restaurant.

1579
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,120
Right.

1580
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,120
Epcot Italy restaurant.

1581
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,120
Oh, okay.

1582
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,120
It's Annapoli.

1583
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,120
The Annapoli.

1584
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,520
The space is a collaboration, I believe, between Imagineering and the Patina group.

1585
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,520
Oh, finally.

1586
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,480
If you go to the restaurant in Disney hall, that's a Patina restaurant.

1587
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,480
Yes.

1588
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,840
And then you have the music center like by the Mark Taper.

1589
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,840
That's where, that's a Patina.

1590
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,840
Okay.

1591
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,840
Black Moon.

1592
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,840
Yeah.

1593
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,840
They're in a lot of museums.

1594
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,840
And Big New York.

1595
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,840
Yeah, they were in the Norton Simon cafe.

1596
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,840
Okay.

1597
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,160
And then they have restaurants in the Empire State Building and in Rockefeller Center.

1598
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:40,640
I will say that a Patina group sign inspires confidence in me.

1599
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,640
Wow.

1600
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:47,240
Right, so a place I can feel like I can get a reliable little nibble and probably like,

1601
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,760
yeah, they probably have a nice glass of wine, something like that.

1602
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,760
Sure.

1603
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,760
Sure.

1604
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,760
Is that Norton Simon in Pasadena?

1605
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,760
Yeah.

1606
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,760
Yeah.

1607
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,760
I re-ordered it wrong.

1608
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,760
I started saying New York.

1609
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,760
That's a good museum.

1610
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,760
Yeah, that is a good museum.

1611
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,760
Shout out to the Norton Simon.

1612
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,920
They've got a bunch of Warhol crates in the basement.

1613
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:12,920
Well, you're right to trust them because they are interested by Hollywood's second biggest

1614
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,760
night, the Emmy Awards, to cater.

1615
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,320
Do you guys know this?

1616
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,320
No.

1617
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,880
Patina caters the Emmys, Governor's Ball.

1618
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,880
Wow.

1619
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,880
Okay.

1620
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:29,320
The people, well, there's two people primarily involved in Patina.

1621
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:35,720
Nick Valenti, I'll get to him in a minute, but Chef Joaquin Splishol is sort of the main.

1622
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,720
Same.

1623
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,720
Yeah.

1624
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,760
It's like, yeah, there was never a Wolfgang Puck, right?

1625
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,000
Just has a ring to it.

1626
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Fictional character created.

1627
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Nancy Silverton invented him.

1628
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,040
He's like Chuck E. Cheese.

1629
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,040
Yeah.

1630
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,040
In a lot of ways.

1631
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,240
Is there a little book that tells me his best story?

1632
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,240
Wolf Entertainment.

1633
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,240
Yeah.

1634
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,240
Puck.

1635
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,240
Pucky Cheese.

1636
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:04,640
He'd, you know why the, as we record this, the Emmys have just occurred and this year

1637
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,800
was no exception.

1638
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:10,660
He did the catering and the, there's a theme every year.

1639
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:16,360
This year was brilliance in motion, which is why they had mini milkshakes and street

1640
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,360
corn ravioli.

1641
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,360
Ooh.

1642
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,360
Brilliance in motion, I guess.

1643
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,360
Wow.

1644
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,360
I want that right now.

1645
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,840
It does sound pretty good.

1646
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,800
We just all gotta get nominated for Emmys, I guess.

1647
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:32,520
If they open a podcast category, let's see what we can do.

1648
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:37,320
Let me see what they, oh, it's very decadent stuff at that.

1649
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:43,080
One decadent dopamine releasing spoonful of the pot de creme, a fashion by Lint.

1650
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:49,320
It's topped by a tiny gold bar decoration sprayed with edible gold.

1651
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,740
A quote from a Natalie dressed attendee.

1652
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:56,280
This is why they hate us, she says, smiling wickedly.

1653
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,200
Are they terrorists?

1654
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,800
I think so.

1655
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:04,000
Anyone out there, MAGA people, anyone outside of Hollywood.

1656
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,200
That's a good thing to say when you're eating gold.

1657
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,200
Very cool.

1658
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:12,560
I think that maybe that refers to like all the, like 90% of lower tier members of the

1659
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,560
writers guild.

1660
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,560
I think that's what that's about.

1661
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,040
I'm so tired of edible gold.

1662
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,040
Yeah, yeah.

1663
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,040
We just get it all.

1664
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,040
It grows on trees in LA.

1665
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:25,200
All the damn time.

1666
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,960
Also this year they served a thousand calorie gratin.

1667
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,440
Why would, why is it the calorie?

1668
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,440
Why is it called that?

1669
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,920
Yeah, why do they push that as in the title?

1670
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,920
Is that just like very rich?

1671
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,160
But like all gratin is already incredibly rich.

1672
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,160
Right.

1673
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,640
Isn't it already approaching a thousand calories?

1674
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:48,800
Well, it's like you spent all this time getting into your little dress and you ate your little

1675
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:55,440
packaged meals and then you lost to like Jason Bateman.

1676
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,440
He won best director.

1677
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,240
The best director we have.

1678
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:04,560
So this is, you're the person who didn't win for directing Game of Thrones and then you

1679
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,560
were like, fuck it.

1680
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,080
I'm going to eat this thousand calories.

1681
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,080
You needed it.

1682
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,080
It's a baby bottle.

1683
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,080
Yeah.

1684
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,800
To nurse the wounds.

1685
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:19,560
I know, you know what's fun is when those award winners, they don't go to the fancy

1686
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,560
ball.

1687
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:27,480
They go to in and out with their award in hand and then they get back in the car immediately

1688
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,800
because it was a stage photo opportunity.

1689
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,520
It took a minute and a half to.

1690
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,400
I worked in a reality show back when I was a reality show person that was called Pageant

1691
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,400
Place and it was like about pageants.

1692
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:48,440
It was anyway, I was backstage at Donald Trump's Miss Teen USA pageant and the Pasina City

1693
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:58,600
Civic Center and they put me in the losers room to interview losers, which was horrible.

1694
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,920
But they kept eliminating these girls and they'd come back and there was just all this

1695
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,360
pizza in that room and the girls would just be like stuffing pizza in their mouths because

1696
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,400
they hadn't been eating and they're teens.

1697
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:14,080
But anyway, we all remember that lady, that Miss South Carolina who talked about maps.

1698
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,360
Oh, an early viral sensation video.

1699
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,360
Yeah.

1700
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,360
So she was that year.

1701
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:25,880
So I was in the loser's pit watching all these girls eat pizza, watch that happen and they

1702
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:29,840
had lost and she was still in the pageant and they all just like, there was this like

1703
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,400
howl like this weird guttural howl.

1704
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:47,200
Of just like rage and like, that I saw firsthand because they told us the pageant people took

1705
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,160
us, well this is a spoiler, this is a secret probably, but they told us she was going to

1706
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,160
win.

1707
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,160
Oh wow.

1708
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:57,040
And over there like she's probably going to win so you should be following her a lot and

1709
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,880
she was like, so she came to the pageant as like the probable winner and then she did

1710
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,880
that and she lost.

1711
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:02,880
Oh my gosh.

1712
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,320
She had it in the bag before the night.

1713
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:10,480
She had been selected probably by Donald himself as the winner and then she was such a dumb

1714
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,480
dumb they couldn't give it to her and this other girl won.

1715
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,480
Selected by Giseline.

1716
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,480
Yes.

1717
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,480
Yes, Jeff and killing.

1718
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,480
Speaking of in and out photo opportunities.

1719
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,640
Do you guys know that I have shared a name with a character from the Epstein verse?

1720
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,640
Oh yes.

1721
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,640
I saw you posting that.

1722
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,640
This is so weird.

1723
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,640
I'm sorry.

1724
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:34,000
It started popping up under like YouTube videos or like mentioned, like it'd be like, is this

1725
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,520
the Eva Anderson who took the Lolita Express?

1726
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,560
And I was like, what?

1727
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,220
And then I, and it turns out it's with two S's.

1728
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:45,300
She's like an ex girlfriend of Epstein's and she's in the black book right above magician

1729
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,300
David Copperfield.

1730
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,300
Whoa.

1731
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,300
Who's also in the black book.

1732
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,300
That's right.

1733
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,300
Oh boy.

1734
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,920
And you have magic connections.

1735
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,920
I know.

1736
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,920
Yeah, you've crossed paths.

1737
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,920
So they're probably thinking.

1738
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,920
He came to my house when I was a kid.

1739
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,680
And he would come by and like buy shit from my dad.

1740
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,880
Oh my, police monkeys and have them draw pictures of you.

1741
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,280
To be fair, have you ever done some sort of train immersive that was called the Lolita

1742
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,080
Express that's unrelated to the plane?

1743
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:14,840
There was like this whole chain on, I found on Twitter where they put my photo up and

1744
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,400
they were like, was it a childhood photo of you and your dad?

1745
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,400
Yeah.

1746
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,360
And they're like, she was on the Lolita Express.

1747
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:25,680
And then, and then someone underneath was like, isn't her dad an admitted warlock?

1748
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,160
Yes.

1749
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:34,720
That's the thing about the, about conspiracy people is like, they are afraid of the dark

1750
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,720
arts.

1751
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,000
They are afraid of black magic.

1752
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,560
But then like on this chain too, I found it was from, I was Googling my own name guys.

1753
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,760
Someone corrected this woman and was this QAnon woman and was like, that's not her.

1754
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,080
She's it's a different person.

1755
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,520
QAnon to the rescue.

1756
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:57,440
But I tweeted, but the picture of me had been shared like 60 times, like repeated 60 times

1757
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,040
with my dad on it and everything.

1758
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,040
So I tweeted at the lady.

1759
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,140
I was like, Hey, that's not, that's wrong.

1760
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,520
And she was just like, I was corrected already.

1761
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,320
Just look at the whole, read the whole chain, please.

1762
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,880
And I was like, okay.

1763
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,960
Not a sorry, not a sorry.

1764
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,600
I said, you went on the Lolita Express to the island where they think there's like a

1765
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,800
temple with tunnels where that I went in the tunnels and got like Adrena Chrome with Hillary

1766
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,000
from a screaming child.

1767
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,120
I've already been yelled at a bunch of times today.

1768
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,960
Last thing I need is a warlocks daughter bugging me.

1769
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,960
Wow.

1770
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,560
So I'm part of the Epstein verse.

1771
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,560
Wow.

1772
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,560
Wow.

1773
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,560
Oh my God.

1774
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,560
Yeah.

1775
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,800
I didn't know Epstein had such an elaborate Island, much like Copperfield.

1776
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,800
It's probably what they bonded over.

1777
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,800
Oh yeah.

1778
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,800
There's a temple.

1779
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,800
Whoa.

1780
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,800
Did he build the temple?

1781
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,800
I don't know.

1782
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:52,920
And the Zorro Ranch in New Mexico from the earlier photographs, it looks like it has

1783
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,280
a maze, which I find very interesting.

1784
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,280
That's his ranch.

1785
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,280
Right.

1786
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:03,960
He had his own Neverland type, like he had his Neverland fun, like amusement park back

1787
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,960
behind the house.

1788
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,800
I meant to look up how far apart Mousha K and Little St. James are.

1789
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,360
Is that how they know each other?

1790
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,280
It's just like chartered flights to the islands.

1791
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,280
To their sex island buddies.

1792
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,720
To their evil islands?

1793
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,720
Yeah, possible.

1794
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,080
Didn't we say we think there's an underground tunnel probably to the islands?

1795
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,080
Oh yes.

1796
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,080
Oh yeah.

1797
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,320
Or like the, yeah, the whatever it was.

1798
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,320
The tunnel, what's underground?

1799
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,320
What's the?

1800
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,320
The tunnel.

1801
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,320
Is it the tunnel I'm thinking of?

1802
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,320
Something like that.

1803
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,320
There's like a tunnel between.

1804
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:39,720
Did you ever do, Jason Walliner and John Daly and I did a tour of Jalil Barajan's house.

1805
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,120
Barajan's collection in Vegas, which is like an old.

1806
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,120
Oh, I wanted to do this.

1807
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,660
You told us about this.

1808
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,240
We drove up to the house.

1809
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,240
Okay.

1810
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,640
Because it's the house where Michael, one of the last places Michael Jackson lived.

1811
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,960
The Thrilla Villa where he like lived after he was exiled from Neverland.

1812
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:59,280
And the reason he bought this house was it was made by, it was built by some entertainer,

1813
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,800
some guy who like ran a bunch of shows in the fifties or whatever.

1814
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:08,440
But he built a house with tunnels connecting all the rooms, which is not a good thing for

1815
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,440
anyone.

1816
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,440
Everyone needs tunnels.

1817
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,440
No.

1818
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,440
Alone.

1819
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,440
Michael Jackson.

1820
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,400
Well, he needed it so that paparazzi couldn't fly over and see him.

1821
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,760
So we would never leave the house.

1822
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,000
But it was crazy because you get a tour of the Thrilla Villa and the first.

1823
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,560
So they're walking you through and they'll be like, you'll be in a room.

1824
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,960
They'll be like, it's this really elaborate, like a room full of oil paintings.

1825
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,640
Like all these oil paintings are on loan from the French consulate.

1826
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,320
When Michael lived here, all we know is that this whole room was painted black.

1827
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,040
The windows were blacked out and there was a single chair in the middle of the room.

1828
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,040
Okay.

1829
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,880
They just say weird things like that.

1830
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:45,280
And then you go into these tunnels underneath and you and Liberace's collection is down

1831
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,280
there.

1832
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,280
Oh my God.

1833
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,280
Underground.

1834
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,280
Under in the tunnels.

1835
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,280
Yeah.

1836
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,280
And you're in it.

1837
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,080
Also, like the reason I didn't do it is because you just, you told me a little more and you

1838
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,160
said like, yeah, that guy like picks you up in your car with lukewarm champagne in his

1839
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,160
car rather.

1840
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,160
Yeah.

1841
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,160
Like, Hey, come on in.

1842
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,880
And he's got like lukewarm just bought champagne from Ralph's.

1843
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,080
He bought market sushi.

1844
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,200
To take you to a, to Michael Jackson's tunnel.

1845
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,280
I think I looked into this and it wasn't running, but there was a, there was something.

1846
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,280
You would love it.

1847
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,280
It's fantastic.

1848
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,280
I would really like to do it.

1849
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,320
The guy who does it is the consul to Monaco and he's a whole character as well.

1850
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,640
Oh great.

1851
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,800
And he just tells you all about, he'll tell you all these secrets.

1852
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,760
He told us like a bunch of weird secrets.

1853
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,400
Just he's trying to, we got the feeling like if we had asked the right question, he would

1854
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,400
have gotten us literally anything we wanted.

1855
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:39,560
Like, cause he kept plying us with cheap champagne and sushi and being like, so what else guys?

1856
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:43,720
Like he just kept trying to keep the party going and being like, so any questions about

1857
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,720
anything?

1858
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:49,240
In my fantasy of it, the guy who hosts the tour is a Josh Agabor's husband, the Prince

1859
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,240
man.

1860
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,240
Oh yeah.

1861
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,760
I went to her estate sale and he was there in the room with us.

1862
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,760
I think we may have talked about that.

1863
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,120
Celebrity estate sales.

1864
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,120
Oh yeah.

1865
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,120
Jason.

1866
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,000
I mean, we're, we got to get on the same mailing lists.

1867
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,800
So yeah, I, I missed it.

1868
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,840
I couldn't squeeze in the Jack Webb one.

1869
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,840
I was really sad.

1870
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,200
Jack Webb just had an estate sale when he had, did you see that?

1871
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,000
I tagged even Molly Lambert.

1872
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,640
He had nine TVs.

1873
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,920
He would watch all the TVs at once when, when Dragnet would be on.

1874
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,400
He supposedly, when he moved out, he packed one suitcase and walked out with everything

1875
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,680
still in the house.

1876
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,840
That's a crazy, that gave me goosebumps when I read that.

1877
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,840
What was, what happened?

1878
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,840
I don't know.

1879
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,840
Like what happened to that man?

1880
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,840
I don't know.

1881
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:31,840
Just the facts please.

1882
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,840
That's what I want.

1883
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,840
Jesus.

1884
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,440
I don't want any of this shit.

1885
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:41,480
Do you guys know that my parents bought the first, the house that I was the first raised

1886
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,400
at the first three years of my life was bought from my parents.

1887
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,680
My parents bought it from Jerry Mathers.

1888
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,680
Yeah.

1889
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,800
Like it was like that, like that was a, that was a handoff.

1890
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,360
Jerry Mathers.

1891
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:55,840
You just moved up in the celebrity rankings in my mother's head.

1892
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,840
You're now 25.

1893
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:57,840
Another layer of the onion.

1894
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,400
After the Beatles, the Monkees, David Cassidy, Bobby Sherman.

1895
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,800
And now it's Scott because he lived in a house that was bought by the Beaver.

1896
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:10,240
I grew, I was, I crawled around a room the Beaver lived in and then they were selling

1897
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:12,620
the house not that long after.

1898
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:15,680
And there was a plaque in there like the Beaver house.

1899
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:16,680
Oh my God.

1900
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,840
It was just a place where he lived and didn't.

1901
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,300
The Beaver house.

1902
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,560
It's still called as the Beaver house.

1903
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,560
That sounds.

1904
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,560
It's a great name for it.

1905
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,560
The Beaver house.

1906
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,960
Is that why they had a priest bless it?

1907
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,320
Because like God knows what sort of business Jerry Mathers got up to in that house.

1908
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,320
Yeah, yeah.

1909
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,280
Well, my parents, as I've said before, had every house blessed so that it couldn't get

1910
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:39,280
lit on fire.

1911
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,720
Anywhere I lived would be blessed by prayer.

1912
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,960
I should text my mom this right now.

1913
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:42,960
Oh yeah, let her know.

1914
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,960
I lived in a.

1915
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,960
Oh, sorry.

1916
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,680
I was just, the other thing about it, the one thing is that there was a hole in the

1917
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,600
wall of the master bedroom that then my parents moved into.

1918
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,000
But that apparently wasn't fixed before they got in there.

1919
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,480
There was a hole in the wall that was distinctly a fist shaped hole.

1920
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,480
Oh.

1921
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,480
So.

1922
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,560
He punched the wall because he was so mad.

1923
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,280
He wanted to punch his wife, but he's like, punch the wall instead.

1924
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:07,800
Oh, so actually I, you know, my whole life I've thought like, does that mean he was an

1925
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,800
abusive guy?

1926
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,360
But if it saved somebody from getting abused.

1927
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,160
Yeah, you can't abuse a wall.

1928
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,960
Yeah, you can hit them all you want.

1929
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:15,960
Yeah.

1930
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,960
Hit all the walls.

1931
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,560
We lived in Michael Landon's house.

1932
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,560
Old house.

1933
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,560
Michael Landon.

1934
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:27,480
And he told my dad that he had like, there were a bunch of pets buried in the basement,

1935
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,480
like weird ones, like an orangutan and an iguana.

1936
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,480
In the basement?

1937
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,480
Yeah.

1938
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,640
And he took it off where Michael Landon was like, enjoy it.

1939
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,800
No, it was like some people that lived there in the middle between some old people that

1940
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,040
lived between, but then my dad met him at some sort of function was like, I live in

1941
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,040
your old house.

1942
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,040
And he was like, oh.

1943
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,680
And he, then he told him this was like grim, creepy thing that orangutan had died in that

1944
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,920
house or something.

1945
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,560
Was it an unfinished basement?

1946
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,760
Like how was it, why would it be buried in the basement?

1947
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,760
I don't know.

1948
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,760
Like in the floorboards?

1949
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,760
Orangutans.

1950
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,760
This isn't Michael Jackson's house.

1951
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,760
Right.

1952
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,760
Yeah, I don't know.

1953
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,760
It's like, I don't know.

1954
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,760
It's weird.

1955
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,120
It is weird.

1956
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:09,160
This is reminding me something I saw, someone sent me a few weeks ago, there was tour.

1957
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,160
Okay.

1958
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:15,040
There were ghost tours, but they were advertising it as like ghost tours of Walt Disney's own

1959
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,400
old house.

1960
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,800
And it's not as famous like Homeby Hill, like his big house.

1961
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,480
He lived in like 10 places in the Los Feliz area when he first lived here.

1962
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:32,280
So it was a house, but very slyly the ghost tour operators put in like, and then the house

1963
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,040
was also owned by the LaBiancas.

1964
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:37,840
And I was like, oh my God, did Disney live in the LaBianca house?

1965
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:44,640
No, it was just another house that the LaBiancas lived in before the house where they were

1966
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,400
killed by the Manson family.

1967
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,400
Different.

1968
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,400
Wow.

1969
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,680
Which you, yeah, that's not right to call it the LaBianca house.

1970
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,680
You know what that means.

1971
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,680
It's a LaBianca house.

1972
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:57,400
It's a LaBianca house and a Disney house, but it's not the in either case.

1973
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:02,320
Just think about it, guys, if Manson had just come a bunch of years earlier into a different

1974
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,280
house, he could have killed Walt Disney.

1975
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,280
Walt Disney.

1976
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:11,240
Well, if he'd crank through it all a little soon, like there's maybe a little slice of

1977
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:16,160
time where he was like on the prowl and doing drugs and stuff and Walt was going to die

1978
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,200
in like a couple of weeks.

1979
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,200
He could have gotten in there.

1980
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,200
Yeah.

1981
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,200
Just read it along.

1982
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,880
James L. Roy wrote this book for sure.

1983
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,600
It's like a crime conspiracy novel.

1984
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,360
In a hundred years, this is what we'll think happened, like when all of history jumbles

1985
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,360
together.

1986
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,360
Oh, yeah.

1987
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,360
Yeah.

1988
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,360
Manson killed Disney.

1989
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:36,360
The 60s died when Manson killed JFK and then Disney.

1990
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,400
A quick update.

1991
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:42,040
I did find so Moosha Kay is in the Bahamas.

1992
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:46,320
Little St. James is more between the British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

1993
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,880
So kind of a decent, decent distance.

1994
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,200
The shuttle is big.

1995
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,600
It's a big shuttle between the two islands.

1996
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,440
They definitely visited each other's islands though, guys.

1997
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,440
Yes.

1998
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:57,440
For sure.

1999
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,440
For sure.

2000
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,440
All right.

2001
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,440
And now to unfavorite little St. James lest I get trapped.

2002
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,440
Oh, yeah.

2003
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,440
Don't keep that pinned.

2004
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,440
I had to.

2005
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,440
Yes, I had to get the pinned so I could see it.

2006
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:10,560
Ghislaine like got put in, like got sawed in half, like giggling and a like a little

2007
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,680
like trick and she was like, oh, David, like you're funny.

2008
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:17,840
Would you like my monkeys to draw you?

2009
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,840
You know what?

2010
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:22,440
I've only ever drawn one person and it was Jeffrey Epstein.

2011
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:28,600
Oh, when they're like digging through the remains of Moosha Kay in a Jurassic Park,

2012
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,680
nature has been reclaiming it and then they find an old drawing.

2013
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,680
Wait a minute.

2014
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:34,760
And wait a minute.

2015
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:39,400
And also there's been all these questions about how did Epstein just magically evade

2016
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,600
the cameras, evade the security guards?

2017
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,920
Maybe he had the help of a magician.

2018
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,680
David Copperfield helped him fake his death in the prison.

2019
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:49,680
We just solved it.

2020
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:50,680
That's what happened.

2021
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,680
That is honestly you're right.

2022
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:52,680
It is what happened.

2023
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,880
And maybe he's still alive.

2024
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,520
Maybe he dug like a channel or something.

2025
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,280
Do we know what what Epstein's father did?

2026
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,960
Where did he work in the military?

2027
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:02,960
Oh, do you have a question?

2028
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:07,960
Did he also have a little friend that helped him?

2029
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,960
So David gave.

2030
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,960
OK, so David, of course, broke into the prison.

2031
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,960
We're also, by the way, referring to things you have to listen to the Patreon.

2032
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:19,120
Do it, the Copperfields episode is worth it.

2033
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,120
Oh, thank you.

2034
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,120
Yeah, thank you.

2035
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:26,400
He gave Epstein his time stone and sent Epstein back in time.

2036
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,400
That's where.

2037
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,040
So if they want to find Epstein, they got to go to the bath.

2038
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,040
They have to go to the bath.

2039
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:33,760
They got to go to a park where Epstein's dad is kissing Epstein's mom.

2040
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,360
Love, Jeffrey.

2041
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,160
The answer is love.

2042
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,160
The message was love, Jeffrey.

2043
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:45,600
There's a picture of Trump Epstein and Blue 32 hanging out.

2044
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:51,800
Oh, man, I was going to get you guys those blue 32 pouches.

2045
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,800
They're so ugly.

2046
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,800
They're so ugly.

2047
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,400
I was like, that's not cool.

2048
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,560
I would spend one hundred and fifty dollars on that nice blue.

2049
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,760
Like if they really just if they made him, I want it so bad.

2050
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,760
I need blue.

2051
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,440
Donald competing over the same pageant contestant.

2052
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,720
Yeah, sure.

2053
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,720
She's hot.

2054
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,720
Donald.

2055
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,640
Make sure to stick with her.

2056
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,400
She's going to win.

2057
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,320
It's honestly like they're the same sense of humor like Trump making fun of somebody

2058
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,800
who can't speak English like Blue did during the Copperfield show.

2059
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,800
Like, I can't understand it, David.

2060
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,560
He drinks a lot of root beer.

2061
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,560
Trump farts root beer.

2062
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,560
I bet you know how his farts smell.

2063
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,560
Please.

2064
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,560
Oh, my God.

2065
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,840
If you're confused by any of this, please seriously go to the Patriot and listen to

2066
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,840
it.

2067
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:46,240
OK, winding down, we should talk about the other figure in all of this in the patina

2068
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,240
group.

2069
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,240
Yes.

2070
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,240
Nick Valenti.

2071
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,400
And you know what's funny?

2072
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:52,400
We've been talking about this.

2073
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,480
We're in our this research has been going for a little while.

2074
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,760
The first time I ever checked the website, it said founder and CEO Nick Valenti of the

2075
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,760
patina group.

2076
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,000
Now it just says founder because guys, he's out.

2077
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Whoa.

2078
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
He's out of the company.

2079
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,440
It used to be the patina group that runs all these restaurants used to be a two and

2080
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,160
a half year old founder.

2081
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,160
Nick Valenti hit the bricks.

2082
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:17,080
I'm not sure what it happened this year is like like within the last few months.

2083
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,080
Let me see.

2084
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:24,080
He's just an external adviser through his company, Simple Hospitality LLC.

2085
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:29,600
He works on special projects for this other not unnerving name for a company, Delaware

2086
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,600
North.

2087
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,600
Definitely not like a scammy.

2088
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:38,600
Love board in that state, half run by DuPont, half run by credit card companies.

2089
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,600
Sure.

2090
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,600
Totally fine.

2091
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,600
North Delaware?

2092
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,600
No, no, not North Delaware North.

2093
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,600
North.

2094
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,600
North.

2095
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,040
Flip it around.

2096
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:52,280
And then also, I think it's so it's been a tough little run for the patina group because

2097
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:57,200
they've also recently been kicked out of Rockefeller Center.

2098
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,340
So if you're if you live listening to this, you live in New York and you're a fan of patina's

2099
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:05,160
Sea Grill Rock Center Cafe or Kuchina and Co.

2100
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,600
It's well January 2020.

2101
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,600
It's all out.

2102
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,600
It's gone.

2103
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,600
Wow.

2104
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,280
So patina something's going I couldn't find any more information about the drama.

2105
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,280
Right.

2106
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:20,560
But Joaquin Splashall, king of the thousand calorie gratin has there's there's been the

2107
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,680
split with with old Nick Valenti.

2108
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:27,200
And I don't know what does this mean for their future at 1010 Disney?

2109
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,840
What does it mean for the future of the company?

2110
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:29,840
Yeah, that's a good question.

2111
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,000
I mean, there's something we have to answer, obviously, on the next or downtown Disney or

2112
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
deal.

2113
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Yes.

2114
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Two years maybe.

2115
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,200
Yeah, or deal revisited.

2116
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,200
Yeah.

2117
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,200
It's good.

2118
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,200
I was looking at all the list.

2119
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,200
I will real quick.

2120
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,200
I just want to praise them.

2121
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,200
They don't have a lot of repeat name restaurants, which I like.

2122
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,200
That's impressive.

2123
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:52,640
The Disney Naples Napolini via Napoli is a little confusing.

2124
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,240
Look, I'm just saying there's not they're not doing the they're trying to do different

2125
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,640
concepts, which I appreciate.

2126
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,800
That's anyway.

2127
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,800
So we don't know.

2128
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,200
There could be some shadowy things happening.

2129
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,200
Yeah.

2130
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,200
Evil.

2131
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:08,400
I don't want to say evil spirits are involved in the patina group, but maybe something is

2132
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,840
going on.

2133
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,840
Interesting.

2134
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:16,200
Maybe he was trying to propose less or more calories in the thousand calorie grotten.

2135
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,200
Yeah.

2136
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,640
And he was shouted down and stormed out never to return.

2137
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:23,520
We don't even know what kind of express plane he's been on.

2138
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,520
No.

2139
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,320
A man with that power.

2140
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,320
Right.

2141
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:30,520
That's all he is went through to get to an island.

2142
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:34,320
He's described everywhere as like a major New York restaurateur.

2143
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,280
So yeah, who knows?

2144
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,920
We know what's up in the New York socialite.

2145
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,920
Yeah.

2146
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,920
Yeah.

2147
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,920
Hmm.

2148
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:42,920
We're on to you.

2149
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:47,280
Well, this is something we're going to have to just keep exploring, I guess, and for further

2150
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:51,080
episodes because we got a lot more patina to go.

2151
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,940
But for now, I guess we've went our way to the end.

2152
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:57,640
And so we get to say, Eva Anderson, you survived.

2153
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,160
Hey, where did Eva go?

2154
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,160
What happened?

2155
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,160
Wait a minute.

2156
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:06,360
Guys are I seeing something or like we're looking over.

2157
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:10,520
I looked at my notes to say goodbye and remind myself of Eva's name.

2158
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,320
And then I looked up and she's not here anymore.

2159
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:17,000
I looked down at my computer to remember Eva's name as well, just to make sure on the way

2160
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
out you got it right.

2161
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,400
Because you wouldn't want to say the name.

2162
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,060
But she's gone.

2163
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,060
But she's gone.

2164
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:27,520
It's just a puff of like marinara sauce, red smoke, which is different from the kind of

2165
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:34,360
water vapor like buffalo ink flavored water vapor that the Sector Keepers been vaping.

2166
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,360
Right.

2167
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,360
Yeah, right.

2168
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,360
Distinctly.

2169
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,360
Huh.

2170
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:43,080
But him being a vapor expert, maybe he could tell us what's going on or just explain what

2171
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:47,920
the we've never had a guest to just not make it through the I say you survived.

2172
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,920
I guess the ride.

2173
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,320
This is the first time it hasn't worked out.

2174
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,200
Yeah, I mean, there's been guests who like clearly like wanted to leave because they

2175
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,200
were bored with us.

2176
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,920
But they never actually disappeared on us.

2177
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:58,920
Jesus Christ.

2178
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,920
Yeah.

2179
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,160
Well, then maybe we need to bring in vapor expert and evil spirit.

2180
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:05,160
Yeah.

2181
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,160
The Sector Keeper.

2182
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,160
We weren't planning on having him.

2183
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,360
He just popped in to tell us where we're going this episode.

2184
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,360
We got to get him in the room.

2185
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,760
Hey, Sector Keeper, what the fuck's going on?

2186
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,760
Boys, boys.

2187
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:15,760
Sector Keeper.

2188
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,760
Sector Keeper.

2189
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:17,760
Sector Keeper.

2190
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:18,760
What the hell's going on?

2191
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,000
What happened to Eva Anderson?

2192
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,080
I don't know, boys.

2193
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,280
Things aren't good.

2194
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,280
Things aren't good.

2195
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,280
It truly is an ordeal.

2196
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:33,400
I mean, I guess you said that there were evil spirits around these parts.

2197
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,840
Is that what was the evil spirits?

2198
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:36,840
They're nearby.

2199
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,840
But what?

2200
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,840
Boys, no, no.

2201
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,840
What's happening?

2202
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,840
He's changing.

2203
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:41,840
The Sector Keeper is more.

2204
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:42,840
It's Nick Valenti over here.

2205
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:43,840
Oh, my God.

2206
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:44,840
I don't know.

2207
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:45,840
I don't know.

2208
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,840
I don't know.

2209
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:47,840
I don't know.

2210
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,840
I don't know.

2211
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,840
I don't know.

2212
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,840
I don't know.

2213
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,840
I don't know.

2214
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,840
I don't know.

2215
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:53,840
I don't know.

2216
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:54,840
I don't know.

2217
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,840
I don't know.

2218
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,840
I don't know.

2219
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,840
I don't know.

2220
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,840
I don't know.

2221
01:25:58,840 --> 01:25:59,840
I don't know.

2222
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:00,840
I don't know.

2223
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:01,840
I don't know.

2224
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,840
Fuck you.

2225
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:03,840
Fuck you.

2226
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:04,840
Fuck you.

2227
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:05,840
I'm trying to open restaurants over here.

2228
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,840
The Sector Keeper has been demonet possessed by New York restaurateur Nick Valenti.

2229
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:07,840
Oh, this makes sense at the end of three stages in a video game.

2230
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:08,840
This is like a boss.

2231
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:09,840
This is what the boss is talking about.

2232
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:10,840
This is the boss.

2233
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:11,840
This is Nick Valenti.

2234
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2235
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,840
I'm walking over here.

2236
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,840
Oh, my gosh.

2237
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,840
He's a real New Yorker.

2238
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,840
That is no place.

2239
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:25,160
That attitude is no place here in Anaheim and the Anaheim Resort District.

2240
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,000
Look at me, Scott.

2241
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Look at me.

2242
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,920
I'm a man who opens restaurants, okay?

2243
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:41,120
I was a goddamn CEO selling pizza, pasta, et cetera.

2244
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,120
Yes, were.

2245
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,120
You were.

2246
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,120
That's the key word.

2247
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,160
And you're not part of Patina anymore.

2248
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,160
But I should be.

2249
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,160
Yeah.

2250
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,160
A snake.

2251
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,480
There was a snake in the grass and he took my place.

2252
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,480
What are you talking about?

2253
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:53,480
Joaquin's fochal?

2254
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:54,480
Joaquin's fochal.

2255
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,480
Everyone knows.

2256
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,480
It's his recipe.

2257
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:00,280
He's the mastermind behind this whole thing.

2258
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:01,280
Anyone could get in the kitchen.

2259
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,280
Who are you?

2260
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,280
You're my goddamn mom.

2261
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,280
No, we're not.

2262
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,280
We're Scott, Jason, and Mike.

2263
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,280
I don't even understand that.

2264
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,280
No, we are not.

2265
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,280
And we respect the craft of the cooking of chef's.

2266
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,280
I don't even understand that.

2267
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,280
No, we are not.

2268
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:17,760
And we respect the craft of the cooking of chef Joaquin's fochal.

2269
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,760
And I don't respect you.

2270
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:22,440
You know, New York businessmen are running amok through this world.

2271
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,520
And it's about time that people like you be stopped.

2272
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,520
If I could get my friend Giuliani on you right now.

2273
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:31,520
My best friend.

2274
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,520
Whoa, your best friend is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani?

2275
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,520
More like brother.

2276
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,880
That's the kind of person you hang out with.

2277
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,720
That's not a person you want to be associated with today.

2278
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:46,280
Listen up, you three little assholes come around.

2279
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:48,600
Carefully, he's got a pizza paddle.

2280
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,600
That's right.

2281
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,600
I got a pizza paddle.

2282
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,880
Oh God, to put in the wood burning ovens?

2283
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:53,880
He's going to spank us with the paddle?

2284
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,880
I'm trying to spank over here.

2285
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,120
Oh God, he barely missed me.

2286
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,120
Oh no.

2287
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,640
Hey, sit still.

2288
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,920
Okay, now I'm going to spank you.

2289
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,720
No, I don't want to sit still.

2290
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,720
Move your toys off the shelf.

2291
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,720
Let's sit on the shelf.

2292
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,720
Jason, why are you pointing your butt at him?

2293
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:16,720
Do you want to get spanked?

2294
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:17,720
Well, I don't know.

2295
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,720
I don't want to be a distraction.

2296
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:19,720
Anyway, we've got items.

2297
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,720
We've got items to stop him.

2298
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,720
Oh, that's right.

2299
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:27,200
We've been getting the sector keeper whose body you are stealing right now.

2300
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,520
He gave us things to help us.

2301
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,480
We're going to defeat that paddle and we're going to defeat you.

2302
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,480
What do we have?

2303
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,360
What do we have in the inventory?

2304
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:41,240
We have three black aprons from Starbucks and a side loaf of sourdough bread signed

2305
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,360
by Nancy Silverton and Mark Peele.

2306
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,360
Let's put on the aprons as protection.

2307
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,360
Everyone put on the aprons.

2308
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,360
Silverton and Peele.

2309
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:50,800
I'm trying to open restaurants over here.

2310
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,080
Are there other restaurants you're opening now?

2311
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,560
Are you partnering with Rudolph Giuliani in any way?

2312
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:58,760
Yeah, me and Rudy are going to open a restaurant.

2313
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:00,240
Where?

2314
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,240
Downtown Manhattan.

2315
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,080
Wall Street.

2316
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,400
Rokers only.

2317
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:12,720
Oh man, you're going to kick some good old fashioned porn theaters out and mom and pops

2318
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,720
will be out on the street.

2319
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:18,080
We're cleaning up the city and we're serving pizza to the top one percent.

2320
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,560
Only for the one percent.

2321
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,400
Gold leaf pizza?

2322
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,960
Gold leafs instead of pepperonis?

2323
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,560
Is that what we're talking about?

2324
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,560
That's right.

2325
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:31,360
In that famous street, Wall Street located in downtown Manhattan.

2326
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,280
Manhattan, Wall Street.

2327
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,280
Never heard of it.

2328
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,280
Yeah.

2329
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,280
Buy sell, bitch.

2330
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,280
Jesus.

2331
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,280
Yeah.

2332
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:43,040
You're probably going to have oregano that's shaved off of rainforest trees.

2333
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:47,000
You probably scorch the Brazilian rainforest just to get your oregano.

2334
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,840
Oh yeah, I live for that shit.

2335
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,560
What is Giuliani going to actually be doing at this restaurant?

2336
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,560
He's going to be tossing pies.

2337
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,560
You're going to be able to watch him through a window.

2338
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,680
It'll be like a little show.

2339
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,480
He'll make the pie in front of you.

2340
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:04,560
And if you say Rudy, Rudy, he'll wink at you and give you a finger gun.

2341
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,560
Whoa, really?

2342
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:08,560
Honestly, that actually sounds interesting to me.

2343
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,560
It's a better thing than being a lawyer.

2344
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:12,880
I think you'll be better at it.

2345
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:17,920
Every dollar spent there goes to a super PAC to reelect the greatest president.

2346
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:18,920
Oh no.

2347
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:19,920
No.

2348
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,920
No.

2349
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:21,920
All right.

2350
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,320
So beyond saving Eva, beyond saving ourselves, we've got to save the world.

2351
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:28,280
Trump's going to get a third term if we don't stop this guy.

2352
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,280
Yeah.

2353
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,280
Okay.

2354
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,280
Abrons on, boys.

2355
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,280
Abrons on.

2356
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,280
Tie him on tight.

2357
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,080
Someone beam it with this sourdough bread while I stick my little bottom out.

2358
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:39,000
Jason, yeah, toss him with your little bottom.

2359
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,160
Oh yeah, look at that little bottom.

2360
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,520
I want to spank it with my pizza paddle.

2361
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,520
Oh, he's leaning in.

2362
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,520
He's leaning in.

2363
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,520
He's leaning in.

2364
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,520
Take the bread, Scott.

2365
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,520
I'm going to sneer and give it to you.

2366
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:51,320
The bread, it's crusty on the outside and stale, so it's extra hard.

2367
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,320
I like you.

2368
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:53,680
You smell like pizza.

2369
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:54,680
Well, usually.

2370
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:57,240
All right, here we go.

2371
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,240
Right on the back of the head.

2372
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:03,240
Oh, Scott, I'm going to get it again.

2373
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:04,240
Again.

2374
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,240
Again.

2375
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,240
Again.

2376
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,240
And again.

2377
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,240
But we just got to be careful, though.

2378
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,240
This is actually the sector keepers body.

2379
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,240
That's right.

2380
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,240
Oh, no.

2381
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,240
Okay.

2382
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,240
Okay.

2383
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,240
You can.

2384
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:18,240
Wait, I'll use it.

2385
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:19,240
Wait, I'll use the crack it open.

2386
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:24,080
I'll use the sourdough inside to patch open the parts of the sector keeper that I split

2387
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,080
apart.

2388
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,080
Good as new.

2389
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,080
Sourdough.

2390
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,080
Sourdough.

2391
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,080
I love him.

2392
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,080
Hey, quick question.

2393
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:35,080
What was the name of the restaurant you were going to start with him?

2394
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:39,640
I just wanted to know really quick before your spirit left the sector keepers body before

2395
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:40,640
to do it.

2396
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,640
He wrote is really good.

2397
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:44,640
It's good.

2398
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,640
It's really good.

2399
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,640
Good name.

2400
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,640
These are teas.

2401
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:48,640
D. Yeah.

2402
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:49,640
Yeah.

2403
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:54,640
Hey, I'm dying over here.

2404
01:31:54,640 --> 01:32:03,960
Boys, boys, boys, what happened?

2405
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,800
I'm not sure.

2406
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,640
You seem fine.

2407
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:10,560
I don't think anybody bangs your head in.

2408
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:15,240
My skull is half red.

2409
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:16,240
Yeah.

2410
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:17,240
We do.

2411
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,320
You sort of spazzed out and we took it.

2412
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,320
It's an enhancement.

2413
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,120
A lot of people are doing these days.

2414
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,120
They're using dough.

2415
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,440
It's actually safer than skin and skull.

2416
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,560
Boys, boys, are you okay?

2417
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,760
You look shaken up.

2418
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,080
You're wearing the aprons.

2419
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,080
Yeah.

2420
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,280
The master brewer aprons.

2421
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:35,280
Yeah.

2422
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:39,880
We use to take down somebody who doesn't respect the work of chef.

2423
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:40,880
Yeah.

2424
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,720
Jason, you can not present your little bottom anymore.

2425
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:46,040
Just use it now.

2426
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,360
This one's wearing only aprons.

2427
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,560
Well, we didn't have to strip.

2428
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,560
Yeah, you stripped.

2429
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:53,400
Well, I suffer for my art.

2430
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:56,120
What are you going to do?

2431
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,120
Okay.

2432
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:03,920
The point is, Sectorkeeper, you were inhabited by a ghastly being and it's so good to see

2433
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,320
you again.

2434
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:07,560
And I just, are you feeling okay?

2435
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,560
Can you count to 10?

2436
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,560
Is everything you're not seeing crooked?

2437
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,560
I'm feeling okay.

2438
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,560
Okay.

2439
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,800
In fact, for some reason, you've given me strength.

2440
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,840
Well, so it was actually, I helped him actually.

2441
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,320
Yeah, I guess it was 10.

2442
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,320
Good.

2443
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,680
We seem to have dissipated somewhere.

2444
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,680
I don't know where, but they're not gone, boys.

2445
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,680
Oh no.

2446
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,800
But I have an inventory item for you.

2447
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:35,080
I just received a text message from the level keeper.

2448
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,240
Yes, the level keeper.

2449
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:38,240
Yes, the level keeper.

2450
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:43,720
He or she had one text message left today from their cricket wireless prepaid phone.

2451
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:46,400
Their precious last text on us.

2452
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,200
What an honor.

2453
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:52,480
Guys, I grant you two pizzas.

2454
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:56,920
Wait, there's a little note, a little post-it note.

2455
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:01,480
It says I grant Jason two pizzas from Tootie Rudy.

2456
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,480
What?

2457
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:03,480
Wow.

2458
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:07,000
The defunct restaurant Nick Valenti and Rudy Giuliani were going to open?

2459
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,320
Yes, just for you though.

2460
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,560
Beta tested pizza.

2461
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,560
That's great.

2462
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,120
Wow, hand tossed by Rudy Giuliani?

2463
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,200
That's what I was going to ask.

2464
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,200
Guess so.

2465
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:19,440
He could put his hands on this pizza, I'm interested, but we can't eat, Scott and I

2466
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,440
can't eat it.

2467
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,000
We can't have the pizza, we can't have Rudy's pizza?

2468
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:29,840
No, no, just for Jason, but for you two, I have two pamphlets about the dangers of fornication.

2469
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,000
God damn it.

2470
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
That's not as good.

2471
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,000
We just have to read a pamphlet while Jason only eats two pizzas?

2472
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,600
But look on the back, boys.

2473
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,400
It's endorsed by Rudy Giuliani.

2474
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,400
Well, that's good.

2475
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:48,800
He's been divorced so many times, he's no one to scold us about.

2476
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,080
Oh God.

2477
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:53,200
But look, he is America's mayor.

2478
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,920
He is and always will be.

2479
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,840
The future events don't erase that.

2480
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,200
All right, well I honor him with this and I'll read every word.

2481
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,400
And Jason, you ate every bite of that pizza.

2482
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,400
Not a problem.

2483
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:10,200
Wow, guys, we did it.

2484
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,880
We survived our first boss.

2485
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,240
Yeah, how about that?

2486
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,120
Geez, it wasn't so bad.

2487
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:19,640
No, it was pretty scary, but you look like you were having like a lot of fun.

2488
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:25,560
Honestly, we Scott, when you were when I was doing whatever I mean, the sector keeper and

2489
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:29,960
improving the state of his skull, I was just going to like say like maybe like talk to

2490
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:32,560
someone because it seems like there's some anger.

2491
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

2492
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:38,360
I feel perfectly calm and I direct my anger correctly.

2493
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:43,120
This one has sourdough on his hands.

2494
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:45,240
Usually it's Jason.

2495
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,240
I know.

2496
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,440
And like like you were white knuckling it too.

2497
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,760
Like it's under the skin.

2498
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:57,720
Well, I guess Jason's lust for food is only matched by my lust for blood.

2499
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,720
Fair.

2500
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,520
We're all lust for something.

2501
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,920
I'll consider trying to deal with this.

2502
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:09,640
But hey, keep in mind, if you need me to be violent with anybody for the rest of the rest

2503
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:12,200
of the ordeal, I'm your guy.

2504
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:16,400
You're like the bear Jew in Inclerious Basterds.

2505
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,240
You're the guy with the baseball bat that comes in.

2506
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,320
You're Negan on The Walking Dead.

2507
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,320
Hell yeah.

2508
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,920
It's a new addition to your character.

2509
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:25,920
All right.

2510
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:26,920
Yeah.

2511
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:27,920
Fuck yeah.

2512
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:28,920
Well, all right.

2513
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,920
Well, next time, next time, maybe next time we get some of these items, I'll like strap

2514
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,960
some to the other and yeah, you know, like nails on a baseball bat.

2515
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,320
I'm going to fuck somebody.

2516
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:43,040
I don't know who else is coming up down this down this in this ordeal, but future bosses,

2517
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,040
watch out.

2518
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:49,480
Yeah, let's just call.

2519
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:50,480
Actually I need to hear that.

2520
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,480
I need to calm down.

2521
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,480
Everyone needs a hit.

2522
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,920
What flavor we got today?

2523
01:36:54,920 --> 01:37:02,520
Today's oh, today's flavor is oh, I'm dizzy.

2524
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:05,800
Today's flavor is fun dip.

2525
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,800
Nice.

2526
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:07,800
That's fun.

2527
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:10,800
Scott's going to take some too.

2528
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,800
Mint.

2529
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:12,800
Fund it.

2530
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:13,800
Mint.

2531
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,800
Yes, they all have to be mint now.

2532
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,800
Lust for blood decreasing.

2533
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,800
Whoa.

2534
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,800
Whoa, man.

2535
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:18,800
Pass it down.

2536
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:19,800
Here you go.

2537
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,800
Hey, Jason.

2538
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,800
I got food in my mouth.

2539
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,800
Bring it back.

2540
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:23,800
It's all right.

2541
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,800
I can't do it.

2542
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,800
I wouldn't do it.

2543
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:26,800
All right.

2544
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,800
Well, who we survive.

2545
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,800
Oh, man, we survive podcasts.

2546
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,800
The ride down to San Disney ordeal level.

2547
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:30,800
What we did.

2548
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,800
This is our first time.

2549
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:36,800
Guys, yeah, we made it out.

2550
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,800
All right.

2551
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:45,800
So tomorrow we move to level two and we'll see what waits in store.

2552
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:50,800
Who knows if anything scary happens, I'll make him fucking bleed.

2553
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:51,800
Yeah, I.

2554
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:59,800
Hey, so hashtag DDO hashtag save the level keeper and hashtag cricket wire.

2555
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,800
And hashtag cricket wireless severance.

2556
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,800
No, sector keeper cricket wireless severance.

2557
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,800
Tweet that at cricket wireless.

2558
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,800
Not at us.

2559
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,800
Much appreciated.

2560
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:15,800
Well, let's keep let's keep hitting this shit and I'll get recharged for tomorrow.

2561
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:16,800
Yeah.

2562
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,800
See you tomorrow.

2563
