1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
...Dark!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Darkness falls out on the street, Evil rears its head.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Get your crazy shake to go, And your fried doughnut bread.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The villains threaten this sacred place, This downtown shopping mall.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We must defend the Lego store, And the Splitsville bowling balls.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, We must protect our AP discount meals.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The Downtown Disney or to you, What secrets does the Earl of Sandwich conceal?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Boys, boys, my cousin has been taken by evil forces that have inhabited Downtown Disney.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In order to find them, you will need to thoroughly discuss every aspect of the mall.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stores, restaurants, both of the Starbucks.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You have 15 daily very necessary episodes and what's to do so.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I will be there to guide you and keep your conversations from getting too off topic or boring.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The Downtown Disney ordeal, Why do we do this to ourselves?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Welcome to podcast the ride, the Downtown Disney ordeal level three, stage three.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm here.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
J.O.J. So I'm getting so out of it.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's another late night.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's another night for these ordeals.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah. Yeah.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I'm hitting a mental roadblocks where I'm forgetting that I have to say the name and then you talk.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah, because it identifies the name with the voice.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Old radio trick, I guess.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No, I know.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I know.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I know.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What?

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There's paradox.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What?

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Who is Mike and who is Scott?

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We've seen a lot on social media of people saying they cannot tell Scott's voice from mine.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then I'll see a lot of stories attributed to you or to me when it's actually the reverse.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So I guess from that, you know, maybe we should actually address that.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Maybe I should just do a different voice for the whole rest of the run of the podcast.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Maybe McGruff, maybe you will lose your voice.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Your throat will just disintegrate.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, maybe.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Maybe I will.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe I'll get used to it.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wait a minute, if you talk as McGruff the rest of the episode, maybe we'll get it done quicker.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, Mike McGruff, make it clear that you're a different person.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
OK.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There was a comment that was like where there was confusion over the voices and then I saw somebody say like, oh, come on, Scott is the one who sounds the dorkiest.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's be honest, everyone.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
OK.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Scott is the dorkiest dork.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
All right.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So let's that's how we know it.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And like, can we all just be honest with ourselves that Scott's the dork and now and all time I was like, maybe is it maybe it's not me.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Maybe they're confused.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's what I hope.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They could have been talking about me and they just don't know the voices.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, maybe.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I've been holding out hope.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you left that comment and clearly it's a place that I'm checking the comments.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let me know if you are so that confident that I am the dork.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But let's bring the fourth voice in to level three, stage three here, a pro of podcast, the right, a frequent guest as he loves to be called the Alec Baldwin of podcast, the right where that very proudly.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, I know.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm happy to say Jason Waller.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hello.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hello.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hey, guys.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thanks for having me back.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Very happy to be here.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Always happy to be included.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, sure.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, absolutely.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Sure.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And of course, whatever you want.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you for joining us for a real Nalyn's meal.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And you, though we're still recovering from our uvabar ballast point episode with Kyle, you have brought us beers again.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's another one recording late at night and you've brought us Nalyn's beer, Nalyn's brews.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I thought there was a chance.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So I was like, well, I have some white claws in case we want to have one.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But then Jason came in with three different plastic bags and like 18 beers.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wow.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And yeah, I don't know.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We don't have to drink all of them.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I went to Captain Corks in Los Feliz and just asked him whatever he had from New Orleans.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Put in the bags.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, yeah.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And there was that much.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Wow. They've got a beta. There are all beta beers and then Sazerac Rye, Sazerac both a cocktail and a brand of rye whiskey.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, that's interesting.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, really?

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
OK.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So it doesn't have anything to do with the cocktail?

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I think the cocktail traditionally uses Sazerac Rye and it was invented in New Orleans.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I thought it used cognac.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Is that right?

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I like that's what it said when I looked it up.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But Jason didn't have 24 hours to prepare for this.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So forgive his lack of knowledge on the topic.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I always thought Sazerac had rye in it because of the name.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, we'll figure that out.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You could have cognac too.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is every five.

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Or we'll drift off entirely because where it's another it's become another drinking one, I guess.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think we need it.

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This has been this is the again once again the name or deal correctly chosen.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll say as a listener and fan, it is an ordeal on this end as well.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There's a lot of content to get through.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah, I feel it more.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We didn't do like any of them short.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm glad.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you for your feedback.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is a rare opportunity to get feedback mid ordeal.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We know we can't address a lot of it because we've recorded a lot of what's coming already.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But if you had to give any any tips or notes.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm enjoying every minute of it.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But it is to wake up to like an hour and a half new stuff every day is a lot to I just know I'm not going to.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And you're not you're not working in Pomona right now.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You don't have a massive commute.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've got about a 20 minute drive to where I'm working right now.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I did Eva's episode.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I had to do some of it on one and a half speed.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
To be perfectly honest.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No, how dare you, sir.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is art and you do we dictate the speed.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I wanted to finish it before I saw you guys that night.

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So I think I sped up a little bit.

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Is it easier to tell Scott and I's voice apart on one and a half speed?

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Would that help?

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Or would it make it just the same?

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I go way up.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, it makes you less dorky.

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I was going to say to Scott, I'm not I'm so cool as long as you do it at one point five.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He comes the coolest chipmunk in town.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The dorkiest human.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But if I was hanging with Alvin and the gang.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It looks like some recipes call for cognac and some call for rye whiskey.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The main ingredients being two different kinds of bitters and a muddled sugar cube.

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Lemon peel and absinthe.

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Absinthe is the big absinthe.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
As long as we're correcting things.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Jason Ballast Point Sculpin is available for twelve dollars at Trader Joe's.

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So the price Trader Joe's also drops their price.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't know what that means.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's not a we shouldn't relive.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm saying yes, I do think they're fair.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But compared to like a liquor store or in some parts of the country, beverage distributor, which is where you have to go in some states to buy beer.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I have a lot to say about this, but I will refrain for the.

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Jason's screaming getting Jason got so mad at me when he said, what did he say?

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What was the grapefruit line he said in the episode to go?

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Apparently, who cares about grapefruit?

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's war.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You didn't swear in there about grapefruit.

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He said I was arguing about craft IPA's and the different like fluctuation and prices.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It was a big fight.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A big fight was a big fight broke out.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But we're kind of calm today by the presence of one of our great recent inspirations.

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What is going to be?

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So Mr.

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Plus is out in the background.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm trying to put we have Mr.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Bugatti playing without the sound on just to in case you haven't seen online, there's a big movement to confuse the Disney Plus algorithm and to get Disney to realize that there's a huge market or think that there's a huge market for Mr.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Bugatti and hopefully launch a cinematic universe or just launch a TV series.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You guys even playing it on loop all day here.

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I have not.

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But I figured that I started in the evening.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I can't see this, but there's a message has come up and says you've reached your Bugatti limits of the day.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Please check out the Mandalorian.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
They're forcing you in.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We are taking control.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's a Mandalorian.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If you like Mr.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Bugatti, you have to watch the Mandalorian.

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
A video from Bob Iger comes up.

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Hi, I'm Bob Iger.

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You've been watching a lot of Mr.

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Bugatti.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We've noticed we're going to ask you to watch some of the other programming on Disney Plus.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
My company has spent a lot of money on a certain series and we'd appreciate if you'd respect our wishes.

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We all appreciate this funny joke.

182
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We're ahead of you.

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We get it.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Believe me.

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, we think it's very funny.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We purchased the Bugatti franchise from under director, Oz Scott.

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He gave it over plenty willingly.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
When he showed us his plans for the third film, we laughed and said we're going to go another way.

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is Oz Scott still alive?

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Have we checked?

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I believe so.

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Does sound like a fake name of a director.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
From the 80s.

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, he is.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We've looked him up.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oz Scott's around, the shepherd of the Bugatti franchise, and eventually he'll be trotted out at forced appearances when

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Bugatti's Edge is built at Disney Parks Worldwide.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes, I love it very much.

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's like Mr. Bugatti on acid.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So, yeah, as you said, this is a campaign started by our friend and past guest Van Roba Show to really try to make Disney think that there is a strong desire for Mr. Bugatti.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And now all of the green light decisions have been AI'd and automated, so they may have to make more.

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
There may be no say in it, no human voice involved, that someone would get an email being like, okay, on the slate is a new Bugatti.

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No one decided.

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, it just shows up.

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We have to do this now.

207
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
People get a memo.

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There's a release date, summer 2022, and then it's, okay, well, here we go.

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, everyone just wakes up and finds out what the new things are.

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And then the robot starts writing the script that writes all the like live action reboot movies that aren't anything.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They're scanning Richard Mazer's face.

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So if he dies, he can still do.

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I forget if he's Mr. Bugatti, if that's the dad or Mr. Bugatti.

214
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Mr. Bugatti, by the way, we should say is a film from 1986.

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It was on like the magical world of Disney and Eisner did an intro for it.

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It seems like it has a strong presence in people's minds and hearts.

217
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So they've cut out all the Eisner.

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They're not framing any of this.

219
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, it's all.

220
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hello.

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We Google.

222
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I mean, I searched Eisner just in the search bar and there's like nothing.

223
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Nothing.

224
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He's just been wiped from his memory.

225
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Or is there some piece of Eisner content anywhere on Disney Plus?

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Not that they've marked it at least or maybe.

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah.

228
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah.

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So perhaps he snuck into something, but there's no, there should obviously be like a best of Eisner because they have like, you know, they've different boxes that say like Star Wars, Marvel.

230
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Once you just say Eisner and it should just be his face and you click on it and it's all of his greatest hits.

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
His greatest intros.

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah.

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Perhaps his greatest intro.

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Sorry.

235
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No, I was going to say, did you mean Josh Gad?

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No, I didn't mean Gad.

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Stop trying to guide me algorithm.

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
All right, we'll play Gad.

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There's like a deep fake where like Michael Eisner, you click on him, it's Michael Eisner for a second and then he puts a Mandalorian helmet on.

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And then the show just starts.

241
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You want to see Michael Eisner? Very fascinating, huh? Like no, Goldblum, no, not everything can be according to you. Get away.

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It is. Thinking about though the Mandalorian, the idea that the secret is that it's Michael Eisner under the helmet is pretty good.

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Maybe.

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That would be a really good twist.

245
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Anything is on the table.

246
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You know, we also in Checking the Socials, there were apparently people who were upset that we didn't support their cause of the Apple dumpling gang being the first thing to watch.

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, right.

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The algorithm and I'm in support of that too.

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm all in support of throwing off the algorithm.

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We're not supporting you.

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
To me, this feels like a Sanders Warren kind of thing.

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I like both.

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I like both.

254
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think they're, you know, they're both fine.

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There's one clear choice.

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They're both great.

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
One of them voted for Reagan twice.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Just a player in the game, you know?

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Either the point is the point is the Dublin gang doesn't want to abolish ice.

260
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's fine.

261
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Look, it's like they say not not boogity us.

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Not him.

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What you're finding is I don't pay as much attention to politics as I do.

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You know, Mr.

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Boogity on the day to day.

266
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What the point is, clearly, the Mandalorian is Biden.

267
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So we're all in it together.

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We're all trying to overthrow what people think is the obvious choice.

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And that if you kind of stop and think about it, it's a little dull.

270
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's a little sleepy.

271
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It doesn't maybe have the freshest ideas.

272
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And that's why we just have to unite behind a voice for change.

273
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Leading out of one eye.

274
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Teeth are falling out of its mouth.

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Mandalorian is like sniffing Jabba's dancers hair.

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Can't stop.

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Can I just say because this is sort of like I'm going to say this now since

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
we're talking about Disney Plus and then we can throw it to the sector keeper

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
for what what is in this.

280
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes, we should.

281
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Can we just cancel?

282
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Let's talk about this is great.

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can do both.

284
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We so kind of annexed into this stage the Disney Plus activation booth.

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes, while we all went down together to go see it and we're quickly informed

286
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
that well, folks, we're not online right now.

287
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This is not working.

288
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, yeah.

289
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It really was a display booth for the Rick at Ralph themed error message that is

290
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
displayed on Disney Plus because that's what the monitors were showing us.

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So you could fiddle around with the user interface, but you could not sign up

292
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
there, Scott.

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You were able to get a free button.

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I did.

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I told I swore that I had signed up earlier in the day.

296
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So they gave me a button.

297
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This was on the day of the launch.

298
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We were at I hate to brag, but we were all together at the official booth on

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
the official launch day of Disney Plus.

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And I got a button commemorating it.

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And I think that is where they launched it from.

302
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's where they get the red button was there.

303
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah.

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So they the whole the whole Disneyland Resort surged with energy.

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That little line that comes out of the logo shot up out of the out of the booth

306
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
for iPad pros like that.

307
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's what it's running on there.

308
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was just going to say there were two this happened twice.

309
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You excitedly to an employee of downtown Disney, that guy.

310
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And then I think the person in one of the places we're going to talk about today,

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
you excitedly said about, you know, the McClunky thing.

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Greedo said McClunky.

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Do you know about McClunky?

314
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah.

315
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And you said it in excess so excited and the person just really like yes times

316
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
looked like you were out of your mind.

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's weird.

318
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's weird that a 60 year old Disney employee doesn't know everything as soon

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
as it happens and everyone's already made things that are very popular on Twitter

320
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
only.

321
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Don't you know this is three hours old already on Twitter?

322
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's all over.

323
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah.

324
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
McClunky.

325
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Well, you feel free to explain.

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Well, just people noticed when Disney Plus launched, they watched Star Wars

327
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
New Hope and the famous Greedo scene where Han kills Greedo.

328
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's been changed about 10 times by George Lucas.

329
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It had been changed again.

330
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And this time they kind of both shoot at each other at the same time.

331
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But and that's like that that's kind of happened in the last cut, I believe.

332
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But the difference this time was that Greedo says McClunky and then he dies.

333
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
McClunky.

334
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
McClunky.

335
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And then he has shots and then Greedo's dead.

336
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And everyone was like, what the hell is this?

337
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Everybody's wondering who's going to shoot first in this one.

338
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Let's go straight to that scene.

339
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Will it be answer A or answer B?

340
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And then it was a C or really a X or a Z that nobody could have ever guessed.

341
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah.

342
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
McClunky.

343
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And now we have a word that we know has been gifted to us from George Lucas in 2012.

344
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
He gave us the word McClunky.

345
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think, yeah.

346
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So George, yeah, it came out that this was not because some people were upset about it,

347
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
thought Disney was fucking around with Star Wars again.

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But it was George Lucas before he sold the company.

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He wanted to add a very important piece of dialogue to Star Wars, McClunky.

350
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And he did it.

351
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And then he handed it off to Disney.

352
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah.

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So I guess, yeah, that was his last little gift to us.

354
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The gift of McClunky, which I like.

355
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I will be on record.

356
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not the first person to say that, but I like McClunky.

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah.

358
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm into it.

359
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It was making me smile all day.

360
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So at the Disney Plus sign up booth, the guy is like, oh, yeah.

361
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So you signed up, huh?

362
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Have you watched The Mandalorian?

363
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And I said, no.

364
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Do you know about McClunky?

365
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So it's this new thing that Greedo says when, and then almost the same thing happened as

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
we were being led into Ralph Burnham's Jazz Kitchen where somebody saw, the hostess saw

367
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
my button and like, oh, Disney, have you watched The Mandalorian yet?

368
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And I said, no.

369
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you know about McClunky?

370
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And in both cases, they didn't even say, I don't know what you're talking about or I'm

371
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
confused.

372
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
They just didn't say anything.

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah.

374
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It was eerie.

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
They were scared of you.

376
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I think so.

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes.

378
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,800
I feel like they were all like hitting silent panic buttons.

379
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,000
They were all trained to ask, how about The Mandalorian?

380
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Clearly.

381
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yes.

382
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,880
Here's a way you can personalize your guest interactions today on the day of the launch.

383
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,560
And I found the code that shut down the Disney robots.

384
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,360
Like if you needed to bring a Westworld robot in for repair, that's like the secret code

385
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,600
to get them to like shut down and be malleable so you can take them backstage.

386
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I think that's what happened.

387
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,960
The secret word is McClunky and everybody, all the cyborgs melted.

388
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,240
They were probably like, is this some like racist code that's going to get me in trouble?

389
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Who are you?

390
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Can I just get you to say McClunky?

391
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
Could I film it?

392
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
Hey, just say it.

393
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
It's a fun thing.

394
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Yeah, it's cool.

395
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Just need to throw it on 4chan.

396
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,520
You'll be a star overnight.

397
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,920
The Disney Plus Activation booth is where I learned about an unsettling, what I'll call

398
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,480
unsettling series.

399
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,760
Apparently there's a bunch of shorts to tie into Toy Story 4 called Forky Asks a Question.

400
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,560
And real big, and this is on the sample like browsing.

401
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,520
I don't even think that was like the fold like Disney Plus, but the sample provided

402
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,040
is Forky Asks a Question colon.

403
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,000
What is money?

404
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,560
And the explanation, Ham attempts to give Forky a lesson on how the US monetary system

405
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,640
works.

406
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,400
So that might be one of the bleakest pieces of entertainment I have ever seen.

407
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,960
Hey, you know what I got to tell you, we shouldn't tax those billionaires.

408
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
That's what I think.

409
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,440
You know, corporations shouldn't be taxed at all.

410
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Don't you think, Forky?

411
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,840
That's a big, you know, you worked hard enough.

412
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,640
Any four year olds watching this, may this influence your future voting.

413
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,760
Listen to me, listen to Ham.

414
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Did you watch it?

415
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,400
No, I don't think I don't think I wish I watched it.

416
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,520
Yeah, I'm sure there were definitely themes.

417
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:45,720
I so this, well, we're doing exactly what we Jason, what you say with it.

418
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,400
We're adding to an exhaustive amount of kind of, we are telling you, I'm cherishing every

419
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,800
minute of I didn't mean like we should make this one shorter.

420
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,960
We can't shortchange it all the way here.

421
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,040
It's got to be a minimum two and a half hours.

422
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,920
But that being said, now this while this technically was what we all said was part of the stage,

423
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,640
because this was a surprise thing on the stage.

424
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,480
So I don't hear any fucking coughing from the sector keeper because it was on point.

425
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,880
But let's hear the rest of what we're supposed to talk about.

426
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Where are we going today?

427
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:27,160
Boys, boys, today's stage includes Wonder Ground Gallery, Disney Home, and Ralph Brennan's

428
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,840
Jazz Kitchen.

429
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,520
Good luck, boys.

430
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,680
Boys, boys.

431
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,280
Wait a minute.

432
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,840
OK, so that's all great.

433
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
And we're going to do all that.

434
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
But you know what?

435
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,960
There was one at this stage was hopping when we all went because not only was the surprise

436
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,720
of the Disney Plus booth, but also there was a magic show clearly within the confines of

437
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,360
our so we didn't even have to annex it.

438
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,440
It was happening and breaking out when we got there.

439
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,920
So a magician setting up.

440
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,600
He had also an iPad with a countdown on it.

441
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,640
Maybe the longest two minutes of my life.

442
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,240
He called us hipsters at some point.

443
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,400
He called us hipsters even though he was the one wearing the pork pie hat, the three piece

444
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
suit.

445
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:31,520
Well, my main memory of it is that we had a dinner reservation in probably six minutes.

446
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,400
And we asked when does the magic show start?

447
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,480
And he said five minutes and or maybe a lot.

448
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,640
Maybe it was maybe flip that.

449
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,720
And Jason, you were like, OK, let's get out of here.

450
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,920
You were like, you cannot have been more.

451
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
So hungry.

452
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
You were so.

453
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Oh, no.

454
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,360
I said, I go, yeah, I go, you know, they let you, you know, they let you get in if you're

455
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,720
like 10 minutes past the reservation.

456
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
You go, no, they will.

457
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,880
No, that's going to be a problem.

458
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,200
And I said, oh, I thought before you've not been so concerned, you said, no, I'm always

459
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
concerned about the reservation.

460
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,720
I like to call ahead.

461
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,560
I don't think that's big enough.

462
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,320
You said that I call ahead.

463
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,920
I do call ahead.

464
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,840
This didn't seem worthy to call him.

465
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,120
But also, I didn't know everyone seemed on different irony levels.

466
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,720
So I didn't know if we were playing along or if we were watching this guy or if we were

467
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,600
like, no, we're going to dinner.

468
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Come on.

469
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,160
You know, watch those levels again, Mike.

470
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Jason's getting hot.

471
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,160
He just went like what you did.

472
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,080
You just did a fucking impression of me so I can match it.

473
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Sure.

474
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,560
That was fairly accurate to my memory.

475
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,120
Yeah, you were really like exploded.

476
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,280
Yeah, I didn't want to be there.

477
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,160
So I was expressing my emotions.

478
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,640
What do you mean you didn't want to see a magic show?

479
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,000
You're choosing magic over dinner.

480
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,680
This content is plenty reasonable.

481
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,520
This downtown Disney is so goddamn dry.

482
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,840
These stores aren't fun.

483
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
They're not interesting.

484
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,920
The least that could have happened is we saw five minutes of magic so we could have talked

485
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,200
about it and goofed around.

486
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,880
And you were like, no, no more fun stuff to talk about.

487
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,480
And we were near ballast point.

488
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,520
You saw the words ballast point and made you think about those extra three dollars that

489
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
you didn't want to spend.

490
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,080
So you're agitated from that.

491
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,720
It's all salt piling up.

492
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,520
So we had to do we said five minutes of the show.

493
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,640
Getting grief from you two very normal people.

494
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,200
The most normal men.

495
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,000
I take your stand without going back to your normal ways.

496
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,960
Let's hear it.

497
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,360
We need content.

498
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,440
The magic man was content.

499
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,800
We had to we did have to.

500
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
That's a very good point.

501
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,040
We watch a minute of it.

502
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,360
I didn't know what I was expecting.

503
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,800
Well, he did tell us we you can watch a whole thing or you can watch two minutes.

504
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,000
Oh, yeah, that was a very low self-esteem kind of like, yeah, fellas, I know you don't

505
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,600
want to see this, but like bodies drop bodies like just hang out for a few seconds.

506
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,200
Yes, that was the vibe.

507
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:03,640
And he he was hooked up by a wireless head mounted mic to the speakers that were on the

508
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
things.

509
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
And so we waited two minutes.

510
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,080
We're just counting and watching the seconds go down.

511
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,080
And he starts this kind of corny show.

512
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,760
And who does he who does he pick?

513
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,280
He's like, I need a volunteer and just zeros in on the angriest human being watching him.

514
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,280
And then we all look to you like here it goes.

515
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:32,400
And you it is the sharpest daggers you stare as if you we might help you get out of it.

516
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,280
And instead, of course, we go, yeah, forward.

517
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,120
It felt like you stood there for 30 seconds.

518
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,320
You really hung back.

519
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,680
You hung back instead of just being like, oh, that's funny.

520
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
I should go do this.

521
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
That'll be funny story.

522
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Whatever.

523
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,960
I swear it was one, two, three, four, five, six and so on.

524
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,640
My therapist helped me practice deep breathing exercises.

525
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,400
Yeah, but I'll help a guy out.

526
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,560
I'm not crazy about audience participation, but I did it.

527
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
He did it very graciously.

528
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,560
And he did a very good card trick.

529
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
You were gaining once you did it.

530
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,040
Can you describe what the card trick?

531
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,800
I don't remember the specifics very well.

532
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:17,320
It was a classic set up of pick a card, show it to the audience, don't show it to me, shuffling

533
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,120
the deck, put it back in the deck, pull out the card.

534
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,320
Oh, it's obviously the my card was the 10 of diamonds.

535
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
He shows everyone.

536
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
This is your card.

537
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
It's a five of clubs.

538
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
Right.

539
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,080
Like they get out my card and yeah.

540
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,200
And then he he reaches into his pocket and pulls out.

541
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,800
He pulled he pulls out the five of clubs from his pocket.

542
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,120
And then I turned the car over in my hand and it was the 10 of diamonds.

543
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Great trick.

544
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Great trick.

545
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

546
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
You did a good job.

547
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Fine.

548
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Great trick.

549
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:58,440
Well, look, we're all we're all skewed because we've all seen a saucer appear in a small

550
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
room.

551
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
We've seen a creature.

552
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Yes.

553
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Yeah.

554
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Yeah.

555
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,200
What would you say the greatest trick you've ever seen of all magic tricks?

556
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
I mean, I think it's that finale at the Copperfield show.

557
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,160
That was truly miraculous.

558
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
The UFO.

559
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,400
I've seen it three times that I've cried every time.

560
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
I cried.

561
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
I cried tears.

562
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
I cried tears.

563
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,920
You really gifted us that entire episode.

564
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Yeah, yeah.

565
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
We really should thank you for that.

566
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,560
And our awareness of the whole thing.

567
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Check it out on the Patreon.

568
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,480
If you guys, if you're not, if you're listening, you're not a Patreon subscriber and you're

569
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,440
in Vegas or you're not in Vegas, go to Vegas and see the David Copperfield show.

570
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,160
I don't know if you said that on the regular podcast.

571
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
I can't remember.

572
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,920
And then subscribe and then, and then listen to that episode.

573
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,240
Cause it's a great discussion of it.

574
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,320
And then just kind of try not to think about some of the more problematic parts of David

575
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Copperfield's life.

576
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Well, he, they went away and I assume for nefarious reasons.

577
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Yeah.

578
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,520
Like, uh, Jeff Goldblum says, if you haven't been convicted in the court of law, you've

579
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,040
done nothing wrong.

580
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,560
And Jeff Goldblum now is one of the major stars of Disney Plus.

581
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Right.

582
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,800
So you can trust him as much as you can trust Mickey Mouse.

583
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,680
And that's the end of that story.

584
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
Yeah.

585
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Life finds a way.

586
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:24,280
I guess we should say also, by the way, just as we're heading into this stage, uh, because

587
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:30,480
a fellow fan of, of, of Copperfield and who was with us earlier in the ordeal.

588
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,480
And I know as your friend, Eva Anderson, you mean you heard the episode you like she, she

589
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
disappeared.

590
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,720
She is speaking of Matt, she's gone and we don't know what it was.

591
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,400
I've been texting her and no response since I, since that, whatever that is.

592
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Oh Jesus.

593
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,640
Cause we're too scared to text her.

594
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,360
So we do, we just kind of like, we're worried.

595
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
And that was it.

596
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,360
I mean, I want to check on her, but what if like, what if we didn't, some, whoever has

597
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,920
her sees the texts and then comes to get us.

598
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,000
I just don't want to feel guilty.

599
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,360
So yeah, I've just kind of put it out of my mind.

600
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,400
Like you just, you're just leaving her.

601
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,000
You just, I mean, I'm not doing anything either.

602
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm concerned.

603
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,120
I'm worrying about it, but worrying isn't doing anything.

604
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,920
I guess you would want us to do the boogity challenge.

605
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,680
So that's what she would want.

606
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Yeah.

607
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Challenge.

608
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
What if Mr. Boogity has her?

609
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,960
Oh, is that where it's headed?

610
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Who knows?

611
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
It could be.

612
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,800
There's all that we can promise to taught concise storytelling ahead in this ordeal,

613
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,320
but we can't tell you what's happening.

614
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
It is weird.

615
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,920
I'll say it is weird that our friend was sitting right where I am now and just, I guess disappeared.

616
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,880
Is that spot, does it make you feel like being in a murder house or something?

617
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Yeah.

618
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Yeah.

619
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
A little bit.

620
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,800
You can sort of feel the negative vibes, but it's not the only thing that makes me feel

621
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
like that.

622
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Sure.

623
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
What that means exactly.

624
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:59,640
I don't want to, I say that to say, uh, it said that we're in a, a, a boss level, a boss

625
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,200
stage right now.

626
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,920
So I let's learn the lesson of, of Eva.

627
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:11,320
If we never see her again, let her be a patron saint for a hasty guest escapes.

628
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,700
You should, as soon as we're done here, you should get the fuck out because I don't want

629
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
you to.

630
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,400
Now I'm going to run as soon as we've discussed everything in great detail.

631
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Sure.

632
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Yes.

633
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,680
I'm going to book before whatever.

634
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,040
And that's like, if that takes an hour and a half, two hours, it doesn't matter.

635
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,800
But I think it's once we're wrapping up.

636
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Yeah.

637
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Oh, could be.

638
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
Absolutely.

639
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,040
I think that's what it takes because we're now heading into, we're still talking about

640
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,800
this when the sun comes up.

641
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,520
Are you able to upload the beginning part of it?

642
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,160
Uh, at a certain point on a switch to the feed, I'll switch the feed live.

643
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
Yes.

644
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Really?

645
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Yeah.

646
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
And then live 12 hour.

647
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
Right.

648
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,160
I think the studio 60 where they had to bud in to address the stolen joke.

649
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,560
And then again, for the feed in Australia or whatever, it's like the studio 60 episode.

650
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Yeah.

651
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,040
God, it could be our big clock.

652
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
The big clock.

653
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,320
It's ticking down, so we better hurry.

654
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,040
And we better hurry and get everybody's screaming and asking for a wonder grand gallery.

655
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Let's get to it.

656
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
Okay.

657
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Jason, let's just hear, let's hear Gil, go ahead and get them out.

658
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,280
Get all of your wonder grand gallery thoughts out.

659
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Jesus.

660
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,560
It's an art gallery where they sell Disney art, right?

661
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Yeah.

662
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,920
But kind of along the lines of for a younger crowd.

663
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Yeah.

664
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:32,400
It's sort of like the Etsy deviant art sort of like design influence.

665
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
That's what it is.

666
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,280
And that's what makes it so confusing that we're going to talk about it for 25 more minutes.

667
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,080
But you'd think maybe we could just get through it.

668
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,440
But you know, we do have to talk about.

669
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,120
Have any of you bought anything from there?

670
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,400
I bought, I think so.

671
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,480
I think I bought a print.

672
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,440
I know about Christmas gifts and stuff there because they they when they pick like a design,

673
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,560
they usually put on a print and a postcard and mugs and stuff like this design.

674
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,320
I clocked walking in, which I call Mickey and his items.

675
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,880
So it's Mickey Mouse.

676
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,520
It's a cute Mickey Mouse.

677
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,800
And some of the stuff is stuff Mickey has like hats he wears.

678
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,840
And some of it is classic merchandise.

679
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,280
Mickey has appeared on and you can get that as a print or you can get it as a little mug

680
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
as a cup.

681
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Mickey and his objects.

682
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Cool mug.

683
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
He and his items.

684
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Yeah.

685
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,280
Great.

686
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
I feel like I have gotten something here, but I can't remember what it was.

687
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,320
Well, you didn't get this here, but I did notice it there that the this the Funko Pop

688
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,480
of the Matterhorn car with the snowman in the car, which is now on display in your ever

689
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,580
growing Pop merch collection.

690
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:49,240
And this is where I got you the Splash Mountain Funkos, which are up there too, because I

691
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,880
texted you that, hey, someone on Twitter said these are in stock.

692
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,680
I'm a California adventurer.

693
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Should I go?

694
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,080
And he's like, go get me one.

695
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
Yeah, that's true.

696
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Well, I mean, the vehicle pops.

697
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,200
I don't want to get off on a thing.

698
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,200
A rant here is Dennis Miller might say you never.

699
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:15,240
I don't want to play a game of billiards using the earth as Dennis Miller might say, but

700
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,440
the fungal pops of the vehicles.

701
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,960
I'm way into the vehicle for whatever reason makes the pops better.

702
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,160
Like I the normal inherent pop fan.

703
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,320
But don't you think that the vehicle ones are better than sort of the normal ones?

704
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
And you know what?

705
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
I've been looking at that Splash Mountain one.

706
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,080
I don't even know that I could have told you that was a Funko.

707
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,680
I love a because it is its own toy.

708
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,920
That's what I think.

709
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,800
So like I got like the Madame Liotta I have, which is a different thing.

710
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,880
But the Funkos in general, if it's just like the cast of supernatural boring, it's just

711
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,120
the same flat Funko face.

712
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,460
But like these force the designers to actually create something new.

713
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,840
So like that's I think like that's the difference.

714
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,920
So that's why I like these better than the average.

715
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:01,560
Of course, I would have normally bought the supernatural toys if they looked better.

716
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
Ending after 16 seasons.

717
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
You love those brothers.

718
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,120
Because I love all 16 seasons of supernatural on the CW network.

719
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
No one knows what I'm talking about.

720
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
I don't know.

721
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
I didn't know that was that one.

722
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
You really watched all 16 seasons?

723
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,400
Have I rewatched them?

724
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Have you watched them all?

725
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,880
Oh, for the purposes of the bit, yes.

726
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Do you actually like this?

727
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
I don't know.

728
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
No, I don't.

729
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Okay.

730
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Okay.

731
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
It's hard to tell what's a good show or not.

732
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
Yeah, I don't know.

733
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,280
I have no idea except for there's only one truth in this world and it's Mr. Boogity.

734
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,800
And right now as we're looping it because it's on TV in front of us, the dad who's a

735
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:39,600
gag gift seller is holding a mummy, a flaccid mummy body.

736
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,720
Really kind of whole family of pranksters according to the description.

737
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,880
You think they shot this in one day?

738
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
This movie?

739
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:52,200
I think so because I was pointing out that Mr. Boogity doesn't move from his spot.

740
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,160
He stands on his mark and they kind of move around him.

741
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,800
Is it all in the house?

742
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
I think so.

743
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,400
It's one of those classic, just one night in a house kind of tales.

744
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,080
There's one scene where they're like on the way to the house.

745
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,440
Oh, now the piano is playing.

746
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,640
Now the piano is playing itself.

747
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:15,680
And the mummy that was just a toy or something, a dummy is now kind of like, you should really

748
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,320
be watching Mr. Boogity along with listening to this episode.

749
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,680
And to keep the Boogity challenge alive, there's disembodied hands clapping.

750
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
That's cool.

751
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,320
To keep the Boogity challenge alive, just be playing it in your house all the time.

752
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,580
I was going to say, could you go back and edit into when it restarted and put in one

753
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,080
of you guys saying, okay, start your Boogity's now.

754
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Yeah, we could.

755
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Yeah.

756
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,960
And then they'll be in Boogity sync with us.

757
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,120
Can you check time code, Mike?

758
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Yeah.

759
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,560
So this episode will serve as like a casual Mr. Boogity commentary, but we obviously will

760
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,040
do a real one as well.

761
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Yeah.

762
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
We're at 26, 27.

763
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
All right.

764
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm going to restart it now at 26, 27.

765
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,600
Mr. Boogity Disney Plus on three and then it'll be on the three I will start it.

766
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,200
So one, two, three, I'll start.

767
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,160
It should be one, two, Boogity, Boogity, boo.

768
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Okay.

769
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,520
But am I going to Boogity, Boogity, and then I start it right as we say boo or after the

770
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,520
boo?

771
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
On boo.

772
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
On boo.

773
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Okay.

774
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
One, two, Boogity, Boogity, boo, start.

775
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
Boo is start.

776
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
26, 27.

777
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
26, 27.

778
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,640
You should, there's the two actresses and one is yelling.

779
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Right.

780
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
Okay.

781
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
All right.

782
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
One, two, Boogity, Boogity, boo.

783
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
Oh, I hit it, but it didn't work.

784
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Yeah, you didn't know the other thing.

785
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Oh, shit.

786
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,640
Well, that's, oh God.

787
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,520
This is what happens when we drink beers when we record.

788
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
We need more beer too, actually.

789
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
I'm out of my beer.

790
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
Yeah.

791
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
So.

792
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Yeah, I'll do a haze.

793
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
I'll do whatever's in there.

794
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
We put four on ice.

795
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
They're probably all still cold.

796
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,120
If they're all still cold, it's fine.

797
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
So.

798
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,720
Wait, I'll try the Pecan.

799
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,120
There's a lot of different artists.

800
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,880
It's like Jason's our server at Ralph Brennan's Jazz Good.

801
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,880
A lot of different artists have their work displayed at the Wonder Ground Gallery.

802
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,480
Shag is like a big one.

803
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
A lot of Shag.

804
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
A lot of Shag influence.

805
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,200
A lot of like, it's very retro-y and like he'll do like T-Bird stuff and I like some

806
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,200
of that.

807
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,480
They had the print on demand kiosk where you can get attraction posters, but there was

808
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,800
no vintage ones.

809
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,320
It was all like new design.

810
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Really?

811
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,840
Because I've seen it where they were vintage on those.

812
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Yeah.

813
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
I've seen those clues before.

814
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
I like those.

815
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
I like the kiosks.

816
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,120
Those are good because you can have a real nice option, a lot of options.

817
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,780
And they show up at your house.

818
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,000
So there's an artist that Jason and I are very familiar, Jason Sheridan and I are very

819
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,600
familiar with named J. Scott Campbell.

820
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:34,880
And he drew comics, comics that we read growing up, famously Gen 13 and a comic called Danger

821
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Girl.

822
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,760
And there were both comics where he would draw, look it was the 90s.

823
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
It was the 90s.

824
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,560
And he would draw very like sexy girls and like these images imprinted on my brain at

825
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,560
the time.

826
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,040
It's your first J.O.

827
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,440
Yeah, we got it.

828
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Not first.

829
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Oh my God.

830
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
Oh my God.

831
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,800
No, I mean, I don't, did anyone jerked off to a cartoon character?

832
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Yeah, sure.

833
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Yeah, sure.

834
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
But of course.

835
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,080
It's weird that you were doing, it's the ones we're talking about right now.

836
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
Things really problem.

837
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
I mean, when you're that age.

838
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,800
We have one raspberry beer.

839
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Look what happens.

840
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
A single beer.

841
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,000
And I'm ready to let it all out.

842
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,240
Let's get a list of every cartoon character.

843
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
So here's my point.

844
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,560
My point is they have like picked like he draws the Disney princesses.

845
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
I'll do my list first.

846
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
One Mr. Boogity.

847
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Okay, there you go.

848
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,200
Sorry, go ahead.

849
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,340
So he like there's a lot of different prints of him like drawing the Disney princesses.

850
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,120
So it's like Snow White and the Evil Queen.

851
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:42,680
And I'm like, that's kind of weird because he has drawn a line of much more pornographic

852
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
versions.

853
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,200
We're looking at a very sultry Snow White.

854
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,400
These are not officially licensed.

855
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,960
No, they don't sell them at the Wonder Ground Gallery.

856
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,680
But I'm looking at his.

857
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,360
They sold some body ones.

858
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,320
There are a couple that like kind of are on the line of like body.

859
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
But I think it's funny that like.

860
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,840
They could be for body.

861
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,960
You can go in there and you get like a PG version of it and then you go on his website

862
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,560
and you can get the PG 13 to our version of it as well.

863
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,860
So he's probably got like two versions of every sketch.

864
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,400
He's got like the dirty version and the less dirty version anyway.

865
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
So wait, wait.

866
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
So what did he do?

867
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,680
What's at the gallery you can buy that you made?

868
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,440
So he was an artist in residence for a while and they had a line of like.

869
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,360
Yeah, like stuff like this and like, you know, perfectly fine.

870
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
I mean, there's some other ones.

871
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,080
There's ones where the cat's naked.

872
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,320
Yeah, the cat's dick is out.

873
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
It's your cat.

874
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Striped penis.

875
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,400
It's in the shape of a smile.

876
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Yeah, nothing else.

877
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,120
The rest disappeared.

878
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
But it's weird to me.

879
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
I don't know.

880
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,200
I don't know if Shag has like dirty pictures on his, you know, on his other website.

881
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,160
Like I'm just saying, I think I find it funny that like you can get the like Disney version

882
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,600
of the fairy tales and then you can get like the dirtier version of the fairy tales from

883
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:12,600
this one artist who specialized in just like making 13 year old boys by his comics because

884
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,840
of the way he was drawing women.

885
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,160
Boy, you get to buy those at the under wonder ground gallery.

886
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
Yes.

887
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
The under.

888
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,240
You sneak through the there's an alley in the back.

889
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,240
Yes.

890
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,600
The seedy wonder belly.

891
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
That's before the metal detectors.

892
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,320
Oh, yeah.

893
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
There's that one store.

894
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The rinse.

895
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Sorry.

896
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Oh, yeah.

897
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh, spoilers.

898
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Sorry.

899
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,640
We're going to talk about a store outside of the metal detector.

900
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
Yeah, we can't.

901
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
That's yeah.

902
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
I'll cut it out.

903
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Sorry.

904
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,640
I cut that out.

905
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,200
So they've got the they've got the like little to the blind box toys in there.

906
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,720
They've got a variety of things.

907
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,200
They of course have still after years.

908
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,920
Hipster Mickey and evergreen Disney thing.

909
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Yeah.

910
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:11,000
Mickey wearing glasses, drinking a coffee, that fucking hipster wearing a scarf and a

911
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
jacket.

912
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's unacceptable.

913
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Like us.

914
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Gross.

915
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah.

916
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You know what?

917
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,800
You're right that those basic acts don't make you hateful.

918
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,760
But I don't think that what I think about Hipster Mickey is that he is not present.

919
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,960
He is looking down.

920
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,560
He's looking down at his phone.

921
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,320
I mean, as opposed to regular Mickey, who is the most present, he's welcoming you.

922
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,700
He's excited to be in the fireworks show or the parade or to be, you know, playing turkey

923
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,480
in the straw in a barnyard jamboree.

924
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,840
So I don't like I don't like the idea of a disaffected Mickey.

925
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,240
Well, yeah, he should be taking that phone to the den.

926
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
We all know that.

927
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,640
Taking that smartphone into the den.

928
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Yes.

929
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
If you need.

930
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
Yes.

931
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,360
If you need to make a telephone call, use the den.

932
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,680
Mickey, remember your own words.

933
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,400
God, Hipster Mickey.

934
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,960
He's probably just out of his mind on CBD.

935
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,440
Jewel in like the keeper.

936
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Oh, yeah.

937
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
Fucker.

938
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,840
You know, there is a elsewhere in the I swear I'm not jumping ahead, but if we were jumping

939
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,300
ahead, I would anyone complain in Disney Home.

940
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,300
There is a hipster.

941
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

942
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,300
I'm done.

943
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,800
I'm done with mine.

944
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
You're giving me permission to move on.

945
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
Sure.

946
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
I'm taking it.

947
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Disney Home.

948
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Yes, we got it.

949
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
Let's go.

950
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Disney.

951
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Oh, my God.

952
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Jason, I can hug you.

953
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,120
There weren't microphones blocking us.

954
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,560
OK, so there is there was some there was a mug or something I saw or maybe it was on

955
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,920
like a bag of coffee or something.

956
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
I saw it.

957
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
It must be coffee.

958
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,720
There's a hip there.

959
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,560
I saw Hipster Mickey merch, but this Hipster Mickey is different.

960
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,680
In this Hipster Mickey, you knew he was a hipster because he was wearing a retro Epcot shirt.

961
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,280
Oh, I didn't see that.

962
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Yeah.

963
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
Yeah.

964
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Why?

965
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
And I was like, this is weird.

966
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
It is like there's fun.

967
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,640
There is a like version of Mickey that reflects me.

968
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,800
He's conveying hipsterism via love and coffee and vintage Epcot vibe.

969
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,040
I was like amazed they were like that keenly aware of what I would want.

970
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,880
It's like the algorithm was speaking to me within the Disney Home store.

971
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
Wow.

972
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,040
If only there was a hipster Mickey in the shape of the Mickey Star Trader sign.

973
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,720
Oh, my God.

974
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,880
There was a that's the thing I forgot.

975
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,400
Let's not use this as a ticket to go back to Wonder Grand Gallery.

976
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
I think we're already back.

977
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
No, no, no.

978
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,960
OK, there was a there was a painting of Hipster Mickey and the abstract background.

979
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,960
I didn't even notice it until I was going through my pictures later.

980
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,200
The the kind of muted background is tumbling neon Mickey from Tomorrowland.

981
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:51,200
So there are hip items that represent my favorite Disney imagery.

982
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,200
The algorithm put that background in after it saw he's going back looking at it.

983
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,480
Well, they're trying to show that they're the boss of me.

984
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,120
Like you can boogity challenge all day, but we know what you want.

985
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,120
Yeah.

986
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,920
Don't go thinking you have control, Gardner.

987
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,840
There will be probably within five to 10 years, some sort of a kiosk you walk up to.

988
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,920
It reads your mind and it creates your perfect Mickey, like whatever you like your dream

989
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,920
Mickey is.

990
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:24,920
Your dream Mickey is dressed as Mr. Boogity.

991
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,680
The famous cape.

992
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,480
But he is undefeatable.

993
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,480
Yeah.

994
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:35,080
What's so Disney home is like there's like mugs and.

995
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,480
So this used to be D Street.

996
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,560
We would go in a lot because that's where you'd get the vinylmations and like distressed,

997
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,040
like softer, nicer looking shirts.

998
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,680
And then they kind of went, this will make more money if we make it home goods.

999
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,240
And I think they were right.

1000
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,240
I'm not sure.

1001
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,360
I haven't seen the books.

1002
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,480
I'm not sure if they are making more money.

1003
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Maybe.

1004
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,320
Well, I was saying the price of stuff, the stuff that retails at a higher price point

1005
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,320
than like.

1006
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,320
Yeah.

1007
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,680
There's a lot of just a lot of stuff.

1008
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,400
D Street at least had different types of merchandise you wouldn't find in the park, but like so

1009
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,120
much of the merchandise, the same stuff.

1010
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,440
And it's just mugs.

1011
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,080
It's like all the mugs they have in world of Disney and the park.

1012
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,880
There are a lot of Christmas ornaments.

1013
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,840
A lot of Christmas stuff out there.

1014
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
Things for dogs.

1015
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
There's a dog stuff.

1016
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,840
Yeah.

1017
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
But those are, that's in the parks too.

1018
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,840
There's a little Hanukkah section.

1019
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,840
I don't know if you saw that.

1020
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
There's a nice.

1021
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,840
I kept it real little.

1022
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,840
There was like a dreidel.

1023
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,720
You could go through several doors.

1024
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
That's also in the underbelly.

1025
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,120
Can I see the Jewish things please?

1026
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,920
Yeah, this way.

1027
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,280
Did the dreidel have any sort of Disney branding on it?

1028
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,040
Yeah, it had Mickey and I should have taken a picture.

1029
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,000
Yeah, it had, you know, Mickey and the gang.

1030
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Oh, that's fun.

1031
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,880
They had a, there was like a tray with a picture of a menorah.

1032
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,280
They, you know, kind of a cursory.

1033
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,000
So they were just putting the regular.

1034
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,400
Enough to make Walt spin his grave.

1035
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,000
In my land.

1036
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,560
How dare you.

1037
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,520
We actually, well, you know, a friend and a listener, Dave Soldinger was, was talking

1038
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,040
about how he was texting me about out there.

1039
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,000
There are no primary Disney characters who he feels are definitively Jewish.

1040
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,040
I was honestly just thinking, are there any Disney characters who are Jewish in my head?

1041
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,320
And I, like I'm thinking.

1042
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,960
Technically Disney owns Krusty the Clown now.

1043
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,600
That's true.

1044
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,560
Is that why they bought Fox in general?

1045
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,560
To diversify?

1046
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Hmm.

1047
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,520
Yeah, I mean, obviously Mickey's a Christian.

1048
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,520
Of course.

1049
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,920
I mean, Mickey is the Christ figure.

1050
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
Yeah.

1051
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,880
He dies for our sins in phantasmag.

1052
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,880
Goofy.

1053
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,440
Goofy Christian as well, I think.

1054
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,920
Maybe he doesn't practice.

1055
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
On all the primaries.

1056
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,640
Uh, Donald Christian, uh, scuttle.

1057
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,840
I would say anything.

1058
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,840
Flint Heart Glomgold is a Scottish Jew.

1059
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,640
Is a money yamming.

1060
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,240
Flint Heart Glomgold, the villain in DuckTales.

1061
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,480
Oh, you don't know Flint Heart Glomgold?

1062
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,480
I do not.

1063
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,480
I do not.

1064
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,480
He's got the big kilts.

1065
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
Oh, uh, let's see.

1066
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,480
Yeah.

1067
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,200
So I found, yeah, there's a Jewish character in the Three Little Pigs, the Disney cartoon.

1068
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,200
Oh no.

1069
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,200
Oh no.

1070
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,880
I don't want to see this joke.

1071
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,080
You pulled up an article called Bippity Boppity Bigot.

1072
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,080
Jesus.

1073
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,080
That's real.

1074
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,080
Yikes.

1075
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,640
This won't be on Disney Plus.

1076
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:53,800
Yeah, that cultural depictions warning isn't going to get him out of this one.

1077
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,520
Let's just take a look at this.

1078
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,520
Oh my God.

1079
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,960
Don't take a raspberry beer sip before you look at this.

1080
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,960
This is ten times worse than I thought it would be.

1081
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,400
Yeah, I thought that was, I was, oh, like we'll have to read into this.

1082
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,400
No we didn't.

1083
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,120
Google image Disney Jewish cartoon.

1084
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,640
And wonderful things are found.

1085
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,640
Yeah.

1086
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,920
I'm pretty sure that's real.

1087
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
That is real.

1088
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,920
Okay.

1089
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,920
But that's, you know, that's fine.

1090
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,520
As a member, that's how we look.

1091
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,520
One of the chosen people.

1092
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,520
You're giving them a pass for.

1093
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
I'm giving it a thumbs up.

1094
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,520
Okay.

1095
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,520
I love this character.

1096
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,520
Great character.

1097
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,520
I get it.

1098
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,520
You feel seen.

1099
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,520
Yeah.

1100
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,520
Are you working on a pitch?

1101
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,520
Are you working on a Disney Plus pitch for this?

1102
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,520
It's called Glomgold.

1103
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,520
Yeah.

1104
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,680
No, it's good to feel represented.

1105
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,520
Again Google Disney Jewish cartoon.

1106
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,920
You'll see what I'm talking about.

1107
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,520
Good morning advisory warning to this Google.

1108
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,520
And that's Disney Home.

1109
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,240
And that's pretty much anything you need to know about Disney Home is that.

1110
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,720
Good for holiday gifts.

1111
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,720
Yeah.

1112
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,720
What's up, Joe?

1113
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,720
Good for stocking suffers.

1114
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,320
Are you advertising for them?

1115
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
Sure.

1116
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,320
Yeah.

1117
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,320
You can get oven mitts.

1118
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,320
You can get spatulas.

1119
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,320
So yeah.

1120
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,400
Someone was listening to somebody who like works at Disney Home or was like the guy who

1121
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,280
had the idea for the brand is like, oh, I'm going to listen to what these nice boys say

1122
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,280
about me.

1123
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,120
And like, oh no, a chunk of Disney's anti-Semitism.

1124
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:30,520
I also don't for the record necessarily think he was like more anti-Semitic than anyone

1125
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,840
else back then or now.

1126
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:42,200
There was one, I mean, there's one incident I read about what he did, like a Jewish voice.

1127
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,040
Like when people were in animators were leaving to go to like Fleischer or something, he's

1128
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,080
like did some like, oh, you're going to go through those Jews like made something like

1129
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,440
and that someone told it's like, OK, who wasn't doing that?

1130
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
But I don't know.

1131
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,440
I think it's like it's fine.

1132
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,040
I love this stuff.

1133
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,600
They don't make the statue come to life and say that they don't.

1134
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
Yeah.

1135
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,320
The partner statue doesn't quote that.

1136
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,240
So anyway, I think I think it's fine.

1137
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,760
Well, I feel fine because we are now lined up to the bar where Boogity has arrived.

1138
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,440
He was the only it was the only studio to host Lenny Reef.

1139
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,440
Yes, that is true.

1140
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,320
He was trying to collaborate.

1141
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,840
They left that out of the Mary Poppins, Tom Hanks movie.

1142
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,920
I got another meeting to go to.

1143
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:39,400
Well, this is Reef install.

1144
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,320
This other lady ain't giving me the rights as easy as you.

1145
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:47,000
Well, well, well, Mr. Reef install.

1146
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,680
That's how he sounds in the movie.

1147
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,680
I'm Walt Disney.

1148
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,760
I bet the boys at the studio you wouldn't get on a ride.

1149
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,360
I just won 20 bucks.

1150
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,680
I just rewatched that.

1151
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,680
So that was one of my random.

1152
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,280
Maybe you guys had like a random flip through on Disney Plus or you didn't watch the full

1153
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,440
movie or just like I want to watch this one.

1154
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,520
Yeah, I've seen mostly that.

1155
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,040
OK, I mostly do a good one.

1156
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,200
Like an indicative.

1157
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,320
Like here's what I wanted to see.

1158
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,080
I watched a lot of openings.

1159
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,920
I watched Why Should I Worry Oliver and Company?

1160
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,920
I did too.

1161
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,720
And I watched Once Upon a Time in New York City.

1162
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,280
Yeah, once upon a time in New York City.

1163
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,280
Very good.

1164
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,280
Very sad sequence.

1165
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,320
But then the Dodger man, he is still such a cool dog.

1166
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,240
I still am so impressed with him.

1167
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,880
The Dodger man, the artful Dodger, the dog, the dog.

1168
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,880
Oh, yeah.

1169
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,880
Billy Joel.

1170
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,880
The Billy Joel.

1171
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,880
I know.

1172
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,880
I know.

1173
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,880
But you said the man and I was like, what?

1174
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,880
Did I say that?

1175
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:42,880
Maybe the Dodger man.

1176
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,880
And be what I look at.

1177
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,880
I'm called a dog.

1178
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,880
I've had a beer and a half.

1179
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,880
I'm out of control.

1180
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,880
I know you're like that.

1181
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,880
Hey, he's getting to your head.

1182
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,880
Yeah.

1183
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
The Chip and Dale.

1184
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,880
It doesn't have a witch doctor on it.

1185
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,880
It's the beer that you're drinking.

1186
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,880
Chip and Dale does not have the original recorded theme.

1187
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,760
The Regressi Rangers doesn't?

1188
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,280
It's like a re-recorded version.

1189
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,280
What?

1190
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,280
It sucks.

1191
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,280
Oh, no.

1192
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,280
DuckTales, same thing.

1193
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,840
Chip and Dale, though, is also blown up aspect ratio-wise.

1194
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,320
No, they didn't kill them or something.

1195
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,320
They didn't blow them up.

1196
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,320
Was that what you were reacting to?

1197
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,760
No, just that no one's really talking about that.

1198
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,120
Look, there's a lot of things that I want to blow the lid off right now.

1199
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,680
What happened is Scooter Braun owns that.

1200
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,680
Scooter Braun.

1201
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,840
Scooter Braun and the Carlisle group technically owned the Chip and Dale.

1202
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,840
The original recording.

1203
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:30,280
Or was the master destroyed at the Universal Fire?

1204
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,640
They don't know it was destroyed, but they technically own it.

1205
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,360
They don't know it doesn't exist anymore.

1206
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:41,760
We will never get true remasters of the Chip and Dale's theme.

1207
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,840
Those instrument lines of tailspin we'll never hear again, thanks to that fire.

1208
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,840
That sucks.

1209
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,400
Giles Martin will never go in and remix the Disney Afternoon songs for some sort of Cirque

1210
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,400
de Soleil show.

1211
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,680
That'll never happen.

1212
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,800
They'll never add a ghostly John Lennon demo to the theme for Gummy Bears.

1213
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
Sucks.

1214
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:05,240
But Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers is blown up and looks like it was remastered.

1215
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,720
And DuckTales is not blown up.

1216
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,840
It's in the regular aspect ratio, but it looks like shit.

1217
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,840
So I'm not sure how this got determined.

1218
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,880
What was presented in which way?

1219
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,120
Or in what way?

1220
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,120
Maybe do what?

1221
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,080
Because just no one was paying attention.

1222
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,080
Maybe no one cared.

1223
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:28,680
My guess with the Simpsons was they just shuttled over from one server to the other the FX ones.

1224
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,720
But I thought, didn't FX put the ones add in 4-3?

1225
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,720
Or didn't they?

1226
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
They did and we're hoping.

1227
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,720
Did they?

1228
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,720
I don't know.

1229
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,320
I thought it was available to everyone.

1230
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,080
I think they did make both available, so hopefully Disney will do that and hopefully they will

1231
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,560
release the Snyder cut of the Simpsons.

1232
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,200
Of every episode of the Simpsons.

1233
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,920
Jason, any Disney Plus wanderings?

1234
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,600
Have you had a sec?

1235
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,400
No, I just started last night.

1236
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,440
I haven't gone deep.

1237
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,680
Oh man.

1238
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,160
It's the best part of being alive.

1239
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,160
You can miss it out.

1240
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,720
It seems like they just haven't put up anything that actual people who are into Disneyland

1241
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,240
and stuff would care about, besides the Imagineering show.

1242
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,240
There's one other one.

1243
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,640
You said the Disney Parks content is low.

1244
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,640
There's one other one.

1245
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,040
It's like Disneyland through the seasons, I think.

1246
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,040
But all this kind of borings out.

1247
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,040
That one's on YouTube.

1248
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,520
Like a lot of things have been on YouTube.

1249
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,520
That's the thing.

1250
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,480
The after is and has always been on YouTube.

1251
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,480
Yeah.

1252
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,480
I mean, we want a full remastered Bob Hope doing jokes in the Contemporary at the opening

1253
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,480
of Walt Disney World.

1254
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,480
That's what we want.

1255
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,280
And really, all the weird stuff you guys have talked about.

1256
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,680
That was at Pinocchio live action.

1257
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,680
All these crazy things that are on YouTube.

1258
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,680
Oh, that's Avery Schreiber today.

1259
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,680
Yeah.

1260
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,680
That's a weird Christmas song.

1261
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,680
Like that's the stuff.

1262
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,640
That wouldn't be hard for them to upload.

1263
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,240
It's not like they're holding onto that.

1264
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,800
They're going to make some big announcement that they're releasing the Avery Schreiber.

1265
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,800
Joining the family.

1266
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,880
I think they just don't give a shit.

1267
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,240
But yeah, they have so much stuff that would actually be interesting.

1268
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,680
But look, it's not filmstruck.

1269
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,480
I mean, it's not for us.

1270
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,800
That's a good idea, though.

1271
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
The criterion.

1272
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,800
Wow.

1273
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,800
They have to be exploring.

1274
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,800
The Disney Artisan collection.

1275
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,800
There's like other.

1276
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,800
I think there is a demand for that.

1277
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,800
I mean, obviously.

1278
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,800
Yeah.

1279
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,800
We're making the demand right here and now.

1280
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,520
But it's like there's other streaming services.

1281
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,040
And honestly, when I say others, I may be talking about the WWE network where there

1282
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:25,960
are rumors they're going to float an extra $5 tier if you want to go hard, which is like

1283
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:32,520
you want to go deep in the catalog or you want them to bust out really obscure VHS uploaded

1284
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,520
house shows.

1285
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,520
Do you really want to trip?

1286
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,520
Yeah.

1287
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,520
How hard do you want to go?

1288
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,520
Exactly.

1289
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,520
And it'll be like five more dollars.

1290
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,840
And maybe Disney will eventually get there where we're all paying.

1291
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:48,000
I mean, it's true to see the DVD like Disney Digital or to see the Plano Vista home entertainment.

1292
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,040
Like, yes, the rules, all of the in hotel channel loops.

1293
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,040
Yeah.

1294
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,360
Like we would pay money for that.

1295
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,160
But we I we can see all that now.

1296
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,160
Right.

1297
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,720
We dare you say, do we want nicer quality?

1298
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,720
We want nicer quality.

1299
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,400
But maybe there are a couple missing.

1300
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
We don't know.

1301
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,440
They have the full library.

1302
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,440
Hopefully.

1303
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,400
And you should my my demand is if there is this like a separate section for people who

1304
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,800
want to go hard, they should be you should say you want to.

1305
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,360
And then Mr. Boogity greets you.

1306
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,880
So you want more Disney Plus, do you?

1307
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,880
You shame you.

1308
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,160
Boogity, boogity badly.

1309
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,640
This is Green Goblin, obviously.

1310
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,600
But that's the same we've heard seen.

1311
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,280
Boogity, boogity boo.

1312
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,080
They own him now, too.

1313
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,080
What about?

1314
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,080
Yeah, they do own the green.

1315
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,080
Oh, no, no.

1316
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,080
They own the green.

1317
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,080
Kind of.

1318
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,080
Oh, in media.

1319
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,080
Yeah.

1320
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,080
And like movies and stuff.

1321
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,080
Sure.

1322
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,080
TV.

1323
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,080
Yeah, I hope they put that stuff out there.

1324
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,080
That would be great.

1325
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,080
Please.

1326
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,080
Yeah, please do.

1327
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,680
And they don't own the travel channel stuff either for years and years.

1328
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,680
Like the making of stuff was just outsourced.

1329
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,680
Yeah.

1330
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,680
Yeah.

1331
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,680
The travel.

1332
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,240
You mean like behind the scenes behind the scenes sort of special?

1333
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,240
Yeah, I see.

1334
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,080
Mike, could you go ahead and cue up Mr. Boogity again?

1335
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,080
Yeah, sorry.

1336
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,200
We're now staring at the screen for Phantom of the Megaplex, which I've been meaning to

1337
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,200
get to.

1338
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,200
It's 45 minutes long.

1339
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,840
Oh, I didn't realize it was so short.

1340
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,840
I accidentally put on the Megaplex.

1341
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,840
Oh, there we go.

1342
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,840
I know.

1343
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:19,200
I think I've sat through five full viewings of Mr. Boogity in the last 48 hours.

1344
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,680
I'm really doing it.

1345
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,680
Yeah.

1346
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,680
Wow.

1347
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,680
Deep in the middle of a Daily Podcast.

1348
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,680
Get that Mandalorian out of here.

1349
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,680
I don't want to see modern Dumbo.

1350
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,680
I want to see sad.

1351
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,680
That fucking.

1352
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,400
I don't ever want to see that mask again.

1353
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,040
That's Biden.

1354
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,040
Go find the one we like.

1355
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,040
Go find Warren.

1356
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:40,120
Obviously, Boogity is our favorite Warren.

1357
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:46,480
It is already the second hit that comes up for Mr. Say, Mr. Banks is the first.

1358
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,480
We got a top.

1359
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,000
OK, maybe that's a tangible goal.

1360
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,140
Yeah, that's the first thing we can do.

1361
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,140
That's the first goal.

1362
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:55,800
The second goal would be if you put in the letter M, Mr. Boogity is the first suggestion.

1363
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,800
All right.

1364
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,800
Mickey Mouse.

1365
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,800
All right, here we go.

1366
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,200
One, two, one, two, Boogity, Boogity, boo, I will hit play.

1367
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,080
Everyone is a fresh start.

1368
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,720
And will we be done with the episode by the end of this viewing?

1369
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,280
But let's see.

1370
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,880
We've got at least two Boogity's left.

1371
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,880
One.

1372
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,440
OK, one, two, Boogity, Boogity, boo.

1373
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,440
All right.

1374
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,440
There we are.

1375
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:24,440
Oh, it honestly made me so happy to see something of this shitty VHS quality, like something

1376
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:30,160
so broadcast in four by three on the otherwise, you know, very glossy Disney plus.

1377
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,400
Yeah, I do.

1378
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,400
I do like this.

1379
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,400
90 percent of the material you watch is in this.

1380
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,400
Yes, this is yellow.

1381
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
Absolutely.

1382
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
Yeah, yeah.

1383
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,400
Scott's favorite aspect ratio.

1384
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,400
This is the nicest quality I've seen in months.

1385
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,640
It's not taped off of VCR.

1386
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,640
I worked on a clip show that was narrated by David Faustino and it never aired in the

1387
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,600
United States.

1388
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,280
What was it called?

1389
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,760
Sports a Palooza.

1390
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,240
David Faustino would narrate it.

1391
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,720
What didn't make sense in other countries because they call football different things.

1392
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,720
Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I think that it was called Sports a Palooza

1393
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,240
in like North America, like in Canada.

1394
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,160
And then they change it to World a Palooza for overseas sales.

1395
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,160
World?

1396
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,040
Yeah, we didn't know what that meant either.

1397
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,040
World a Palooza.

1398
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,760
But it was all about sports?

1399
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,160
Yeah, I think.

1400
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,160
I can't remember.

1401
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:25,920
I mean, I could have said this already, but obviously that is not the most number one

1402
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,760
quality product that David Faustino ever appeared in.

1403
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,600
I think we know what that is.

1404
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:38,240
So let's keep moving to Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen, y'all.

1405
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:44,800
This is the reason you picked this when we gave you, Jason, the stage list.

1406
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,360
I think you had an odd intrigue with this place as we always have and we have not really

1407
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,920
sat down and eaten at this place before.

1408
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,000
I got to say, in terms of things to goof on, very disappointing.

1409
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Yes.

1410
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
No kidding.

1411
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Because it was very good.

1412
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
It was great.

1413
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Like Mr. Booty, it makes me very happy.

1414
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,600
A real McClunky of a meal.

1415
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,360
A Downtown Disney original has been there since it opened.

1416
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,360
Yeah.

1417
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,360
A hit.

1418
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:17,160
And I think it is still there because it's very good.

1419
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,320
What a shocker.

1420
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,360
I always thought it was going to be this cornball thing.

1421
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,000
I think the name Jazz Kitchen.

1422
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
They didn't even serve cornballs.

1423
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
They should have.

1424
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
They should and could.

1425
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
They probably do them right.

1426
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,240
I don't know.

1427
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,480
I always thought it was probably stupid.

1428
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,520
I feel like I passed by it and made fun of it.

1429
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,520
Why?

1430
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,520
Definitely.

1431
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,080
Well, you made fun of it because of the statues outside.

1432
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:43,520
There's two New Orleans themed statues that look pretty ridiculous.

1433
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,920
There's things to goof on there.

1434
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:51,240
One is a guy playing a trumpet and he is wearing a sailor hat that says Jazz on it and the

1435
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,400
J is a saxophone.

1436
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,400
Yeah.

1437
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,160
Now, I would very much like that hat.

1438
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,280
Maybe I'm not goofing on it.

1439
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,440
I think I'd like it and want a J for Jazz saxophone hat.

1440
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,440
It's a problem.

1441
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,800
For years, I think I've tried to get Jason to wear the captain's hat.

1442
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,640
But Scott is a yacht rock enthusiast.

1443
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,000
It does feel like you would have some sort of captain's hat that you would wear on a

1444
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
special occasion.

1445
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Yeah.

1446
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,280
I would do it like...

1447
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,880
Because you go to a Christopher Cross or a Hall and Oates kind of concert and people

1448
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,880
are wearing the hat.

1449
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,880
That's a little silly to me.

1450
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,600
Well, but that's like wearing the band t-shirt to the band they're singing.

1451
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
That's a faux pas.

1452
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
Yeah.

1453
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,600
Yeah.

1454
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,600
Yeah.

1455
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,600
And it's about the spirit, not wearing a literal.

1456
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,600
I'm very picky with my...

1457
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,840
But I would like to...

1458
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,840
Yeah.

1459
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,840
In some venue, I think I'd wear a captain's hat.

1460
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,440
But if you wore a captain's hat to a Rolling Stones concert, that's fine because that's

1461
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,720
not associated with the audience.

1462
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,720
Sure.

1463
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,160
But I think you're showing your sort of coolness in a different venue.

1464
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,160
There's no cooler thing I could do in a cooler place.

1465
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,720
I mean, I'll wear a visor everywhere.

1466
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,600
So obviously, I'm extremely cool.

1467
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,880
Both statues look vaguely psychotic.

1468
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,200
The other one's a chef holding a spoon and a whisker.

1469
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,680
Is that what it's called?

1470
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,680
Whisk?

1471
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,680
Whisk?

1472
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,680
Whisk?

1473
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:15,160
And he has a pot at his crotch with an alligator coming out of it that he's not holding but

1474
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,840
is suspended against him, like as Scott pointed out.

1475
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,560
A very dick in a box syndrome.

1476
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,560
And a crawdad, right?

1477
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,560
Is it a crawdad?

1478
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,560
And a crawdad.

1479
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,560
And a turtle, maybe?

1480
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,560
And a fish.

1481
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,360
A fish, an alligator, and a crawdad coming out.

1482
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,360
And he looks crazy.

1483
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,120
So it looks like a restaurant that would just be bad.

1484
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,120
Yeah.

1485
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:40,440
It's pretty silly where the man beckoning you in is holding up a pot of stew with his

1486
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,440
penis.

1487
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,880
But in fact, you go in and it's a wonderful meal.

1488
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,840
I knew that the Brennan's ran a lot of restaurants in New Orleans.

1489
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:59,560
And we learned that Brennan was involved in the creation of Bananas Foster.

1490
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,680
Bananas Foster was first invented at the original Brennan's.

1491
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,040
Brennan's a restaurant in New Orleans.

1492
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,040
Yes.

1493
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:12,600
I think it was, I always get confused if it's Ralph's father or uncle.

1494
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,600
Uncle.

1495
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,600
Uncle, okay.

1496
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,600
Because Richard Brennan was also.

1497
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,600
Father's part of the business but uncle ran the restaurant?

1498
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,600
Yes.

1499
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,600
They're all restaurateurs.

1500
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,480
He's like third generation restaurateur.

1501
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,560
And the aunt is who figured out Bananas Foster.

1502
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,520
By setting a banana on fire.

1503
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,520
Yes.

1504
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,800
Or they're a chef?

1505
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,400
By grabbing what was around.

1506
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,760
Yeah.

1507
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:41,000
And it was, yeah maybe somebody else was involved but the aunt is attributed to as well.

1508
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,600
And it's some story where there's a man named, I might be getting the first name wrong, maybe

1509
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Robert Foster.

1510
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,600
It's somebody named Foster.

1511
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,600
His first name was Bananas.

1512
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:55,200
We gotta make Bananas here.

1513
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,960
Good dish.

1514
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,600
And she like whipped something together really, felt like kind of begrudgingly like, what

1515
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,960
have we gotten through it together.

1516
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:07,120
And it was amazingly a great dessert out of the gate.

1517
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:13,960
Foster, this guy they were honoring was the head of the New Orleans Crime Commission.

1518
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,920
He like cracked down on corruption in the city.

1519
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,880
I'm a little nervous about what the, I couldn't find more specific stories but it made me

1520
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,080
a little worried about what Foster was into.

1521
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,080
No I'm sure everything was fine.

1522
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,760
I'm sure everything was above board.

1523
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,840
Probably okay.

1524
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:32,040
So there was a big New Orleans banana trade at the time that this dessert was in.

1525
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,400
So that's why there were so many bananas around.

1526
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:41,120
And thank God it wasn't the Brennan's but there was another guy, one of their competitors

1527
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:49,200
who was such a huge banana trader that he meddled, in order to keep the bananas coming,

1528
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:55,600
he meddled in the Honduran presidential election of 1912 and like had his guy installed so

1529
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,360
that everything would be on the up and up banana wise for him.

1530
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:03,720
And the phrase banana republic refers to things exactly like this.

1531
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,720
Wow.

1532
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,720
Yeah.

1533
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,720
Yeah.

1534
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,720
Wow.

1535
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,720
Yes.

1536
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:13,200
Politics being organized to align with Americans banana interests.

1537
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:18,800
But the Brennan's, I couldn't, I think what I, because you were efficient too, Jason.

1538
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,400
I think you Googled.

1539
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,400
I got nothing.

1540
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,200
I Googled Ralph Brennan accused.

1541
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,800
He's usually pretty, pretty juicy.

1542
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,800
Nothing.

1543
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,400
This guy's got a spick and span record.

1544
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,400
Clean as a whistle.

1545
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,400
Yeah.

1546
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,400
He used to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers.

1547
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,400
Yeah.

1548
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,400
He was an accountant.

1549
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,400
Yeah.

1550
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,400
And then joined the family business.

1551
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:42,960
It seems like he was a good businessman and he had a family name and, you know, made some

1552
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,960
deals.

1553
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,960
Yeah.

1554
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,600
I think, I think this guy is squeaky clean.

1555
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,600
You know what?

1556
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,040
I might say a little suspiciously too squeaky clean.

1557
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,960
It makes me a little worried, but I'll leave that thought aside.

1558
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,960
Okay.

1559
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,960
Sure.

1560
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,960
But yes, I, let me ask this.

1561
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,680
Does anyone have a direct answer for this?

1562
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:05,280
In the years you've been passing by this place, have you had a mental image or any thought

1563
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,840
as to what Ralph, who Ralph Brennan was?

1564
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,360
I thought he was a crazy jazz playing chef.

1565
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,720
Like while he's cooking.

1566
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,720
Yeah.

1567
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,040
He's also like, you know, like banging on percussion.

1568
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,040
Yeah.

1569
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,680
Hanging on pots and pans.

1570
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,320
I thought he was like a stern Southern California businessman.

1571
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:27,600
Like I never actually associated with like New Orleans with him.

1572
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,600
I don't know why.

1573
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,640
I think I thought he was like 700 pounds.

1574
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,640
We all had vastly different ideas.

1575
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,640
Jason, what'd you think?

1576
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,640
He was a raccoon?

1577
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,880
You're thinking like a Paul Prudhomme, who was sort of in the orbit of the Brennan family.

1578
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,880
Yes, floppy hat.

1579
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,880
Yeah.

1580
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,080
Emeril Lagasse also a couple degrees removed.

1581
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,280
Yeah.

1582
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:53,760
I think I maybe I thought it was akin to the, you know, neighbor of this restaurant, House

1583
01:05:53,760 --> 01:06:03,040
of Blues, an acroid with his sort of like, you know, weird, like cultural, what do you

1584
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,040
call it?

1585
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,040
He's like appropriation.

1586
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,040
Yes.

1587
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:11,480
Kind of like taking the like sort of, you know, corny way, taking this culture and let's

1588
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,760
make it a theme for a restaurant.

1589
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,040
And then instead you get in there and it's very charming and it like genuine.

1590
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:23,200
I think I also assumed that a weird little fake New Orleans outside of Disney and outside

1591
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,520
of New Orleans square would be inferior and like a much stupider version of that and not

1592
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,520
at all.

1593
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:32,840
It's wonderful and very charming and like really wonderfully art directed in there.

1594
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:37,700
We asked the waitress if Ralph ever comes by.

1595
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,880
She told us he was just here last week.

1596
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:40,880
Wow.

1597
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,880
Wow.

1598
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,360
And yet though we were saying maybe I'm just like fishing for flaws in this.

1599
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,360
Oh, it was too perfect.

1600
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,360
I don't know.

1601
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:50,560
We were saying that maybe is that like the standup thing or whenever you see a standup,

1602
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,520
they have, they are telling you a story that just happened to them that day.

1603
01:06:53,520 --> 01:07:00,320
Yeah, I think it is because I was at a bourbon steak, uh, which is another restaurant owned

1604
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,120
by like one of these like multi restaurant owning guys.

1605
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:08,360
Uh, Michael Mina and I was like, is Michael ever come in?

1606
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,000
And also told he was just here last week.

1607
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,600
And then when you ask, Oh, what's their favorite thing to get, they say, Oh, he, uh, he mixes

1608
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,600
it up.

1609
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,600
He likes a lot of different things.

1610
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,640
She said the burger though, the burger or the jambalaya pasta.

1611
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,840
She did do a twist on jambalaya here.

1612
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:30,040
Uh, but we will look when we, we do downtown Disney or deal revisited in six months, uh,

1613
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:34,400
we will, uh, we will ask again and see if that's the same story.

1614
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,280
If you went for a long time, if you went into any Wendy's and asked, does Dave Thomas ever

1615
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,280
come by?

1616
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,000
I would say he was here last week.

1617
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,440
I bet you could still catch a couple of them.

1618
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,480
They would just be in the train, like train to say it.

1619
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,400
So if you walk in, you go, Oh, is Dave Thompson?

1620
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,400
Oh yeah.

1621
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,400
Ah, shit.

1622
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,840
I think anyone who works at a Wendy's knows who Dave Thomas is.

1623
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,840
Yes.

1624
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,560
Or thinks that Wendy was ever a real person.

1625
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,560
She was.

1626
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,560
They were all born.

1627
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,000
Well, I, well, we know that.

1628
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Yeah.

1629
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,480
But I would say you're saying that died with Dave.

1630
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,120
I was saying that anyone who's working on Wendy's and I was probably born after, uh,

1631
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,120
both of them were dead.

1632
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,920
I think Wendy is still alive.

1633
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,880
I like to ask at airport Wolfgang Puck express locations, what is a Wolfgang like?

1634
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,240
Well because of the one at CityWalk, he was represented by a cartoon wolf, right?

1635
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,440
That was, uh, probably what most of the employees thought he was.

1636
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,440
Oh, that, yeah.

1637
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,040
Oh, and if you, yeah, does he ever come in here?

1638
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,560
There's a cartoon character named Wolfgang Puck.

1639
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,120
Does he ever come in here?

1640
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,120
No, thank God.

1641
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,120
Chew our heads off.

1642
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,120
We could tear this place up.

1643
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,880
They'd blow this house down.

1644
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,880
Are you kidding?

1645
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,320
No, heavens no.

1646
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,320
Who's asking?

1647
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,800
There was a, a piano man.

1648
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,800
Yes.

1649
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,800
A piano player.

1650
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,800
Very good.

1651
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,520
The atmosphere in there was so fun.

1652
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,640
Oh my God.

1653
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,120
I really was like, here's what-

1654
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,120
I miss it so much.

1655
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,120
We had a wonderful time.

1656
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,120
Here's what I'm gonna say.

1657
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,120
I'm embarrassed.

1658
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,480
I've been hundreds of times.

1659
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:05,680
I'm embarrassed that I've never been in there because there was a nice bar.

1660
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,600
There was a piano man playing all the times we've been there.

1661
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:15,600
Not once have I stepped foot in there and know, cause like we really fancy ourselves

1662
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,760
experts here, but like to not know about the main drag of downtown Disney, it's shameful

1663
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,760
honestly.

1664
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,480
I also love this style of cooking gumbo and jambalaya.

1665
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,320
Like I love eating this way.

1666
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,320
Well then why didn't you go?

1667
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,280
It was not a bad version of it.

1668
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,280
No it wasn't.

1669
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,080
The gumbo yaya was delicious.

1670
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,160
The express though, Jason or the gumbo yaya?

1671
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:42,000
You gotta, I mean, this gumbo yaya, their presentation had no okra in it, which I realized

1672
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
later.

1673
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It's not often prepared with okra.

1674
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,720
Okra is a standard gumbo?

1675
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,720
Sometimes.

1676
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:51,800
Then I learned that a big ingredient in a lot of gumbo is called filet powder, which

1677
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,840
is ground up sassafras leaves.

1678
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,840
Wow.

1679
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,840
Interesting.

1680
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,840
That's a thickening agent.

1681
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,840
Oh, like flour.

1682
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,840
Yeah, like flour.

1683
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,840
Interesting.

1684
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,680
Because you have to start gumbo by making a roux.

1685
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:02,680
Have you ever made a gumbo?

1686
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,120
I've never made gumbo.

1687
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,120
I should though.

1688
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,120
Yeah, I think so.

1689
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,440
Yeah, that would be fun to do.

1690
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,720
Are you a fan of the Jimmy Buffett song?

1691
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,720
I will play for gumbo.

1692
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,720
No, I am.

1693
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,720
Yeah.

1694
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,720
Hell yeah.

1695
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:14,720
Hell yeah.

1696
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:21,080
Speaking of songs, wait, didn't you, who recorded the, that happy birthday song?

1697
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,680
Yeah, I did a little bit.

1698
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,680
I was trying to get the gist of it.

1699
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:31,920
He sang the birthday, he sang happy birthday to a couple of guys in the front, this piano

1700
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,920
player and the rest.

1701
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,080
Was it Jeff and Josh?

1702
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,080
I think you're right.

1703
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,080
Yeah, yeah.

1704
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:41,480
I just wrote, the only things I wrote down is like, we got two cool dudes here.

1705
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,840
Who's Griffin?

1706
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,240
Who's very cool.

1707
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,960
I'm so happy for you guys.

1708
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:49,960
Yeah.

1709
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:54,800
And then at some point they know how to bale some hay.

1710
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,800
Right.

1711
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:56,800
Yeah.

1712
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,800
That probably means sex.

1713
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,720
He was referring to their girlfriends too.

1714
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,200
Yeah, probably filthy, whatever he was referring to.

1715
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,760
There was some reference to how they look 22.

1716
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,760
They look 22.

1717
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,000
Oh, I didn't catch that.

1718
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,920
I didn't want to hold the song against them because I was like, am I misunderstanding

1719
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,920
this?

1720
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,920
Do you guys remember?

1721
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,520
He was not close enough to see what everyone looked like for this piano player to make

1722
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,520
sense.

1723
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,720
So some of the jokes didn't land with us, I think.

1724
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:26,920
But he would often, like he had breaks and he would go like, all right, I'm going to

1725
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,920
do one more song and everyone's like, and multiple times people were like, no.

1726
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,920
Oh, the whole, yeah, we were doing it.

1727
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,920
No, keep going.

1728
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,920
No.

1729
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:35,920
No.

1730
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,920
Stay.

1731
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,920
You're on the clock.

1732
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,120
He did a jazzy Billy Joel piano man.

1733
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,120
Yeah.

1734
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,120
New Orleans-y piano man.

1735
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,920
Does anyone have in their mind what that was like?

1736
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,040
I know it was very, it was a knowledge.

1737
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,240
It was just a little bluesy or whatever.

1738
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,480
It rolled together a little more.

1739
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:59,280
It was less staccato, that's my feeling, if that makes sense.

1740
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,280
Sure.

1741
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,280
It was nice.

1742
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,280
I don't always like that song.

1743
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,280
I did like it.

1744
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,280
I liked that version.

1745
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,280
It was good.

1746
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,440
He was singing that happy birthday song, which made me really happy.

1747
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,280
He's talking about two cool dudes and he's, how happy he is for them.

1748
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,840
I'm so happy for you guys.

1749
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,720
And as that was happening, fireworks are going off.

1750
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,400
I think if you were up on that veranda on the second floor, you've got obviously a great

1751
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,400
fireworks view.

1752
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,400
Yeah.

1753
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,720
But we were at a table just near a window, a fantastic fireworks view in the distance

1754
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,800
from Disneyland.

1755
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:32,120
Just all of that coalescing, mixed of course with excellent food.

1756
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,120
Excellent food.

1757
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,120
Oh my God.

1758
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:37,240
Also, we should say that food came out so fast.

1759
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,240
Oh yeah.

1760
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,460
Everything came very quickly and it was very hot.

1761
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,960
Like it wasn't like...

1762
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:43,960
Yeah.

1763
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:49,280
I was suspicious of how fast it came out because I noticed from going to Ohana and Disney World

1764
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,400
when Lindsay and I went like five or six years ago, we had the best time at Ohana, which

1765
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:58,440
is the all you can eat family bring food to you buffet.

1766
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:03,160
And then we went back three years later and they were bringing stuff out so fast and it

1767
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,920
was a little less good.

1768
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,160
It's a buffet where they bring food families.

1769
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,160
Yeah.

1770
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,920
They brought in hundreds of meat and different noodles and stuff.

1771
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,360
And it was like our favorite meal we ever had.

1772
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,520
And they won't stop until you're done?

1773
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,040
They won't stop until you're done.

1774
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,040
It's good.

1775
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,440
Until a button bursts on you.

1776
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,440
Yeah.

1777
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,440
It's still good.

1778
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,120
It's in the Polynesian so you can watch fireworks from there too, which is fantastic.

1779
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,720
Did they give you a card with a red side and a green side?

1780
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,720
Like a...

1781
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,720
No.

1782
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:35,160
It's just skewer people walking around and going, you want this?

1783
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,160
Skewer people?

1784
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,680
There's just a bunch of skewer people with like four different meats.

1785
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,680
Like made of skewers?

1786
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,680
Yeah.

1787
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,680
They're anthropomorphic skewers.

1788
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,680
Yeah, yeah.

1789
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,960
They have giant eyes.

1790
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,240
Big spindly creatures.

1791
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:50,000
They look like Clippy from the Microsoft office.

1792
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Can you tickle...

1793
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Is there eyeball food?

1794
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Looks like you want some meat.

1795
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Yeah.

1796
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,560
Looks like, yeah, click me for meat.

1797
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,560
Yeah.

1798
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:03,200
So, but we noticed like how fast they were rushing us out the second time.

1799
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,400
And I got that vibe from here.

1800
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,520
I was like, oh, they've like got the efficiency down.

1801
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,280
And I was like worried it wasn't going to be that good, but it was still like the food

1802
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,280
quality wise.

1803
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,280
I didn't feel rushed though.

1804
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,840
They feel like we were at kind of a later reservation.

1805
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:21,960
Which is always, with that vibe of like the restaurant's trickling out, but it's not like

1806
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,480
we're putting the chairs up, get out of here.

1807
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,480
That's the best thing.

1808
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:31,480
There's not that you aren't feeling the quick turnover and hanging out with y'all and firework.

1809
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,320
This was like, this was fantastic, I thought.

1810
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:38,400
And then we got another little show at the table when we ordered the famous Bananas Foster.

1811
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,360
It's Flambé table side.

1812
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,360
Delightful.

1813
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,360
Yeah.

1814
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:47,960
Which is maybe a seemingly, according to Ralph Brennan at least, is a, like, you know, maybe

1815
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,080
a tradition with the Bananas Foster.

1816
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,080
Okay.

1817
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,080
They like to do that.

1818
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:56,600
So you're watching butter and brown sugar get mixed up and then, and bananas thrown

1819
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,600
in the pan.

1820
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,480
Then it's finished off with rum, I believe.

1821
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:05,480
And at some point during that process, and she tells you, get those cameras out.

1822
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,520
And we all did.

1823
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,040
And she also tells you, the flames are going high.

1824
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,000
And you get nervous and the heart's beating.

1825
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,680
And sure enough, oh my God, those flames.

1826
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,980
That's like, I mean, I like any little table side thing.

1827
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:24,760
And I like the, you know, we're just in Epcot and I like the Benihana-esque restaurant that

1828
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,760
you go to.

1829
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,600
This is probably the coolest table side thing I've ever seen.

1830
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,600
Yes.

1831
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,600
The ceiling high flames.

1832
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,600
Certainly up there.

1833
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,000
It was really, it was really a spectacle.

1834
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,480
She also told us to film it in slow motion.

1835
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,480
Yes.

1836
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,680
And you have the newest, that iPhone looks very good.

1837
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,880
I just got a new phone.

1838
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,480
I filmed it in slow motion.

1839
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,480
She was right.

1840
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,480
Yeah.

1841
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,480
Looks cool as hell.

1842
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,360
Do we all have an angle on it from our phones?

1843
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,760
I did it head on at normal speed because I was trying to get, I think this is when Piano

1844
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,600
Man was playing.

1845
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,920
I was trying to get the audio.

1846
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,680
But it was a little too conversational.

1847
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,040
I feel like Piano Man was not playing during the flames.

1848
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,040
Something was playing.

1849
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,320
Something funny was playing while she was doing this.

1850
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,560
There was some song that stuck out to me.

1851
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,120
But we also asked her, how many times a night do you do this?

1852
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,600
And she didn't, she didn't make it sound like that many, but she said, but once someone

1853
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,560
orders it, someone else will.

1854
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,120
Like it's like the fajita trick.

1855
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,140
It's like the Chili's fajita trick.

1856
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:23,360
But times 10, it is so cool.

1857
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,840
Like can you guys name a cooler table side thing?

1858
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,120
I'm trying to think.

1859
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:34,520
Not a lot of people order it, but everyone who does makes one.

1860
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,280
Everyone who sees it makes their own table side dessert.

1861
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,840
Bites a table.

1862
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,840
Yeah.

1863
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,840
And some bananas.

1864
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,840
It was very good.

1865
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,840
Also very good.

1866
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,680
We ordered the like, order it when you order your food, chocolate souffle, like 25 minutes

1867
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,000
to cook chocolate souffle.

1868
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Delicious.

1869
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I thought that was great.

1870
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
We also got the beignets.

1871
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And beignets.

1872
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,600
We kind of tricked into the dark chocolate dipping sauce because that was already coming.

1873
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,800
That was coming with the souffle.

1874
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,800
Yeah.

1875
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,800
We didn't get through all of it nearly.

1876
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:01,800
We made an extra 75 minutes.

1877
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,000
Yeah, not by all the things, but that sauce was crazy good.

1878
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,360
Yeah.

1879
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,360
All of it.

1880
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:13,760
She recommended take beignets, put bananas foster inside of it, make a little sandwich.

1881
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,760
She was right on.

1882
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:15,760
That was fantastic.

1883
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,800
Does anyone want to shout out anything about main meal?

1884
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,800
Oh yeah.

1885
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:26,280
The, the, um, the buden balls, the like pork rice balls with pepper jelly.

1886
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,280
Yeah.

1887
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,280
Were amazing.

1888
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,640
Like that was delicious.

1889
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:33,440
Maybe probably one of the best things I've eaten in this ordeal so far.

1890
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:38,640
For me, the whole thing tipped when I, you know, I mean, I found it charming from, from

1891
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,600
second one, except when the hostess, uh, didn't understand my clunky.

1892
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:48,120
But besides that, once we sat down and we, and oh, like umbrellas on the ceiling, that's

1893
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,120
fun.

1894
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,120
Like art direction school.

1895
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,680
Like we're in the room with the piano guy.

1896
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,680
That's cool.

1897
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:57,600
Uh, but is the, but I'm worried this food is going to be a sort of, sort of silly or

1898
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,600
not that great.

1899
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,680
And then when that garlic bread came out, that tips, the whole thing, that let me know,

1900
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,240
Oh, we're in, we're in for some quality.

1901
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:09,560
Um, I don't, I mean, I could list the ingredients, but they were just basic ingredients, but

1902
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:15,400
it was just like the craziest richest and like, and not in a insane manner.

1903
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,160
Just like, God, this is very well done.

1904
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,080
I think I said another, but I think, well, no, I'm going to say it on a future.

1905
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,200
So there's a ceiling on good Disney restaurants.

1906
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,080
A lot of them, a couple of them, I think blow by it.

1907
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,640
And I was expecting that like ceiling where you're like, this is like good, but is it

1908
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:30,640
worth $35?

1909
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:35,960
Cause most of it is like, you're paying for like a slightly better restaurant.

1910
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,280
Like you're paying for the ambiance.

1911
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,280
Yeah.

1912
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:43,160
But I was like, Oh, this is actually pretty, this is like a bet, much better than the average

1913
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,160
like expensive.

1914
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:48,360
Like it, that was like a full letter grade above blue Bayou.

1915
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,200
And I like blue Bayou fine.

1916
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:55,000
I don't think it's a good, like a, a good run, a good, nice restaurant.

1917
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,960
Why should be this good?

1918
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:02,160
I don't like blue Bayou has to water it down for a more broad audience, but Brennan's is

1919
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,000
more fine dining and it's going more for that segment.

1920
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Yeah.

1921
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I know you're saying, but what, what dad isn't going to like that garlic bread.

1922
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Yeah.

1923
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,360
A bunch of, right about that.

1924
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,360
Yeah.

1925
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,360
For sure.

1926
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,360
I had barbecue shrimp and grits and it's just mashed potatoes and shrimp.

1927
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,640
It's like, it's great.

1928
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,880
I can't find shrimp to be very disappointing and bland.

1929
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:28,880
I loved the shrimp, which was crusted in sausage.

1930
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,280
It was so many things happening at once.

1931
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:36,160
And green beans with like pecan bacon crumbles.

1932
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,720
This has just turned into a genuine discussion of food.

1933
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,120
The gumbo was legitimately spice.

1934
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,080
I was like, this has some spice to it.

1935
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,080
Like nothing.

1936
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,520
This property is spicy.

1937
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,520
Right.

1938
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,160
Oh, wait, what happened to, what happened to Oh, boogity.

1939
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,160
I got to put boogity back in.

1940
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,320
Oh, we have to re queue it.

1941
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,800
Oh, re queue boogity.

1942
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,800
Okay.

1943
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,800
All right.

1944
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:56,800
Cornbread.

1945
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,800
That was good.

1946
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,800
Yes.

1947
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
All right.

1948
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,800
All right.

1949
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,720
2104 boogity on one, two, three, boogity, boogity, boo boo being the time when I started

1950
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,640
one, two, three, boogity, boogity, boo.

1951
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:08,640
All right.

1952
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,640
We're off.

1953
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,640
John Astin's talking.

1954
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,640
He's got a great John Astin.

1955
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,640
Oh yeah.

1956
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,640
Great.

1957
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:14,640
Still alive.

1958
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,640
John Astin.

1959
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:19,000
He's been acting in like at a college in Minnesota or something.

1960
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
There's no way he's still alive.

1961
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Oh, I swear to God.

1962
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Yeah.

1963
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,920
He was on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast like a month or two ago.

1964
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,920
That's incredible.

1965
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,920
Yes.

1966
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:27,920
He's also what we learned.

1967
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,240
He's the writer of Mr. Boogity and Bride of Boogity.

1968
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,400
Same writer.

1969
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:37,720
And he is now a screenwriting professor at UCLA, I believe.

1970
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:43,160
So the boogity crew is giving back to the world.

1971
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:47,720
They are educators and they are training the next generation who could be the people making

1972
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,720
Boogity 3.

1973
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,120
Well, I was going to suggest get the old crew back together.

1974
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,120
Oh, of course.

1975
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,680
But we need some new generation.

1976
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:59,120
You need like the Ray of Boogity, like the Star Wars character Ray of Boogity who can

1977
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,880
take the franchise in the next few movies.

1978
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:02,880
It's true.

1979
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,400
The boy flying on the floating chimney equipment.

1980
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,400
All of it.

1981
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,760
The vacuum that came alive.

1982
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,720
All of it.

1983
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:17,640
This is the shop vac that killed Boogity.

1984
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:22,920
And if we can only hope it brings him back because we need him now.

1985
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:29,680
It's like how eventually the villain in Every Fast and the Furious joins the crew.

1986
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:33,760
Every time they beat someone in the next movie, it's like, well, we need them.

1987
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,000
Boogity created a problem only Boogity can solve.

1988
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,560
So what else do we like?

1989
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,560
Everything was good.

1990
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,120
The only oh, the Dippin Tots were good.

1991
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,120
Dippin Tots.

1992
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,120
Dippin Tots.

1993
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,640
They did not serve Dippin Dots.

1994
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:57,880
They were not named after the Ice Cream of Future's past.

1995
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:02,400
The Crawfish Mashed Potatoes was they didn't stay super hot for very long and they were

1996
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,160
a little thick, a little dry.

1997
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:10,520
But that is the smallest little criticism.

1998
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,520
Everything else was amazing.

1999
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,400
Well, I have a criticism too.

2000
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,400
As I said, I'm searching.

2001
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,400
I think just like, obviously this was so great, but suspiciously great.

2002
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:24,400
There was one bump in the road, which is that we were all supposed to do it a week prior

2003
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:29,120
and then we went to get reservations and there were no reservations available.

2004
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,320
I was like, oh, why?

2005
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,120
Because it's just the most popular restaurant you've ever.

2006
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,120
But there were reservations every other day.

2007
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:37,960
What happened was the whole thing was booked up by an event.

2008
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,320
It was like an alumni event.

2009
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:46,000
Oh, yeah, a big event being hosted by Harvey Mudd College, which is a liberal arts college

2010
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
in Claremont.

2011
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:55,160
When I looked up Harvey Mudd College, they have a curriculum that is a core curriculum

2012
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:58,480
that is described as soul crushing.

2013
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,480
On their website.

2014
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,480
Incredibly difficult.

2015
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,480
Yes.

2016
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,400
Want your soul crushed?

2017
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,680
I'm Harvey Mudd.

2018
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:10,920
It's a very difficult liberal arts college and they booked it up for the night.

2019
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,120
I don't know.

2020
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:20,760
I feel like jazz is a people's music and this restaurant should be a restaurant of the people

2021
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,360
and I don't like some snooty liberal arts college pushing us out.

2022
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,960
Yeah, I hear that.

2023
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:33,080
I did try to sign us up for the alumni dinner and filled out the form.

2024
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:37,120
I got as far as me and Scott's name and then I was like, what am I doing?

2025
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:43,360
And then got an email from the woman coordinating it saying like, hey, you kind of banned your

2026
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,440
form halfway through and we don't have you on any of the alumni rosters.

2027
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,680
She pointed out you didn't finish the form.

2028
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,680
Yeah, I guess she got.

2029
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,320
So she could see it in real time?

2030
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:59,800
Yeah, I guess she's just sitting there looking at it as the letters come in and I did not

2031
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,800
write back.

2032
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,600
So if she's listening, I'm sorry.

2033
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,000
It was all trick.

2034
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,480
You were part of our scheme.

2035
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,480
I did.

2036
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,360
Ultimate prank down in the mud messing around.

2037
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:13,360
Rasslin.

2038
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,360
I did want to.

2039
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:21,080
I was looking through Yelp and TripAdvisor reviews to try to find something.

2040
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:27,360
I did want to read my favorite review of this restaurant on TripAdvisor.

2041
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:32,840
The title is from Joanne B from Gardnerville, Nevada.

2042
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:37,280
The title of the review is quote, a very different experience.

2043
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,480
Exclamation point.

2044
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:45,400
We had never been to a Louisiana restaurant before and really enjoyed the different dishes

2045
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:49,980
and the accompaniment of jazz music as we dined.

2046
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:50,980
Exclamation point.

2047
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,080
And that's it.

2048
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,080
One star.

2049
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,080
What?

2050
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,080
What?

2051
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:58,280
Maybe she didn't finish filling out the form either.

2052
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,880
She thought that was like.

2053
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,840
Did she think one is the best?

2054
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:03,840
Golf rules?

2055
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,840
Number one.

2056
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,840
Number one.

2057
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,840
One star.

2058
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,480
Yeah, she must not have understood it.

2059
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,080
Yeah, I don't think she got the system.

2060
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,160
Take a Yelp class lady.

2061
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:14,160
Go to Harvey Mudd.

2062
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,800
Learn how to Yelp.

2063
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,800
Harvey Mudd?

2064
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,800
Who is Harvey Mudd?

2065
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,400
Um, Alex, he seems like.

2066
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,480
The Batman villain's real name.

2067
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,480
Clayface.

2068
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,480
Mudface.

2069
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,480
Mudface.

2070
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,480
Or Mudd.

2071
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,920
Mudd is a, there's a Star Trek character.

2072
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,920
Oh, right.

2073
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,200
Is it something Mudd?

2074
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,200
It's some.

2075
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,000
Is Harvey Mudd going to be the boss?

2076
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,200
Oh my God.

2077
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,960
Are we getting to the end of it where we have to be boss concerned now?

2078
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:43,880
Is he going to appear towards the end of the last few minutes of the episode like Mr. Boogity?

2079
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,320
Is this a boss level?

2080
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,320
It is.

2081
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,320
Yeah, we're in a boss state.

2082
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,320
Harry Mudd.

2083
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,320
Boy.

2084
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,320
What?

2085
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,320
Harry Mudd is the character.

2086
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,600
Harry Mudd is the character on Star Trek.

2087
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,560
Wait, how did Boogity pause again?

2088
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,560
What the hell?

2089
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,360
Maybe Harvey Mudd is creating, oh God.

2090
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,960
Everyone pause your Boogities.

2091
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,280
Okay, we're now at the point where the dad, oh it's paused again.

2092
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,280
What?

2093
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,200
Sorry, 2639, one, two, Boogity Boogity Boo.

2094
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,200
Okay.

2095
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,200
Oh shit, it doesn't.

2096
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:17,640
This, there are some interferences, there are some disturbances and it makes me worried

2097
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,400
that we are in the presence of the boss already.

2098
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:25,080
And unless there are any more interesting facts about the Jazz Kitchen restaurant we

2099
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:28,400
went to, maybe it's time for Jason to make his escape.

2100
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,160
Yeah, I've got a weird feeling here, I might take off guys.

2101
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,160
Sure, yeah, yeah.

2102
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,640
Just leave all that beer you brought.

2103
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,120
Yeah, I'm going to leave the beer but.

2104
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,800
No, no, no, of course, but we won't give it to the boss when they show up.

2105
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,560
Alright, good luck guys, I'll see you later.

2106
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,560
Okay, you survived Pug, you survived, okay bye.

2107
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,560
Do you want to plug anything though before you leave?

2108
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,560
Do you want to plug anything?

2109
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,560
No, I'm good, I'm good.

2110
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,840
It's a gift shop, there's nothing to plug.

2111
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,640
Okay, just making sure we're polite and giving him the option.

2112
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,640
Yeah.

2113
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,040
We can always retweet something.

2114
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:58,320
Oh shit, Jason's gone and now we have to, oh fuck.

2115
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,000
Well I guess we better get this over with, okay.

2116
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,200
Hey, Sector Keeper.

2117
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,840
Boys, boys.

2118
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,320
Oh, Sector Keeper, hi.

2119
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,320
Hello.

2120
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,800
Okay, so we're at the end of the level, what's going on?

2121
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,600
What's going on?

2122
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,800
Boys, darkness looms.

2123
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,800
What?

2124
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,160
There's a boss on the horizon, boys.

2125
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:23,240
I don't have much time, look at me, look at me, I have an item for you boys.

2126
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:24,240
Oh, a few.

2127
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,240
Yeah, yeah, you boysie.

2128
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,240
Sector Keeper, you having trouble looking?

2129
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,240
Put the vape down, there's not a time to vape.

2130
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:34,240
You said you didn't have time to lose and then you're still pumping on the vape, come

2131
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,240
on.

2132
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,240
Yeah.

2133
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:41,240
Boys, I need you to take this trombone, this.

2134
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,240
Oh.

2135
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:46,600
This Treme certified trombone and use it.

2136
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,600
Boys, boys.

2137
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,800
We're losing your leader, Sector Keeper.

2138
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,800
It's forming again.

2139
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,840
Well, well, well.

2140
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:01,280
If it isn't a few pots of gumbo.

2141
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,280
Oh my god, I know it's.

2142
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,280
Oh, it's we are?

2143
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,720
He's been overtaken by the evil spirit of Ralph Brennan.

2144
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,000
It must be, is it you, Ralph?

2145
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,080
That's right, at your service, W. Tull.

2146
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,200
I know that draw anywhere.

2147
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,480
It reeks of rotten etouffee.

2148
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:23,120
Oh, watch your mouth.

2149
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,920
He's fanning himself, too.

2150
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:25,920
That's right.

2151
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,880
I've got two big fans.

2152
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,200
Don't make me use them.

2153
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,240
OK, all right.

2154
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:34,920
And he's puffing now from a mint julep flavored vape.

2155
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:35,920
That's right.

2156
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:36,920
Mint julep, mint.

2157
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,920
Oh, he's got a double mint.

2158
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,920
Right, because everything's got a new mint now.

2159
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,920
Oh, Jesus.

2160
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,240
God, this guy, this guy means business.

2161
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,240
Just got to be careful.

2162
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,460
His fans are are are sharp.

2163
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:53,120
They're like Molina or Katana from Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat.

2164
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,820
I don't believe you.

2165
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:57,040
I mean, I bet it's just a regular paper.

2166
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:00,320
We have Mortal Kombat two in the big easy.

2167
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,320
Oh, wow.

2168
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,320
Oh, my God.

2169
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,320
You.

2170
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:04,320
You.

2171
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,320
It cut my fingers up.

2172
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,320
That's right.

2173
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:09,080
You came to the wrong level, boys.

2174
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,280
How dare you step foot in here?

2175
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,720
A few of you philistines.

2176
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:18,680
I bet you haven't even been to Harvey Mudd College.

2177
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,680
Oh, no.

2178
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,160
We're in the Harvey Mudd thing again.

2179
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,400
Was that you?

2180
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,760
Did you schedule that to minorly inconvenience us?

2181
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,760
That's right.

2182
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,160
Me and Harvey Mudd go way back.

2183
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,440
Wow, I didn't know that.

2184
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,560
They're old bastard brothers together.

2185
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:36,560
Yeah, that's right.

2186
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,920
We're old bastard brothers.

2187
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,760
Oh, you bet you say it in a celebratory way, not an insult.

2188
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,200
You own the word bastard.

2189
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:47,720
I love being a bastard in the big easy.

2190
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,920
Oh, God, this guy is real big, easy.

2191
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:59,200
Did you know I'm named one of the 20 most influential restaurant people in the country

2192
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,960
by Restaurant Business Magazine?

2193
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,600
Yeah, I guess we do.

2194
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:08,240
But it was something we kind of found because of this, not like a thing we know.

2195
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,240
Yeah, we were looking up stuff.

2196
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:10,240
I mean, that's impressive.

2197
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:14,120
But I have to say, I've never heard of that magazine.

2198
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,480
Philistines, read a magazine once in your life.

2199
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:18,480
We do.

2200
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,480
I mean, we read.

2201
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,480
We're not reading magazines.

2202
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:21,480
Any magazine also?

2203
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,480
What about like Boys Life?

2204
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,480
Boys Life, I'm living it.

2205
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,480
Wow.

2206
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,480
OK, well.

2207
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,480
It's that famous southern sense of humor.

2208
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,480
I guess so.

2209
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,480
Tennessee Williams.

2210
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,480
Boys Life, yeah.

2211
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,480
This hoity toots.

2212
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,920
What he doesn't know is that we still we've all we've defeated two bosses and we have not

2213
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,680
had to use very many weapons.

2214
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:40,840
So we've got weapons at our disposal.

2215
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:44,400
Just like you and your your blade fans.

2216
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,400
Jason, what?

2217
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,400
Check the stockpile.

2218
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,080
What do we have still at our disposal?

2219
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,080
OK, you know, you get a body accent.

2220
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,080
What?

2221
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,080
I was like, sorry, I thought you were going to say that.

2222
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:58,080
I was like, I'm sorry.

2223
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:02,040
I thought you were like a grit and determination.

2224
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,040
OK, so sorry.

2225
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,040
Talking about.

2226
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,040
Oh, no, it's spreading.

2227
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,040
It's right.

2228
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,040
Shake it off.

2229
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,040
It's contagious.

2230
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:13,520
We've got a big we've got a boot from Sanuk that seems big enough for me to hop into.

2231
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,800
That could be good.

2232
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:21,400
We've got two pizzas from Tootie Rudy's Tootie Rudy's Pizza.

2233
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:25,040
That's the pizza restaurant where Rudy Giuliani makes the pizzas.

2234
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,040
That's right.

2235
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,040
And you haven't eaten either of them yet.

2236
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:32,040
I managed not to get that city slick of shit out of my.

2237
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,880
Well, you don't have no boys for you.

2238
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,200
Oh, I get it.

2239
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,200
That's right.

2240
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,200
Po boys for me.

2241
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,920
It's a po boys life.

2242
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,440
You know what I mean?

2243
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:47,240
He doesn't know boy boys life po boys life magazine.

2244
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,240
You should publish that.

2245
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,240
Ralph.

2246
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,240
I already did.

2247
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,640
My father gave me the money.

2248
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:52,640
Ever heard of him?

2249
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,640
Owen Brennan?

2250
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2251
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:58,040
Yeah, we talked about him a little bit.

2252
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,040
We're in Hollywood.

2253
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:03,000
The only Owens we care about are Owen Shaw and Owen.

2254
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,800
What the fuck's his name?

2255
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,800
Wilson.

2256
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,800
Grady?

2257
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:11,280
Yeah, we just care about the movie character ones.

2258
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,280
Who's Owen Shaw?

2259
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,280
Yeah, who's Owen Shaw?

2260
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,520
He's one of the villains in Fast and Furious.

2261
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,520
Oh, Hobbs and Shaw.

2262
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,640
OK, that's what we care about.

2263
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:19,640
Enough.

2264
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:22,320
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you right now.

2265
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,120
Because we have weapons.

2266
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:29,440
I've got two pamphlets here, one of them's for you to read and one of them's for me to

2267
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,440
read along.

2268
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,480
This is about the dangers of fornication.

2269
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,480
Fornication?

2270
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,960
This'll show you you can't be this way.

2271
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,280
Listen up you little pots of gumbo.

2272
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:41,920
I created fornication in the Big Easy.

2273
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:48,000
What do you think we do down in the Big Easy in the Four Quarters?

2274
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,560
We fuck.

2275
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,840
Oh God.

2276
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,800
That's way beyond just cohabitation with somebody you're not married to.

2277
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,360
You got nothing against me.

2278
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,360
You right there.

2279
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,760
Yeah, I see you got a hungry look in your eye.

2280
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:09,120
What if I whipped up some of my sweet free gumbo emphasis on free?

2281
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,760
That's right, now he's floating over like a cartoon cat.

2282
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:12,760
No, no, no.

2283
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:13,760
Need the people.

2284
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:14,760
Jason, go to him.

2285
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:19,040
Oh, Muggy Day, like this is nothing like a free pot of gumbo.

2286
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,040
That's right.

2287
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,040
Oh, he's southernizing.

2288
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,120
Jason is fans too and they're sharp.

2289
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,120
Oh God.

2290
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,120
He's gonna turn on us.

2291
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:29,400
I keep it on keeping me cool but not cutting my face off something fierce.

2292
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,400
That's right.

2293
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,400
How about you?

2294
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,560
Why don't you cool off with something refreshing?

2295
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:43,560
Why don't you take a sip of my piping hot Big Easy wine?

2296
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:47,680
Most of those words I didn't like, but wine I certainly do.

2297
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:49,520
Have you drank hot wine before?

2298
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,960
I haven't had very hot wine.

2299
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,960
It's a delicacy.

2300
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:53,960
I do declare.

2301
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:54,960
That's right.

2302
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:55,960
It's the sweet spot.

2303
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:56,960
That's right.

2304
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,960
What do you think you're going to, tall boy?

2305
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:04,720
I was just sneaking away.

2306
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:06,400
No, you're not going anywhere.

2307
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:10,600
I'll spank your little bottom before you go anywhere.

2308
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,600
That's right.

2309
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,120
The party's just beginning, Michael.

2310
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:18,080
I am not going to have the accent.

2311
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,280
I promise you this.

2312
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,280
Is that right?

2313
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:29,280
Even if I took out one of your biggest weaknesses, something naughty like Mardi Gras beads.

2314
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,960
Well, well, well.

2315
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,120
What do I have to do to earn them beads?

2316
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,640
That's right.

2317
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,640
That's right.

2318
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:42,560
Now that you're under my spell, I banish you boys.

2319
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,160
I banish you to the underworld.

2320
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,160
Whoa.

2321
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,160
That's right.

2322
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:49,160
It's shaking off.

2323
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,160
I don't have the accent anymore.

2324
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,160
Wait, wait, what happened?

2325
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:55,920
Did we just sign our soul over to this guy?

2326
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,920
I'm sorry.

2327
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:57,920
What?

2328
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,920
The underworld?

2329
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:03,840
You signed a Ralph Brennan embroidered napkin, a Faustian bargain of sorts.

2330
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,320
You're going to the underworld.

2331
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:06,320
What?

2332
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,320
Wait a minute.

2333
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:08,320
Did we lose?

2334
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:09,320
I think that means we lost.

2335
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,320
I think we lost a boss battle.

2336
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,320
We can lose the battles?

2337
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,320
I didn't realize that.

2338
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,320
We won.

2339
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,320
We were two for two.

2340
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,320
We lost them.

2341
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:16,320
Hold on.

2342
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,320
Wait, wait.

2343
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,520
Hey, Ralph, how about a skull pin?

2344
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,560
You ever cooked skull pin before?

2345
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,360
Doesn't that look tempting?

2346
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,320
Get that shit out of my.

2347
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,160
Okay, that didn't work.

2348
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,160
I tried to trick him.

2349
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:30,720
The fish is dead on the ground now.

2350
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,000
He owns our souls.

2351
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
What are you talking about?

2352
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
The underworld.

2353
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,120
The underworld, boys.

2354
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:39,680
You just made me a lot stronger.

2355
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:44,720
Your banished down below to one bad bayou.

2356
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:45,720
What?

2357
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:46,720
What bad bayou?

2358
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:54,320
All the stores of downtown Disney past have fallen.

2359
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,520
Oh my God.

2360
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:56,520
That's right.

2361
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,520
Oh, that's right.

2362
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:04,040
Fallen brothers that you'll have to discuss behind a paywall.

2363
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,040
What?

2364
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:08,040
Oh, oh my God.

2365
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,040
Okay.

2366
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,040
Oh God.

2367
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:14,520
Did you just make this series longer?

2368
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,520
Wait, wait.

2369
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,520
Yeah.

2370
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,520
I'm not even going to say it.

2371
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,520
Are you?

2372
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:19,520
Okay.

2373
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,520
Can you tell me, can you say specifically what this entails?

2374
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:26,600
What you're saying is we have to go behind our paywall, podcast the ride the second gate,

2375
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,560
and we have to do, we have to do more episodes than what we were already doing?

2376
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,840
I couldn't have said it better myself.

2377
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,320
Oh my God.

2378
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,760
We thought this was going to be 15, but apparently it's going to be longer.

2379
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:40,960
How, wait, how many?

2380
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,960
How many?

2381
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:42,960
What are you talking about?

2382
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,680
Like how many things do we have to do?

2383
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:49,640
We're now looking at 18 total episodes, boys.

2384
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,640
You motherfucker.

2385
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,200
It was never 15.

2386
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,120
I knew it was too good to be true.

2387
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,760
I like, Oh my God.

2388
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:02,400
You've co-opted our three monthly behind the paywall, Patreon episodes.

2389
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,840
Haven't you, you evil son of a bitch?

2390
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,760
I couldn't have said it better myself.

2391
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:10,120
He took them over and pulled them into this series.

2392
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:13,480
And what was supposed to, I was so happy it was only 15.

2393
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:16,640
It was mercifully shorter than the city walk saga.

2394
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,640
And now it's almost as long as the city walk.

2395
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:19,640
It's one less.

2396
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:22,640
It's an insultingly number, it's an insultingly shorter.

2397
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:25,080
It's a taunting amount of almost the same.

2398
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,080
Okay.

2399
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,840
So I guess if I have to sum up everything, it means that there's going to be 15 free

2400
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:30,840
episodes.

2401
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:34,680
Yes, that will happen, but there are going to be three additional episodes behind a paywall

2402
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:37,240
at patreon.com slash podcast the ride.

2403
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:38,240
Is that right?

2404
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,240
Is that right?

2405
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,240
Is that the wrong?

2406
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:43,920
It's the shops and experiences that have fallen that have closed it down.

2407
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:50,600
It's been open for so long and so many failed businesses have been there.

2408
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,880
No, that's going to take us forever.

2409
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,880
I couldn't have said it better myself.

2410
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:58,280
You're so pleased.

2411
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:59,280
I hate that.

2412
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:03,920
I know it's a compliment that you're, you like our phrasing, but I'm still not happy.

2413
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,880
You, but you, I can think of no worse punishment.

2414
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,440
You are banishing us to three more episodes.

2415
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,440
Jesus Christ.

2416
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,920
You son of a bitch.

2417
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,960
Good luck boys.

2418
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:28,080
And if you'll excuse me, I've got to go finish a big bowl of bananas foster with Harvey mud.

2419
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:33,040
Wait a minute, Mike, you're turning into little, little pixels.

2420
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,040
You're splintering off.

2421
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:36,320
Oh, I feel where our bodies are.

2422
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,920
I don't feel so good.

2423
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,720
Jason, I got a case of the vape.

2424
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:43,640
Jason, I'm scared.

2425
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,640
We're descending.

2426
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:47,240
We're descending down beneath the bayou.

2427
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:51,840
And if you want to know what happens to us, there's only one solution.

2428
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:57,060
You have to go to patrion.com slash podcast, the ride.

2429
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:03,480
It's the only way to know what's going to be happening to us for the next three days.

2430
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:07,800
Otherwise the straight run of episodes is going to be broken.

2431
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:11,360
You'll only get a straight run of episodes without a three day lapse.

2432
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:15,480
If you subscribe right now and page your account, such pockets, the ride, it's $5.

2433
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,760
It's only $5 for this one.

2434
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:22,320
On the good side, it's only $5 in our whole back catalog also available as well.

2435
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,120
So you can also just binge on all the old episodes.

2436
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:29,960
You can still hear about McGruff and the coming out of our shells tour.

2437
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:34,320
So there are good things, but I'm starting to splinter.

2438
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,620
My face and mouth are disappearing line by line.

2439
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:39,440
So I better wrap it up.

2440
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:44,760
Please for more downtown Disney ordeal, there's only one thing you can do.

2441
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:50,480
Join us tomorrow at podcast, the ride, the second gate page on duck, I've slash podcast,

I'll see you guys down there.

2444
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,640
