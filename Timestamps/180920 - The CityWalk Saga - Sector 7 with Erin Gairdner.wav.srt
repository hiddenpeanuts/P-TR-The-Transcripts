1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:27,000
As theme park journalists, we know the value of trust. You trust us to provide accurate, up-to-date theme park news, to hold ourselves to a higher standard than pretenders like bumper car boys. Today, we've broken your trust. As we spend much of the episode praising a Mexican restaurant that has since closed, we let you down, and much more importantly, we let the Sector Keeper down.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We hope you can tolerate this episode as something of a time capsule, of an era where Camachos stood strong, and Antigitos was but a flicker of a ripple of a dream. Thank you for your anger, your criticism, your honesty. It is making us better.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:01:02,000
With all that said, Sector Keeper, we hope you can find it in your heart to give us today's assignment.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold, a sublime hot topic and billabong. A place where you can purchase a candy thong. So let's go take a walk. Let's all go to City Walk tonight.

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Podcast The Ride presents The City Walk Saga, a daily 19-part, extremely necessary series exploring the stores, restaurants, and wonderful magic that make up universal city walk Hollywood.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The City Walk Saga, Sector 7. At 7, it has become clear we have actually been doing this for an entire week, a week's worth of content. Is this too much content?

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No such thing.

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You let us know. I feel like nobody's ever complained about too much. I haven't heard complaints about episode length, but is this pushing it?

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This has to be pushing it. This is insane what we're doing.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You'd have to think. And it's probably bumping other podcasts out of people's. It's possible that people are not getting this. If you've listened to 20 podcasts, maybe there's not even room for these to show up new because you haven't cleared them out yet.

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Right. People have probably unsubscribed from us for this period and will subscribe in two weeks again when we resume the normal show.

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Which is fair. I wouldn't hold it against you. One reason might be if you don't live in Los Angeles and you don't know what the fuck these 19 episodes in a row are referring to.

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But we've crunched the numbers and a lot of the listenership is in Los Angeles and any LA resident loves City Walk, guaranteed.

15
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And anyone who's been at Universal Studios knows the wonderful magical shopping and dining area outside of the theme park on both coasts is called City Walk. So they know what this is.

16
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, unless you're some sort of eccentric millionaire who can afford the valet at Universal Studios.

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, to skip the walk.

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is there a valet though? Oh, it is. It's in Frankenstein.

19
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I think the valet is in Frankenstein, right?

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Look, gentlemen, there are two valets, one in Frankenstein and then one in the Jurassic Park.

21
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So you can come out in different areas depending on where you go to valet.

22
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So do yourself a favor and do the valet that is mid City Walk to catch some of City Walk.

23
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Not Frankenstein because Frankenstein does take you on the other side of the park.

24
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So you will miss all of a City Walk if you go to Frankenstein.

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So go to the Jurassic Park valet, which is really when you go to the closer, when you go like toward the main sort of hub where you would get dropped off in a lift at City Walk.

26
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's the area where you're going to want a valet to make sure that you get a good amount of City Walk in.

27
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And that's the valet that you can get validated at a sit down establishment?

28
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Both valets, you can get validated.

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, both.

30
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
For two and a half hours if you go to a sit down restaurant.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So we've said all that, but we haven't said our names, which are Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hello.

33
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And if that the tenor of that may let you know that some of the hosts, some of us, I imagine at some point have struggled with this, this ordeal of this series.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And, you know, it feels like a long walk through the desert.

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And that's, you know, when you're going through something trying, you need the support of people you love and people who care about you.

36
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And I'm happy to have such support today, our guest today.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
She is the artist behind the logo of this podcast that is on your screen right now.

38
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Look at your screen unless you're driving, then shut off your car and look at it later.

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But and she is also engaged in holy matrimony to me, Erin Gardner is here.

40
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hi guys.

41
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I say 19 days isn't enough.

42
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Wow, man, what else could we do?

43
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can listen to this bullshit forever.

44
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She's right. She's right.

45
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There's the hills that lead up to the, there's the sidewalks that have been recently redone.

46
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Fascinating.

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The stairs that we haven't talked about the fountain, the beloved Universal Studios.

48
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The neon sign fountain.

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The elevator, the cool elevator that connects the Sheraton and the Hilton.

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, we could talk about that.

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, that's got to be.

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But yeah, there's plenty more.

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I think the Sector Keeper could double the sectors, perhaps.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We'll ask them.

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Guess what, boys?

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The grand reveal.

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There are more sectors still to be done.

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's probably where this is going.

59
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Every few years, there's another 50 Pokemon.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You can never collect them all.

61
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's kind of the same.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I do.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, I appreciate you saying that, Erin, and I know that you listen to the show, which is very nice.

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And you also listen to the show in real life constantly when you hang out with us.

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This is true.

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's kind of a strange paradox because I feel like this is very natural and normal.

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Like I'm just hanging out with you guys, but I'm also kind of a fan.

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I'm in a weird fan.

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, Scott.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, but really I am.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And I'm kind of happy to be buried in the middle.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You've had such great guests.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And now it's like Scott's wife.

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh, come now.

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Look, feel at home.

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Roast Jason for some reason, if you want.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, I mean, that's definitely going to happen.

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
All right.

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Come on.

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But you also, you contributed to this show in such a major way by giving us our Epcot Dream logo.

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes, thank you.

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, thank you.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do that.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Absolutely.

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I also, you know, you there was an alternate version of it where I was suggesting all this

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
extra crap roller coasters and stuff.

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And you wanted to do it a lot more simple.

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And then Mike wanted to do it a lot more simple.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And y'all were right.

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It was a real mess.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
When it had all the extra bells and whistles.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Add some birds flying by and Guy Pukin off a roller coaster.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And as much as you can jam into the square, it's possible.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah.

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I mean, you know, it's very simple.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I think it's a good good starting off point for when we have 50 t-shirts and there's 50

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
variations on the symbol.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So yes.

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And I am down.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I think they'll be great.

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hopefully.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
There will be merch on the way.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
A lot of reformatting to do.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, yes.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, and do we have putting things in different, you know, in switching your CMYKs?

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know what shirts are printed in.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm not sure if you can see the RGB right now, guys.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Sorry to say.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So that is for screens.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, no.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If you guys want it printed CMYK is going to come into play.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's going to get real messy.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We're talking file extensions here.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, yeah.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Geez.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, in color settings.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, is that what it is?

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's what you.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's the color format.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Interesting.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If you're going to print it.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I just hope shirts are available in the shade of purple that is close to what the current

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
logo is.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It'll be close, but not quite.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, boy.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I could start my own dry podcast on color formatting.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Sure.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think the logo would be the shirt wouldn't be the purple.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, I mean, I guess you could have a purple shirt, but I feel like the logo would be ink,

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
wouldn't it?

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes, it would.

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah.

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's all very comfortable.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We could talk about it off the show.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Nah.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We don't have to do this on the listener's time.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
OK.

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But I don't know, we're pushing the limit of what can be considered podcast, the right

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
content.

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's true.

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Might as well keep going with that.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Erin, the other great thing about having you here is so you're all right.

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So you're a Valley kid like me.

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And I think you regarded City Walk in a fairly high fashion growing up.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It was the coolest place when it first opened.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The absolute coolest.

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Especially because I was like a preteen and teenager sort of in its like rise and heyday.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And it was where you kind of felt like an adult.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I remember going to the Hard Rock Cafe and buying like drumsticks for the boy that I had

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
a crush on.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, wow.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Sorry to spring this on you.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't actually know this story.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, you don't.

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, you know that I don't.

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I know.

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You saved it.

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I had a crush on someone before you and I bought him drumsticks.

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh my goodness.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Did it just say how I'm easily threatened?

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you know my YouTube body of work, you know, like I did a I did this video where I'm Michael

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
McDonald.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And the first one I did was for your birthday, Erin.

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And it was because you declared you had a crush on like 78 era Michael McDonald.

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And I was like, we'll see about that.

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah.

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I will make you think of me instead.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You served that crush.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah.

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Quite handily.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I think so in the minds of the whole world.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Does this mean you're going to take up drums now?

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Maybe or I'm going to I need to dress up like this boy.

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, you're going to need a mushroom haircut.

186
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You need to 1997 it up.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, boy.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Good opportunity.

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I need to be like a pre makeover Nick Carter.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What's what?

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What else about this boy?

193
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He was just a boy that I had a crush on.

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I bought drumsticks.

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We don't need to dwell on this.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Did they just say hard rock on them or was it?

197
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They didn't have like famous drummers name on them or anything.

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, no.

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They just said hard rock.

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Joey Kramer, Aerosmith drummer, drumsticks or anything.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No.

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Just generic hard rock.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think I got a pity dance out of him at some school dancer.

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I was not very cool.

205
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I also like that you defaulted to the hard rock gift shop and not the two block long

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
guitar center and Sherman Oaks on Ventura.

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Is this closer to you?

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes.

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh yeah.

210
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Way closer, but not as cool.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, certainly not.

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah.

213
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah.

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Lamer logos, just actual drum companies.

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,640
Do you know the fact about the, I forget if I've told you in the lead up to this, that

216
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,480
the sectors are such that the hard rock retail store is in a different sector than the hard

217
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,800
rock cafe itself.

218
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,000
You did tell me this and I think it's bonkers.

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I mean, I think that it makes perfect sense because that's just the way it is.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Wow.

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That, that is a solid argument.

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,800
There is no debating that.

223
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
It's a Trumpian.

224
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
It's yeah.

225
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Yeah.

226
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Yeah.

227
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
It's a bureaucratic kind of a thing.

228
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
It just, it just, that's not how it falls.

229
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,240
You know, I respect the sectors.

230
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm not going to, I'm not going to stir up trouble.

231
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Thank you.

232
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Yes.

233
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Thank you.

234
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,680
I'm not sure that every guest along the way has or will respect the sectors, but thank

235
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,920
you for, uh, and he's not, he's not with us.

236
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,120
He's with us today, but we'll summon him at some point to give us the, to officially

237
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,000
assign our sector before we do.

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,240
I think it's worth saying, I don't think we've really said this on the podcast, but

239
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,120
universal studios factors so heavily into us.

240
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Yes.

241
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Together.

242
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,000
Uh, it's a 12 year relationship now with four years of, of marriage.

243
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And it really, in some ways began at universal studios.

244
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It did.

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,760
Um, uh, um, being that, I mean, we, we could switch on and off, jump in whenever you want,

246
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,000
but the, we're going to shut our mics off.

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, yeah, sure.

248
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,800
I'd love to hear some fiction in this story as well.

249
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,000
Interject to whatever you want, make it a fancier story.

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,760
But I got, I got the job as a universal studios tour guide.

251
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,600
Uh, I, I suited up and wore the ultimate uniform you could ever dream of wearing.

252
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,400
I love a man in uniform.

253
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,600
Balloon khakis and a denim button up.

254
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,080
Um, adjacent, uh, light blue.

255
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,800
Uh, but I got this job and I was kind of spreading the word that I was, that I was doing this

256
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,000
and we were acquaintances in high school.

257
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,720
Um, and you were, had just finished college and you wrote me a message on my space that

258
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,360
was the, where you didn't have a lot of pride in yourself.

259
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
I never do.

260
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:26,520
And it was, cause it was sort of like, you're like, I don't, I'm coming back to LA and

261
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,320
I realized I don't have any friends.

262
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,420
Are you cool?

263
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,400
You seem like you might be cool.

264
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,040
It was all true though.

265
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:40,360
All of my friends had moved from LA, you know, everybody, everybody went off to different

266
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,620
schools and stayed where they stayed.

267
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,200
And I was the one who came back to LA and I didn't have any friends left.

268
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
And I always liked Scott.

269
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,120
I loved his videos.

270
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
I was a big fan.

271
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,220
I thought he was funny and yeah, I thought that we would be good friends.

272
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,880
And I had heard that you've got this tour guide job and I was like, well shoot, I gotta

273
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
go see him.

274
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,440
That's a good excuse to hang out and make a new friend.

275
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Sure.

276
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,800
And I, and I thought it was a good excuse to, uh, uh, to do that, to present myself

277
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,000
in the most impressive manner possible.

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,600
And so, and you came with our friends, Tyler and Kia and Andrew.

279
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,120
And I, I was so excited.

280
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,800
You guys were there that I did something.

281
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,480
I did probably a fireable the fence.

282
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,200
I forget if I talked about this in the show before, apologies if I did, but I, I was like,

283
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
you know what?

284
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
So excited to have you guys.

285
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,560
I'm going to take you to a place that I've not taken any, but the guests are not supposed

286
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
to go.

287
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,840
And I led you from the tour guide patio, uh, over to the deep backstage area and the backstage

288
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,560
area contained the rotting remains of ET's teacher, Botanicus.

289
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Wow.

290
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,160
He took me to the Botanicus graveyard.

291
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,960
I screamed when I saw him and Scott, you turned around so fast and you were like, I, I can

292
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
get fired for this.

293
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,000
Like really, please keep it down.

294
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,800
The good boy jeans or in effect even while doing an illegal act.

295
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:04,400
And just then William Peterson came out of the soundstage where they shot CSI.

296
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
That's the kind of fiction.

297
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,760
Him and Aaron locked eyes.

298
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,320
It's Scott beat the shit out of it.

299
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,800
I stole the drumsticks Aaron bought for him.

300
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,960
While, while that, uh, while who are you play?

301
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,880
Who are you?

302
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,960
Um, this is weird cause when we first met, I was, you caught wind of my botanical relation

303
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,240
to I have to bot botanic.

304
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
That's how Spielberg says it.

305
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Oh yeah.

306
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,060
Teacher Botanicus Botanicus.

307
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,000
And then I had been talking about this on the screen junkies.

308
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,960
Um, and you'd become famous for using people know me the most is talking about ET's teacher.

309
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:49,760
One of the first things you showed me a photo of this rotting botanical botanicus and my

310
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,920
God, it's she was horrifying looking.

311
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Yeah.

312
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
Yeah.

313
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Terrifying, but also exhilarating.

314
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Well, sure.

315
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Of course.

316
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,840
And it's kind of what you dream would be around backstage at universal studios.

317
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Yes.

318
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Otherwise nothing very interesting.

319
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,960
I think I said on another episode that one time I got to see like a bunch of the DeLorean's

320
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
from the bags of future.

321
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,800
I stacked up, but nothing.

322
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,880
I just wanted to try to like snap off a piece or something and there was nothing there,

323
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,560
but I'll never forget during the training, it was like, we went up a big flight of stairs

324
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,480
and then, Oh my God.

325
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Yeah.

326
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
That's big.

327
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Yeah.

328
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Did you, did you ever?

329
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
He was huge.

330
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
That's right.

331
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Yeah.

332
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,880
And he's because he's on this big like a pedestal that was like embedded in a stone or whatever.

333
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,400
How long had the ride been gone out here?

334
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Hmm.

335
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,120
Mommy was in 2003.

336
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,800
This was 2006.

337
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,480
So this is like two years old just sitting out in the sun for.

338
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Yeah.

339
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
On the rain.

340
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,280
It was just out in the elements.

341
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,640
There was no covering over it.

342
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,640
It was so sad.

343
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,040
That happened with the rocket rods too, right?

344
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,520
Like didn't someone say, I feel like I've heard someone say like, there was no rocket

345
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
rocket character.

346
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,440
No, but like the ride vehicles were just like left in a lot in Glendale or like parking

347
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
on.

348
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
I've heard that about like the parade and stuff.

349
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Certain parades just get left out.

350
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,640
Spectra magic was left under like temporary tents in Florida.

351
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,840
It was just kind of destroyed by the elements.

352
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
I think.

353
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,680
But Botanica is ET's teacher from the green planet.

354
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
He doesn't deserve that.

355
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
He has a personality.

356
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,240
I think that's sort of the dividing line.

357
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,760
Some ride cars, it's like, ah, I sort of get it.

358
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,840
But I mean, it's like leaving a person out there.

359
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,320
It's like leaving your grandfather in his wheelchair just out on the patio for a few

360
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
years.

361
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,240
Also, surely some museum would have happily taken that for surely Universal could have

362
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
just donated that.

363
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,240
The Smithsonian, Natural History Museum.

364
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,280
Some pop culture museum.

365
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,440
Did you ever think about taking it?

366
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
It would have been impossible.

367
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
It was too impossible to do it.

368
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,560
Oh, it's giant heavy machinery and you could see all these machine parts.

369
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,480
I'll post this out to Twitter, which may get me, I wonder if they'll retroactively find

370
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
me.

371
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

372
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,560
It's bit specific proof.

373
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:05,200
They'll find me one day's salary, $45.

374
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,440
Did you ever yell at like an older or like a more senior employee like this belongs in

375
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
a museum?

376
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,800
What is it doing out here?

377
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,320
I want to know, did you ever yell at God?

378
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,280
How could he let such a big botanicals?

379
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,040
This was the only way that like the rage that we all have every day of the Trump administration.

380
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,320
This is the only time I'd ever felt it before.

381
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,560
I was screaming at people about the poor care of botanicals.

382
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,600
This alien is dying out here.

383
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,600
He needs to get back to the green planet where he can be needs to bring joy to all the little

384
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,760
creatures to the to glub lock and the flop flop and the flop cloppel.

385
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,200
There was also a rotting like mushroom guy.

386
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
You know what?

387
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Is that the flop?

388
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Yeah.

389
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,040
One of the friends you have to find also left to die.

390
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,760
See, I don't remember that.

391
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
There was that.

392
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,600
I mean, the botanicals pulled a lot of folks.

393
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Tragedy.

394
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
He was there too.

395
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,160
I put them on that scenic overlook halfway down the starway where there's like a Apollo

396
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,320
13 cut out.

397
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
Just put them there.

398
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
They're there.

399
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
We'll take pictures.

400
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
I don't care who the cow.

401
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
Look at this crazy guy.

402
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
I'll take a picture with him.

403
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,680
Oh, he looks a little like ET.

404
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
Oh, whatever.

405
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,280
They think he's in the movie.

406
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
Like I remember that scene when he comes.

407
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,320
Yeah, you get botanicals on one side, you get the Oakwood apartments in the deep background.

408
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Yeah.

409
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Sorry to do that.

410
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,040
Yeah, show some respect here.

411
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,960
We will do a full botanicus episode.

412
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Yeah, that's fine.

413
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,160
I think we'll go back to some of the other ones and go, oh my God, we only spent an hour

414
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,160
and a half on the ET adventure?

415
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,000
Anyway, so I was riding high off of, you know, I showed that I knew my history.

416
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,520
I also showed that I was a real rebel, except when it came to high volume.

417
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,840
And then you came and took the tour and I kind of customized the tour for you and pointed

418
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,040
out the detail you requested, which is wherever on the lot was used for the Janet Jackson Escapade

419
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
video.

420
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Mexico?

421
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Yeah, that was Mexico.

422
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,840
It was like right before or right after the flash flood.

423
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
Oh, OK.

424
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Yeah, yeah, sure.

425
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,200
That little Mexican town also used in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

426
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,880
And Big Fat Liar?

427
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Oh, yeah.

428
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,440
Yes, the flood was practically used as exactly right.

429
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Yes.

430
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,000
The Frankie Muniz movie.

431
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,700
So I finished the tour and it felt like a particularly good one.

432
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,380
And then we got off and everybody was really nice.

433
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,800
And then you said, I have such a crush on you right now.

434
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,160
And I thought that was mean.

435
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,640
Very rude of her.

436
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
I would say bold.

437
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
I was very honest.

438
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,120
And I think the theme of this, I'm declaring a lot of crushes in this episode.

439
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,120
I think I'm quick to declare a crush, but I really meant it.

440
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,560
Yeah, sarcastic is what you're saying.

441
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Yes.

442
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,920
Yeah, I thought it was like this moment literally happens on The Simpsons.

443
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,120
I think you're cool, Homer Simpson.

444
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,520
Stacy, that was me.

445
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Sandra.

446
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
That was me and Sandra.

447
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,880
I thought it was one of those.

448
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,880
And unlike Homer, I didn't revel it.

449
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,960
Honestly, for like the for 10 minutes, I was kind of like, I don't know.

450
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
That was in a pretty.

451
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I just don't.

452
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Why would you do that?

453
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,240
Soon enough, though, you'd find it was true.

454
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Yeah.

455
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,920
I just got it out and I asked you on a date to the air.

456
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,400
I recall calling you from the universal patio.

457
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,000
And then we are our first date.

458
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,680
You picked us up from the other from the lift.

459
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
We took this.

460
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
We were at the stop today.

461
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,160
What do you call that?

462
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,120
What it's it's the by the book of the Beppo that end the taxi.

463
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,440
I think that's the one that connects to the E.T. parking structure, right?

464
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,160
Yeah, I think.

465
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,840
If you look on the lift app, I think I've said this before.

466
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,720
If you look on the lift app and you say you say your pickup is universal, they ask if

467
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
you were by the fountain or by the other.

468
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,520
It's like the airport where you have multiple options at this point.

469
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Yes.

470
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,160
But yeah, our for our first day, you picked me up from there from a tour guide shift and

471
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
the date went very well.

472
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:21,320
And well, I mean, I guess if we're being correct about it, are the second kiss of a long time

473
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,280
relationship and marriage was in the Frankenstein parking lot.

474
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Wow.

475
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,600
The end of the night.

476
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Yeah.

477
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,040
So I'm sorry to say that fact in advance of the ultimate parking episode.

478
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Right.

479
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
I am.

480
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,520
Yeah, you should have saved it, but I'll allow it.

481
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
Yeah.

482
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,960
Well, Aaron, I guess because Aaron's here.

483
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,760
Now let's reenact it.

484
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,320
Well, Jason and I.

485
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,000
This would look more like the traditional Frankenstein burning of a windmill.

486
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What?

487
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Right.

488
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,480
Don't they chase him in a windmill at the end of that movie?

489
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
I'm not sure.

490
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Or does he?

491
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,960
If we all kissed, that's what it would look like.

492
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
What are you doing?

493
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
He's on his phone.

494
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,720
He's still trying to find out this lift fact.

495
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,160
So you either you can either set your lift pickup as Universal Studios, which is by the

496
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,680
fountain or City Walk East, which is right between Bucca de Pepo and Lids.

497
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Yeah.

498
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
Went to all that trouble, but then called it Bucca de Pepo.

499
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
Yeah.

500
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,760
It sounded like he said P and P.

501
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,760
Beppo.

502
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Bucca de Beppo.

503
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Oh, Bucca de Beppo.

504
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,160
Oh, I think the sexor keeper is suffering right now.

505
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,120
I think I just probably mush mouthed it.

506
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,960
That's just that Philly vibe.

507
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,280
You just mush a bunch of syllables together and sometimes it comes out a little weird.

508
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
I don't know.

509
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,960
I think you're leaning on Philly to hide your mistake.

510
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,260
Don't blame your city.

511
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:53,680
So a successful date began at City Walk East and really a successful marriage and life

512
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
began.

513
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,120
But that's not that has nothing to do with this sector.

514
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,000
No, no, no, no, you're correct.

515
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
And the sector keeper would be upset.

516
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,560
But it is it is it is saying that, you know, magic happens at City Walk and at Universal

517
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,640
Studios and that dreams come true there.

518
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Yes.

519
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,280
And that's the whole you know, if if we're if some of the the the rap on City Walk is

520
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,520
that like, you know, it's this fake place, this fake, this artificial city.

521
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,360
And it's not really look at that magical life events.

522
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,000
Important things happen just in doing this podcast series.

523
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,400
We've had we've had good times with friends, of course, and some unpleasant bathroom experiences

524
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,520
and uncomfortable aqua massages.

525
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,040
A lot of city walks where it all happens.

526
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,000
And we still have some heavy hitters coming up.

527
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We're going to have some great nights at Howl of the Moon coming up.

528
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah.

529
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And Margaritaville.

530
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yikes.

531
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah.

532
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,680
And you'll be you'll be forced to join us for some of those.

533
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,760
It's not being forced.

534
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,160
We have to stay till close at all the moon.

535
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
I just want to say that now.

536
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
That I will not.

537
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
I don't know.

538
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Even if I were to participate in that.

539
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,960
It's going to be me alone at Howl of the Moon.

540
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,280
Anyway, with all that is back storying with how much city walk has factored into into

541
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,560
your life and our life together.

542
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,600
I think we should now turn to the sector keeper and get today's assignment.

543
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,280
Boys, boys, Aaron, today's sector is sector seven.

544
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,160
Nectar bath treats, Camacho's Cantina and Walters Gate.

545
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,120
Good luck.

546
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:39,640
OK, and sector keeper, you are correct that those are the things that are presently in

547
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,240
sector seven.

548
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,880
But there's more to this sector than meets the eye.

549
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,920
There's a little bit of hidden magic because in the history of sector seven, there was

550
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,400
once a truly magical place indeed, a place called Wizards.

551
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Yeah.

552
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,840
Oh, this is the reason that I was so excited about this sector.

553
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
Yes.

554
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,800
And this is why this is why you're here.

555
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,000
And because I consider so Wizards is well, you do you want to describe it?

556
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Yeah.

557
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,880
Wizards was a very cool like like a magic club slash bar at like dinner theater type

558
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
place.

559
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
Mm hmm.

560
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Yeah.

561
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,960
Where you just go see a magic show and you could go during the day also.

562
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,520
And they had like psychics sort of roaming around the bar area so you could go and get

563
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,280
your fortune told, even if there wasn't a show happening, it was awesome.

564
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Right, right.

565
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,080
And where exactly in the city walk geography was was it?

566
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,560
We were trying to figure this out.

567
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:46,840
I believe the entrance is where the current American Express New Card member.

568
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
Yes.

569
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Kiosk is.

570
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,640
That's where I think where you bought tickets from what I can tell.

571
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
And like the sheriff's department.

572
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,640
Yeah.

573
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
Yeah.

574
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,600
And I think it's of I think a lot of what's used as the sheriff's department.

575
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,160
I don't know if any of it got annexed into the UCLA extension.

576
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Possibly.

577
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,600
Which we haven't really covered either.

578
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,880
I don't think that maybe didn't really turn it become a sector.

579
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,560
Was it one time functional class space?

580
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Yeah.

581
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
And the sign is still there.

582
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Yeah.

583
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
But I don't think they do any of it now.

584
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Don't think so.

585
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,320
I looked it up a little and I think it was kind of a bone throw to residents who were

586
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,640
like, well, a town should have education.

587
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,560
And so they like, all right, here, let's jam something in here.

588
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
I don't know.

589
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,720
And I think it's now gone and they moved it all to Woodland Hills, to my hometown.

590
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,160
But so, yeah, because we were walking around the area and you were now that that bridge

591
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,320
that is kind of that separates kind of that middle zone, that sir, the circle court in

592
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
City Walk.

593
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
Yeah.

594
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,560
Was that that was part of it.

595
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,880
I believe that was part of the bar.

596
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
That was the bar.

597
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
I think.

598
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Yeah.

599
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
It was extended.

600
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,320
It was sort of an overhang and you had it was all glass walls and you had a view of

601
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,520
City Walk from the bar area.

602
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,480
This was three stories tall.

603
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Yes.

604
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Three stories.

605
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,400
Well, you entered at the at the floor level and then you got in an elevator that I only

606
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,960
have the most hazy childhood memories of it and like preteen memories, but it was a black

607
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,600
light sort of elevator.

608
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,120
So you would get in and the lights would dim and there would be sort of like a black light

609
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
effect.

610
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,640
So you were immersed from the minute you got in the elevator, which was so cool.

611
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,600
And then the doors would open and let you into what I think was the bar level.

612
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,120
And then above that, there was a like fortune telling area.

613
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Whoa.

614
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,640
And the third, the third floor is certainly isn't anything that hasn't become unless it

615
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,400
became maybe part of it might be the John Lovett's Comedy Club or one of those things

616
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,600
or space for the sheriff's.

617
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
Yeah, it might be that.

618
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
Is there like a city walk jail up there?

619
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,400
Maybe it's the city jail.

620
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,280
Oh, you three would never know.

621
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
You're such good boys.

622
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
Yeah, we'll never know.

623
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,400
Well, after that night at the moon, who knows what?

624
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,960
We've had reports that you're drinking a lot of the free fruit water at the Sheraton down

625
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
the hill.

626
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,000
That's what you yeah, you're going to be in jail for that.

627
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Just wandering.

628
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,840
And he was referring to me.

629
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Oh, yes.

630
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:23,360
I love you guys after we saw the Kung Fu Panda thing movie and I didn't want to pay for a

631
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,840
four dollar Dasani.

632
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,600
So I walked and got free fruit water and sat in the Sheraton lobby.

633
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Yeah.

634
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,160
Well, we've established that I am the bad boy of the podcast.

635
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,080
What would this quiet stepping away to see botanicals?

636
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,680
But shush, don't tell anybody.

637
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
And this water thing.

638
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Yeah.

639
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Yeah.

640
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,120
So you're lucky you didn't go to city jail for that cotton candy disaster.

641
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,640
Yeah, that's true.

642
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,280
Her littering for you dumping a whole cotton candy into the garbage because I couldn't

643
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
eat.

644
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
Yeah.

645
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Oh, yeah.

646
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,920
Aaron's lucky enough to hear so many of these stories before the listeners hear it.

647
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,840
And then again, when you're listening to it later and then again, if we're out socially

648
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
punishment.

649
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
Yeah.

650
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,840
So sorry.

651
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,240
And what a perfect place for you to be in a city walk.

652
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Candy thing.

653
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Oh, let me refresh you.

654
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
No, no, no, it's good.

655
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
I heard it twice already.

656
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,600
There's so much cotton candy and like I couldn't eat it and like, oh my God, I can't believe

657
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
I ordered it.

658
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,520
And then Nick Mundy texts you and says, I'm worried about Carlson with this whole cotton

659
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
candy thing.

660
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,480
I'm at a point where I can't hold on to my own memories anymore.

661
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,720
They've all been replaced.

662
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,000
All that brain space is now your memories.

663
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,960
This is why you need to you.

664
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,800
You need to preserve the memories of wizards before they're knocked out of your brain by

665
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,080
something even stupider.

666
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Yeah.

667
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,960
Diving a milkshake.

668
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,200
If only Philip K. Dick had lived long enough to write a story about a podcast that replaces

669
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,360
your own memories with anecdotes you did not live.

670
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Duller.

671
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
Less interesting.

672
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
On par.

673
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
In the ballpark.

674
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
I have a brain.

675
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,160
I haven't lived a fascinating life.

676
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
Geez.

677
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
But you went to wizards.

678
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
What are you talking about?

679
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,800
It's three stories of magic.

680
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Of magic.

681
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
So much magic.

682
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
It's so much.

683
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,640
I had my 11th birthday party there, which was a dream because I loved this place and

684
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:25,680
I couldn't wait to be 21 so that I could drink in this damn bar because there was a certain

685
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,320
time or certain days that they wouldn't allow kids in there.

686
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Yeah.

687
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:37,360
And it drove me nuts because there would be days that I would look at it and think, oh,

688
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,640
if only I was an adult, I could go up there and have those.

689
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,840
They serve drinks in potion speakers.

690
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Yes.

691
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:51,720
Well, the trailer for Wizards has these special drinks and it's potion or test tube type

692
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
drinks.

693
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
Yeah.

694
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:01,120
So this guy sent us a four minute long video package trailer for Wizards, which is first

695
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:08,680
off, I'm glad you did because I think I said to you before, if you search Wizards and City

696
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:14,320
Walk now, it's very hard to find any results that aren't Harry Potter stuff.

697
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Right.

698
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,000
Actually, I was just talking about this with my mom is that this is all before Harry Potter

699
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,920
and for kids who were into, and for me, I was super into like David Copperfield, but

700
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,640
also Eureka's Castle.

701
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:35,760
So it kind of was this like wizard safe place for kids who were into like nerdy stuff.

702
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,680
Because there was like a Dumbledore looking wizard roaming around in addition to like

703
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,680
a wise, in addition to the 90s.

704
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
He's like a more of a Merlin looking.

705
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Yeah.

706
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Like a Merlin.

707
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
He's like got the purple or something robe.

708
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,240
It was a very classic take on wizardry.

709
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,880
Did you care about Sword and the Stone also?

710
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
A little bit.

711
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Yeah.

712
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,440
Isn't there, is Sword and the Stone the one where people are attracted to the squirrel

713
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,760
or something?

714
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Which one is that?

715
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
Yeah.

716
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
They're turned into squirrels, right?

717
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Merlin turns.

718
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
They're attracted to squirrels?

719
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,440
People, is there a, there's a female squirrel or something, or is it the, the, the boy turns

720
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,440
into a squirrel.

721
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,160
The boy turns into a, Merlin turns the boy into a squirrel and he like experiences young

722
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,440
love or something with the girl squirrel.

723
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
Okay.

724
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
I don't remember it that well.

725
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,560
I feel like I've talked to somebody who this was an awakening for and I swear I'm not coding

726
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
myself.

727
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
All right.

728
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
We'll believe you.

729
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,960
This is the male equivalent of the women of a sort of Fox Robin Hood.

730
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Yeah.

731
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,400
Cause many women say that they were attracted to the Robin Hood, Disney character Robin

732
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,360
Hood, the Fox, cause he was like a cool, handsome Fox.

733
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,360
Really?

734
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
Yes.

735
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,560
I was attracted to Ken from Street Fighter.

736
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,040
That was one of my first cartoons.

737
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
He was a human.

738
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Yeah.

739
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Man.

740
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
So that's normal.

741
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Which one, which ones he describe him?

742
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,720
He's the blonde Ryu.

743
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Okay.

744
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Sure.

745
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,480
They were very, they're too boring guys.

746
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Yeah.

747
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,040
Not like Blanca, not like M Bison.

748
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,040
I think I have a crush on Bison on Raul Julia.

749
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Oh yeah.

750
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Oh, well that's fair.

751
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Sure.

752
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,680
Do I tame the power?

753
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,520
I didn't realize this is a tangent Balrog, which is the boxer character.

754
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,160
They were going to call him M Bison because it was Mike Tyson.

755
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,720
And then it was a problem and they changed that and they made that the character that's

756
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,960
M Bison M Bison.

757
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,440
So they could not even make the association.

758
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,000
That's why that weird name exists though.

759
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,400
Oh, it's rise of Tyson.

760
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,960
And Zangief was a real Russian wrestler.

761
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,880
Oh, so how about that?

762
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,840
So Street Fighter facts for you guys.

763
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Hey.

764
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,640
Anyway, back to the three story magic.

765
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,840
Getting off three story magic.

766
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,200
You were saying that the store, because the other thing is what is now nectar bath treats

767
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,320
was a wizard's store.

768
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,560
It was a wizard store and they sold wands and you know, like wizard trinkets and it's

769
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,280
sort of a pre what all of Anders is that the name?

770
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
Yeah.

771
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Yes.

772
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Wand shop.

773
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,200
So I would spend, I called my mom to ask if she had any memories and she was like, yeah,

774
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,560
I couldn't get you and your sister out of the wizard store because you guys loved all

775
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,320
the magic stuff and something that I didn't remember that she did is that they had like

776
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,880
slight of hand magicians sort of roaming the store.

777
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:23,000
So even if you didn't go up into the bar area or see the show, the store had magic for you

778
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
and it was free.

779
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Really?

780
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,440
It's funny you say that because when I last time I was in Orlando, there was a shop in

781
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,160
the original part of Universal Studios Florida sort of before you like hit the kids area,

782
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,600
that was like a magic shop and they're like, we'll have a magic show in a little while.

783
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,360
And I'm like, okay, what is this?

784
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,920
And I went in, this might've been two times ago I was there because now I think it's like

785
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,880
old, you know, studio props you can buy props from the theme park and stuff.

786
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,600
But at one point in time it was magic and it was like close up magic and little, little

787
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,520
stuff because you could then buy all of those tricks right around the corner, including

788
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,840
a wallet you could open and there would be fire.

789
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:17,720
Like it fire through the length of the wallet and somehow it like used the lighter fluid

790
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,520
and they're like, they were telling everyone only adults, you have to have an adult buy

791
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,480
this and also we're not going to, we can't sell you the lighter fluid and you can't take

792
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,040
lighter fluid on plates, but it uses any regular lighter fluid.

793
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,120
So yeah, so Universal's not above a magic association to this day.

794
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,280
You didn't get that trick, did you?

795
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
I didn't get the trick.

796
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,440
And you didn't accidentally put your money in there?

797
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
No.

798
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,280
Too careful for that.

799
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Come on guys.

800
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
That's true.

801
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,720
But it was also weird to come out and look across the way and be staring at Diagon Alley

802
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,000
and be like, that's right, I don't, okay.

803
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Huh?

804
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,920
Well competing with competing wand stores.

805
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,840
I don't want to, you know, I, I'd say, you know, however you want to take us through

806
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,360
the three stories, feel free.

807
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:15,120
But I did find a, a little like passage from a website or from a piece of promotional material

808
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,440
that kind of lists everything that you could do.

809
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,800
And maybe that can help guide us.

810
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,160
I would love to hear this because my memory is so fuzzy.

811
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,600
And yet I do think you were the best source of information because there is almost none.

812
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,920
I had to really dig in my Google searching.

813
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,200
I had to make the date, you know, before 2002 or whatever.

814
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,400
So you know, when one of these sounds familiar, if you have anything to say about it, feel

815
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
free to stop me.

816
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,120
My memory is like looking through a kaleidoscope.

817
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,020
That's just like hearts and stars.

818
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,020
It's just a feeling.

819
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:52,480
I just can't get over that bar on the bridge sort of, because I've always looked up at

820
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,600
that bridge that crosses over the walkway and been like, yeah, that is a really, that

821
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,520
would be a cool view.

822
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,320
But it's like, wait, does it just connect the office buildings?

823
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,600
Like, I mean, it's probably all office space up there now.

824
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
It's just a sheriff, I think.

825
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,680
But I remember fairly late in the game.

826
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,400
I forget if you were with me when I saw this, but I like, I was walking through one of those

827
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,240
corridors and they still like the doors were still lightning bolts from wizard's era.

828
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Yeah.

829
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,960
So they left remnants of it.

830
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
So pretty late.

831
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,680
Okay, so, you know, here, stop me or I'll ask you about some.

832
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,600
Make it a magical evening check.

833
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
You did that clearly.

834
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
What, the birthday?

835
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
Yeah.

836
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
Yeah.

837
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Oh yeah.

838
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,800
And tell us anything else from that birthday.

839
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,600
Good attendance, good presence that you got.

840
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:45,560
I'm thinking there's only one picture and it's from like the house after the wizard's

841
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,320
stuff where we had like cake and open presents.

842
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,920
And I was looking at the people in this picture and I was like, huh, there must've been a

843
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:00,080
minimum to fill a table because some of it was like my sister and some of her six year

844
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:06,240
old friends, my cousins, some girls that I didn't like from school.

845
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,720
And it's like, oh, this is sad.

846
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,160
I had to like really reach around.

847
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,680
I still had a great time.

848
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,160
So good you didn't take any picture.

849
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,720
I mean, that's, you know, that's a good time.

850
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,440
It's like, oh, I didn't take pictures.

851
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Too much fun in the moment.

852
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
They might not have allowed it.

853
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,880
Maybe it would have ruined Magic Castle.

854
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,320
Magic Castle, by the way, if you don't live in Los Angeles, kind of the like the more

855
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,120
like traditional equivalent of Wizards that's been there for a long time and it's still

856
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,120
there.

857
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
That has to be where this comes from, right?

858
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
Yeah.

859
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
I would say Magic Castle.

860
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,640
Let's make a cheaper, gaudier city walk version of this.

861
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
Anyone can go to Wizards.

862
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Not anyone can go to Magic Castle.

863
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,000
That's right, only people give you a card.

864
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,320
Some people, like a magician, will hand you a card that gives you access somewhere.

865
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,520
But other than that, yeah, it's harder to get into.

866
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:01,400
I did see this literature that they said they felt like the Magic Castle was by magicians

867
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
for magicians.

868
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Right.

869
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,200
And they wanted to create a populist magic bar.

870
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,400
For the many, not the few.

871
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,120
Magic.

872
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,480
I have another theory also, which is that I think it's just this, we've talked about

873
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:26,560
other things, this dynamic elsewhere in theme park culture, where I wonder if they talked

874
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,720
to the Magic Castle and said, would you want to open a wing at City Walk?

875
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Oh, interesting.

876
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,520
And they said, no, this is what Paul Scheer said about the improv.

877
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,400
Was it Boom Chicago or Improv Olympic or something?

878
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,960
Or a New York one?

879
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Was that one?

880
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Chicago City Limits.

881
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Oh, okay.

882
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Chicago City Limits.

883
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
Gotcha.

884
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,240
Disney had approached them to do the comedy warehouse.

885
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
Okay.

886
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,280
And they said they wanted an insane amount of money.

887
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
For the name.

888
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
For the name.

889
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,840
And Disney went, okay, well, thankfully, improv games aren't copyrighted.

890
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
So.

891
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Neither is magic.

892
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Neither is magic.

893
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
And neither is magic.

894
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,360
There's another thing similar to this also.

895
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,520
Well, it didn't end up happening, but when they were looking for live entertainment for

896
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,480
City Walk, they approached the groundings about opening a wing in a theater at City

897
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
Walk.

898
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
Oh.

899
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
It did not happen.

900
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,480
What could have been and what John Lovitz ultimately made happen.

901
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,800
I think UCB City Walk sounds pretty good right now.

902
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Hey.

903
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Maybe close.

904
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,440
UCB Sunset opened up UCB City Walk.

905
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
And put it in that hallway.

906
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Kick the sheriffs out.

907
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Yeah.

908
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,000
So, all right.

909
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Make it a magical evening.

910
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Chat with a wizard.

911
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,480
Accomplished?

912
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,280
I don't remember.

913
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,160
I know that there was a roaming wizard, especially like at the dinner show.

914
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,320
I think, you know how they have like the Charlie Chaplin at the Wild, Wild, Wild West show.

915
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
Yes.

916
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,880
Like, you know, roams around before the show starts.

917
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,880
I think the wizard.

918
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Right.

919
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Have been that sort of.

920
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,760
Like the guys who do the hijinks in the Waterworld show were running around before it.

921
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Yeah.

922
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,680
But I don't think Merlin had a lot of or sorry, a wizard had a lot of hijinks.

923
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,680
Yeah.

924
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,680
He's generic wizard.

925
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,680
Copywritten.

926
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,000
That might be public domain though.

927
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I think Merlin is public domain.

928
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,280
Sounds like he would be.

929
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
It's interesting though.

930
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,640
I was going to there's a combination of this, which is not how the Magic Castle works, but

931
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,040
there's a combination of your fantastical magic and your, you know, more practical magic.

932
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,520
Your traditional magicians, but also there's a wizard roaming around.

933
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,320
So it's like it's a fan.

934
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
It's crazy.

935
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
It's very fantasy.

936
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,600
There's fantasy element to it.

937
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,360
And there's also like more normal magic type things.

938
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,720
And also comedy, Matt.

939
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,440
Like there was in the video, there's a guy doing like gag magic.

940
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Yeah.

941
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
And a laser show.

942
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
Right.

943
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,600
Oh, that laser show looks cool.

944
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
Yeah.

945
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,040
Which I think was a pre-show element sort of thing while you were eating.

946
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
Yeah.

947
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,360
It's probably on that list, right?

948
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
It's coming up.

949
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,360
Yeah.

950
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,360
We're going to make.

951
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,360
I'll skip ahead.

952
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
Yeah.

953
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,200
The spectacular laser show creates glittering sights and exciting sounds.

954
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Accurate.

955
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
Yes.

956
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,480
It's time to make your shrimp skewers appear.

957
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,880
Now, there's something else.

958
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,160
It sounds to me like the food presentation is much like the pirate's dinner adventure,

959
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,760
which we did an episode on and Aaron was present for.

960
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,920
I saw a review of Wizards, which had the following quote, the first three quarters of an hour

961
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,600
of the two hour show is devoted to a meal of indifferent quality served with Prussian

962
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
efficiency.

963
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,360
What does that mean?

964
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,360
I think it means how the pirates thing was, which is like it is they think those guys

965
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,480
are on it.

966
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,000
It is a delivery system.

967
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
This is not what would you like, sir?

968
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,560
They're grilling you.

969
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,840
That is likely true, but I was 11 and didn't give a shit.

970
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:53,120
I was goofing around with my friends and probably doing like silly things with the straws.

971
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,000
So sure.

972
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,360
That's the magic that you could do.

973
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,840
Some of the power of silly straws.

974
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,920
All the liquid comes in a pitcher.

975
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,920
It's all dumped out in a pitcher.

976
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,480
Your ship is in a pitcher, drinks are in a pitcher and it's just like you have one chance

977
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,680
to get you have to flag them down if you want it.

978
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,640
Your magical meal were personal pan cheese pizzas.

979
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,320
Sounds pretty good actually.

980
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:22,040
Yeah, this is probably on the higher end of food for your 11 year old self.

981
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,040
Definitely.

982
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,040
Yeah.

983
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,040
Yeah.

984
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,040
It was fancy.

985
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,720
Now, what you probably didn't do as an 11 year old, I hope was drink a love potion.

986
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,960
Oh, I would have loved to though.

987
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,960
That's the kind of thing that I yearned for when I was 11.

988
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
Adults.

989
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,640
I just wanted to be 21 so that I could go drink there and fall in love with a cute boy

990
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,280
who maybe looks like Ken from Street Fighter.

991
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:55,040
Be served a drink that's Midori and Midori over ice.

992
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,160
Have your palm read.

993
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,280
When you talk about the mix of types of magic, very strange.

994
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,880
That's not something at the Magic Castle that it's palm readers too.

995
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,880
Yeah.

996
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,880
And I did have that done.

997
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,880
Ah, remember anything?

998
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,600
No, I'm sure it was very tame because I was 11 or 12 when I had it done.

999
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,440
They weren't like, I see that you're with a bunch of people you don't like.

1000
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
At your party.

1001
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,440
What's that like?

1002
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,440
Why is your cousin here?

1003
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,120
Scraping the bottom of the barrel, are you?

1004
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,000
Don't have enough friends at school?

1005
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,600
That seems like too easy for a palm reader to do it for like an 11 or 12 year old.

1006
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,080
You're going through a lot of changes right now.

1007
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,080
Yes.

1008
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,080
Exactly.

1009
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
You feel like people don't understand.

1010
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
Yes.

1011
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,240
I remember it being a lot.

1012
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,160
It was really focused on the palm reading itself and it was like, here's your lifeline

1013
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,280
and you have a long lifeline and here's your wealth.

1014
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,880
And here's it was really tech.

1015
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,040
Like you could go on Wikipedia and say the same things that the palm readers there said.

1016
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,680
They call this the pinky finger.

1017
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,920
Here's the part that I wanted to ask you back because I don't, nothing I saw on the video

1018
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,000
correlated to this exactly.

1019
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,280
Visit Saturn, Jupiter and Mars.

1020
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,600
No idea what that means.

1021
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,600
Yeah.

1022
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,600
Yeah.

1023
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,600
I didn't see any equivalent of that.

1024
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,000
Maybe that's if you drink too much.

1025
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,880
I guess so.

1026
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,560
If you smash your head on the way out.

1027
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,560
Yeah.

1028
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,020
Then you'll be seeing stars and planets.

1029
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,920
Everything here also had a Z, a wonderful thing.

1030
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,280
See the world's top magicians perform amazing tricks while you dine in the elegance of the

1031
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,760
theater of illusions.

1032
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,800
So that's the main theater.

1033
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
It must be.

1034
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,800
Yeah.

1035
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,320
And you'd see, you know, like, yeah, there'd be, there'd be a comedy magician.

1036
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,520
There'd be more of a sleight of hand guy.

1037
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,520
Yeah.

1038
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,520
Yeah.

1039
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,240
It seemed like they, they had a lot of variety.

1040
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,640
Seems like they were, they were lauded for that.

1041
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
Yeah.

1042
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,320
The laser show covered before after the show, you can sip cocktails and concoctions in the

1043
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,200
magic potions bar as magicians perform at your table.

1044
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,200
What a bar.

1045
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,200
You could if you were 21.

1046
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,200
Right.

1047
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
So you didn't get to do it.

1048
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,200
I didn't.

1049
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,200
So by the time you turned 21.

1050
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,200
It was gone.

1051
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,200
Wizards is no longer.

1052
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,040
We would be hanging out there all the time.

1053
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,040
That's what I was thinking.

1054
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,040
That's right.

1055
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,040
That's why I was watching that YouTube.

1056
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,040
Cause we go to there for city.

1057
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,120
We were to watch the movie, go to opening night of movies.

1058
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,120
We, and now we go to Margaritaville beforehand, but we would absolutely be at Wizards bar

1059
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,120
every night.

1060
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,680
The bar was beautiful too.

1061
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,720
It had so much neon.

1062
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,720
So much.

1063
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,720
Yeah.

1064
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,720
Yeah.

1065
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,960
That was, those shots were blowing me away.

1066
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,520
It's very much my aesthetic.

1067
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,440
The and a giant Wizards hat in the main bar.

1068
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
Yeah.

1069
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,440
Yeah.

1070
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,440
It was huge.

1071
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,320
Two stories it says, and you could see that from the window.

1072
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,320
Yeah.

1073
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,360
And now it's an empty hallway.

1074
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,360
It's sad.

1075
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,360
What are you talking about?

1076
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:47,040
We keep, this has been a recurring thing in the podcast in the city walk series is I've

1077
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,880
been calling them fallen brothers, the ones that didn't make it.

1078
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,440
And it seems like everything with personality is not really there.

1079
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:00,920
Like the beloved rain stick store of the nature company, the rain sticks are the bar.

1080
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,080
It doesn't really look like it, but it reminds me of Clark's bar from Star Trek, deep space

1081
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,680
nine, which was apparently a bar in Vegas, which is outside of the Star Trek experience.

1082
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,240
Oh, at the, uh, the West gate.

1083
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,240
Yeah.

1084
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,880
I think that's where it was, which is a thing I never went to the Hilton.

1085
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,880
Yeah.

1086
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,880
It was our first trip in Vegas.

1087
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,880
Oh, that's right.

1088
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,880
Yeah.

1089
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,880
Our first vacation.

1090
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,440
Um, but it's like a, yeah, it looks, it looks like dreams are made of it.

1091
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,080
We've been there a number of times and it's a really confusing mishmash of it's still

1092
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,380
a Star Trek.

1093
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,160
It's still a spaceship casino.

1094
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,160
Right.

1095
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,960
Now it's a timeshare selling place.

1096
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,600
So you go into the Star Trek themed area and they try to sell you a time.

1097
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,480
Wait, did you say it's West gate?

1098
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,480
Yeah.

1099
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,240
Is that the guy from King of Versailles or Queen of Versailles?

1100
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,240
Yes.

1101
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,240
Oh yeah.

1102
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,240
That guy's the biggest piece of shit.

1103
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,160
The guy who runs West gate.

1104
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,960
That guy is the sleaziest guy with this giant house.

1105
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,960
Okay.

1106
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,320
So when you're in, um, like you're in a Star Trek themed area and on folding tables are

1107
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,560
Queen of Versailles t-shirts that you can buy.

1108
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,880
Get out of here.

1109
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,960
They add like as if the Queen of Versailles presented just like, what was that?

1110
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,920
Dumpster, the show with Paris Hilton and, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1111
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,160
Like, yeah, she's just, you know, she's the queen of, uh,

1112
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,960
You know, like the, like the, the wealthiest ritzy, but the documentary is extremely sad.

1113
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,960
Oh, it's depressing.

1114
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,960
Yeah.

1115
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,960
Yeah.

1116
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,520
Dead animals and their horrible house and their palace never gets built.

1117
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,520
And you're watching that they would like present that as like live like the Queen of Versailles

1118
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,720
and not cover up the Star Trek stuff.

1119
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,720
Not cover up.

1120
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,720
So funny.

1121
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,720
Just a space.

1122
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,120
I mean, that was a thing that the people in that movie are so gaudy and cheap, even though

1123
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:50,000
like the guy in the mo, oh God, I forget his name now, but he made so much money selling

1124
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,680
time shares and shit.

1125
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,520
And he got in like, it got a lot of hot water.

1126
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,680
Cause like one either 2008 or 2012, he said like, well, if Obama wins, I don't know if

1127
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,600
I'm going to be able to keep all these people on payroll the way this guy's going.

1128
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:12,120
And it's like, what's the disease weird, like ultra rich people over like that Obama.

1129
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:19,120
He sure was radical in the way that no one went to prison for the financial crisis.

1130
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:26,120
And, uh, uh, uh, Obamacare was a modified Republican healthcare plan.

1131
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:34,040
Well, you can relive the glory days of 2006 and the half completed.

1132
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,760
Also remember when we got on the elevator and people had just finished a Star Trek wedding?

1133
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,760
Yes.

1134
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,760
Wow.

1135
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,760
And they were in full.

1136
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,760
Full costume.

1137
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,760
Was there an alien?

1138
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,760
I think so.

1139
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,760
Yeah.

1140
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,760
Were there Ferengi?

1141
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,760
I don't know.

1142
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,760
I don't know the Star Trek.

1143
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:55,520
I think one was just kind of like a mod sixties girl Star Trek crew person.

1144
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,240
The other one might've been a Ferengi though.

1145
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,240
I hope.

1146
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,240
I'm not totally sure.

1147
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,240
Yeah.

1148
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,240
For your sake.

1149
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,240
Or a Borg.

1150
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,240
No, no Borg though.

1151
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,240
I hope not.

1152
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,240
There were only two people getting married.

1153
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,240
So how long ago was this again?

1154
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
That was in 2006.

1155
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
Okay.

1156
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,440
So was the casino not necessarily still Star Trek?

1157
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,440
I think it is.

1158
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,440
A little of it.

1159
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,440
No it is.

1160
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,800
In 2006 it wasn't Westgate yet.

1161
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,600
That was still the Las Vegas Hilton.

1162
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,600
Yeah.

1163
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,120
It changed over pretty in the last five or six years I want to say.

1164
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,120
Recently.

1165
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,240
But remember when we went a couple years ago and it still had the Star Trek logo outside

1166
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,680
even though it doesn't stay Star Trek anywhere inside.

1167
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,840
This thing is a mess.

1168
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,840
They are not keeping track of what's going on.

1169
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,880
One of my biggest regrets is not doing that Star Trek experience.

1170
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,880
Which people theme park.

1171
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,880
Which people go nuts about.

1172
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,880
People said.

1173
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,880
Did you do it?

1174
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,880
You did it?

1175
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,880
I loved that show.

1176
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,880
No.

1177
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,680
Oh you loved the show Star Trek?

1178
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,680
No I loved the.

1179
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,680
Oh the thing I'm talking about.

1180
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,920
Yeah at Universal Studios right?

1181
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,920
Oh no.

1182
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,920
No, no, no, no, no.

1183
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,920
This is a different thing.

1184
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,920
Wait what?

1185
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,120
In Vegas it's called the Star Trek Experience and you would like get beamed up and like

1186
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,920
be on the bridge of the Enterprise and then like Borg would show up.

1187
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,480
Like alien Borg would show up and that's a whole people describe it as incredibly immersive

1188
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,920
to Mr. Tony Baxter I think says he was blown away by it.

1189
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,920
Wow.

1190
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,400
Because he thought it was like going to be a normal ripoff simulator like Star Tours

1191
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,120
style but then you get beamed up somewhere and it was an incredibly like realistic effect

1192
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,600
and then you're like on the bridge and it's like they have performers and it's a whole.

1193
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
That sounds cool.

1194
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,080
You're talking about the Universal Studios.

1195
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,080
Sorry yeah yeah yeah.

1196
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,640
The stage show at Universal Studios which I loved.

1197
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,200
Were you ever in it?

1198
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,200
No.

1199
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,200
Were you in any of those?

1200
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,880
Did you do Harry and the Hendersons of sound effects?

1201
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,880
No.

1202
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:40,000
I had a very cool friend named Astrid growing up and she got picked for everything.

1203
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,040
Everyone I know is a friend named Astrid is like Astrid's so cool.

1204
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,080
She was the coolest.

1205
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,040
I mean she deserved to get picked for everything.

1206
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,960
I was sort of quiet and weird and she was like loud and crazy.

1207
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,400
I see they knew she could she could give them some energy.

1208
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,400
Classic Astrid.

1209
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,600
Yeah yeah yeah.

1210
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:02,520
I think we're almost through the list but the I don't want to skip past that potions

1211
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,240
bar that you get a little like magic potion themed drink and I love in the video when

1212
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:12,960
they set down a magical overflowing potion drink next to a little bowl of Chex Mix.

1213
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,320
Not magical but yeah we would be you love the Chex Mix.

1214
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,640
We go have the Chex Mix at the Universal Hilton bar.

1215
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,280
Which we will cover in a later episode.

1216
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Is that still there?

1217
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,280
Yeah.

1218
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,520
Cause I walked through it the other day and I don't know that I saw.

1219
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,520
No.

1220
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,520
The Atrium bar?

1221
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,520
The snack dispensers yeah.

1222
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,520
Snack dispensers oh I don't know.

1223
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,680
They may just have it like under the counter now.

1224
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,480
Are you saying that there's still a bar but maybe not the snacks?

1225
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,480
Yes.

1226
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,480
Oh well okay.

1227
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:43,000
The Atrium bar is still there but I feel like they just have these giant like dispensers

1228
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,760
for like Chex Mix and stuff.

1229
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,160
Maybe they just scoop it out now.

1230
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,360
Chase this is one of the times when he sat up to double check and see if the snacks were

1231
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,360
still at the bar.

1232
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:55,120
I sat up too but I thought it was because the Atrium bar was gone.

1233
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,120
Right you scared them that the bar was gone.

1234
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,800
No still going strong looks recently redone.

1235
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,440
I just hope it's still like big brass bars and stuff.

1236
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
That's beautiful.

1237
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,920
We gotta go have a drink there too.

1238
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,920
We will.

1239
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,920
We have so many places to go.

1240
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,960
We're gonna hit that and take the outside elevator down to the Sheraton.

1241
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,440
Oh yeah that outside elevator that goes really slow and clunky.

1242
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:19,360
Which was not working the other day so I walked down 45 degrees.

1243
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:24,640
Middle of the day sun burning bright.

1244
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,360
Next if you like walking up hills and taking long escalator rides Universal Studios the

1245
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,360
place for you.

1246
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360
Yeah agreed.

1247
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:37,200
Let me see the Venture of Visions psychic reading room and Spirits the fortune tellers

1248
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,200
bar.

1249
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,440
Wait those are different things?

1250
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,920
Psychic readings and fortune tellers different?

1251
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,920
I guess so I don't know.

1252
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,320
Oh my god and you never and after all you never know what the future holds until you

1253
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,000
ask.

1254
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,760
So you accomplished all that.

1255
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,760
It sounds like an incredible 11th birthday party one of the greats.

1256
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,040
If it's 10 years later I would have loved to have a 21st there.

1257
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,040
What a bummer.

1258
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,940
Yeah I feel like you would have done it but you had the same thing with me where you thought

1259
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:07,080
your adulthood would be full of city walk visits which I guess it has been.

1260
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,080
It kind of is.

1261
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,080
It kind of is.

1262
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:15,280
Just with levels that we added to it but we have spent a lot of our actually our 10th

1263
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,320
wedding anniversary was in that Hilton Atrium bar.

1264
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,840
We've done a lot of important events and milestones in our lives.

1265
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,640
We'll renew our vows below the King Kong as if he is.

1266
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,640
That would be fun.

1267
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,000
That's a not a bad idea.

1268
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,160
Well you know we should do it under that sign that says the most beautiful faces in the

1269
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,560
world pass through here.

1270
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,440
Well that would be a lie.

1271
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,720
Just yesterday I noticed that sign like I always notice the face but I never really

1272
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:53,200
process the text on it and I was just like what in the hell.

1273
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,680
Just looking at that sign because I was like crossing above it and I like just happened

1274
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,160
to look down and go like what what.

1275
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:07,640
I always knew the sign was there and I went on an early I went on a high school date to

1276
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,360
city walk and I remember thinking like what if I was like what if it was going really

1277
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,880
well and if I was like bold enough maybe I could point to that sign and say yeah like

1278
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,880
you.

1279
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,880
Wow.

1280
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,880
You didn't do that.

1281
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:25,720
I know I did not I did not have the courage to do that.

1282
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,640
Now we were we knew each other in high school does that make you jealous we weren't dating

1283
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,640
then.

1284
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,640
We it was the perfect timing together we both grew out of our thank God it was stagger awkward

1285
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,640
phase.

1286
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,640
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1287
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,080
Scott do you remember wizards being there and not going in.

1288
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,640
I think I assumed it was for adults only I assume and I was never corrected on this so

1289
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,200
I could have gone and I didn't go and I'm upset about it.

1290
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,960
Sometimes kids could go not always though.

1291
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:54,680
OK I see there's very few things you admit to being upset that you didn't go on because

1292
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,760
usually I'll say like oh I wish I went an alien encounter you're like too scary I don't

1293
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,760
care.

1294
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,560
Yeah yeah and then like this might be one of the only ones where you're like I regret

1295
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,560
yeah going in wizards.

1296
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:07,760
I'm pretty sad about this of things we've talked about I'd say this not going to wizards

1297
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:14,000
and that I didn't get to meet Marvelous Marvel McFay at Astro World Astro World and hear

1298
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,720
the song ring through the through the loudspeakers.

1299
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,160
So just just to confront so wizards open in 2000.

1300
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,880
No no no no OK sorry.

1301
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,880
93.

1302
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,880
I'm not young.

1303
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:33,640
I started dating Aaron at age five.

1304
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,560
My yeah 1995 was my birthday but it was OK before then.

1305
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,880
And how long did it last for.

1306
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,760
I don't remember when it closed.

1307
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:47,360
I figured it out finally and it took a lot of I ended up on magician message boards to

1308
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:51,320
figure this out and I made it back alive.

1309
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:57,920
OK it was it closed it seemed to have closed slowly in 2002 I think just the lease probably

1310
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,960
heading for a 10 year lease and they just didn't renew it.

1311
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,560
And sadly I had to say it I think the the it was owned by a husband and wife and the

1312
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:12,040
wife passed away and I think the owner lost enthusiasm for doing it and just kind of just

1313
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,040
sort of let it go.

1314
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,040
Is that a bummer.

1315
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,160
And and and now here's the thing.

1316
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,800
Oh no this I did figure out this did open.

1317
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:24,280
Here's new fact for you Aaron that I somehow kept to myself at home.

1318
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,280
There was a.

1319
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:31,160
Thank you inner monologue.

1320
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:37,960
That wasn't talking for two seconds.

1321
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:44,520
There for a little stretch of time there was a second wizards in Tokyo Japan.

1322
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,360
Yeah yeah didn't know this.

1323
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,840
And where was it you ask.

1324
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,800
Well they were trying to build it.

1325
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:56,440
It was slated to open in Jakarta Indonesia originally.

1326
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,200
They were 95 percent completed when political upheavals there made it impractical.

1327
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:07,240
So yeah the wizards were chased away and they ended up opening it in a mall called XP

1328
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,320
Ari which means inspiring experience.

1329
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,680
And this mall is right next to Tokyo Disney.

1330
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,680
And now I know that there is this mall outside Tokyo Disney.

1331
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,720
So yes perhaps the four days will need to be.

1332
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,720
Whoa four Jason.

1333
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,720
Jason we're all right.

1334
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,640
And so Scott's got a really I perked up.

1335
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,360
It's a technicality but take it.

1336
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,080
Hey yeah I will.

1337
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:39,040
I'm already imagining Scott with his like Sherlock Holmes style magnifying glass like

1338
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,680
check it out this ball.

1339
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,200
Trying to find remnants of wizards.

1340
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,120
Yeah I found a W. I found a W on a pipe on a valve.

1341
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:54,000
So we flash forward to 2018 because there's so much stuff in the sector now.

1342
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,880
There is yeah we haven't done any of the current.

1343
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:01,000
Can I say one more thing which is that there's the happy ending to this to that sad story

1344
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:08,320
which is that the the main close up magic guy was named Warren Gibson and he left in

1345
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:12,440
the mid 90s to establish he was so inspired by his time at Wizards and everything he learned

1346
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:20,200
there that he opened his own magic bar in on Maui in Lahaina is a Maui area.

1347
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,640
And that's called Warren and Annabelle's and that is that was open in 1998 and it's there

1348
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,640
to this day.

1349
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,640
Let's go.

1350
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,640
Wow.

1351
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,360
We got to go to Maui.

1352
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:36,840
So this literally the spirit of Wizards transferred over to one of the most beautiful places in

1353
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,840
the world.

1354
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,840
So thanks Warren for Annabelle.

1355
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,320
Wow we all got to go to Maui.

1356
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,640
No complaints from me.

1357
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,640
Yeah.

1358
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,640
How many days in Maui?

1359
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,440
I think seven is great.

1360
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,440
Seven?

1361
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,440
Okay.

1362
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,440
Personally.

1363
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,760
That one I'm not going to I'm not going to complain about.

1364
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,000
Seven days in Maui sounds wonderful.

1365
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,800
All right so that's that's the Wizards tale and thanks for telling us what you knew.

1366
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,800
Thank you.

1367
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:06,520
But there is other stuff in the in the sector including where we went today Camacho's Cantina

1368
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,200
where you had been before correct?

1369
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,200
Yeah several times.

1370
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,200
Uh-huh.

1371
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,640
I don't know why I hadn't had you guys.

1372
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,640
Never.

1373
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,640
Just yesterday.

1374
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,920
This must be a thing like they must.

1375
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,560
It's just because it's like hidden away a little bit.

1376
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,640
There's something uninviting about it.

1377
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,880
Yeah I know none of us have been there.

1378
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,120
But it's got a lovely fountain outside.

1379
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,120
Yes.

1380
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,720
And I've been to the one at the airport.

1381
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,720
Oh.

1382
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,720
What?

1383
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,720
In Terminal 1.

1384
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,400
Or at least there used to be in Terminal 1.

1385
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,080
I think that is a Camacho's like there's a McDonald's.

1386
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,640
It used to be a Godsend.

1387
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,240
LAX has gotten a lot nicer in the last five years or so.

1388
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:47,240
But when I used to fly US Airways a lot because one of their hubs is in Philadelphia.

1389
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,220
They got bought by American Airlines.

1390
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:55,840
But I'd always be flying out of this one terminal that had like no food in it besides a McDonald's

1391
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,600
and a Camacho's which was like a Godsend for like breakfast burritos.

1392
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,600
Yeah.

1393
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,600
Oh.

1394
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,600
It sounds familiar.

1395
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,600
I do feel like I've seen the logo in LAX.

1396
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,600
Yeah.

1397
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,600
Yeah.

1398
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,360
It's a pretty big logo sign.

1399
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,120
But in terms of the City Walk one had never been there besides yesterday.

1400
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:15,800
And I got to say walking inside, beautiful inside.

1401
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,800
Really nicely done.

1402
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,800
I was shocked.

1403
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,720
I walked out because it's like a little bit of a step.

1404
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,720
There's like steps down.

1405
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,260
It's kind of in the basement a little bit.

1406
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,260
Not really.

1407
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,260
But it's like there's you feel like you're going underground.

1408
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:27,260
The bar is.

1409
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,260
The bar is.

1410
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,260
Yeah.

1411
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:30,260
Yeah.

1412
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,260
Yeah.

1413
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,260
Sorry.

1414
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,260
And yeah, it's very nice.

1415
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,260
Yeah.

1416
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,260
This might be the hidden gem.

1417
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,260
We didn't know.

1418
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:39,840
I think that's an original City Walk 93 opening.

1419
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,960
Is it really?

1420
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,480
And it's just, you know, whereas other City Walk trends have come and gone and burned

1421
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,480
out in a flash.

1422
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,200
Classic Mexican food.

1423
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,200
Everybody always loves it.

1424
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,200
Always in style.

1425
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,720
And I would say 3 p.m. on a Friday packed.

1426
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,680
Their dining room packed.

1427
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,840
The bar a little less packed, but I had a great happy hour.

1428
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,880
The people there at the bar for happy hour were having a great time.

1429
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,880
What'd you get?

1430
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:10,640
I got just a house margarita and then I got potato taquitos with and it came with half

1431
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,400
mole sauce and half like avocado sauce.

1432
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,400
Delicious.

1433
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,200
A great mole sauce.

1434
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,200
Got out.

1435
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,880
I think both of those like 11, maybe 12 dollars.

1436
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,880
Wow.

1437
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,880
Great deal.

1438
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,360
That's better than just regular Mexican restaurants.

1439
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:30,040
Like, because usually you think City Walk like prices are usually jacked up above average.

1440
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:34,980
But I thought that Camacho's was on par with just regular Mexican restaurants in the city

1441
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,560
that aren't in a touristy area.

1442
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,560
I thought so too.

1443
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,560
Yeah.

1444
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:43,440
And I think in terms of happy hour might be a little loud ahead of Margaritaville in terms

1445
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,440
of like price and quality.

1446
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,660
Well, and certainly decor.

1447
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:50,440
Like when you compare those, the bathrooms in Camacho's are beautiful and fancy.

1448
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,120
I love the bathrooms in Camacho's.

1449
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,120
Full door stalls.

1450
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,120
Full door stalls.

1451
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,120
You kidding me?

1452
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,120
Gorgeous.

1453
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,120
Amazing doors.

1454
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,120
Molded.

1455
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,600
I love a full door stall.

1456
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,880
They have one at Carthay Circle.

1457
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,880
We'll eventually talk about that.

1458
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,880
It feels like you got a little apartment in there.

1459
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,880
This might be.

1460
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,440
I'm not going to hang out that long, but I just like it.

1461
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,920
It feels very private.

1462
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,520
Number one with a bullet in terms of City Walk bathrooms.

1463
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,520
Yeah.

1464
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,520
At the moment.

1465
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,080
I don't know that anything's going to top this.

1466
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,400
I think we may have to like, if we have to go to the bathroom for the rest of this journey,

1467
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,400
we'll have to like sneak into Camacho's.

1468
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,400
Sneak into Camacho's.

1469
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,400
Because that's a good.

1470
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,400
It's always packed.

1471
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,400
It would be easy to do.

1472
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,400
Yeah, that's true.

1473
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Oh yeah, yeah.

1474
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,900
Just slip past the crowds and yeah.

1475
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,160
Happy with your meal, Erin?

1476
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,640
Good skinny margaritas, both of us.

1477
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:32,640
Yeah.

1478
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,640
And nice beer too.

1479
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,640
Yeah.

1480
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,640
Yeah.

1481
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,760
Well, the best thing, the thing, this is going to sound like I'm trashing City Walk, but

1482
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,720
one of the best things about Camacho's is you forget you're in City Walk when you're

1483
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,240
eating in there because it's very much, the theming is different.

1484
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,080
It's not, you know, gaudy and neon in there.

1485
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:54,680
It feels like you're in kind of a whole Newali Mexican restaurant and it really like atmospheric

1486
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,440
wise, you know, you feel like you're having a different type of experience.

1487
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,440
Yeah.

1488
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,880
So, I mean, we all went to Camacho's.

1489
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,640
We all were like, wow, Camacho's is great.

1490
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:07,600
Are we putting it in the Golden Fort Chet?

1491
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,840
Yeah, I would put it in the Golden Fort Chet club.

1492
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,840
Yes.

1493
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,840
For sure.

1494
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,840
What's Italian for yes?

1495
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,840
C?

1496
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,840
C?

1497
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,840
Is it C?

1498
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,240
I was in charge of learning Italian for our honeymoon and I failed.

1499
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,240
Yeah, that's why I turned to you.

1500
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,680
French, say it in French.

1501
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:25,680
Just move it over.

1502
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:26,680
We.

1503
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,680
We're going to move it over.

1504
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,680
Okay.

1505
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,680
Can you give it five forks in French?

1506
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,680
C?

1507
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:37,560
That's as far as I could go.

1508
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,760
The fork, four K's.

1509
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,080
A, I, S. That's pretty specific.

1510
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,320
It's probably in front of you.

1511
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,080
You don't have to ask for one there.

1512
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,080
Yeah.

1513
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,080
Yeah.

1514
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,080
All right.

1515
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,160
It's in the, it's in the Golden something club.

1516
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,160
Yeah.

1517
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,160
Wow.

1518
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,360
What a, like, what a pleasant surprise.

1519
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,280
I thought that was something we might just brush by.

1520
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,280
I know.

1521
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,280
That's what I thought too.

1522
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,280
Yeah.

1523
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,280
Yeah.

1524
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,280
Really good.

1525
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,280
And that's what this series is about.

1526
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,280
Yes.

1527
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,280
We might've never gone.

1528
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,280
Yeah.

1529
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,280
That was the last thing.

1530
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,280
It looked in the menu.

1531
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,680
It said on Friday and Saturday, they have a mariachi band.

1532
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,280
Oh, we saw the stage.

1533
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,280
We sat by the stage.

1534
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,280
So gosh.

1535
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,280
What did everyone eat?

1536
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,280
Oh, I had carnitas and a flour tortillas.

1537
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,280
Great.

1538
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,280
Vegetable enchiladas.

1539
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,280
Salmon tropical.

1540
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:27,280
A little, a little accent above the.

1541
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:32,520
Oh, I felt like I took a swing.

1542
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,280
I was like, I know they'll do just kind of some greasy tacos as well, but a salmon dish,

1543
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,280
will they?

1544
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,280
I thought it was excellent.

1545
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,280
That's great.

1546
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,280
Chips.

1547
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,280
Good salsa.

1548
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,280
Oh yeah.

1549
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,280
Great chips and salsa.

1550
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,280
A little spicy.

1551
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,280
I liked it.

1552
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,280
Spicy.

1553
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,280
Yeah.

1554
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,280
Smokey.

1555
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,280
Smokey.

1556
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,280
Yes.

1557
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,280
Yes.

1558
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,360
I liked the green creams, stuff carved into that.

1559
01:06:54,360 --> 01:07:01,340
The decor of this place, it's like all of the, the, the tastefulness in city walk in 1993

1560
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,600
went into this one spot.

1561
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,600
Yeah.

1562
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,880
A lot of tile work, a lot of wood stuff.

1563
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,880
Yeah.

1564
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,160
I did say I got a little bit of a kick out of watching like an old, a middle aged, a tired

1565
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,000
white guy sitting at the bar, like a few down for me.

1566
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,920
Just kinda like in one breath go, can I get some sour cream, gracias por favor?

1567
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,440
Like it was one sentence.

1568
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,600
Not attempting to pronounce.

1569
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,480
And then finally, to wrap up the sector,

1570
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,680
upsettingly, the former Wizards Wonders

1571
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,320
became a lush for a long time,

1572
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,200
and now it's something called Nectar Bath Treats.

1573
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,240
All right.

1574
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,960
All right, here we go.

1575
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,800
Well.

1576
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,960
I hate this place.

1577
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,120
Sorry.

1578
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,440
Well, let's ask a quick question.

1579
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,040
How many of us bought something and tried it last night?

1580
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,240
Let's raise our hands.

1581
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,360
I like it, Jason.

1582
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:50,960
Two of us.

1583
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,280
Jason and I are raising our hands.

1584
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,880
The two A students.

1585
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,960
We got A's.

1586
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,280
I mean, this was one that I, early on, was like,

1587
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,600
well, I got to get something there.

1588
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,880
You declared that you were going to get something and try it.

1589
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,400
So then I said I have to get something and try it.

1590
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,840
I wonder what we got.

1591
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,480
I wonder what you got.

1592
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:07,840
All right.

1593
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,560
I guess I can go first with mine.

1594
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,240
So first of all, I wanted to, so just in case you don't know

1595
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,280
what Nectar Bath Treats are, most of it

1596
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,480
is like food looking, like food shaped soap.

1597
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,280
Yeah, it is not treats.

1598
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,520
Yes, you cannot eat it.

1599
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,080
There are a lot of signs on the wall

1600
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,920
that say do not eat this stuff.

1601
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,040
Because a lot of it looks like real treats.

1602
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,160
It's very pretty looking.

1603
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,160
Sit down, Edwin.

1604
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,400
It's not treats.

1605
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,240
Donuts, like popsicles, but there's soap.

1606
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,960
It's all these fancy expensive soaps.

1607
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,880
And a lot of soap where I was like, this looks cool,

1608
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,680
but what is the practical use?

1609
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,480
They had a three tier cake of soap.

1610
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,440
That's like $40.

1611
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:49,280
It was, I thought it was more than that.

1612
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:54,960
The one that I saw was close to $100, and it was monstrous.

1613
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,920
And I don't know what, it's fun, I guess,

1614
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,640
but are you going to ever use the soap if it's hard to?

1615
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,080
How do you break it up?

1616
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,160
Do you just like kind of break off?

1617
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,360
It was huge.

1618
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,520
I guess you have a big cake knife,

1619
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,160
and then you cut slices of soap off before you take a shower.

1620
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,440
You don't ruin a knife.

1621
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,600
It used to be, or was it next to it, a Lush store?

1622
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,400
It was a Lush.

1623
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,400
I feel like I know multiple women who are like,

1624
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,240
oh, they took the Lush store away.

1625
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,160
That was the thing I liked up there.

1626
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,080
An actual.

1627
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,520
I've never shopped there, but I do

1628
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,800
know people really like Lush.

1629
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,560
And you don't do like froufy bath stuff.

1630
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,400
So to you, a bunch of key lime pie soaps doesn't make any sense.

1631
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,040
I used $1.69 dial soap from the drugstore.

1632
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,880
Yeah, that was a little bit of a change for me,

1633
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,480
because I definitely bought a bottle of body wash for $2.50

1634
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,680
the other day.

1635
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,720
All right, buy like a gallon of body wash.

1636
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,760
Welcome to my life for eight months, friend.

1637
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,160
Eight months, friend.

1638
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,000
But they have, yeah.

1639
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,120
I'm looking around, and I'm like, I got to get something here.

1640
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,320
And all the soaps just seem impractical.

1641
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,040
That seems really more for decoration, just for the fun of it.

1642
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:10,040
I'm not going to be washing myself with a fake popsicle that's a soap.

1643
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,440
That seemed like the most practical,

1644
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,120
because it was at least a flat, flat-ish kind of shape.

1645
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,800
It didn't have a wooden stick in it, which is odd.

1646
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,680
Yeah, but I mean, maybe that's kind of like the scrubber.

1647
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,520
It actually makes sense if you were, say,

1648
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,480
imagine you're holding a popsicle and you're

1649
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,520
washing your back with it.

1650
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,240
It makes sense.

1651
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:31,040
Like you're Donald Duck with that big, big bath brush.

1652
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,800
So I was walking around, and here's what happens, I think, most of the day,

1653
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:39,640
is that a couple of people wander in, walk, do one quick lap.

1654
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,040
It's a pretty small store, and they right away leave.

1655
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,520
Because they're like, well, I would $25 for this.

1656
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,600
This is crazy.

1657
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,520
And there was a gentleman who was excited to talk to me, because he's like,

1658
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,140
well, do you want to see a demonstration?

1659
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,600
And I went, yes, I do.

1660
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,800
Because they have a big sink.

1661
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,080
They have a big sink in the middle, and I don't know what he's demonstrating.

1662
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,400
It's usually kids they're doing demonstrations for.

1663
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,000
Yeah, of course.

1664
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
This time it was Michael.

1665
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It was me.

1666
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,280
And you could tell he was like, oh, I've got something to do now.

1667
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:11,160
And he was like, well, what I would go, what's a cheap kind of, I'm just

1668
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:14,360
getting into this, what do I want to do?

1669
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:19,520
He goes, well, you could do a bath bomb, and you could also do what they call,

1670
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,040
hold on, let me find the name of it.

1671
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,360
You could do a little, they call it a bubble scoop.

1672
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,600
So the bubble adds, there's some moisture, and then the bath bomb has

1673
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,100
Aromatherapy.

1674
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,160
Is this the one that you buy three of them and put it in a little ice cream

1675
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:33,660
container?

1676
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,400
They can do that too for you.

1677
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:39,200
So he's like, you got one bath bomb, you get one of these little bubble scoops.

1678
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,480
And he's shown to me, and he's like, hey, put your hand in the water and feel it.

1679
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,520
And I go, oh, OK.

1680
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,400
So I'm putting my hand in soapy water, and I have to be like, oh, yeah.

1681
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,640
Oh, I feel it.

1682
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,920
And then he puts the other thing in, and then he goes, yeah, you can feel the

1683
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,520
water if you want.

1684
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,520
I go, oh, sure.

1685
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:54,920
And I put it in.

1686
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,400
Oh, yeah, I feel that.

1687
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,280
And I was like, I don't know.

1688
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,040
It's soapy water.

1689
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,440
It feels fine to me.

1690
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,800
Just a good public bath with a man you just met.

1691
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1692
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,320
So I'm on my hand.

1693
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,640
He's like, oh, you want to like me?

1694
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,240
I'm drying off because my hands are soaked.

1695
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:12,080
So I'm looking around, and I'm like, let me get one of these bath bombs.

1696
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:17,200
The bath bomb was $6, and the other one was like $5 maybe.

1697
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,760
That's what he recommended to me.

1698
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,160
I'm so curious what you got.

1699
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:20,480
Hold on.

1700
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,200
Don't say it yet.

1701
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,040
OK.

1702
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:26,760
And then he tells me, so I got the Calm Your Spirit bath bomb, because there's

1703
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,560
many different kinds.

1704
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:31,440
There's one that's Awaken Your Senses, which is supposed to clear up your

1705
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,840
sinuses and stuff.

1706
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,320
And then there's one that's like Stimulate Your Passion, which I guess

1707
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,200
that's a horny one.

1708
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,840
I didn't get that, which I'm like, that's weird.

1709
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,200
I should have gotten that.

1710
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,320
Jason should have gotten that.

1711
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,600
I should have gotten the horny one.

1712
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,600
And then so I get that one.

1713
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,360
And then as far as the Bubble Scoop, that one looks like ice cream.

1714
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,720
The other one looks like a big giant kind of hard candy.

1715
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:58,040
And then the Bubble Scoop, if you guys want to see, it looks like little tiny

1716
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:58,720
scoops of ice cream.

1717
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,480
And it really looks like sherbet.

1718
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,240
We saw those today.

1719
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,320
It's impressive that it looks like that.

1720
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:04,880
And I got that.

1721
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,840
So he's like packaging them up.

1722
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,360
And he goes, oh, yeah, don't worry.

1723
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,600
The sparkles are like, I think, biodegradable.

1724
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,800
And then I was like, oh, my god, am I going to get sparkles in my urethra?

1725
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,800
Like, that was the first.

1726
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,800
I'm so sorry to be vulgar like that.

1727
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,720
But that's my first.

1728
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,480
I got like a fear as they were like, I was like, did I buy?

1729
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,760
Oh, shit.

1730
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:28,280
What is this going to be?

1731
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,960
Would a woman using it also have concerns about getting it?

1732
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:36,280
That's what more possibility of sparkly innards.

1733
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:40,120
He brought up the sparkles and I went, oh, he's saying maybe the sparkles are

1734
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,960
OK. He brought up that concept.

1735
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,440
Not in my urethra. No, no, no.

1736
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:49,320
I was going to say that part of their marketing is like paraben free, handmade.

1737
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,000
There's a lot of other crap that's not in it.

1738
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I'm saying I wouldn't have thought anything of it until he brought up the idea

1739
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,920
that the sparkles should be OK.

1740
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,600
Hey, but for a second, thanks for shopping here.

1741
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:03,000
Hey, don't worry, those sparkles, they won't hurt your piss hole.

1742
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:03,800
You're all good.

1743
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,800
A couple of weeks, but it'll clear out.

1744
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,800
Yeah, it'll be fun for a couple of weeks.

1745
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:12,960
And it comes with a bottle of cranberry juice in case anything goes wrong.

1746
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,400
And then, yes, because they're like very big on the holo, it's OK, it's fine or whatever.

1747
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,840
So I was. But that is what he when he said it, I was like, why did you say that?

1748
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,880
Why would you say that?

1749
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:26,600
If you took your pants off and were just in your underwear, would we we wouldn't see

1750
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,440
just a glow emanating from your crutch?

1751
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,840
I honestly, I've been shiniest.

1752
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,320
I've been running around all day, so I haven't even looked.

1753
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,760
So who knows?

1754
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,280
I looked like Spar.

1755
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,920
At some point, Hawaiian Tropic started putting sparkles in like

1756
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,720
their main bottle of suntan lotion. Really?

1757
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,520
And I was just like, what the fuck is that?

1758
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,640
Like I bought a full bottle and I'm like, well, I'm just going to be sparkly

1759
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,400
for the summer. That's disgusting.

1760
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,240
I had to switch to the sport brand because there weren't sparkles in it.

1761
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,600
You don't you you do you do makeup that has like a that's a little sparkly.

1762
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,440
Yeah, like not you wouldn't want like it in your washing sparkles.

1763
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,960
Sparkly and something with glitter in it.

1764
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,680
Sure. Yeah. Go away.

1765
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,880
Right. Yeah. Those are items.

1766
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,560
Yeah. Yeah.

1767
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:15,720
So this was hopefully not glitter in the periwinkle dream bubble scoop Sunday

1768
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,000
that I got. So what did you use?

1769
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,600
So I use both.

1770
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,360
So I use a bath bomb, which is a calling bath bomb in the periwinkle

1771
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,640
dream bubble scoop Sunday.

1772
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,800
So what you do is you put the scoop, the dream bubble in first as the bath is going.

1773
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,440
And then you have to put in the bath bomb after when the tub has been full.

1774
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:34,280
Also, I had to really scrub the hell out of the bathtub last night

1775
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,720
because I was like, I got to get this clean if I'm going to sit in a pool.

1776
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,360
I take a bath once every five years, maybe. Yeah. Yeah.

1777
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,600
And I'll be I'm six, three years.

1778
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,880
I'm six, three. I would say years old. Jesus.

1779
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,960
Losing my mind. Six, three.

1780
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,080
And I do not fit in that tub very well upstairs.

1781
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,640
It is a small tub.

1782
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,040
But I was like, I am a theme park journalist and I have to do this.

1783
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,440
So I filled it up.

1784
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,760
I'm a little concerned you combined items, though.

1785
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,960
Well, he told me to. He said that was the he said that was the best way to do it.

1786
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:04,760
That's why I got it.

1787
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,520
I asked him what the what the best way to do.

1788
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,800
That's just a hard sell.

1789
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,720
Well, it was a hard sell.

1790
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,360
But he was explaining to me that this part was a aromatherapy.

1791
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,440
This part was more for moisturizing your skin.

1792
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,640
You know, there's only two people in this group of four who fight like a married couple.

1793
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,800
And it's not the people who are married.

1794
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,880
Fair enough. Fair enough.

1795
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:24,920
That's a good point.

1796
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,640
Well, let's see what he did in a second.

1797
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,200
We don't even know what he did.

1798
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,280
Maybe he's oh, you're going to have the same reaction.

1799
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,920
No matter what I did.

1800
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,480
Maybe you ate the periwinkle dream bubble scoop Sunday.

1801
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,320
So I did it.

1802
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,720
And for the first, I hadn't taken a bath.

1803
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,080
So really, this is mostly going to be

1804
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:49,280
commenting on what the bath is like for a six, three man in a tiny bathtub.

1805
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,480
Because it for once we will not have supplemental photos on Twitter.

1806
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,720
I felt like Rafael in the first Ninja Turtles movie where he's like in the tub.

1807
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,040
It's too big. He's too big for it.

1808
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,960
Or like in The Matrix, when they get like they're just like slid out

1809
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,840
and like it's uncomfortable and they're just like a prone body.

1810
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,040
So like I don't feel good today from

1811
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,120
lying in this bathtub for an hour.

1812
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,280
This is a bath tree.

1813
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,440
But it's not the bath treats fall because I found the bath treat very nice.

1814
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,520
I found the aroma very pleasant.

1815
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,000
I don't know that I'm going to do this.

1816
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,480
Maybe once we move out of here and get a better tub,

1817
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,720
I could see doing this once in a while.

1818
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,680
I find it very pleasant.

1819
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:30,480
The only problem, again, bath problem, not bath treat problem,

1820
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:35,400
is that I cannot get to bed after a bath because my body temperature is so fucking weird.

1821
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,720
It took takes me an hour to readjust to the outside world again.

1822
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,440
I don't know why that is,

1823
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,640
because it would be nice if I could go right to bed.

1824
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,880
Did not happen. Jason is looking at me like he went right to bed after.

1825
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,640
All right. I've said all I have to say, Jason, let's see what you did.

1826
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,760
All right, Martha. Fine.

1827
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:58,000
Jason, I should do Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf on stage.

1828
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,760
That might be what this is like.

1829
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,680
All right. Well, I land work.

1830
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,600
And what's her name?

1831
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,640
So I was concerned about not having time for a bath.

1832
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,880
I was also concerned because I feel like I didn't see the cheaper bath item.

1833
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,080
So I thought, well, if I'm going to spend eleven dollars,

1834
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,840
I want to get my money's worth.

1835
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,240
And I was also trying to find a treat that appeals to me.

1836
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,520
You get the milkshake.

1837
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,040
I did not get the milk. Damn it. OK.

1838
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,720
How do I work? You pour a milk.

1839
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,840
It's a milkshake.

1840
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:30,080
It's just kind of like it's it looks like a milkshake, but inside is powder.

1841
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,640
Yeah. So it's kind of the same.

1842
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,680
He said it's actually very similar to what I did.

1843
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,280
A literal nightmare.

1844
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,560
I had a nightmare where I went for a milkshake, but it was sand.

1845
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:41,960
Horrible.

1846
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,520
So I was going back and forth between the donuts and the popsicles.

1847
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,040
Now, I'm very picky with sense, too.

1848
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,840
I don't like a lot of sense.

1849
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,840
I have a sensitive nose.

1850
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,680
So I was trying to find one.

1851
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,240
I like I didn't want to smell particularly sweet,

1852
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,440
but I am OK with coconut stuff.

1853
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,160
So I got this coconut pineapple doughnut soap.

1854
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,440
Whoa. What it is.

1855
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,200
It's like a doughnut.

1856
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,880
And it's just a bar of soap that looks like a doughnut.

1857
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,440
Now, it has sprinkles on top.

1858
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:21,360
The sprinkles are also soap, but they just kind of fall off

1859
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,520
as you are, let's say, unwrapping it from the package or using it in the shower.

1860
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,840
Also, like it's got like a little

1861
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:34,160
little icing and like a little mini doughnut.

1862
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:37,320
So it's like, well, you can't scrub with that side.

1863
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,360
But then the other side is just like a flat.

1864
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,840
Oh, my God.

1865
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:46,000
And it also just like I'm not either a huge fan of bar soap to begin with.

1866
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,240
I find it dries out my skin too much.

1867
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,480
It is a little uncomfortable.

1868
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,400
So it's fine. It smells.

1869
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,160
You were cleaning yourself with a doughnut last night.

1870
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,840
No, this morning, this morning, this morning, 9am.

1871
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,560
You took a shower with a doughnut.

1872
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,760
And also, I mean, this is the greatest thing that's happened on this podcast.

1873
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,000
It's going to take me months to use this.

1874
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,240
I feel like you feel clean.

1875
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,840
I feel clean. I feel like fine.

1876
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,320
But it also like you smell like coconut too.

1877
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,880
Not really. It's kind of that generic kind of bar soapy kind of smell.

1878
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,480
Like I kind of let down.

1879
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,840
Yeah, I don't.

1880
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,280
I don't think it's a let down for the next month.

1881
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,160
Jason will be using a doughnut to clean himself.

1882
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,400
That's terrific. That's the greatest thing I've ever heard.

1883
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,680
I mean, I like to switch it up.

1884
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,320
I, you know, I got a lot of hotel soaps to go to.

1885
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,120
Oh, yeah.

1886
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,920
Should we explain that that was tweeted about?

1887
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,480
But somebody that somebody brought you.

1888
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:42,520
Oh, yes. A couple of very nice listeners came to Mike and I show at UCB.

1889
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,200
Yes. And they came up to me and said, we just want to say hi.

1890
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,920
And also, we brought you something in tribute.

1891
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:55,240
And it was a lovely Pixar pure bag of each two Disney hotel soaps.

1892
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,600
And that is the nicest.

1893
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,040
And they were so nice.

1894
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,880
And I'd like to say to the fans out there, keep it coming.

1895
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:05,000
Jason would like as much of this as you can get any hotel.

1896
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,120
Any hotel you get.

1897
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,760
I don't want a single thing.

1898
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,080
If you saw me somewhere, if you knew you were going to see me for some reason,

1899
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,680
give me a soap doughnut to give to Jason.

1900
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,840
I want all gel fan treats to be that.

1901
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:25,040
Let's see if we can keep up when this one runs out, if you can replace it

1902
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,520
with a complimentary new doughnut.

1903
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,920
Yeah. Anyway, the soap doughnut, I guess it's fine.

1904
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,480
It didn't seem that much nicer than I thought.

1905
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,400
It would be a little more moisturizing.

1906
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,520
But again, like, did you talk to an employee at all?

1907
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,800
Or every employee I talked to just kept saying

1908
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,040
what I would look at something that could go like you can smell it, too.

1909
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,120
It's just like, don't just look at it, smell it.

1910
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,200
That's the other thing.

1911
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,440
Like, it didn't have a ton of sense.

1912
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,680
I feel like that one popsicle smell, though it was kind of vanilla.

1913
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,800
But it was like, oh, this feels like it might really be overpowering. Right.

1914
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,440
Fruity sense typically try to learn.

1915
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,360
They tend to meld together to like, yeah, smell one.

1916
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,360
It sort of kills your senses.

1917
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,040
And they all just smell like a mishmash of fruit. Yeah. Right.

1918
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,960
If you like if you smelled 20 things in a row, you'd only smell the first two.

1919
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,000
Yeah. Or it would just all start to you forget.

1920
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,040
Sure. Yeah.

1921
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,880
I remember that coffee one that we smelled. That was terrible.

1922
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,400
Yeah, that was smell like coffee.

1923
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,200
It was like a kind of a one for boys with tobacco.

1924
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,120
Really? Yeah.

1925
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,680
That smelled horrible.

1926
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,600
That was OK. Now, that's what I call a treat.

1927
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,160
Delicious tobacco.

1928
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,200
Yeah, I don't.

1929
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,600
That's why I went for the ones that like seemed like they were just slightly

1930
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:47,080
dressed up, traditional bath things, something that would seem practical.

1931
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,040
Yeah, because there's a lot of nonsense in there.

1932
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:56,440
I also like when I take a bath once in a blue moon, I'd like to have a beer with it.

1933
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,800
Maybe listen to a podcast.

1934
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,040
I had a grape diet soda while I was in the bath.

1935
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,160
Oh, a grape diet soda. Yeah.

1936
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:06,840
And maybe my girlfriend took a photo of me with it and we'll post it.

1937
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,560
No, it's not anything indecent.

1938
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,360
Chillin' with some diet grape.

1939
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,200
Here's Mike's glitter filled urethra.

1940
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,640
Here's the X-ray x-rays from Providence St. Joe's.

1941
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,640
Mike's glitter ridded.

1942
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,280
Well, as you know, post that x-ray on Twitter.

1943
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:33,400
In the rare event that grape soda centric urine is peed from a glittery urethra

1944
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,440
triggers an instant tumor

1945
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,840
that blocks the pee hole forever.

1946
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:46,080
Before we wrap up, we also had

1947
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,440
Walter's Gate in this sector.

1948
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:54,480
Yeah, I annexed Walter's Gate because that is that that was where I entered

1949
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:58,000
for the day to do my tour guide job.

1950
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:01,600
It's right between Camacho's and the

1951
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,560
Abercrombie Fitch, which is once the Sam Goody.

1952
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,800
And I don't.

1953
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,160
Hey, you know what?

1954
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,880
Let me be real corny here.

1955
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,400
All I want to say is I started that summer being a tour guide

1956
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,160
without an awesome girlfriend.

1957
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,320
And by the end of the summer, I was walking through Walter's Gate

1958
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,240
with a lot of pep in my step.

1959
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:25,240
Oh, that's nice. Thanks, Aaron.

1960
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:31,280
Can I ask you, was it always like really intense in terms of metal detectors?

1961
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,080
No, got a lot crazier.

1962
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,000
Got a lot crazier, right?

1963
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,440
Because I think I used to use that gate when I was an intern on the back lot.

1964
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,040
And they would send me up for like lunch orders at City Walk sometimes.

1965
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,760
Like you take a golf cart up there.

1966
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,000
Yeah. And you could just walk right into City Walk

1967
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,360
and go up to the old.

1968
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,640
What was the taco? What's that fish? Rubio's.

1969
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,880
They're using rubio's.

1970
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,400
You get a bunch of orders and take the golf cart back down

1971
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,000
some very steep hills to use a golf cart on. Yeah.

1972
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,200
That's so scary.

1973
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:02,800
It's really scary.

1974
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:07,520
Now it looks like a full security checkpoint, like an airport. Mm hmm.

1975
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,400
Yeah, yeah. It got really intense.

1976
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,800
And I'm not sure if I think there was a real Walter.

1977
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,560
I think Walter was the guy who checked in and I'm not sure if it still is.

1978
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,200
I hope if he's still around, he's doing well.

1979
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,200
But yeah, you know that.

1980
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:26,360
Yeah, that first summer, I felt a lot of pride walking through there.

1981
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,560
No, and I had to all I had to do.

1982
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:32,880
My only responsibility that day was to maybe come up with a new riff

1983
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,000
on the King Kong part.

1984
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:41,840
I I also remember I remember that I took a there was a thing called the ESATS,

1985
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,440
which was an employee satisfaction evaluation kind of thing.

1986
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,840
And I didn't I didn't take it that seriously.

1987
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,320
And there were a lot of people I knew who had a lot of grievances.

1988
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,360
And I'm going to I'm going to give them a piece of my mind on this survey.

1989
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:58,600
And but what I did was like I just like gave fives to everything

1990
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,040
until the comments section.

1991
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:04,240
And then I said, like, you know, the job is going fine.

1992
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:08,680
But I there is this thing where, you know, we went into a soundstage.

1993
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,240
There was an open set and then an earthquake happened during the

1994
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:18,040
and I read it and the entire set flooded.

1995
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,520
And and we received no help, even though there was a power outage.

1996
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:25,960
I didn't feel like anyone cared, like no supervisors came.

1997
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:30,000
And then we went into another soundstage and there was a giant ape in there

1998
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,760
who took the tram with his hands and shook it around.

1999
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,560
And I'm just, you know, it makes me feel I love the job.

2000
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,200
But if I don't feel safe, maybe I have to go.

2001
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,200
And I wrote all that out.

2002
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,720
And then I told I told a fellow tour guide that and they were like,

2003
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:48,280
well, that's a little disrespectful, don't you think?

2004
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:52,720
But wow, this was not a job to take seriously.

2005
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,920
I mean, you were very good at it.

2006
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,440
But hey, thank you.

2007
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:57,840
We know what it is.

2008
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:58,840
Yeah.

2009
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,800
They some some people did.

2010
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,680
And there was there's a lot you had to like memorize to the to the letter.

2011
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,320
Do you remember the whole thing?

2012
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,720
I it's possible that if I had like the keypad in front of me

2013
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:13,800
and the correct clips, I could from the beginning one time,

2014
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,480
Aaron and I, we were driving, we were stuck in like horrible

2015
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,560
unexpected traffic on Denim Arango.

2016
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,960
And you said, you want to just do the tour?

2017
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,880
And I did like a lot of it.

2018
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,080
And it passed the time.

2019
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,240
That might be a well, Patreon exclusive.

2020
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,640
Scott reads the tour.

2021
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:29,760
Does the tour.

2022
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,000
Scott ASMR.

2023
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,880
Oh, I guess.

2024
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,960
Twist my arm. Maybe.

2025
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,760
All right. Fine. Regular episode.

2026
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,720
But 2006 era tour.

2027
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:41,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2028
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,440
So we're we're hyping Evan Almighty.

2029
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,960
We're pushing that.

2030
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,840
We're talking Ghost Whisperers starring Jennifer Love Hewitt

2031
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,600
and two lesser known actors I had to mention every day due to their contracts.

2032
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,120
When would you have started?

2033
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,040
2006 summer. Yeah.

2034
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,400
2006. I would.

2035
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,320
That was when I would have been out here like interning start

2036
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,640
a fall and of summer like 2006.

2037
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,120
Did you guys pass through Walters Gate together?

2038
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,680
We probably passed through.

2039
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:07,640
We're on the back lot.

2040
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,720
I may have taken one of your tours.

2041
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:14,120
Whoa. Although I feel like you I do remember one or two tour guides

2042
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:15,360
where I was like, yeah, they were really good.

2043
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,560
And then there would be somewhere I'd be like, how is that guy still doing?

2044
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,400
Like people just did not care.

2045
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,160
Yeah, yeah.

2046
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:26,480
The yeah, it's it's it's possible.

2047
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,600
It's possible that, yeah, like Walters Gate, like that sign,

2048
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,040
all the most beautiful people passed through it.

2049
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,320
And it's possible we were two beautiful ships.

2050
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,520
That's right. In the night through Walters Gate.

2051
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,280
You're going to make me cry.

2052
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,880
I'll make you cry at that one.

2053
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,480
The me and Jason one and not the one about you.

2054
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,720
Nice thing.

2055
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:50,120
Both in our khakis sleepily asking, hey, I'm going to go get a burger today.

2056
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:53,080
Does anyone want me to pick up anything?

2057
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,720
That is a thing by Walter.

2058
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:59,080
I've realized being up there at the lunch hour on weekdays is just

2059
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:02,240
how many people walking around CityWalk are people in business casual

2060
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,640
from the offices worth a lot grabbing a quick bite to eat

2061
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,600
with their generous employee discounts.

2062
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,800
It's 10 percent enough for you.

2063
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:12,800
Is that it?

2064
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,360
I think that it wasn't much.

2065
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,080
Not for me. I got I got 10 percent off of Nectar.

2066
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,120
What? Why?

2067
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,600
Because you are you a pass holder?

2068
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,160
I said, actually, I had my past just ran out like a month ago.

2069
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,080
And he was like, I can give it to you.

2070
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,240
This was how we even got anything for a blossom.

2071
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,640
Yeah, there's there's discounts to be had.

2072
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:30,600
Are there everywhere?

2073
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,600
Well, a lot of places.

2074
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,280
I've been doing this entire CityWalk thing.

2075
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,040
Yeah. Full price every time.

2076
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,720
Passholders. Why? Mine ran out.

2077
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,800
And we've been up there like 17 goddamn times.

2078
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,440
Yeah. We've we'll be up 17 more.

2079
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,480
We could have saved like $200.

2080
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,800
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

2081
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:50,840
Should have asked at the water coffins.

2082
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,040
Oh, yeah, we forgot about that.

2083
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,120
We'd have had a down payment for a house by now.

2084
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:54,800
A Lude owning.

2085
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,000
No. But what's that when you have memories?

2086
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,280
I bet drinks aren't you don't get discounted, though.

2087
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,520
So we shouldn't get a pass

2088
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,040
before my pass renewed before we go to Holland, the moon and spend $300 on

2089
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,000
the jello shots and jello shots.

2090
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,120
Dory and Dory, please.

2091
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,480
Were it only in a bottle of potion, then it would.

2092
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,840
And that is that is that's going to haunt me that that's not there anymore.

2093
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:21,000
Oh, boy.

2094
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,600
Aaron, thank you for sharing your memories of Wizards past.

2095
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:29,200
And I can officially say, Aaron Gardner, you survived podcast, the ride.

2096
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,520
Thank you so much.

2097
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,360
Yeah, thank you.

2098
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,000
Thanks so much for doing it.

2099
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,160
Is there is there anything you would like to plug?

2100
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,760
I have a website, I guess.

2101
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,160
Aaron Gardner dot com.

2102
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:43,560
That's correct. Yes.

2103
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:47,360
I don't do a whole I'm on Twitter, but I only follow podcast,

2104
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,760
the ride and Pibo Bryson.

2105
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,800
If you follow me, I follow you back.

2106
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:52,680
I don't even follow.

2107
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,360
Yeah, I don't even follow Scott.

2108
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,640
You don't follow us individually.

2109
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:56,520
You only follow podcast.

2110
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,640
I only follow podcast.

2111
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,640
Thanks for boosting the like signal.

2112
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,280
It's it's much appreciated.

2113
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,760
But wait, before we go, the stone,

2114
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,120
the stone is appearing.

2115
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,400
The stone's emerging.

2116
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,840
Oh, wow. There it is.

2117
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,040
It's beautiful.

2118
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,760
It looks it looks like a nectar bath treat.

2119
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,600
OK, I guess that was inevitable.

2120
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,920
It's about the size of a stone.

2121
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:22,160
It's a stone that it looks like a doughnut that is flavored for a cupcake.

2122
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,280
But it still has the marbling of a stone.

2123
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,600
It still is like.

2124
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,560
Jason, are you washing yourself with it right now?

2125
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,520
Yeah. And it's.

2126
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,520
I'm crazy.

2127
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:36,200
Yeah, the scent is dissipating as you're rubbing it on your skin.

2128
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,120
It smells like it doesn't smell.

2129
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,960
It smells like dip.

2130
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,200
It doesn't smell like tobacco.

2131
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,440
It smells like Chaw.

2132
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,720
It's a weird one.

2133
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:45,960
It's a weird stone.

2134
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,760
I guess that's they're not all winners.

2135
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,320
That's what the sector keepers skin is made of, I guess.

2136
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:54,960
That's what post afterworld skin composition is.

2137
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,040
Yeah, that's fair.

2138
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,840
Well, thanks for giving it to us anyway.

2139
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:01,680

2142
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,120
Well, I let the Etsy lapse. Oh, no.

2143
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:13,120
Yeah, let's not do that. Yeah, they hiked up the seller fees.

2144
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,760
Oh, all right. Well, then don't go there.

2145
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,640
All right. Well, a good decision made then.

2146
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,280
Screw you, Etsy.
