1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Warning, the following podcast is about one of the most popular Disney characters, Genie,

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,540
the lovable blue guy from Aladdin.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,540
You might be wondering, hey, where does Genie hang out these days?

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,820
In Aladdin and Jasmine's palace in Agrabah?

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,820
In his magic lamp?

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,580
Well, the answer is neither.

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,980
Genie is now confined to your phone, stuck in your various parks apps in order to analyze

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,860
queue lengths and monitor crowd levels in order to carefully and effectively control the flow

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,660
of traffic around the Disney parks.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,800
Also, if you slip him some money, he'll let you skip the lines.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,480
Justin McElroy joins us to chat about a new parks planning tool and the replacement for

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,560
FastPass, Genie and Genie Plus, on today's thrilling Podcast the Ride.

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:06,760
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a podcast about theme parks that's just like a Genie, assuming

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,320
that all three of your wishes are to hear 90 minutes about theme park efficiency and

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,720
pricing information.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,240
I'm Scott Gairdner and I'm joined by Mike Carlson.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
Hello.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
Yes, I'm here.

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,360
I want to break it down.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,520
I want to make even, like say a Disney executive who has listened to presentations, I want

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,140
to bore even that type of person with the amount of minutiae that we're going to comb

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,260
through today on Podcast the Ride.

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,740
Someone whose job is to care about this specific thing.

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,660
I know one of those people from the video that I want me to be talking about.

27
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,740
Yeah, I'm a big fan at the door.

28
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,740
Yeah.

29
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,740
All right.

30
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,620
Well, yeah, we'll get boring, but we can't do it without the help of Jason Sherrod and

31
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,620
I.

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,620
Of course not.

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,620
This is Mr. Boring himself.

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,620
Here he is.

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,320
Listeners, you asked for more logistical nonsense.

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
You asked.

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,800
We listened.

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,120
My cohost bucked at the idea and then true.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:08,560
Yes, like a star in the night appeared, a star guiding the ship and we knew we had to.

40
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,760
It was exactly right.

41
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,160
Look, we have just there's been a lot of these kinds of information drops recently.

42
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,340
Everything is getting reset.

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,360
There is no longer an annual pass program post pandemic.

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,920
So they reset that and there is a thing called the Magic Key program over on our Patreon,

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,000
the second gate.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,080
We broke that down for God knows how long.

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,840
It felt like four days to me.

48
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,000
But we did that.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,080
So when Jason brought up, well, now we got to do the same thing for Disney Genie.

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,280
I'm like, oh, Jesus Christ.

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,460
But you are correct.

52
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,560
We are very incentivized to do it because the best thing that came from Twitter losing

53
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,420
its collective mind about this Disney Genie thing, which is essentially the replacement

54
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,780
for Fast Pass and Max Pass.

55
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,020
It's about making your day efficient and skipping the line and all that.

56
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,020
We won't explain it.

57
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,020
Yeah.

58
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,980
In theory, that's the idea.

59
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,980
Sure.

60
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,180
But yes, everybody's freaking out about this program and it caused somebody to reach out

61
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,540
to us on Twitter who we've wanted to have on for a long time.

62
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,100
And I'm so happy he's here.

63
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,940
He's a prolific podcaster from my brother, my brother and me, Sawbones and Adventure

64
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,940
Zone.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And Maccleroy.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hi.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hi.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What a pleasure it is.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Welcome.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Thank you.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hello.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know why I said welcome.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You welcomed us to our own podcast.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What a joy.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What a treat.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Very nice.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah, it's nice.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's like freshens the things up.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,960
Yeah, I've been listening for a while and I wanted to connect faces with voices.

83
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,000
And this is the only way that I know how to do it.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,880
It's just a guest on and then it all clicks into place.

85
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,680
Beyond now, you know, I'm Scott.

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Hello.

87
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
I'm in a what?

88
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,700
Mr. Toad shirt, right?

89
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,260
And I'm wearing Mr. Toad shirt.

90
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,260
That's correct.

91
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,260
And Jason's in the 82.

92
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,260
The Epcot.

93
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,180
I still have no idea what Terry Gross looks like because she won't have me on.

94
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,140
So I can't spot her in a crowd.

95
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
Someday.

96
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,180
It's more of a don't if you Google image, then that will like ruin the entire thing.

97
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,180
Yeah.

98
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,740
That's what keeps us dispensed for when I'm actually on Fresh Air.

99
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Of course.

100
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,740
Yeah.

101
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,540
We're we're so happy you reached out and you were you were fired up about this situation,

102
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,800
this new Disney genie program that has been launched.

103
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,120
And I'm so glad that you are that somebody is not completely exhausted by Disney information,

104
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,440
dumps and names as at least I am.

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720
So this works out perfectly.

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,200
You will carry me at least through this.

107
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,400
So let's let's dive in.

108
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,400
What like is there anything else we need to set up about this in general?

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
Did I did I sort of explain it?

110
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Disney for a long time.

111
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Yeah.

112
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Fast pass.

113
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,740
All right.

114
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
There's three things.

115
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,380
They announced three things at once.

116
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,580
And I'm going to try to log line each one of them.

117
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,180
There's Disney Genie.

118
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,380
This is some sort of automated.

119
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,380
It's not an app.

120
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,200
It's built in other apps that will art of an app.

121
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,380
It's part of an app.

122
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,980
It's part of the apps are different depending on Disneyland or Disney World.

123
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,620
It's my Disney experience app.

124
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,320
Yes, Disney World and it's the Disneyland app.

125
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,160
If it's Disneyland, is that right?

126
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,320
Yes, that's correct.

127
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,880
So this was announced a while ago, like the D23 in 2019.

128
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
They said this is coming.

129
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
I think everyone kind of went like, yeah, what is what is this going to be?

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,580
And it seems like, you know, in theory is one of those things like that old Apple adage

131
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,400
of like it just works where it's like I want to eat something.

132
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,880
It'll tell me what's not crowded.

133
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,440
I want to go on a ride.

134
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,700
It'll tell me wait times.

135
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,620
There's now they're saying it'll tell you forecast at wait times, like in the way that

136
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,060
ways will tell you if you leave at five o'clock, you're going to get there at this time.

137
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,700
But if you leave at eight o'clock, you'll get there at this time.

138
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,060
Then there's Disney Genie Plus, which is a an add on.

139
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,040
Fifteen dollars in Florida, twenty dollars in Anaheim, which is essentially functions

140
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,820
like Max Pass, which we used to have at Disneyland.

141
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,740
And this is this is what FastPass is now.

142
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,340
Free FastPass is dead.

143
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,440
You pay you pay more.

144
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,520
FastPass is a thing where you would get little slips of paper and it would tell you what

145
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,080
time window to come back and you could skip the line.

146
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,960
Max Pass is a thing where you paid for that privilege to do it way, way out of time.

147
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,800
In Florida, you would book three online.

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,720
You would book three different FastPass is 60 days ahead.

149
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,320
If you were I think it was 60 days, 60 days ahead, if you were staying on the property

150
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,020
and you could book three after you use those three, you could book another one.

151
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,740
Yes, that's gone. That's that's all gone.

152
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,420
That's all gone.

153
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,860
So now this is where it gets confusing.

154
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,300
There is a third offering.

155
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,540
Those first two they refer to as services.

156
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,940
And then this third one, it's service, service, punishment, service, service.

157
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,260
And then Lightning Lane, they refer to as Lightning Lane entrances.

158
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,400
So Lightning Lanes are both.

159
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,720
It's it's kind of two things.

160
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,360
It's the lines that used to be the FastPass line.

161
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,720
So you you get in the Lightning Lane.

162
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,840
You and you.

163
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,020
But then there's also a la carte purchasable access to the Lightning Lane

164
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,120
for like the most popular rides within a park.

165
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,640
So the so the Disney Genie Plus does not cover all of the premium ride experiences,

166
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,780
like I assume Guardians of Galaxy, probably the IncrediCoaster,

167
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,940
anything that you think is like a mega ticket living with the land, all the major

168
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,260
living with the land, living with the land dollars to cut the line on it.

169
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,260
But that that seems to be maybe like a universal type, like shifting money

170
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,060
price, depending on day and traffic.

171
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,300
But it also seems like the algorithm is going to shift.

172
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,660
Like this has been this is what's currently the most popular one.

173
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,960
So right. Exactly.

174
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,680
Could potentially drop.

175
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,200
Like it seems like the one I I kept seeing, which I was surprised by

176
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,000
with seven dwarfs mine train in Magic Kingdom is apparently insanely popular.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,760
So like everyone's like, well, that one's going to Lightning Lane.

178
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,340
So but you you buy you buy Lightning Lane,

179
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,940
but then you also use Disney Genie Plus to access the Lightning Lane. So.

180
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,520
Yeah, so I've been feeling more like Scott recently reading.

181
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,620
This I've got to I've got to come out. OK.

182
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,720
Yeah, because I.

183
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,320
I already in the insanity.

184
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,260
I was visiting family and I, you know, my family is planning a trip down the line

185
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,700
and I'm explaining all this to my dad and he just looked like like I just made him

186
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,100
eat a lemon and he's just like, oh, this is similar to how Justin looks.

187
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,380
And I was so so what is what is your take in?

188
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,540
Let's let's fire up some opinions.

189
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,980
Yeah. Well, actually, could I stop?

190
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,460
I just want to ask Justin, what is your feeling about Max

191
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,840
like about the FastPass program before before even we get your reaction

192
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,800
to the new news, because I just want to know what you were, how hard of it

193
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,080
may be of a checker, how much of a planner you were.

194
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,280
It should. OK, so so things that sort of differentiate me from from,

195
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,420
I think your situation is one, I am planning for one.

196
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,560
I live in West Virginia, so I'm planning for a, you know,

197
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,160
not not regular visit.

198
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,700
It is a it is an event, right?

199
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm also traveling with

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,080
at least three other people in my immediate family.

201
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,500
I have ballooned up to as many as 15.

202
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,340
Wow. Where I'm like scheduling that. Right.

203
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,680
So I actually liked I like FastPass in the sense that it gave me

204
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,340
a little bit of structure to hang my hat on.

205
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,140
I'm going for efficiency in a visit and I want, you know, maximum impact.

206
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,660
So I liked that it gave me something to hang my hat on.

207
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,880
Like, at least I know I've got this, this and this at these times,

208
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,080
and I can kind of plan around that a little bit.

209
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,680
So I so I appreciated it from from that in that sense.

210
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,380
OK, got it. All right.

211
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,600
So now reactions now let's fire up our take machine.

212
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,880
The new thing.

213
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,600
I've oh, wow.

214
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,040
It it's. God, I'm really

215
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,040
a lot of people, I read a lot of the Disney social media, which have you

216
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,940
if you even if you think you wouldn't

217
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,820
just treat yourself every once in a while and hop in, see how things are going.

218
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,420
Yeah, it is. Yeah.

219
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,060
Just be careful.

220
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,860
He gazed in the abyss, the abyss gaze back sometimes, you know, get pretty good.

221
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,580
This was like this was it right.

222
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,580
This is finally the the the the final straw.

223
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,080
I would. Chaypeck has gone too far.

224
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,080
I'm done with Disney.

225
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,620
You know, I'm out.

226
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,000
But it's like you're not because

227
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,440
the fans of Disney and I'm not like excluding myself from this.

228
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,180
I'm right there with you.

229
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,900
But you got to be honest about what you are.

230
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,380
People have proven time and time again, they will fall all over themselves

231
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,060
to pay any price to heighten the experience.

232
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,060
And this is just like this is the big one, right?

233
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,660
This is the lever that was always kind of like behind Mickey

234
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,320
that he could like reach up and like pay to skip the lines,

235
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,620
pay to skip the lines. I'm going to do it.

236
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,220
It's like, oh, come on, don't.

237
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,860
And then, of course, he does it.

238
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,360
The problem is, my my hesitations about it are this.

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,360
So I have been one time

240
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,760
when when there was like this the sweet spot where numbers seem really low.

241
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,760
There was a lot of masking and seems seemed OK.

242
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
Right. So I went the lot.

243
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,720
It was but it was rough, like the especially with the way cues

244
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,820
were working at the time where it was like, you know, standing out

245
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,120
in the sun for a lot of it.

246
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,420
We went for like an hour and a half to get into the jungle cruise.

247
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,620
Like and almost all of it was like standing just in direct sunlight.

248
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,420
Well, yeah, if we if we haven't said this officially, like if if

249
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,620
and just to mark this point in time, the pandemic has reset everything

250
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,820
where there hasn't been any of these programs.

251
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,020
So these ways to skip the lines have not existed.

252
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,460
And we are just back to how it would have been several decades ago

253
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,120
where you're just standing in a line regular and there's no way to jump

254
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,800
besides being like a VIP.

255
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,780
And the the idea behind FastPass, which I should point out in Disney World,

256
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,840
it was democratized like anybody could get a FastPass.

257
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,880
You could get them earlier if you were staying on property.

258
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,640
But like they were open to anybody.

259
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,980
And the idea, the cynical it was it was good for everyone, right?

260
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,540
Because cynically, Disney wanted you not in line.

261
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,480
They wanted you buying drinks, buying T-shirts, you know, spending

262
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,640
money on other stuff, right?

263
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,800
They don't want you to wait in line.

264
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,380
And you don't want to wait in line because it's boring.

265
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,640
So it's good. So this is good.

266
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,800
It's good for everyone.

267
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,140
I will be really interested to see.

268
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,500
And I think the thing that is is going to be.

269
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,100
I feel like the adoption rate of this of the of the Genie Plus

270
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,940
is going to be so astronomical.

271
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,200
I mean, you think about how much you're already spending to do this.

272
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,200
The idea that you wouldn't kick in another 15 bucks a ticket to me

273
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,780
is like unfathomable, right?

274
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,200
Like, of course, $15 is so low that I wonder if they're going to get

275
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,900
like overwhelmed by demand for it.

276
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,200
They're going to limit the number of Genie Plus sales in a given day,

277
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,440
or if it's just going to be like, you know, everyone, everyone go for it.

278
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,800
I feel like no matter what it is, it'll still be better than

279
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,400
what it is right now, right, which is just people waiting in a line,

280
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,880
which is which is tough.

281
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,240
Like it's it's and it's also hard to plan that way

282
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,800
because the lines just are much less predictable than they were pre pandemic.

283
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,600
Yeah, it's like I've seen a lot of, as you said, like Disney Twitter,

284
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,500
there's a lot of discourse because I've seen a lot of there's compete people

285
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,080
arguing with each other because a lot of people are saying,

286
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,940
oh, well, you know what, if you got rid of FastPass, actually,

287
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,480
that's going to make all the lines much better because what FastPass did,

288
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,080
and that is this is true.

289
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,280
FastPass put a lot more people into the park, but there was still

290
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,800
basically like phantom people in the lines.

291
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,100
So, you know, I forget exactly the numbers, but for every three people

292
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,500
in the standby line, eight people from FastPass would go in.

293
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,580
So that was increasing the wait time in general for all the rides

294
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,660
all over the park.

295
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,360
So now people are going, you know what, this is actually better

296
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,360
because all the lines are going to be short, which I'm skeptical.

297
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,620
Because as you're saying, I feel like a lot of people would pay this 15 bucks

298
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,060
if you're going to be able to like not have to wait in most lines.

299
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,780
I would get to be seen how many things they consider like top level e-tickets,

300
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,160
I guess. But like say it's only like three things per park.

301
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,320
If you're going to like breeze through lines much easier,

302
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,420
it would make a lot of sense to do it, especially if it's your vacation in Florida.

303
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,760
My big, my big concern about it.

304
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,920
And this is like, I don't know that there's a solve for this.

305
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,360
Like in the in universal, there is a in Florida, there is a you pay a large,

306
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,720
much larger fee than 15 bucks.

307
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,920
I think it's like 70 something like that.

308
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,260
I just had an incident where I paid like two hundred dollars.

309
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,720
It was so I did it the day of.

310
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Accelerated. Wow. Yes. Yeah.

311
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,200
They do surge pricing on it.

312
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,200
But it's just like you you can just get there's just like a special

313
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,840
path for you and you go on it.

314
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,840
To me, I wish there was an option like that,

315
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,380
because my main hesitation about this is, especially with the genie thing

316
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,180
where it's like the cloud is planning my itinerary, which I feel like

317
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,540
zero percent adopt.

318
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,200
I feel like I feel like, yes, you either don't know enough about Disney

319
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,200
to where you would ever know even where on the app to find this guy.

320
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,300
Or you know enough where you're like, I'm not fucking doing that.

321
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,940
Absolutely not. I know what I'm doing.

322
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,880
I don't need the genie to hold my hand.

323
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,340
I'm I'm I'm a grown adult.

324
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,500
I feel like you're going to have zero percent people using this.

325
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,180
But I don't like the idea that where it's like,

326
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,000
you know, you could go to this ride right now or this is the thing

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,900
you have available to you or you need to check the price of this experience.

328
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,900
I just feel like you're going to be steering your phone so much more.

329
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,100
Like I would love the ability to not, which I'm having to do already.

330
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,640
Like if you want to eat lunch as of the last time I went,

331
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,180
you want to eat lunch, even like a quick service restaurant.

332
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,900
Put your order in at 10 a.m.

333
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,700
because all the availability is gone by, you know, is gone by noon.

334
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,640
Like you're already like having to watch this thing like a hawk

335
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,500
to try to min max the experience.

336
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,900
And this, to me, the big hang up I have is like it just feels like another way

337
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,800
to keep you like locked into your phone rather than like trying to enjoy

338
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,340
your your experience.

339
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,140
Now, I'm curious how that hits the room, because some of us,

340
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,680
some of the three of us love to be on our phone

341
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,740
checking things throughout the day.

342
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,580
So what does the checker here, this spoiler is not me,

343
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,940
think about this this whole thing is going to get more people change

344
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,320
is going to ruin your line of free work?

345
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,820
Well, here's the thing.

346
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,540
Max Pass, I loved Max Pass, and I believe,

347
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,780
at least when I was doing the Fastpass Plus in Disney World,

348
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,620
the trick would be you make the three Fastpass reservations early as possible.

349
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,480
And then I could Max Pass the rest of the day.

350
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,760
I could just be surfing and trying to find.

351
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,320
And then we would be like in the line of Spaceship Earth.

352
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,420
I would be surfing. I'd find a Fastpass.

353
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,620
I go, we're getting out of this line.

354
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,920
We're getting into Fastpass line.

355
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,720
And I'd make a big I feel like true elation.

356
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,160
Like the only time I can ever feel anything is like when I would

357
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,720
get a victory like that in an app.

358
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,620
So, yes, I do like surfing.

359
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,160
I do. I'm on it too much for sure.

360
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,560
I feel like this is just this all of this is more complicated.

361
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,200
Now you're making this more extra complicated.

362
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,800
Like, I don't know if it's going to be quite as worth it,

363
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,460
because obviously when I'm pulling stuff, it's not always Spaceship Earth.

364
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,560
It's usually big stuff.

365
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,500
You're excited about the stuff that is a long, longer line, longer wait.

366
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,900
So it's a big pain in the ass to be like, yeah,

367
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,060
you're not going to be able to get on Guardians of the Galaxy unless you just pat.

368
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,540
There's no way I'm going to be able to pull that unless I just pay 20 or who knows,

369
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,900
50 dollars or 300 dollars if universal pricing is going to apply here.

370
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,440
As far as Disney Genie and Jason and I and Scott,

371
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,940
we already talked a little bit about this Disney Genie.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,540
Hey, I'd like to see you plan a plan a vacation or a day at Disneyland better than me, pal.

373
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,400
I would like to challenge Disney Genie officially right now.

374
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,840
Old John Henry scenario of like you have your robot family.

375
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,620
I have my human family.

376
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,380
That is exactly what we are going to do on podcast.

377
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,720
The right Jason is going to use Disney Genie.

378
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,920
I am not I'm going to be foamless.

379
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,780
And I still think I could beat Disney Genie at having a great Disney day.

380
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,840
This will happen.

381
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,740
Well, at some point this fall or winter, I am excited for a day

382
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,980
where I am just constantly set back and forth between Ariel's undersea adventure

383
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,680
and the bangle barbecue skewers, skewer stand.

384
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,240
Just there's no law.

385
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,320
It's like, oh, man, they got to do what the genie says.

386
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,800
I said I would do this.

387
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,900
Yeah. So look, I could be.

388
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,820
We'll have to see Genie, OK, because I don't I'm trash talking him now,

389
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,920
but it's only because we're going to compete in some sort of a pro wrestling style contest.

390
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,500
But it's possible that it's better or good, especially if you're maybe

391
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,760
like a total novice when it comes to knowing where to go.

392
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,120
And it just kind of maybe it does send you on a nice Disney day.

393
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Well, yeah. Oh, go ahead, Jason.

394
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,720
Well, I was going to say, I mean, I I am curious.

395
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,000
I think it could come in handy because even I like

396
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,260
there's a stretch between I always complain about that.

397
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,260
There's a stretch between like two and five where like some parks,

398
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,060
just everything is bottlenecked. There's a line for everything.

399
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,800
There's crowds everywhere.

400
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,460
That's when I would like something like, you know, machine learning to tell me like,

401
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,500
hey, there's no one over here right now.

402
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,200
That would be great. That's true. That's true.

403
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,600
That seems like if it works correctly.

404
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,740
But I was in Florida the first summer,

405
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,500
they were doing the magic bands in the my Disney experience.

406
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,140
And that app was so buggy.

407
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,980
It crashed so much.

408
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,200
Our phones were only like a couple of years old.

409
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,880
It was it took up so much room was overheating. It's better now.

410
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,100
But I the the first generation of this, I am just predicting it's it's

411
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,240
I just think it's going to be a mess.

412
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,800
And one of the like little side effects of like,

413
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,180
you know, COVID time, it's like there's everything is a little harder, right?

414
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,980
Everything's got a little more friction.

415
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,500
Restaurants are places closed earlier.

416
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,300
Places have limited menus, be it Disney or just out in the world.

417
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,100
You know, everything's a little harder.

418
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,580
What's that smaller staffs at a lot of places, smaller?

419
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,400
Staffs, a lot of places.

420
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,840
So to me, it seems like this is maybe the worst possible time

421
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,540
you could introduce a new software offering.

422
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,800
That your branding is kind of bad on.

423
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,940
And yeah, a time when people are already exhausted of friction, you know.

424
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,100
Yeah, it's also kind of funny.

425
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:11,240
I do kind of enjoy the idea that they're laying a beloved character just on the altar.

426
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,740
I mean, it's really funny.

427
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,400
They're really letting like this feels very sacrificial, doesn't it?

428
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,380
Like everyone's loved the genie for 20 years.

429
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,760
We miss Robin very much, but we are now going to desecrate this in

430
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,080
pretty much the most monumental way possible.

431
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,020
He burned on Piers.

432
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,180
People will abhor the very mention of his name if it doesn't go well.

433
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,420
Genie, Genie, you're not free anymore.

434
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,720
You're fucked.

435
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,460
You're just just a person after person at the city hall being like this fucking genie.

436
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,420
I hate this fucking genie over and over again.

437
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,020
And then there's just like negative vibes surrounding the Aladdin in general as an IP

438
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,660
and Sowers is something in Robin Williams's whole legacy as an actor.

439
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,000
The only thing people remember in 50 years like, oh, yeah, he's the guy that played

440
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
the A.I. that messed up Walt Disney World.

441
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,120
The I just have zero fit.

442
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,860
The website doesn't work now.

443
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,120
The website barely works.

444
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,420
Usually the app is not much better.

445
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,420
If you think about the and I'm obviously not like,

446
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,300
you know, someone who is planning this, I can see the appeal.

447
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,500
If you're Disney, like, you know, if we just move these groups of people like,

448
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,620
you know, like so many Legos, we could arrange a much prettier picture where

449
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,900
everything is balanced. But like, it's not going to work.

450
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,000
I mean, imagine the the the the challenge of, OK,

451
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,720
there are a hundred people that are just kind of waiting around in the area of.

452
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,100
You know, magic carpets with Aladdin or whatever.

453
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,040
And all of a sudden you send them all a notification.

454
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,880
It's like, hey, five minute wait on this bad boy.

455
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,480
Come on, let's go. And all hundred of those people were like, oh, sweet.

456
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,480
What? 45 minute wait.

457
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,400
No, wait. But it just said on the thing.

458
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,600
And then what about the people that walked, you know, 10 minutes to get over

459
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,540
to this five minute wait? And now it's like, oh, now it's an hour.

460
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,300
There's just no I can't imagine what an incredible challenge that would be.

461
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,500
And the idea that it's going to work is frankly unfathomable to me.

462
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,200
I have the I will hold that hope.

463
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,080
But like, yeah, it seems impossible, impossibly hard to do it

464
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,080
because it's like it feels like it's going to be sending you like it feels like

465
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,440
if you're if you maybe you don't know anything, maybe it's first time at Disney.

466
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,140
It's going to be sending you to like the least popular rides

467
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,840
back and forth over and over to the worst restaurant

468
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,880
because they're all traffic.

469
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,700
So like you're going to be going on, I don't know, what's the worst ride

470
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,240
at Disneyland, gentlemen, what do we what do we think?

471
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,780
The I this is not correct, but Astro Orbiter, that's not the worst ride.

472
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,740
But it's right. Right. You kind of who cares a little bit. Sure.

473
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,240
What is the worst ride at Disneyland?

474
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,940
I don't think we've ever question that. Oh, yeah.

475
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,020
Oh, we should do a whole 90 minutes or two hours on that.

476
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,080
How about like, hey, would you like to go on mission space again?

477
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,940
How about mission space?

478
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,520
There's no way for an hour and over and over and over.

479
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,080
And it's mission.

480
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,420
And Speedway is pretty miserable.

481
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,680
Just inhaling those fumes. Yeah.

482
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,120
Whatever again, you're going.

483
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,580
Yeah, it did. You're just in world vacation.

484
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,060
Jeannie keeps telling you to go back and forth between the Speedway

485
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,480
and then mission space, the intense version.

486
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,260
The intense line is parks are big.

487
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,220
It's like a walk.

488
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,020
It's like a long, a long journey getting from one place to another.

489
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,920
And you think, I mean, hopefully be smart enough to geolocate.

490
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,580
I mean, they know where you're at. Right.

491
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,520
Right. It's a small world that like says goodbye to you personally.

492
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
Like they know where you are.

493
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,160
Like, hopefully it could, you know, geolocate a little bit.

494
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,400
But yeah, but like try explaining this with a straight face to my family.

495
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,900
Their question was, well, how do we benefit?

496
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,140
What do we get out of this?

497
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,440
And I'm like, ah, you know, that's a great question.

498
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,260
And I don't have an answer.

499
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,400
I have the potential like they're discussing about the app.

500
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,500
Like they they literally said on the on like their blog,

501
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,560
like we put a lot of money into this cool new technology.

502
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,740
And it's like, oh, cool, man. All right.

503
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,180
The bragging about the money.

504
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:09,240
I yeah. One big thing, if we haven't properly explained this,

505
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,280
just imagine a in this did this the free part, the Disney Genie part

506
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,780
that now we're in kind of a Netflix will pick something for you territory

507
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,820
where I'm looking at the sample screen they have and it's like thrill rides,

508
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,120
experiences for little ones, slow rides, parades.

509
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,120
And you if you so this is for somebody in theory.

510
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,660
I mean, you could go in and you know what all the rides are like we do

511
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,100
and then just I want to get on all these today and make it happen.

512
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,460
But there's also the version where you don't know anything

513
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,220
and you go in and say, like, well, I like classic journeys.

514
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
So what is a classic journey near me that I could do?

515
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,760
I like swashbuckling adventures.

516
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Oh, what's the Pirates of the Caribbean?

517
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,060
Huh? I guess I give it a try.

518
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,760
I don't like getting drunk on the tequila flight at Cava de la Tequila

519
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,600
than riding the

520
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,740
Grand Fiesta tour with the three Caballero six times because it's air conditioned.

521
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,160
Oh, baby, Jeannie, you just described my day that year.

522
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,300
You're the Jeannie. You got me covered.

523
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,600
Yeah. It's just granted.

524
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,560
Is there a button that just says Dad needs to nap?

525
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,500
Like that will be the most popular.

526
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,500
It's just suddenly like shoulder to shoulder at the Hall of Presidents.

527
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,700
Jeannie, what's a low traffic bench right now?

528
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,100
Jeannie, what's the wait for a table at the bar?

529
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,740
Like how hardcore will Jeannie be?

530
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:38,040
Like I like I'd almost like the idea of they were like Jeannie is a full AI.

531
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,640
Put your headphones on.

532
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,700
You can talk to him all during the day.

533
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,140
He'll he'll answer any question about the park.

534
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,900
He'll tell you any wait time.

535
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,300
And then he'll like give you tips on like riding the ride.

536
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,060
If he's on, he'll say like if you have a hair tie when you're riding on Everest,

537
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,200
you throw the hair tie out when they try to check the track.

538
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,780
Like stuff like that, like I wish they would go full like crazy.

539
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,000
Like you got a little friend on your trip and it's like Dan Castellaneta

540
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,580
doing the Jeannie voice from when he did it in the land.

541
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,980
Wrong Jeannie. Yeah.

542
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,180
There is a virtual assistant for like very basic questions.

543
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,700
My concern about what you're describing, Mike, is that do you remember a few years ago

544
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,500
when Microsoft introduced a chatbot AI into Twitter?

545
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,440
It was called Tay and you would you would talk to the right guy.

546
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,640
Like I think I think it was about T.A.

547
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,640
Why you would you could tweet at Tay and get like,

548
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,540
you know, at back and forth going within.

549
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,380
I just very quickly, Tay immediately got racist.

550
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,120
So I yeah, Tay, just whatever.

551
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,920
It's some of these machine like artificial intelligence.

552
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,280
I don't know a lot about it, but some of them, whatever the input is,

553
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,240
you know, the output ends up being very similar.

554
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,380
Thankfully, I don't think that will happen with Disney. Jeannie.

555
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,620
Right. Well, yeah, they're not letting you input, I don't think or talk to it.

556
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:09,440
Yeah. But I mean, I'm sure down the line, yeah, like you buy your own little

557
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,920
like Jeannie that you could put on your shoulder like the like Salacious Crumb

558
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,120
and the toy that sits on your ear.

559
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,320
And then Jeannie directs you from there as opposed to your phone.

560
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,360
That's a more fun way to control crowds

561
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,920
and to make people pay for the controlling device.

562
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,160
There's no line at the hat store, Michael.

563
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,660
Head over there.

564
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,820
What if it's great on you?

565
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,800
Sixty dollars, what a deal.

566
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,000
A bargain at twice the price.

567
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,260
Did you know there's an antique type glassware store in Jason?

568
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,060
Yeah, obviously, I knew that. Thanks, Jeannie.

569
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,760
All right. Sorry.

570
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,100
Yeah, I appreciate the reminder, though.

571
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,960
The last time you had Lefou's brew, it gave you a migraine.

572
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,720
You remember? Don't want to go through that again.

573
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,120
I hope Disney Jeannie does the voices, the impressions, too.

574
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,000
I hope he does like Jack Nicholson when he's telling you what to do is select

575
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,020
what early 90s impressions you like.

576
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,920
You can have the same reaction that you have to about half of the Robin

577
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,020
Williams, Jeannie Lyons, where it's like, is that OK?

578
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm not sure we can.

579
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,420
That's right.

580
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,460
I'm the kind of voice you can do anymore.

581
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,460
That was Groucho. That's always OK.

582
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
All right. Back on board.

583
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,860
I guess I like you mentioning

584
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,700
over bar kind of beg to question for me, too, which is like if you if I'll pose

585
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,900
this to the group, if there is anything that you could make the Jeannie do

586
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,880
specifically, how that you could program your Jeannie to do,

587
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,640
what would it be?

588
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,340
Because that made me think I want to be able to

589
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,180
not just know when there's a seat at Uva bar, but also control

590
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,180
the temperature of the Chardonnay bottle.

591
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,940
I want to know where that is.

592
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,300
I want to know if that guy can get a couple degrees down.

593
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,480
Is that is that glass frozen?

594
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,140
Can we get that cold chilled as well?

595
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,140
If I can make if I can like, you know, be dealing with my barware

596
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,420
from the galaxy's edge, then that's great.

597
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,820
Feeling good.

598
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,840
That's like Taco Bell app level customization, I think,

599
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,140
because Taco Bell is my favorite of all the fast food apps,

600
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,480
because you can really go to town as far as customization with the items

601
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,080
and the sauces.

602
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,180
But that would be a great thing if you could like truly say,

603
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,280
I'm going to be there literally at like what time, Scott, do you go like 1030 a.m.

604
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,740
or so, 1035 a.m.?

605
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,420
I think it's not.

606
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,580
Yeah, most of our bars are not open until 1030, and then it takes them

607
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,220
a minute to like open the hatch and everything.

608
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,020
So yeah, I'll give them a break and say, I'll be there.

609
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,560
Yeah. So happy to hear you say that about the Taco Bell app,

610
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,720
because I thought that was a singular experience to me.

611
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,520
I have a nasty, specific way I like it.

612
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,260
And I feel guilty like talking to the person like, OK, so here's what you're going to do.

613
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,660
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Trap throughout the diagram, which is starting fresh.

614
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,120
It's a whole new palette.

615
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,720
So red strips. No, no, no.

616
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,060
Look on the shelf. They're behind the. Yes, that's them.

617
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,700
I can't do that to a living person, but the app doesn't care.

618
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,640
Yeah. Judgment unless you click whatever box weird about it.

619
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,600
You want. Yeah. My app. My orders are shameful.

620
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,200
I would be ashamed to say them out loud.

621
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,800
But one of the first times I don't do I'm not as bad.

622
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,240
The first time I went nuts with it and I didn't even think twice about what I was doing.

623
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,380
But I had five order five items and they were all had special

624
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,940
differences from what they normally have on them.

625
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,480
And the person at the order at the box just laughed when they looked at it.

626
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,180
They went, is this your order?

627
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,880
I was like a noise that came out of them like, oh, my God.

628
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,180
Yeah, I just thought you were stoned.

629
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,860
I mean, maybe, yes. So bad at Taco Bell.

630
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,220
Yeah. So so this yeah, this app like Scott is describing, that would be incredible

631
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,620
if you could really like customize exactly the temperature of the glass

632
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,360
and exactly when you would be there.

633
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,480
That's great. That's a that's a premium experience.

634
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,780
I bet that's like Disney, a Disney Genie plus plus or double plus.

635
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,820
Mm hmm. I can't imagine the thing that is is what like

636
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,060
in the in the one experience that I had, I cannot express to you

637
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,420
the extent to which there was nothing like it wasn't like

638
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,220
you have a bevy of options available.

639
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,380
It is like there is one sliver of daylight where you can go to this one place

640
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,280
at this one time and literally everything is gone.

641
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,880
Like I started making dining reservations.

642
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,460
You can do 60 days before you you arrive. Right. Yeah.

643
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,300
There was literally like nothing like I had to put in

644
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,660
some like wish list type stuff and then hope that something opened up later on.

645
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,860
And when you got to the parks, there's you know, you can go to a restaurant

646
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,900
and try to get on the waiting list all full.

647
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,160
I mean, there's no even to get into like the

648
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,160
the ziggurat at the Mexico Pavilion in Epcot was like a

649
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,040
you stand in line for half hour just to like walk into the facility,

650
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,980
which I don't know how Jeannie.

651
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,620
Deals with that, like deals with like there's nothing to do.

652
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,840
You could sit down.

653
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,720
Bathrooms are open.

654
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,040
You need that pretend that's a ride.

655
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,280
Maybe, yeah, sit down and think about your life.

656
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,540
How much did you spend?

657
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,980
How did you get to this point?

658
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,380
That trash can used to talk.

659
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,460
It doesn't anymore, but it used to.

660
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,980
That's some fun trivia for you.

661
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
But the price only went up.

662
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,160
I yeah, that 60 day in advance.

663
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,480
I remember not even knowing that was the case.

664
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,780
And a friend of mine was going and like, OK, I have my stuff ready.

665
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,120
And here's a giant list.

666
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,720
And I was truly like, this is this is insane.

667
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,480
This cannot stand.

668
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,420
You have to know your day two full months ahead of time.

669
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,120
I mean, if this all somehow dismantles that madness,

670
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,320
I think it's good.

671
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,160
Maybe it just replaces it with a new madness.

672
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,820
But yeah, that it it's over.

673
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,060
But, you know, first off, I live for that.

674
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,600
I'm sad to see it go.

675
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,920
The new substitution for that, which sucks more in my in my opinion,

676
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,400
is that you can make your first reservation

677
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,820
the day of at seven a.m.

678
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,760
So if you're on your grind and you want one of the big ones,

679
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,760
you know, earlier in the day, because you can only have one at a time.

680
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,460
Right. So like if I want to guarantee that I'm going to ride

681
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,600
frozen ever after at Epcot and I want to get there early enough,

682
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,800
so I'm not like wasting the entire day of of Jeannie Plus,

683
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,260
then I have to be up at like seven a.m.

684
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,820
which you already have to do for if you want to ride rise the resistance

685
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,160
on that day. But now you're going to have to do it every day

686
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,560
if you want to get like a decent early fast pass, because you want an early one,

687
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,660
because you can't get another one until you have used that one.

688
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,160
As I understand the system.

689
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,200
So, yeah, waking up every morning at like seven a.m. is is not.

690
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,060
I'd rather do that 60 days before I'm at the park and just get it done all at once.

691
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,540
Well, and my my family already has like calendar reminders for the for two

692
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,900
because dining reservations will still be 60 days, I think.

693
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,940
Actually, I think it's been up.

694
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,160
I think it's 60 days.

695
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,860
And a week like so it's a little earlier or like 60 days.

696
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,440
But then you can go to the first of that month.

697
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,140
It's something insane.

698
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,760
And I think we're just like we're just going to call a phone number six months.

699
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,040
And that really felt insane because that is like

700
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,340
I don't even know if I'm going to like spaghetti in six months,

701
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:53,300
but I'm going to put book a table at Tony and Tina's town square tantrum.

702
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Well, Tony and Tina's is Tony's is reliable

703
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,980
because you know you're going to have a bad time.

704
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah, you're not going to enjoy it.

705
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,200
Absolutely. And I control how watery the sauce is.

706
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
Yes. Yeah.

707
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I just remember like the day or two that Disney opened watching someone

708
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,640
live streaming, like dipping a chunk of steak into Alfredo sauce at Tony's.

709
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,000
And I was like, oh, oh, man, like,

710
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,180
she's Louise risking in the middle of the pandemic,

711
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,600
getting steak, Alfredo saw it like, oh, man.

712
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,840
Here's here's what this service or a service like this should actually be.

713
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,400
And this is I'm not no joke.

714
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,380
Here's what it honestly should be.

715
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,740
I'm you should input in the app.

716
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,100
I'm going to Hollywood Studios today.

717
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,980
You could an ideal thing would be maybe I'm going from 10 a.m.

718
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,860
to 6 p.m. or whatever.

719
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,660
I want to do these five things.

720
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,120
I want to have this restaurant.

721
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,580
This is what I want to go to.

722
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,780
And then the app does it for you. Yeah.

723
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,760
And that's it. That's it.

724
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,460
That should be that's the actual easy way to do it.

725
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,380
It's not surfing, Jeannie.

726
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,760
That would honestly take away any of the things that I feel like compulsive

727
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,460
to do compulsion to do, which is search for faster time.

728
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,280
As soon as you get off Tower of Terror, now I'm looking for see if somebody's

729
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,920
canceled Rock and Roller Coaster.

730
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,620
If you just put in all that, they literally said six fast passes.

731
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,960
Here's a reservation.

732
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,620
That's your schedule.

733
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,360
That would be perfect.

734
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,920
There's actually nothing you really need to do other than that.

735
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,520
That's the ultimate version of what they want to do here.

736
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,620
But I don't know if that's too hard, if that's just dependent on too many factors

737
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,660
that they won't do something like that, because, yeah, that'll get rid of the

738
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,120
problem of being on your phone the whole time.

739
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,220
But they're also incentivizing you.

740
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,700
I think it's almost like they want you to be on your phone.

741
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,960
They think that people want to be on their phones the whole time,

742
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,100
because there's also all of this like bonus stuff.

743
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,700
I mean, one thing is that when they because they're also trying to get you

744
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,240
on to rides that maybe you didn't know about or that you might miss.

745
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,160
And I noticed in the in this video that they made where they show you

746
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,100
some of the components of this program, there's a thing that you can pull up.

747
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,860
If you get a recommendation and you're suspicious of the recommendation,

748
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,640
you can pull up a button that says, why this?

749
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,520
And it explains with a few factoids

750
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,280
what would be interesting or fun about this experience.

751
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,180
And what do they choose for as a sample?

752
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,520
Why this? Somebody would click on this for it.

753
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,040
They throw the people mover under the bus, the poor people mover,

754
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,880
which I love very much or whatever it's called there, the Tomorrowland, whatever.

755
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,620
But there's like a they show somebody clicking on that.

756
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,220
And then there's little factoids like, well, it's a nice slow ride

757
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,620
to help you relax during the day.

758
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,660
And you get to see a model of Walt's original plans for Epcot.

759
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,320
And it's fun for the whole family.

760
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,760
This it made me sort of mad to see people mover have to justify its own existence.

761
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,960
So I don't like that.

762
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,600
It's like a ride has to beg for a reason to exist on the app.

763
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,020
So, yeah, like, why would I do this piece of shit ride?

764
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,000
And it's like, well, no, it's actually pretty good.

765
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,200
And, you know, it's like there's a cool breeze when you're riding it.

766
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,840
So that's nice.

767
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,140
Walter mentioned that it could be implemented across in different ways,

768
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,540
like in airports and and you and you like airport trams and efficiency, don't you?

769
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,000
So you'd want to experience this one.

770
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,200
I want to do that. Yeah.

771
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,100
Some of the bonus stuff made me like I

772
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,300
I think augmented reality like inserting something into a like

773
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,640
I those always look like shit to me.

774
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:42,840
Yeah. But nothing is as disgusting to me as like the the Genie plus audio

775
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,980
experiences like here.

776
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,880
Here are more facts about the your magic and you're talking about the ride.

777
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,280
It's like, oh, I can't wait to hear

778
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,240
tinny audio out of everyone's giant fucking phones like giant

779
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,980
shitty, stupid phones like playing like, you know, when we were building,

780
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,380
soaring, we studied real airplanes like, oh, goody. Thanks. Great.

781
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,020
That was thank you for playing that at the top volume because you don't know how.

782
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,340
You didn't bother to use this massive Android phone.

783
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,620
You were forced to get by AT&T.

784
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,640
Well, I'll tell you my problem with that old thing behind the scenes, audio tales

785
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,940
and it's listed in the video.

786
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,920
Listen to interesting facts about the parks at your leisure.

787
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,780
And I was like, hey, that's what we do.

788
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,440
Quit stepping on podcast, the ride Disney Genie.

789
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,480
This is where you get in there.

790
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,180
You try to license get a licensing deal going.

791
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,780
Why is one now step in?

792
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,240
Yeah. What do they hear in their headphones?

793
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,540
Bringing them in.

794
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,840
And if you if Disney Genie fucks up, which it might,

795
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,880
and you end up in a line for two hours still, how do you fill that two hours

796
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,480
with the three podcasts, the ride boys sometimes joined by Justin

797
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,780
and other fun people?

798
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,880
That's how you if not with whatever these these little audio documentaries

799
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,280
are going to be and God help us if it's the behind the attraction people doing it.

800
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,020
Then like you'll be you'll be going deaf from sproings and boings

801
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,120
the whole episode.

802
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,180
Yeah. Slamming on brakes and stuff.

803
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,720
We got to pair with a software provider.

804
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,120
We got to like we got maybe we can get a license, something with touring plans

805
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,980
and go like, all right, we're going to we'll do the behind the scenes.

806
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,780
If you guys want a Disney to far genie, you know, when Jafar briefly becomes a genie,

807
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,260
it's got a lot of the same features, but the audio experiences

808
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,520
we tell you about the rides and there's a light profanity mixed in.

809
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,760
And that's going to really get the teens on board.

810
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,860
Then they'll be interested in their vacation.

811
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:39,140
Can you imagine what an absolute shit fit the Genie Plus will throw

812
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,740
whenever you are within like a hundred yards of a hidden Mickey?

813
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,300
Like, wait, listen, this is something I want to know.

814
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,460
You're going to miss it. Wait, stop.

815
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,740
This is something you might have missed.

816
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,700
There's some there's some small scrap of meat left on the bone.

817
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,140
All right. This sewage pipe with two broken mirrors next to it.

818
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,940
If you squint.

819
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,260
Then you hit the button that says, why am I looking at this?

820
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,600
It's like, well, no, there's like a lot of these actually.

821
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,000
And like, it's kind of cool, isn't it?

822
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,200
And you're like, no, it's not.

823
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,160
So look, this stuff, I don't know how I feel about this stuff.

824
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,000
I also really quickly, I would just like to,

825
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:25,560
you know, I as with Magic Key, I was initially vowing to do zero research

826
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,800
about any of this, but then I thought, wait a minute, there is a 14 minute

827
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,940
video about Disney. This is in my subscription box.

828
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,480
I got to know what the 14 minute video is.

829
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,540
And I started and I you immediately encounter not.

830
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,880
I think I thought that the genie was going to be your host, Mike.

831
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,040
Like you said, the wrong gene, the Casmaletta Genie.

832
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,040
But no, you're greeted by Gary Daniels,

833
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,640
the VP of Digital Experiences at Disney Parks,

834
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,380
which immediately threw my wife, Erin, for a loop because she just immediately

835
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,820
all she can do is talk about his ill fitting shirt.

836
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:09,220
It's just like really odd and like billowing up in strange ways.

837
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,980
And like, why did nobody give him like a like a pat down?

838
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,660
So a little bit distracting from the very dry information.

839
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,560
He's just holding a mask the whole time, not wearing it,

840
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,920
but just gesturing with the this whole thing is one of the weirdest videos.

841
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,520
But especially this clip.

842
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,820
And I just wanted to play this for everybody.

843
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,860
This is where he's demonstrating.

844
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,860
Hey, it's not just rides that Disney Genie will help recommend.

845
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,740
There's a little sweet treats as well.

846
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,560
Here's a little clip.

847
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,660
It also looks like Disney Genie service also suggested a convenient location

848
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,100
near my plans to mobile order lunch before I head over to Buzz Lightyear

849
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,940
Space Rangers fan.

850
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,800
I can place my order and ensure I add that chocolate

851
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,700
bunk cake from Cosmic Grace, you know, the one with the purple icing

852
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,740
at a time that works great in my day.

853
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,860
If I'm not familiar.

854
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah, yeah, no.

855
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,840
So it's a great time to eat chocolate

856
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,000
but cake in a hundred degree.

857
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,040
It's the perfect moment for me to enjoy the entire bucking

858
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,600
while being surrounded by sunny eclipse.

859
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,100
Stop screaming, Tommy.

860
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,900
The phone reminding us we have to get to the bundt cake.

861
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,940
There's a hundred. Yeah, a hundred degrees, a hundred percent humidity.

862
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,380
Eat the bundt cake.

863
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,880
It's Gary Daniels favorite.

864
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,680
Stuff it down.

865
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,820
He loves the purple icing and so will you.

866
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,760
Well, we'll meet up with mom later.

867
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,720
OK, she said she just needed a little time.

868
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,660
All right. It's going to be fine.

869
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,380
It always is.

870
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:44,160
Then then I'm more like, I mean, the whole thing is strange.

871
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,880
Just this guy and this little like you heard it a little bit there.

872
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,720
But I was saying the video, it's like he I'm not sure this guy's ever been

873
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,080
on a camera before.

874
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,720
So there's all these things where he like the voice like goes up.

875
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,920
It goes up and up and up.

876
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,200
But then by a certain point, it has nowhere to go.

877
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,300
And he wants to keep modulating, but there's nowhere that he can his left.

878
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,120
And that is the best way that you can maximize your Disney experience.

879
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,100
Like he did it like the lungs are going to burst.

880
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,820
It sounds like the first time he's ever said buzz buzz, let your space rangers.

881
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,620
You can't believe it's really called that.

882
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,420
Like there's a take where he's like, what is it?

883
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,100
This can't be right.

884
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,460
Can you double check that?

885
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,040
That's what Jeannie said.

886
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,760
Jeannie said that's the name.

887
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,960
Well, I trust Jeannie.

888
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,360
Then you see, you're wondering, like, how is this possibly going to sustain

889
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,100
any more time?

890
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,600
And then you realize that the back half is a Zoom Q&A.

891
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,000
That's essentially like a digital town hall where Gary's back.

892
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,660
And I'm showing you guys there's like six.

893
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,800
This is where the dichotomy of this being named after the fun character

894
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,280
really struck me where half of the screen is the Robin Williams

895
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,240
void, the zany character we all love putting his arms out like, hey, it's me.

896
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,240
What are you going to do?

897
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,380
And the other half is like six forced smiles in various offices

898
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,540
where everybody put up their one piece of Disney.

899
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,800
We're like, oh, it's kind of an Epcot mug.

900
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,640
And all right, I'll try to like it.

901
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,580
And everybody is addressing this guy with actual concerns.

902
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,600
Like, I liked this thing.

903
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,600
What's it going to be now?

904
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,800
And he's like, that's a very good question.

905
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:29,500
It is like a it reminds me of like when every city blew up into protests

906
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,980
and then every city had to have a town hall where the mayor

907
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,080
and the police chief got taken to task forever.

908
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,400
Like, we're back to that.

909
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,900
But it's about this fucking app.

910
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,780
It's oh, my God, this thing in the old does the does the does the

911
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,540
I know we're all in different scenarios here, but like the main thing,

912
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,180
the only thing that anybody

913
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,340
it's really interesting to me that the the vast majority of people in the

914
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:00,220
the Disney media social media morass, I should say, like the Reddit especially.

915
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,440
The only thing anybody was reacting to is the fact they were charging

916
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,440
for the for the for this.

917
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,640
Like, this is what has freaked everyone out.

918
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,380
And to me, that's like the last like.

919
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,080
It's it's I said this on Twitter, and I feel like this is this is accurate.

920
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,720
Disney fans have proven time and time again that they will do

921
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:23,080
they will pay any price for any small edge, and they are shocked

922
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,480
every single time when Disney takes advantage of that fact.

923
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,180
Like, this is just city.

924
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,080
I mean, this is like the lowest hanging possible fruit.

925
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,480
They could have charged anything, any price.

926
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,480
And I think it's still would have people still would have gone.

927
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:42,780
I mean, think about the absolute press of people to like get back into the park

928
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,580
to like get back into the parks when there was like you guys didn't see it.

929
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:50,480
Disney won't probably like there's so little to do.

930
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,680
I mean, like so much stuff is currently closed or not not happening right now.

931
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,880
You know, it's gradually sort of slowly opening back up.

932
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,880
But like, especially with the labor stuff, the, you know, issues that they've had,

933
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,980
like they're still will do and people are like ticket sales are ridiculous.

934
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,120
Like they're topping what they were doing this time two years ago.

935
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,320
Like it's there's no dip in sales.

936
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,020
And it's like, of course, they're going to do this.

937
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,720
They're going to and they're I don't know.

938
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,420
It just doesn't seem to be that to be that

939
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,320
the surge thing will have to say what they're charging for.

940
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,960
It seems like a really weird piece of the puzzle to leave out, honestly,

941
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,320
to not even like sort of, you know, hint at what that charge might be.

942
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,760
Yeah. Is it going to be ten dollars a ride or fifty dollars a ride?

943
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,820
Like that's a big, exactly a big sort of thing.

944
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:44,420
And this is all to like the opposite of like down the road at Universal.

945
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,620
Do it like by two days, get three free.

946
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,720
All hotel rooms on site are 30 percent off until next spring.

947
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,820
Go crazy, folks.

948
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:59,820
And where like, I mean, it's been striking me every time I've been.

949
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:02,620
I mean, I know I've just been twice in the last two years, but like,

950
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:08,060
I mean, it's hard for me to not start thinking universal.

951
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,060
The universal resort is better than Disney.

952
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,460
I think it is.

953
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,960
I think there's more to do that's newer and like,

954
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,260
you know, like scarier and more thrills and better technology

955
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,260
and that's updated more.

956
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,760
I went to the parks themselves are like the the I've never I've never stayed there.

957
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,560
But Jason has and he's a fan of it.

958
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,260
And I imagine you throw that in on top of how

959
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,760
you know, highly I feel about the parks.

960
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,160
I mean, and that it's all right there.

961
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,460
You aren't running all around.

962
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,060
You aren't like potentially at the edge of a property

963
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,260
and having to take endless buses everywhere.

964
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,460
I mean, universal is just kind of killing it.

965
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,160
And I don't I wonder what the difference is though.

966
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,760
It's what you're describing, though.

967
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,460
The big problem is just fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

968
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,860
Where do I go when I need to chill out and calm down with something boring?

969
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,660
Disney has has universal there hands down.

970
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,860
And they got all kinds of chill out.

971
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:09,360
And you get to work up.

972
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,860
You got to look at look at robots of the present.

973
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,360
It's like, got you.

974
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,460
Calm down. It's all right.

975
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,360
You go to the fine Lowe's hotel offering.

976
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:24,160
That's her. That that is the big like we my family would do this in the early 2000s

977
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,160
when they were really giving away the rooms to get people to try staying at Universal.

978
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,760
But it's come back around again where it's like

979
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,760
you could save yourself a large sum of money

980
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,460
if you stayed even at the Hard Rock or the Royal Pacific or something

981
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:41,760
and just took lifts to Disney where like that sounds crazy.

982
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,760
It's not as crazy as you think it is.

983
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,860
No, that's my plan next time.

984
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,060
Yeah, I'm I'm at Universal next time.

985
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,660
I think I've decided that.

986
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:55,160
Yeah. And Disney, like everything is like Guardians of the Galaxy roller coaster.

987
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,460
And Epcot feels like it's like 2023.

988
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,160
There's rumors that it's going to open in 2023 and Tron is like 20.

989
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:05,860
They like everything slow and like Universal is just building.

990
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:09,660
And I'm not saying they should have just forced all the workers to build through a pandemic,

991
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,160
but they did. So there's more rewards.

992
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,660
Yeah. Yeah. And they have.

993
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,960
Yeah. But come on, guys.

994
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,660
Ratatouille, Ratatouille, the ride.

995
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,660
Finally, we heard your pleas, America. Ratatouille.

996
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,960
We heard you 15 years ago when you kind of like.

997
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,860
Right. We looked at our box office returns in the past 10 years and thought,

998
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,160
what do people really want?

999
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,960
And it turns out it's Ratatouille, the rat who has a job.

1000
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,060
That's right, folks.

1001
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,060
Your job is your personality here at Pixar.

1002
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,960
I do appreciate, though, like.

1003
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,660
As someone with kids Epcot, once you get past.

1004
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:52,060
So if you if you've never been to Epcot, there's two halves, right?

1005
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,360
The future world and the world showcase future world is like

1006
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,160
where you've got things like living with the land.

1007
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,660
This is the best stuff. Like talk about chill out.

1008
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,860
You want to come see some hydroponically grown tomatoes.

1009
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,760
We've got you. It only takes a half hour.

1010
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,660
It's the best you sit down the and then like World of Imagination,

1011
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,560
which is an absolute nightmare and should probably be leveled.

1012
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,460
And then a bunch of other walls that are protecting construction

1013
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,060
that may or may not be happening.

1014
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,460
And I think there's a Nemo ride.

1015
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,560
So that's like that have in the world showcase is like a big loop.

1016
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:28,360
So you got Mexico and Canada on either side mirroring

1017
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,160
how those two countries border America.

1018
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,160
They border your entrance to the world showcase.

1019
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:37,360
And then it's a big loop and the boats are running.

1020
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,960
So once you start that loop, you better have a plan.

1021
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,160
It better be to finish the loop or to go back.

1022
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,260
And if you got kids, the thing is, if you start the loop this way,

1023
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,060
you do Grand Fist Tour with the three Caballeros of the Mexico Pavilion.

1024
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,060
Right after that, you got Norway, which is where they

1025
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,860
they now have the frozen ever after.

1026
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,760
And you get past that.

1027
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,260
It's like, well, kids, mom and dad are going to get drunk now

1028
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,360
and there's not going to be a whole lot for you.

1029
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,560
But you just got to keep up.

1030
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,460
OK, because we're going to get halfway around the globe

1031
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,260
and we're not going to have another option.

1032
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,260
We just have to keep going and drinking through.

1033
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,660
There's nothing.

1034
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:15,960
I mean, do you guys want to watch a 360 degree film

1035
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,260
starring Martin Short?

1036
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,260
Because we have you.

1037
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,960
If that's the idea of a good time, you're covered.

1038
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,160
If you can make it all the way back around to Canada.

1039
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,460
But the red at France is like towards the back.

1040
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,860
So that'll be a nice thing to like, keep the kids motivated

1041
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,260
that there's a ratatouille experience for them.

1042
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,360
You bought them all tiny chocolates from each country that you are like.

1043
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,560
You have 90 seconds to eat that before it's go.

1044
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,860
Like it's start yet on that.

1045
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,060
Yeah. After.

1046
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,960
Did you see a poutine?

1047
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,660
You see it's it's 110 degrees.

1048
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,260
The high that a child feels from going on frozen and meeting Gare Ness.

1049
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,660
The perfumer, the cologne man.

1050
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,160
The set maker. Yeah.

1051
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,760
Yeah, that would be never.

1052
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,160
What is that? His name? Did I get his name?

1053
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,460
Here in this? Yeah, I did.

1054
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,460
Okay, great.

1055
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,160
Yeah, then they they had to add ratatouille.

1056
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:07,460
That is so crazy that for this long it's been and if you start that way, hey,

1057
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,560
fun boat ride, hey, like boat ride with more stuff, more animatronics.

1058
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,660
Now what?

1059
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,560
Well, do you want to learn about Carnegie

1060
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,960
and his contributions to this modern world?

1061
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,960
What will Jeannie plus do for me there?

1062
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,160
Like what will the genie say?

1063
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,460
Like, hey, you're in Spain.

1064
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,260
I'm only hey, do you want to go check?

1065
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,060
No, I don't. Jeannie, it's a circle.

1066
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,960
I'm going to the circle.

1067
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,060
Jeannie will probably do some inappropriate accents.

1068
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,360
Let's be honest.

1069
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,860
That is how Italians like.

1070
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,860
It's going to be like, hey, it's going to be like, hey, all over again.

1071
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,760
Careful, Disney.

1072
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,560
Do not open the app in the world showcase with Jean.

1073
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,960
Do not do it.

1074
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,960
They're out of your range, Jeannie.

1075
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,260
Yeah, I, you know, just and just on this topic,

1076
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,760
I'm like because I like hearing your other Disney world opinion.

1077
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,560
What are you like?

1078
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,360
What do you enter into a Jeannie plus?

1079
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,860
What's what's a priority for you or or if you were doing it the old fashioned way?

1080
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:13,060
What's like what is the the most hit for you?

1081
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,060
What's the box here?

1082
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,460
There's a really weird imbalance right now.

1083
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,060
Just from my perspective is like like bringing your whole family like

1084
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,260
Magic Kingdom is like this.

1085
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,160
It's almost like everything is either something they really like

1086
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,960
or something that we just feel compelled to like

1087
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:37,060
do because it's there and we will do it like we almost always do

1088
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:41,360
like carousel of progress and people mover and that stuff because it's there

1089
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,460
and there's not much of a way you can get in.

1090
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,360
Like that's the other thing is you kind of have to keep a pace of like attraction

1091
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,260
to standing outside because it is so hot and there's young children like you need

1092
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,260
to like get them get them cooled off.

1093
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:59,860
Epcot is really I mean, I love Epcot and as somebody who grew up like going to Disney

1094
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,960
and that was like one of my formative memories is like

1095
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:07,660
the the original Journey and Imagination with with Dreamfinder and Figment and stuff.

1096
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,960
It's in a really weird.

1097
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,760
It's really weird.

1098
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,660
The themes are sort of all over the place.

1099
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:21,160
The construction is very present and it's really hard to like make a solid day there

1100
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,160
because you you know, you can it's kind of all spread out and there's a lot of stuff

1101
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,560
that isn't happening right now and is it and is it working and the kids really only

1102
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,460
like like, you know, Nemo and

1103
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:39,760
Frozen and Grand Vista Tour and like other than that like Spaceship Earth like my

1104
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,760
six-year-old finished the the the journey through human history in Spaceship Earth.

1105
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,560
She got to the end.

1106
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,760
The first thing she said was didn't women do anything?

1107
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:56,060
Yeah, honey, I know they were going to rebuild it but JPEG thought it cost too much money.

1108
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,260
So we just left it how it is.

1109
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:05,360
So yeah, that one one scientist there was a woman in the 70s one right the first woman

1110
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,060
who did anything.

1111
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,260
I got stuck on Spaceship Earth last time I was there for 40 minutes in Steve Jobs is a

1112
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:16,960
garage just walking watching that sad robot type into another robot for 40 minutes.

1113
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,660
Why here, you know nondescript bleeps and bloops behind me.

1114
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,560
It was bad man.

1115
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,260
He's really throwing a lot of binders at Wozniak.

1116
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:23,960
She's a weed.

1117
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,960
I haven't seen this scene fully play out before.

1118
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,260
Yeah, you're right though.

1119
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:34,660
It is like it's getting like it's it's Slim Pickens.

1120
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:39,060
I mean, it's sort of where Disney Studios was at for a little while and I think it's

1121
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:44,160
really some of its out of their control because they were really pushing towards there's

1122
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,860
a like if you're following, you know, like one of my guys is this kid.

1123
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,560
Brady's like 15 show Mickey views.

1124
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:57,560
So I'm in five follow his stuff because he seems to have an inside track this 15 year

1125
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:57,860
old kid.

1126
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,160
Brayden and he was talking about all the you know, there was like going to be a Mary

1127
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:07,860
Poppins ride over in, you know, the UK part of the World Showcase and the Spaceship

1128
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,260
Earth revamp and all this stuff.

1129
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:14,260
And I think that like the pandemic really did kick the legs out from a lot not only

1130
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:20,360
the like construction but also like the funding of like how do we pay for this and

1131
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,060
still kind of keep the bottom line where it was so I think that that really like took

1132
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:29,060
the way especially building up to there's been a lot of focus on October 1st because

1133
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,760
the 50th anniversary at Walt Disney World, right?

1134
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,560
So a lot of the like the rebuild revamp and refresh and and that stuff I think was supposed

1135
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,460
to be building to that.

1136
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:42,260
I think it really kind of screwed the timetable with the the pandemic happening when it

1137
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:42,560
did.

1138
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,360
Well, if it makes you feel any better, they're still going to, you know, rename the

1139
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:55,260
neighborhoods World Celebration and World the other ones, you know, World Magic

1140
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,460
World Enchant.

1141
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,960
Yeah, play Pavilion where the play Hogwild.

1142
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,760
That's right.

1143
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,360
I mean, you're that actually like kids will probably like like if you just can unleash

1144
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:11,860
them and there's like a little inside playground and little like, you know, screen games

1145
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,260
and stuff like that probably will be a blessing for parents.

1146
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:22,660
Dumbo is like that Dumbo in in Disney World has a really cool like you get a pager and

1147
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:26,160
then your kids can go like run around on the playground and sometimes you have to like

1148
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,560
peel them off of that to go get them to do.

1149
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,960
I mean, Dumbo is boring.

1150
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,760
I get it.

1151
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,760
But we're here kids.

1152
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,460
Get on.

1153
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,160
It's an iconic like it'll be iconic if you go on it, right?

1154
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:36,660
Right.

1155
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,460
It's great for selfies.

1156
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,160
Kids need to learn that early on.

1157
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,860
I've got this change happening with me now because I have a pretty newish kid and I like

1158
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:49,860
and probably now I think the first trip is, you know, seven eight nine years away somewhere

1159
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:50,260
in there.

1160
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:56,760
So the clock is ticking for me in terms of Epcot having things that make sense for an

1161
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,960
actual child who can enjoy things on their own merit because in my head it's always been

1162
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,360
Epcot is the greatest place.

1163
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:10,460
It what with all the brutalist architecture that almost nothing is inside of that works

1164
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,360
great for me.

1165
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,660
I get drunk near brutalist architecture.

1166
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:14,260
Love it.

1167
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:20,060
But it's there will be a day of reckoning when I take my little dude by that moment though.

1168
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:31,160
You'll have Moana Journey into water space to 20 Ratatouille Guardians Galaxy like hopefully

1169
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,360
like some of the aesthetic construction will be finished on this play Pavilion some of

1170
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,960
this other stuff like it's just a really rough rough spot right now, but it's always been

1171
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,660
my favorite favorite part.

1172
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,560
So hopefully they can they can figure that out.

1173
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,260
Maybe by then they'll let you just throw food at figment.

1174
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,960
Maybe they'll just like cut loose all the rules.

1175
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:57,060
You can throw that chocolate cake with the purple icing straight at figments dumb face as

1176
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:01,060
a depth is as Disney has gotten about exploiting their nostalgia.

1177
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:07,060
It's weird that they kind of leave Dreamfinder and figment like figment to a lesser extent

1178
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:11,060
because he's sort of in the right now, but like they kind of leave the love for that

1179
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:14,260
guy behind glass like it's weird that they haven't just like broken into it.

1180
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:14,860
Yeah, like here.

1181
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,660
Okay, he's back.

1182
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,860
He's walking around.

1183
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:17,460
Come on.

1184
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,260
Okay, now burn itself to the ground.

1185
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,360
There is a golden statue of him.

1186
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:26,860
There's a bunch of golden idols, you know, because these are our gods coming for the 50th

1187
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,260
and they did announce there will be a figment one.

1188
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:34,460
So but not Dreamfinder but now the dream like now the Dreamfinder they just know that dude

1189
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:39,860
to they haven't figured out how to you know, frame the Dreamfinder yet.

1190
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,460
Yeah, that's such a home run.

1191
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:46,760
I mean all out of like a lot of these beloved characters, you know, like Hatbox Ghost

1192
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,760
people didn't even really know but the legend of the Hatbox Ghost was something that they

1193
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,560
unleashed, you know, during the Disneyland anniversary and that was such a big deal.

1194
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,960
You would think that it'd be low-hanging fruit for a character that actually a lot of people

1195
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:04,360
have actually seen and know about you think that would actually be even a bigger deal.

1196
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,160
But I guess they don't care.

1197
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,160
I wonder if Dreamfinder was in Disneyland if there would be more.

1198
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:16,660
I don't know more presence of him because I do feel like Disneyland still the people

1199
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,860
in charge of Disneyland are a little bit more like I don't know there.

1200
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:23,560
They're a little more in tune with like the real hardcore nerds as opposed to Florida

1201
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,060
where I think they're like those are tourists.

1202
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:32,760
They don't know the lore as much like I you know, I think there's this is just one side.

1203
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,560
I've never been to Disneyland.

1204
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:41,160
So I this is my you know outside looking at but I feel like at Disney World there is it

1205
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,360
is a sense of like what can we do to make this place the most profitable and I feel

1206
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,260
like Disneyland has the more direct connections to Walt.

1207
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:53,360
So there's like a little bit a little bit shyer about like it changing anything.

1208
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:59,160
I mean the only do you guys know the only ride that had that that Walt worked on that

1209
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,060
is in Disney World?

1210
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,660
No, I can't.

1211
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,560
So progress.

1212
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,360
Oh, right.

1213
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,760
The only one original with the World's Fair and then went there and then came back the

1214
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,460
only one that he like actually like worked on himself is that which I think is the only

1215
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:16,960
thing that has saved that boring that boring thing for as long as it has been but I think

1216
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,960
there's just like it's I think that there's there's less of a sense of like, you know,

1217
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,960
Walt worked on this, you know before.

1218
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:28,660
Yeah, there's like and I especially I mean, it's interesting because if all the Imagineers

1219
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:33,160
have to move out to Florida and I want to say to Jason a lot of I've gotten a couple

1220
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:37,860
texts from people in Florida after your incendiary remarks about Lake, which what is it called

1221
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:38,160
Lake?

1222
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:38,760
No, no.

1223
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,560
Yeah, no, no.

1224
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:44,260
A couple of people saying a couple of people telling me Lake Jason's wrong Lake Nona is

1225
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:44,960
beautiful.

1226
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,160
I just want to put that out there.

1227
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:46,560
All right.

1228
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,160
So but they're going to move a hard stand.

1229
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,360
So so I don't know what we'll we'll have to address it another episode.

1230
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:57,760
But if they all go to Florida, I wonder because the Imagineers were in Glendale based out

1231
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:03,060
of Glendale and going down to Anaheim was that also another part of it where it was like

1232
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,460
this is our park.

1233
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,660
This is like our little like pristine diorama.

1234
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:12,460
We want to keep it, you know, keep it perfect and Walt's vision and Florida's over there.

1235
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,860
We go out there once in a while.

1236
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:15,360
Will it could it change?

1237
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:20,060
Could there be more of that sort of like let's get let's sneak the Dreamfinder in Tinker

1238
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:20,560
and they make it.

1239
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:26,060
Yeah, it just feels like though they used to be better at making people swallow like

1240
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:29,460
for a company that has a song about a spoonful of sugar.

1241
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:35,360
I feel like they used to be better at like, you know, hiding the like shitty like yeah,

1242
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,660
and you got to pay 15 bucks for this.

1243
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:37,360
Don't worry about it.

1244
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,260
You know, I I don't know.

1245
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:45,860
I just feel like I don't know if the marketing has gotten worse or like I I can't see the

1246
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,960
the benefits are so hidden by the like marketing lingo.

1247
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,860
I'm like, did I just not know?

1248
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,360
I mean, I guess I was younger and I wasn't paying as close attention.

1249
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,960
But simple simple is always the best for any of this stuff.

1250
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:04,860
And if we're like, yeah, summing up even by full like like when Fastpass debuted in the

1251
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,560
90s, it was like, oh, you go over and you get a little ticket and then the ticket says

1252
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,260
when to come back.

1253
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:09,860
That's great.

1254
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:11,060
Okay, got it done.

1255
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:17,360
Like that was what people liked the idea that now like Disney Disney whatever.

1256
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:17,760
It's Jeannie.

1257
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,960
Excuse me, Jeannie and Jeannie.

1258
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,260
Plus, it's like two different things, but they're almost the same.

1259
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,760
It's not simple anymore.

1260
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:30,860
And Lightning Lane, but but Lightning Lane is part of Jeannie Plus and but the one the

1261
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,960
Lightning Lanes that you pay for are not called anything.

1262
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,360
There's no Lightning Lane Plus, right?

1263
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,460
So that's a fourth thing.

1264
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,860
Really, isn't it?

1265
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,460
Yeah, it has no name.

1266
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,560
There's no service is nothing.

1267
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,560
It's like simple all of this stuff.

1268
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,160
They want to do.

1269
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,860
Honestly, it could they could do all of it is Jason saying like they could charge for

1270
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:51,260
things.

1271
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,060
They could do whatever.

1272
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:55,160
It's just that the it's complex at this point.

1273
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,760
Yeah, you just need a warehouse full of coders, not like a bunch of contractors, you

1274
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,760
know, doing it that you lay off after the thing launches.

1275
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,660
So then there's no upkeep on it.

1276
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,060
Yeah, this is my this is the this is the grand plan.

1277
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:15,060
This is what I've convinced myself of 18 months around to see there's another video.

1278
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,360
It's like, aren't you tired?

1279
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:20,460
Aren't you tired of the inconvenience?

1280
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:25,660
The maddening inconvenience of trying to manage Lightning Lanes and Fastpasses who has

1281
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,760
the time to keep track of all this stuff?

1282
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,860
Well, now there's GD double plus.

1283
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:34,860
It's like it's all fused into one and it's a hundred bucks per ticket.

1284
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:39,560
And it's like this does the cynical part of me really does feel like this is long con

1285
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:46,260
like bridging the gap to the full blown like way bigger up.

1286
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,060
Charles, I see it like University.

1287
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:48,860
This is a side.

1288
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:54,460
This is a this is a sort of a torture like you're being interrogated with loud music.

1289
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,160
Yeah, we've always paid.

1290
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,160
We've always paid for Fastpass access.

1291
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,360
We've always been at what we're doing.

1292
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:07,360
Yes, I I think honestly, and I haven't done a exhaustive search exhaustive search.

1293
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:11,360
We talked about on the other Magic Key episode about how there were a lot of rumors and

1294
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,560
like things Bob Chapek said about how like, you know, it's good.

1295
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,960
There's going to be a loyalty program coming back as far as annual passes.

1296
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,860
And it's like that language is very odd for annual passes.

1297
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,860
I do think you can see if we really want to look there's a long term plan here for all

1298
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:26,760
of this stuff.

1299
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:31,360
If you look hard enough of like, yes, it's what you're saying a couple hundred.

1300
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,760
But just pay us a couple hundred dollars and just skip by everybody else.

1301
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,760
Just wherever you want.

1302
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:41,760
Just yeah, like look, there's going to be a guy in front of the turnstile hand of 200

1303
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,560
bucks when you go in there and he'll he'll give you a little thing like a secret.

1304
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,260
Don't care.

1305
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,560
Don't feel like getting vaccinated.

1306
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,060
We get it.

1307
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:48,760
Just come on.

1308
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,360
It's give us a couple hundred bucks on the way in and you don't need to be back.

1309
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,060
Don't worry about it.

1310
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,160
Yeah, it's like sort of like it.

1311
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,560
Maybe we're all ending up.

1312
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:57,060
Yeah.

1313
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:59,760
In 10 years, the most money.

1314
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:04,160
Yeah, the ultimate plan is that go kiss Mark Twain.

1315
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:04,860
It's fine.

1316
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:05,860
Just get up there.

1317
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:08,460
Give us 200 bucks and kiss him on the lips, please.

1318
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:17,160
I think it is odd to me that why like Disney like Jeannie, I you would I would think you

1319
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,060
would call these two different things.

1320
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:22,460
I would think there would be like, oh, well, you know, on on the Disneyland app, you can

1321
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:22,960
like plan.

1322
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:28,160
It's called Plan My Day and you click on Plan My Day or help me with the day that thing

1323
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,260
plant tells you where to go and what's a good idea as far as wait times.

1324
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,860
And then there's then fast.

1325
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,660
It's fast pass on your phone now and it costs $15 for most things like I don't know

1326
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:43,060
why the why lose the fast pass that introducing more brand.

1327
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,760
That's what I confused about where it's like.

1328
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,260
Yeah.

1329
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:50,360
People know what it means, but I mean, I recognize it's not 1999 anymore.

1330
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,360
People are more savvy with their phones.

1331
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:58,060
Not everyone is more savvy, though, but there was a brochure, a scan of like an old marketing

1332
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:03,460
brochure going around recently on Twitter, you know, one of the accounts that posts like

1333
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,060
old pictures of the parks and stuff.

1334
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:11,360
And it it was it wasn't called like the big ticket, but it was something like that where

1335
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,860
it's like get the big ticket.

1336
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:19,160
It gets you access to all the theme parks, both water parks, Pleasure Island.

1337
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,260
That was it.

1338
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:23,460
It was like, you know, a three page thing.

1339
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,860
It was so simple.

1340
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:31,360
It took like two pictures to the full scan and it's just like, oh man, we are far from

1341
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,560
1999 because there's just so many terms.

1342
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,060
There's just so much.

1343
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,660
Yeah, it's like you literally go like if like somebody who doesn't know anything fast

1344
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,260
going in like where's FastPass?

1345
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,060
Oh, FastPass.

1346
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:42,860
You have to pay for it.

1347
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:43,560
It's on your phone now.

1348
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:44,360
Got it.

1349
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:44,960
Okay.

1350
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,460
Like the overthink.

1351
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,760
I feel like the epitome of overthink of modern Disney is the Millennium Falcon ride.

1352
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,960
And I've probably said this before where it's like awesome.

1353
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,060
A big video game where you get to fly the Millennium Falcon.

1354
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:57,660
Awesome.

1355
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:57,960
Okay.

1356
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,560
But every all six people are going to want an equal job.

1357
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,060
All right.

1358
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:01,460
Got it.

1359
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:01,760
Okay.

1360
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,160
Well, there should be one pilot, right?

1361
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,760
No, no, there should be two pilots.

1362
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,060
One gets to go left and right.

1363
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:06,860
One goes up and down.

1364
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,960
Oh, well, that sucks.

1365
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,160
Why would you do that?

1366
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,860
Somebody should just be able to go up and down.

1367
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,660
That's a person on the right.

1368
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:15,160
It's really going to want to have the same transformative experience.

1369
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:15,760
Okay.

1370
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:16,860
I guess so.

1371
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:17,160
Fine.

1372
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:17,560
Split it up.

1373
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:17,860
All right.

1374
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:18,560
There should be Gunners.

1375
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,660
They should be able to aim right and shoot at the thing.

1376
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:21,960
No, they shouldn't.

1377
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,460
There should just be three buttons because it has to be simple for anyone to be able to use.

1378
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:28,060
So it should be intuitive and you should just have three buttons.

1379
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:28,960
Okay, but they can't aim.

1380
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,860
No, they cannot aim because it's too hard.

1381
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:37,160
It's like that's this is what's going on in a boardroom and you're like it's got one person shoots.

1382
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,560
They can aim at the thing.

1383
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,460
One person controls like satisfying for someone.

1384
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,460
Yeah, experience.

1385
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:47,860
Meanwhile, is my six my three year old screaming because you couldn't reach the handle.

1386
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,160
I feel just like Hanan.

1387
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:52,760
Julia.

1388
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,260
This is transported.

1389
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,660
Look, it's not.

1390
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,760
She doesn't have the spending power that a 37 year old does.

1391
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,760
Okay, so the 37 year old has to reach the controls.

1392
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,060
I think what they need.

1393
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,760
I mean all these technology technology offerings.

1394
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:09,660
They need to take an elevator to another floor.

1395
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:17,060
And it's like I need the 20 biggest Luddites in these two department like get me the least technologically advanced people in.

1396
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,260
Dumbest dudes get me the oldest people here.

1397
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:32,960
We're going to unleash them in the parks with the beta version of these things and see what what happens where the you know, what's the catastrophe level here?

1398
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:36,260
You know, I don't know how I really don't know how.

1399
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:40,660
Regular sane people will be able to process.

1400
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:51,260
It's like I I love doing this and when I take a group of people, it's always like boy, you know, you know, we could do this and you know, get over here this time and I'll be just we don't know how you without you and for to me.

1401
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:53,460
It's like you guys are just being nice at this way.

1402
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:54,560
Like, I don't know.

1403
01:11:54,860 --> 01:12:01,260
I don't know how you do it without someone to like take your hand and show you the the old ways to get through the park.

1404
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:04,660
Yeah, well, the screens that you look at are like in this video.

1405
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:07,560
The screens that they show you of this app are so complicated.

1406
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:12,360
There's so many different sizes of text and window and like times and arrows.

1407
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,060
Video doesn't make it look easy.

1408
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,860
Like it looks like in the video about how easy it is.

1409
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,060
Yeah, whole point of it.

1410
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:27,760
I yeah, I know and and now I think that like yeah, because I think we've all been in the seat of being the person who gets it.

1411
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,160
I can get us around and I'll get us on the things.

1412
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:30,760
So don't worry.

1413
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:31,460
I got it.

1414
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:35,260
And now we're all going to be like we're defusing bombs and it's just flop sweating.

1415
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:35,760
I don't know.

1416
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,060
Stop.

1417
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:36,960
You're looking at me.

1418
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:38,060
There's an okay.

1419
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:41,860
There's an update for the app and there's also an iOS update.

1420
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,460
If I don't update my operating system, the app's not going to work.

1421
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,760
The Wi-Fi is still 2011 levels in all of these parks.

1422
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,960
It's all your numbers off your cards.

1423
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:57,160
Let me scan your bar codes while you're trying to do your plan.

1424
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,860
There is an all-knowing robot.

1425
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:00,760
Your pocket like you should turn left now.

1426
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,160
There's not much ride at the frozen yogurt stand.

1427
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:04,760
Come on.

1428
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,860
You didn't know family love frozen yogurt.

1429
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:10,260
It's like you got someone kibitzing like second guessing you with every step.

1430
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,360
Did you prepay for my frozen yogurt without asking me?

1431
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,460
I did.

1432
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,260
Yes, I did.

1433
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,760
Yeah, Jack Nicholson.

1434
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,060
Are you was that you?

1435
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,560
I I'm pretty your lactose intolerant, but I think you're just whining.

1436
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,260
Okay, sheenie.

1437
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:28,660
I'll work and no frozen yogurt for a dull day.

1438
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,460
Did you just order four more?

1439
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,860
Yeah, you should treat the guys next to you.

1440
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,460
Time to tank up.

1441
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,360
What a mission space later.

1442
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,360
Sheenie, I didn't get an entree.

1443
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,860
You just ordered me four sides of Alfredo dipping sauce.

1444
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,660
You don't want to miss these apps.

1445
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,060
I'm shoving it in your mouth now.

1446
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:48,860
That's right.

1447
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,860
Now the app can do that open wide.

1448
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,660
You could be vegan at home.

1449
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:56,060
Time to party.

1450
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,160
Did you book me a night at the All-Star?

1451
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,460
We're already staying at the Contemporary.

1452
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:05,060
Yeah, but if what if you wanted a second hotel room, just in case.

1453
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,860
What if you meet somebody's if you want to cheat on your wife?

1454
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,260
You're strange.

1455
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:14,460
I've been looking at your vet, your browser history.

1456
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:20,760
I know you've been you've had a I'm monitoring the pheromones of the women around you.

1457
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:24,260
I've noticed some of them are feeling slightly amorous.

1458
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,660
Searching for singles in your area.

1459
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,860
You look in your partner's eyes all the time.

1460
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:33,560
But when was the last time you really saw each other?

1461
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,360
He never had a friend like me.

1462
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:42,060
Then you show up and it is your wife like yeah, I came to for the exact same reason.

1463
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,060
She told me how to meet the man of my dreams.

1464
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,960
It's the pina colada song setting.

1465
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:46,760
Yeah, that's right.

1466
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:47,260
She is.

1467
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:48,660
She needs good now.

1468
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:50,460
She needs bringing people back together.

1469
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:54,460
That'll be $800 for reading.

1470
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:55,260
I think you're married.

1471
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:58,960
Why did you make me live the David Fincher movie the game?

1472
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,160
I just wanted to go to Epcot.

1473
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,960
You appreciate your life more now.

1474
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,960
I want to come back in one year.

1475
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,160
Well, actually, I do have a trip planned for you're still not going to ride Ratatouille.

1476
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,160
Sorry lines too long.

1477
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,060
Oh my God.

1478
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:17,860
What a journey.

1479
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,560
What a journey through this insane thing.

1480
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,760
Any closing thoughts about this or are we like, I don't know.

1481
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,260
Are you going to well look Justin after all this?

1482
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:27,960
Are you going to do it?

1483
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,360
Are you going to do you're going to go with a family?

1484
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,660
Are you going to you're going to try to make heads or tails out of this thing?

1485
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,060
I feel like no matter I'm not going to do I will try anything right because it went on

1486
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:44,660
it but like I can't see it being like I can't see like myself trusting me the algorithm.

1487
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:46,760
I really I may you know, I don't know.

1488
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,860
May I I'll try it but I can't imagine I will pay for the Genie Plus obviously and in terms

1489
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:54,060
of like the surge price.

1490
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:54,960
I don't know man.

1491
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:55,460
I don't know.

1492
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:55,960
I don't know.

1493
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,060
That's that's a yeah, bro.

1494
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:00,560
They should have a list out yet of what is surge and what is not.

1495
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,060
Yes for the Genie Plus.

1496
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,960
They should just tack it on for vacation.

1497
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,760
If you if you are buying park tickets and you're staying on site, they should just give

1498
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,960
it away to anyone who does that for like you get people used to it.

1499
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,060
I think I saw theme park insider at Disney Tour spot.

1500
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:20,560
Someone suggested this and it's like that's how you get people to adopt this and see if

1501
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,260
it really works.

1502
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:25,660
It's just or if you like Vacation Club or you know, those people who are like already.

1503
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:30,060
Yeah, die the wool like give it give it to the Vacation Club people like that's that's

1504
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:36,160
how you're going to get people on board and also like they've taken away some like they

1505
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,360
took away free parking.

1506
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,360
They've taken away so many perks.

1507
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:43,060
You may as well at least try giving them something, you know.

1508
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:49,560
Yeah, I think that like Jeannie like I obviously like we're going to test Jeannie

1509
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,960
Plus there are just usually regular Jeannie thoroughly, you know in the coming.

1510
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,260
I don't know when is it is in the fall.

1511
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:56,660
They haven't announced the date yet, right?

1512
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:57,260
At farm.

1513
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:02,860
So that could be anytime Jeannie versus Carlson Jeannie versus Carlson is going to be the name

1514
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:03,360
of the episode.

1515
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:03,860
Thank you.

1516
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:06,260
Hey, yeah, that's good.

1517
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:09,660
Jason's Jason say yeah, it isn't it is like it's like deep blue.

1518
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,860
It's like I'm going to try to beat the chess program.

1519
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,660
That was Jason's joke.

1520
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:18,660
So I'm going to test it out.

1521
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:25,260
I do suspect that is not going to be a thorough thoroughly helpful program.

1522
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:31,160
I do suspect that is Jason said it's going to be glitchy and buggy and I can't imagine

1523
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,160
it's going to let's should we make a prediction?

1524
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,160
Do we think Jeannie lasts?

1525
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,960
Oh, yeah, I think it lasts.

1526
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,860
I think it lasts because they put so much money into it.

1527
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,160
I guess you're right.

1528
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,960
I just wonder if it's a real but last says Jeannie.

1529
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,260
Is it a rebranded thing within the next five years?

1530
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,260
Oh, I don't know.

1531
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:55,860
I mean, remember that mass in like 2014 or 2013.

1532
01:17:55,860 --> 01:18:01,660
There was a massive like time or New York Times profile about like we built a data center

1533
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:06,260
to manage the new my Disney experience and like someone told us a couple of years ago,

1534
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:08,860
like, oh, yeah, we moved out of there ages ago.

1535
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:09,860
It got way too big.

1536
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:15,860
And so that program didn't even last like 10 years as it was.

1537
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:19,160
So yeah, I feel like it'll be vestigial.

1538
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,660
Like it's some like they'll leave it there, but it'll be like one of those there's things

1539
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:27,660
in the app now or if you open it, it's like like lights came on and the roaches with scabies

1540
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:30,760
scuttering on the like nobody's supposed to be here.

1541
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,360
Get out.

1542
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,060
There's something for you here.

1543
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:33,360
Yes.

1544
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,460
So I'm skeptical that that's going to be a really good thing.

1545
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,960
And then as far as like Jeannie, plus Jeannie, plus is a similar situation where magic keys

1546
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,860
where you're like Jeannie, plus is just Max Pass, but you don't have all the rides.

1547
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,860
So like that seems straightforward.

1548
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:52,660
I guess at least I just I would just again, like to see the rides that are not going to

1549
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:56,160
be included before I know if it's like worth it to buy.

1550
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:59,660
Yeah, I don't think we're going to have a choice in the matter because I do think I

1551
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:04,660
do think Disney Jeannie is going to install himself and pay for himself on all of our

1552
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,360
phones and then go back.

1553
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:12,160
And then once he's in our phones, erase this episode and make us say only good things

1554
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:12,960
about him.

1555
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,260
That's probably right.

1556
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:18,460
Yes, he'll he can create podcast episodes in full podcast.

1557
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:20,660
I'm so with our voices.

1558
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,960
Yeah, is a perfect system.

1559
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,560
I should have said this before, but like this does jive like a lot of what Disney

1560
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,860
management seems to be focused on now under shape.

1561
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:34,060
I guess like they don't actually there's so many people who are like, oh, that's it.

1562
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:34,660
I'm not going.

1563
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:35,460
I'm done with this.

1564
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:36,260
They don't care.

1565
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:39,460
Like Disney does not want more people to come to the park.

1566
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:43,360
They want the people who come to the park to spend more money like they don't they're

1567
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,960
not having any problems getting people to come to the right.

1568
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,660
That's why I think the speed like the attractions and stuff is slowed down because like they

1569
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,360
don't they don't need to draw people in.

1570
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,760
They need to just milk those people that are there for more cash.

1571
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,760
And as you said earlier, the people who tweet I am never going again are lying.

1572
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:03,160
They're actually they're treating it from the bus going there at that moment.

1573
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:08,760
They're in a full time, though, three piece suit eating like course number six at

1574
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12,660
Victoria and Albert's and like this is the last time I swear to God.

1575
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:17,360
I can barely get this tweet out there with all this Alfredo sauce.

1576
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:23,060
I own I look I have this tuxedo for another day and yeah, I'm coming back for lunch

1577
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:23,760
tomorrow.

1578
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:29,160
Okay, real quick guys, just because I know we're going to be wrapping up soon and I

1579
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,060
just thought was the best.

1580
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,860
Do you see the DJ that they had at on Main Street?

1581
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:35,760
I didn't get to watch people out of Disney World.

1582
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,160
No, no, no.

1583
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,460
Wait, what was this all about?

1584
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:43,060
If I drop you know what if I drop a link to a video in chat, would you be able to see

1585
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,060
it with that water?

1586
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:44,960
I could pull it up.

1587
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,360
Yeah.

1588
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:46,060
Yeah.

1589
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:46,260
Okay.

1590
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:46,560
Hold on.

1591
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:51,460
Okay, great because the audio is well, it's indiscernible, but it's it's really it's

1592
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:52,060
really choice.

1593
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:52,860
Got Twitter.

1594
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:53,960
We this is Mickey view.

1595
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:54,660
This is your guy.

1596
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:55,860
You were saying you like Mickey.

1597
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:59,660
You guys, my guys, you know, roll with a fantastic blog.

1598
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,260
I got a career.

1599
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:07,460
Here's here's your guy Mickey views and this is a DJ up at the train station as you're

1600
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,660
leaving the Magic Kingdom.

1601
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:14,760
Nostalgic beautiful like Main Street exit and this dude is it like a backwards black

1602
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,960
ball cap and looks like a tech crew for Van Halen.

1603
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:19,660
This is this dude.

1604
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:19,960
Sure.

1605
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:39,460
He's doing a raise the roof now in 2021.

1606
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:40,860
He's raising the roof.

1607
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,960
Happy Bar Mitzvah Brandon.

1608
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,660
You are a man today.

1609
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:48,860
We're all celebrating nights.

1610
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,360
This poor dude.

1611
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:54,760
Someone puts up this video of like, can you believe this the literal next day?

1612
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,960
There is a report from another site where this guy set up his equipment.

1613
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:01,460
Someone came and said something to him.

1614
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,560
He disassembled the equipment and it's not been back.

1615
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,360
Literally less than like three days before they knew.

1616
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,060
No one likes it.

1617
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:11,660
No one likes it.

1618
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,460
This is like that.

1619
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:16,460
We learned about this thing when the Mighty Ducks hockey team was owned by Disney.

1620
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:21,760
There was a halftime performer named Iceman who is a guy painted white who like played

1621
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,760
a keytar and got people pumped up to Gary Glitter and then he was just fired that first

1622
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:29,360
That's even this there's even less than ice man.

1623
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:33,360
This is the least committed to character in Disney history because he doesn't even have

1624
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:33,960
a name.

1625
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,060
He's just black shirt DJ.

1626
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:38,660
Get him up.

1627
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,060
Get him up.

1628
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:45,960
Ten o'clock at night and my child hates me and my wife hates me and I'm sweating everywhere.

1629
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,560
I'm not going to get them up.

1630
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,160
You you all said you wanted us to be more like Universal.

1631
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:51,860
Okay.

1632
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,660
What do you want?

1633
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:59,660
It's usually like Mickey and Minnie and goof like a waving gently as soft music plays.

1634
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:01,260
Yeah, exactly.

1635
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:05,160
You feel like you feel this a nice little feeling in your stomach and then you can't

1636
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:05,760
make it out of the video.

1637
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,460
But this dude was also like directing people to where their boats were to get back to their

1638
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:12,460
resorts like if you're a wilderness lodge, you're going to take a right.

1639
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:12,860
Come on.

1640
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:13,260
Get him up.

1641
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:13,760
You're going to be a bitch.

1642
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,560
Stand 17.

1643
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:24,160
Just just distorted Al City music playing as a guy in stage crew black screams at you

1644
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,160
that the monorail is not operational.

1645
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,860
There are extra buses running.

1646
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:31,160
I don't want to I don't want to see any of you lie and say that you're staying in the

1647
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,860
contemporary to use it as an uber or lift pool.

1648
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:35,860
Please do not do that.

1649
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:40,560
Okay.

1650
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,260
Well, you know what?

1651
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:41,960
Hey everybody.

1652
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,760

Justin put him up.

1663
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,860
Hey, let's take us through the gift shop.

1664
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:58,060
Is there anything that you would like to plug?

1665
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:07,860
We got to have you got a McElroy dot family.

1666
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:10,860
All the stuff that we make is there so you can go see it all.

1667
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,560
That's where the whole tree branches out from from that.

1668
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,660
Yeah, we were going to have some live shows to plug.

1669
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,360
Now we don't have those to plug.

1670
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,460
So I got nothing to plug.

1671
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:22,660
So just go to that website and listen to my content.

1672
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:27,260
Well, if you're excited about the live shows then put them down.

1673
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:29,960
Who?

1674
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,260
Well, just thanks for reaching out.

1675
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,160

1682

1683
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:09,060
Could it be?

1684
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:10,760
There could be more things coming.

1685
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:11,360
