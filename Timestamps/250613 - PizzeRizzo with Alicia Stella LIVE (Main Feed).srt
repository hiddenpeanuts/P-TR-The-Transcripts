1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Warning!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The following podcast will be heard by the live audience and no one else

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
because we left our Zoom recorder in the locker for Tron Lightcycle Run.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
One of your hosts may weep involuntarily due to the recent closure of Jelly Rolls.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
To honor this fallen angel, most of our show will consist of group sing-alongs of Bad Bad Leroy Brown.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
One of your hosts may weep involuntarily due to the recent closure of Mama Melrose.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
To honor this fallen angel, he will spend the show slowly gumming a giant sausage.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And now, live from Icon Park, right next to a lot of very dangerous looking rides,

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
it's Podcast The Ride!

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That was a lot of rigmarole, wow!

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
A standing ovation because it is standing room for some of you.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A forced standing ovation.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's going on, everybody?

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a live podcast endeavor that now requires the abandonment of three children.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Three now!

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Back at home!

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
My daughter is potty training currently, and from what I hear, it's not going well.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I'm not dealing with it right now, but I will be.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You will come home to bathrooms full of pee on the ground.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You'll slip and slide as soon as you walk in the door.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, I will be soaked in pee.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ground stickiness will only be beer that has fallen here at Tin Roof Orlando.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey, everybody, thank you for coming.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hello, Orlando.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We're back!

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Was anyone here last time?

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A couple years ago, a lot of you were here last time.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We are thrilled to be back.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We've been dying to be back.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My name is Scott Gertner.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hi, everyone.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Over here we have...

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
My name is Mike Carlson.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And I'm Jason Sheridan.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Or as you can see, I should say Jason Bourne.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's right, folks, I'm fully stuntacular-pilled.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going all in.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Throughout the show, maybe I'll just turn to you and say, oh, my God, that's Jason Bourne.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
As they do in all of the movies.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, well, for anyone listening, if we've managed to find a way to record it,

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
you are wearing a Bourne's Stuntacular hat.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're wearing a Bourne's Stuntacular shirt.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Is there a Bourne's Stuntacular underwear that we are not familiar with?

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Unfortunately not, and they really got an earful when I realized there was not.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I realized I left my Bourne's Stuntacular water bottle backstage

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and my Bourne's Stuntacular pin back at the hotel so I would not lose it.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Those are precious items.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You've got to keep track of those.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Everybody's feeling good.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're stuntacular-pilled.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm pumped.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I pre-gamed at Cafe Tutu Tango down the street.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Are there fans of Cafe Tutu Tango here?

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Wow.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, I know I'm in the right place.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I will have to explain this to some people if you aren't familiar.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is a chain that used to be a chain and now seemingly is only here on iDrive,

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
which is the case for a lot of chains, it seems.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's the place where they go to die.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But like 30 years, chains get retirement in one little box.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It is a place where you can have sangria next to a little painting

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
of Dave Chappelle as Rick James.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I had a lot of fun there.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I had extremely expensive okay tapas,

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and I want to share my Cafe Tutu Tango love with you.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is there anybody here?

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's do this thing.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Who thinks that they may have come from the furthest to be here tonight?

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Does anybody shout something out?

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You were first with the LA.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You came as far as we did, and you aren't one of the LA people who came with us.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Join us on stage really fast.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I got something for you.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Hello.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Wow.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thanks for being here.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hello.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Nice to meet you.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
My name is Anna.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hello, Anna, and I'm sorry that I shoved the mic in your face in such an aggressive way.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What's your name?

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Anna.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You got the answer right.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Here's what I have for you.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Excellent delusion and not scary farm, a great vest.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Wow.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So for coming all of this way across the country from a place where we do live shows sometimes,

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
but for being here with us tonight, I appreciate it.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Anna, and you get done by a Cafe Tutu Tango artist

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
because there's artists working in there by Kayla Maria Alves,

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
a print of an oil painting of Chucky.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh my goodness.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Thank you.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thank you so much for doing.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Absolutely.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Thank you, Anna.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Thank you for coming.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Appreciate it.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Frame that.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Put that above your bed.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Put it on your ceiling, looking down at you like a mirrored ceiling.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And when you see Chucky's scarred face, think of us.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Wow.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So excited to be here.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So yeah, hey, we've been in our favorite place.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We've been in the place that we talk about all damn day every day,

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and it always feels good.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think it's safe to say that there is never a time that we are happier

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and more engaged and excited to be doing this podcast than when we are here in Orlando, Florida.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you so much for having us and for being here.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And every time we come, we meet more people, we make more friends.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It truly is like such a heartwarming affair, and we really love to do it.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How are you guys feeling?

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You feeling as good as I am, Post Tutu Tango?

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, I'm feeling so good.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I bought a fanny pack that said Florida on it.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Step one to moving.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Step one to moving.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If you just start filling, if everything you own starts to say Florida,

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
it will just be more cost effective to make the move.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Right, because currently all my stuff says California.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So it would make sense that I would have to switch states.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's how it works.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's how we all live.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Items that you own, you represent your state.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Jason, and I haven't even, I didn't see yesterday.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You've got to catch me up on some stuff.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How you feeling here in your favorite place?

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Pretty good, yeah.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's not the best place in the world for someone with heat sensitivity

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
at the start of June.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But you may do because the state is full of industrial air conditioning.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So hanging in there.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You know, Scott, this is the second trip where I've navigated the parks

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
with an ECV scooter.

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes, indeed.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Jason is scooting.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're on wheels.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I am scooting, and I've learned a lot doing that.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Now, last time we were here, I had a top five list

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
of the most reactionary t-shirts I encountered.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And other than Jane spotting a preteen boy wearing a shirt

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:36,000
that said Jesus won, which I don't know that was really his thing, you know?

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't know that he was really trying to win.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Won what?

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's unclear.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The 2024 election?

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm worried that's what it means.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah, so, but I did come up with a top five list of observations

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I've accrued navigating the parks with an ECV scooter.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
May I share it with you all?

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's perfect because I'm on stage, my audio is amplified,

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and you are in the audience.

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You have no choice.

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
All right, top five observations touring the parks on an ECV.

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Number five, when you are resting your hands like this on a scooter all day,

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
you may get a sunburn on the back of your hand.

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh, no.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Don't worry, it's faded and peeling now.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Wait, did you not sunblock the back of your hand?

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Did you not have any lotion just because it's a place you don't necessarily put lotion on?

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I think I put on gobs of suntan lotion.

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I just probably real quick rubbed the back of my hands not thinking.

169
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You need biker gloves, fingerless biker gloves, studded spikes perhaps like Anna is wearing,

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
denim, let's figure out a place so you can get some stuff.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Sorry to cut you off.

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Number four, I no longer like cobblestones as a design choice.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Number three, when a thunderstorm breaks out,

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
make sure to cover the control panel or the device will stop functioning.

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No, were you on top of a very tall hill or something?

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No, that's what we learned like last time, the one day it rained, so I was prepared this time.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay, good. You've learned already.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Also, you very quickly realize when a thunderstorm breaks out

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and there's lightning in the area, you are sitting on top of hundreds of pounds of metal.

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't think too hard about that one.

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Number two, you will have some interesting interactions.

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Like when I was looking at shirts in the Tower of Terror gift shop

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and a child briefly leaned over my arm.

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I did not notice this, but the mother said, honey, stop leaning over people to look at things.

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And I very politely said, oh, no worries, because I hadn't really noticed.

186
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And the mother responded very curtly, yes, worries.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So I've been just walking around, scooting around for a few days, muttering yes, worries to myself.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's my mantra all the time.

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And the number one thing, all handicapped stalls can fit an ECV if you have the will.

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So that's my top five for this.

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Very good. Thank you so much.

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Wow. Excellent.

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I wish we had a Paul Schaefer to play jazz out of that talk show bit.

195
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is the one live show where Paul Schaefer is not in attendance for us.

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Are you sure? Are you out there somewhere?

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
To that kids scolding thing, there's always that thing in theme.

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But you are watching absolute meltdowns occur at all times.

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I had a great meltdown I thought was worth sharing.

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This wasn't even in the heat of a park.

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This was checking into a hotel where it was very air conditioned,

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
but a very normal kind of fight between two kids broke out.

203
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And the mom was being very polite to the concierge or whatever.

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And then all of a sudden turned around and said, I don't need two kids fighting right now.

205
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You're going to end up in Disney jail.

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I witnessed someone going, I'm done.

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,000
OK, I'm done in a park at nine in the morning.

208
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Look, the heat drives people nuts.

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You know, you go a little nuts when it's hot enough, you know.

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But, you know, not us.

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's the getting to be like to feel like among the people who are having the least amount of breakdowns,

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
who are having some of the most fun, which is what I feel about all the folks here.

213
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I think I like this group.

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Where are the theme park fans who are enjoying it the most?

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And I think we've run into some of you folks over the course of the last.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Wait, wait, make some noise if we've seen you, if we met you at some point.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, great, great.

218
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Hopefully meet more of you later.

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But, you know, I think we met some of you in a very specific spot.

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And that maybe takes us into the topic of tonight's show.

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because, you know, we always want to be in Orlando.

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We want to be in Orlando as often as possible.

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We sure do.

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Easy outlaw, easy. Not yet.

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Makes me feel real good is all.

226
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Orlando Mike is coming out.

227
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Orlando Mike's hopping right out of that fanny pack.

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The fanny pack is very pro wrestler core.

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So it's really, it's adding to the aesthetic in a lot of ways.

230
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm becoming my true form.

231
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He's going to be unleashed over the course of the night.

232
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But with this, you know, we always want to be here.

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But this felt like a time where it was like we had to come.

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It was a calling. It was our duty.

235
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Because it's been a very exciting month in theme parkdom.

236
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
There's a lot of stuff that I think we're all thinking about.

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
A lot of very exciting changes in the last couple of weeks.

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Some things have occurred.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Some recent news has happened.

240
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There are things happening that are certainly going to have an epic

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
sized impact on the Orlando theme park universe.

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Wouldn't you say?

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I am talking, of course, about the closure of Muppets Courtyard.

244
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yep. Yep.

245
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I heard some boos.

246
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let's make sure those boos are for the concept and not for us.

247
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You know, get your boos out, right?

248
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We should do it, boo!

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hold on, I have a question.

250
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Is anyone in the room happy it's closing?

251
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Hey!

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We got one! We got one!

253
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You motherfucker!

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Get that motherfucker out of here!

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Get him out of here!

256
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Enjoy your door coaster.

257
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That guy really loves Star Wars.

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What the hell is that waiting area?

259
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The launch bay?

260
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The launch bay. He loves it.

261
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He's glad launch bay is safe.

262
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
No, that's right.

263
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They finally heard everybody's complaints about Disney's Hollywood studios.

264
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We want there to be less to do.

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Shut down a bunch of stuff.

266
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
As we record, I feel like we were here and designed this to be here for history.

267
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We were recording this on Sunday, June 8th, 2025.

268
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
On Saturday, June 7th, 2025, just yesterday,

269
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Muppet Vision 3D ran its final show after 34 years in the park.

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
A sad affair, an emotional affair.

271
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
How many people were there for it?

272
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
How many people got to see it yesterday?

273
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
One last time, yes.

274
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And that's a sad thing, definitely.

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But it puts us in a bind.

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We've already done an episode about Muppet Vision 3D.

277
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Might feel repetitive to do it again.

278
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There is something, dare I say was something.

279
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm still getting used to it.

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm not excited to say it.

281
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There was something in Muppet's courtyard that we have not done an episode about.

282
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Something that has been...

283
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes, Jason?

284
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Fountain.

285
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Fountain, and that's it.

286
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It is the fountain.

287
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Fountain.

288
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No, it's a little bit bigger than that.

289
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It was something of an establishment.

290
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It is something that has been the subject of debate on podcasts, The Ride,

291
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
for a number of years.

292
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What is it, you ask, if you haven't figured it out already?

293
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why, let me tell you.

294
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's rat pizza.

295
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I am seeing...

296
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Got a jacket right there.

297
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Jackets already.

298
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay.

299
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Hey.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We chose right.

301
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Good pick.

302
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh, boy.

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
All right.

304
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So tonight, it is happening.

305
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You are here for the very day after its burial.

306
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
A salute to all of Muppet's courtyard, but mostly Pizza Rizzo.

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That is our show this evening.

308
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Okay.

309
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
All right.

310
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm glad we...

311
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
See, we debated this a lot.

312
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What topic do we do?

313
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Wait, hold on.

314
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hold on.

315
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, a change.

316
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
A change is happening.

317
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's coming out.

318
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Strip, strip, strip.

319
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Jason, strip, strip.

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah.

321
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I see Beaker.

322
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Beaker was a peeker.

323
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I bought this shirt 26 years ago when they bothered to open the store in Muppet's courtyard.

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They weren't selling a shirt yesterday.

325
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, yeah.

326
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What the hell happened there?

327
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
There was not a goodbye shirt.

328
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I read somewhere that there was a goodbye shirt offered for Ellen's Energy Adventure,

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
but not for the Muppets.

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What lends itself to shirts better?

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,000
All of the Muppets or a weird rotting animatronic that didn't look like Ellen in the first place?

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Speaking of shirts and such, please raise your hand or make some noise if you are currently wearing Muppet memorabilia of some kind.

333
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Pretty good.

334
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Wow, wow.

335
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Not even knowing that that's where this was headed.

336
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Can I ask this question?

337
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I hate to keep derailing, but is anyone here wearing any Aerosmith merchandise?

338
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I assume that means everyone because no one raised their hand.

339
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's assumed they all have something on their person.

340
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's all the underwear.

341
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's stuff we can't see.

342
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's thongs.

343
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, yeah.

344
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What if they used to sell a thong at the Rock and Roller Coaster gift shop?

345
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It was 99, baby.

346
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It was a different time.

347
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
One little story from yesterday, now that you bring up Aerosmith, is we did what might be, that's a little scary,

348
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
it could be Mike's final ride with the Bad Boys of Boston on the Rock and Roller Coaster,

349
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
because they're being replaced by the Muppets.

350
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Now let's boo the Muppets.

351
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Boo!

352
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We can have it both ways.

353
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No, you maybe did your last Rock and Roller Coaster with Aerosmith.

354
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Probably, yeah.

355
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So that was your emotional affair.

356
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Right at the exit, we decided to take a photo with a photo that is up as you make your way out of the ride of the full lineup of Aerosmith.

357
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I told Mike, stand next to that.

358
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And right at that moment, somebody walked by and said, hey, there's the tastemaker.

359
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah!

360
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
There's your proof.

361
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, yeah. Duh.

362
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Mike's like, yeah, that was the one time you saw it.

363
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It happens to me 10 times a day.

364
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It happens all the time.

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
When you're not around.

366
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay, no, but we're here to talk about, I mean, Pizza Rizzo, but I think there's maybe a little bit to say about.

367
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So folks here got to see Muppet Vision one last time.

368
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Would you say that you got sort of like a bit of a rowdy audience where people like, people making noise, talking a lot?

369
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I feel like my friend Andrew is here.

370
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He did one right before the one we went to, and he said it's exciting because everybody is cheering all of the stuff.

371
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Then we got in there and no one cheered all of the stuff.

372
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It was deadly, deadly serious, so respectful.

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I had the gall to go, Sweetums came in.

374
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Should we not applaud for Sweetums like Kramer coming in?

375
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And I did a little golf clap, as did people in the row with me, and then it just went away.

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It just like went into the air.

377
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And now I'm hearing that in every other show, people were screaming for Sweetums.

378
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What happened?

379
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There's respect, and then there's too much respect.

380
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You all make as much goddamn noise as you want.

381
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's make it rowdy like Muppet Vision.

382
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Anyone want to cheer Sweetums right now?

383
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
There we go.

384
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Better.

385
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's for Sweetums.

386
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That's for Sweetums.

387
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's for Sweetums.

388
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Is there a member of Aerosmith you'd like to get a cheer?

389
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Careful, careful.

390
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Who's the least problematic of all of them?

391
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The least problematic?

392
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Joey Kramer.

393
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah.

394
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They don't make Joey Kramer's coffee anymore.

395
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The drummer of Aerosmith had a coffee for a couple years, and now he doesn't do it anymore.

396
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He doesn't sell coffee anymore.

397
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
See, this is the effect you had.

398
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You said Joey Kramer, and I immediately, part of my mind went, does he have coffee or does he have a whiskey?

399
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And this is what you've infected my brain with, Tastemaker.

400
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Well, I'm not doing a very good job if you couldn't remember.

401
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I was 50-50.

402
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That was pretty good.

403
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
True, you did say coffee.

404
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Shall I take it back?

405
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I apologize.

406
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Eat notes, right?

407
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
W for whiskey, C for coffee.

408
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What else do celebrities have?

409
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Restaurants that are opening very slowly, like John Taffer down the street?

410
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, yeah.

411
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We'll be back here for that.

412
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We'll talk about that later.

413
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

414
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
There'll be no ends to the John T.

415
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
People will miss rides and theme parks so much when the one stupid Taffer restaurant opens.

416
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Anyways, but it's all a bummer, and I think it's really hard for me to imagine a Hollywood studios that doesn't have Muppet Vision 3D in it,

417
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
because, like, come along with me on this.

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Do you all have the memory of you are in the hotel room or you get the VHS because you're coming to Disney World soon,

419
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
or you're just watching a special on TV, and what do you see but the 3D and the letters are in your face,

420
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and then you see Fozzie and the pie, and the pie is literally coming out of the screen,

421
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and then it cuts to the audience, and the pie is flying over their head,

422
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and they are reaching up to it like dopes trying to touch the pie.

423
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm like, that's the perk to me.

424
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm going to miss that so much.

425
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And just as one commemorative thing, and maybe this is something we would all enjoy on this kind of mournful weekend,

426
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm going to get my phone out.

427
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Could I ask all of you to pretend that there is a giant pie in the sky above you?

428
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Let's do a little bit of live filmmaking, okay?

429
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay, you know what, actually, Mike, can you help me out?

430
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Can you just, like, you know, like the, you know, whenever, like, you know, Marmaduke is a tennis ball.

431
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Will you just point in a direction that you think everybody should be looking for the giant pie, okay?

432
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
All right, and your motivation is...

433
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

434
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah, yeah.

435
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Look at the Florida fanny pack.

436
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Okay, well, they already were.

437
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
They obviously already were.

438
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I know.

439
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Okay, and your motivation is there is a giant pie in the sky, and you're trying to touch it.

440
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay, okay, let's go here.

441
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'll go fish eye, so we fit a lot of people in.

442
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
All right, and action.

443
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Reach, reach.

444
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There we go.

445
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
There we go.

446
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Okay.

447
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Here, and then run all the way to the other side of the stage.

448
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Go, go, go.

449
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yes, good, good, good.

450
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Okay, okay, drop the mic.

451
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Very good.

452
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Okay.

453
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
All right, and now it drops and crushes all of you and you are dead.

454
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That was good, y'all.

455
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Wow.

456
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm not even doing that theme parkie.

457
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Give yourselves a round of applause.

458
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You all made a noise without me asking.

459
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That was awesome.

460
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That was nice.

461
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That was really good.

462
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
All right, I'm going to try to edit that as quick as I can.

463
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't know 3D imaging, but I'll try.

464
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
If you can help me out, maybe I can crowdsource it or something.

465
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I will try to get that up as soon as I can.

466
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Thank you for being great actors.

467
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay.

468
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Scott, would you be able to do a quick voiceover snippet just at the end

469
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
of Kissimmee St. Cloud, the center of the action?

470
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

471
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Can everybody make the sound of a bow going into a big target?

472
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
All right, here we go.

473
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Nope, nope, the arrow goes into the target.

474
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh, wait, no, no, isn't it a bow?

475
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I think it's a bow.

476
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I think I said the right thing.

477
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Okay, arrow.

478
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Here we go, three, two, one, arrow.

479
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Three, two, one.

480
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That was really good.

481
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, that was great.

482
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Thank you so much.

483
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Now do the bow going into the target.

484
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
All right, three, two, one.

485
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You all made a decision.

486
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You made a decision.

487
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You made it loud and clanky and clunky.

488
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
This is great.

489
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
This is a wonderful crowd.

490
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm very excited.

491
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Okay, anyway, let's shift over to Pizzarizzo, the reason that we are here.

492
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The Cliff Notes for anyone who doesn't know.

493
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Does anyone here not know Pizzarizzo?

494
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Dear, what a room we are in paradise.

495
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Deafening silence.

496
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Wow.

497
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
These are smart people.

498
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
This is our crowd.

499
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
This is great.

500
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
This is the most educated crowd I've ever encountered.

501
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
For any fools back at home, unaware, next to Muppet Vision 3D,

502
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
right around 2016, they kicked out a Pizza Planet restaurant

503
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
that didn't resemble the Pizza Planet from Toy Story in any way, shape, or form.

504
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And they put in a new restaurant that is a Muppet-owned restaurant

505
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
that is specifically owned by Rizzo the Rat.

506
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
This is the famous joke that you can see on the outside of it.

507
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
There's a neon sign.

508
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It says, the city's top-rated pizza.

509
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Sometimes some of the letters burn out, and all that is left is, it's rat pizza.

510
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The catchphrase of the place.

511
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I think that phrase is sticky.

512
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I think that's like a reason that this thing is burrowed into a lot of our brains.

513
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
But I think there's a lot of reasons it's burrowed into our brains,

514
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
partially like the debate that's gone on about it over the years.

515
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Why don't we just get a general, before we even hash out the debate.

516
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Fans of Pizza Rizzo.

517
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Not fans of Pizza Rizzo.

518
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Get these motherfuckers out of here!

519
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Go get Gordon Ramsay fish and chips!

520
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You can stay. I'm sorry, I just got mad.

521
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The fact that the audience is a little torn, that was a little more anti than I expected.

522
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That reflects a little bit that this has been a debate on our show since 2018.

523
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That was the first that I was trying to do the forensics of when we started talking about this and for how long.

524
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Let me just take you through what happened here.

525
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I think around that time, Mike took a trip to Disney World.

526
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
He made reference to popping into Pizza Rizzo.

527
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And with apologies, Mike, but I think you can take it because you're tough.

528
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You're Orlando Mike, you're outlaw. You can do it.

529
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You've got a big brave fanny pack and I think you can do it.

530
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm going to read something that you said about Pizza Rizzo.

531
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I was wrong. There he goes. He's all the way in the corner.

532
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Uh oh. Now you did it.

533
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
He's under the table. We cannot even see the fanny pack.

534
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Go ahead.

535
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Okay. I'll try to do it quickly.

536
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
This quote was said by Mike.

537
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's supposedly a Muppet themed pizzeria and there's barely anything that would let you know it's Muppets.

538
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
How do we feel about this?

539
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That wasn't, you know what? It's okay.

540
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That wasn't a deafening boo.

541
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It wasn't so bad.

542
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You survived. You did it.

543
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Was that it? Was it more?

544
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Look at that.

545
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Okay. Yes. Defend yourself. Defend yourself.

546
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Well, look.

547
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It was a quick trip.

548
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So maybe I didn't notice all the little details, you know?

549
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Maybe I didn't notice. Maybe I didn't go in the banquet room or the party room.

550
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Well, I believe that is exactly what happened.

551
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I think that you popped in there and you didn't go to the second floor,

552
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
which is kind of where the action is.

553
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's where the most theming is because really you just order downstairs

554
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and the food is not particularly, there's not like Muppet puns in the titles of the items or whatever.

555
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You go upstairs and that's where you see like, you know, brown derby style drawings of the characters

556
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and it's where you have the banquet room, which we'll talk about in a little bit.

557
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But that seems really like the heart of Pizzarizzo. Does that seem fairly accurate?

558
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Okay. Yeah. I thought maybe you'd get a cheer, but it didn't get a cheer.

559
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You don't have to.

560
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm tired. This has been a very interactive show so far.

561
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
No, it's just so fun. You know, usually it's just us in a room.

562
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
We don't get to point to a bunch of people and make them all yell a lot.

563
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Here we go. Yeah. See, I'm just addicted to it.

564
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Drunk with power, yeah.

565
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
That's right. And liquor.

566
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So, but here's where it went from just a statement that Mike made to a debate.

567
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
A friend of ours, Doug Jones. Oh, this wasn't even Doug on the show.

568
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
This was just he heard the episode and then texted Mike as soon as he possibly could,

569
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Pizzarizzo is good. Yeah.

570
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
He made his arguments there, but then he came on and made his arguments on the show.

571
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Here's something that he accused you of.

572
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
He said that you walked in, said this sucks, turned around and left.

573
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And he felt that you didn't really give it a chance.

574
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And from Doug Jones, that simple yet effective phrase, Pizzarizzo is good,

575
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I think, has resonated certainly with me.

576
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's something that I questioned and wondered.

577
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And like, do I agree with this statement?

578
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Will I ever agree with this statement?

579
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It also feels like, and I don't know, around this time, I also just started seeing it.

580
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I remember seeing Jack Black wearing a Pizzarizzo shirt not long after this.

581
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And I'm not saying our show did it because I don't think it did,

582
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
but it definitely felt like all of a sudden, like, maybe I unlocked, like,

583
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
my evil words unlocked some groundswell in general that swept the world,

584
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
because all of a sudden, I feel like the discourse was there

585
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and I was not aware of it before that.

586
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
For once, our words did not, like, just kill an aging character actor.

587
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Putting Pizzarizzo in the zeitgeist is much nicer, you know?

588
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I believe our words, from what I've read,

589
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
our words have recently killed one of the Hooters in the Orlando area.

590
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Our apologies if that's the one that you liked.

591
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And we, of course, hate all of them, boo, Hooters.

592
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We would never, you didn't tonight, did you, Mike?

593
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I swear to God, if you went and you're not telling me.

594
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Who thinks I went to Hooters tonight?

595
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
He would never tell you.

596
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I won't tell you.

597
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
He's worried you're going to throw your drinks at him.

598
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So that's one Hooters and potentially the most beloved cast member of Cheers.

599
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Actually, that is not correct, because the episode where we mentioned

600
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
George Wint was recorded before, but hasn't come out.

601
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's a question, how does the PTR curse work?

602
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
If it's in the can, but we haven't put it in front of you,

603
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
does that mean that we killed the actor?

604
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I refuse to accept that we killed George Wint.

605
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I will not take that.

606
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But what do you think? Did we do it?

607
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah, we recorded it like the day before.

608
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

609
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
For me? Was it Casamigos, did you say?

610
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Wow, Casamigos has arrived.

611
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Thank God bless you.

612
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Wow, Casamigos right on stage.

613
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Where'd that come from, point yourselves out?

614
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah, who sent that to me?

615
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
This is where the trouble for me is I haven't identified

616
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
enough specific brands of liquor to have it sent to me.

617
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You just sniffed that like you don't like it.

618
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
No, no, no, I was trying to act cool.

619
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
That's it, I could tell.

620
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Do you have your usual tiny shaker of salt hidden in your shoe heel?

621
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I have my little gun in the right shoe

622
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and my little shaker of salt in my left shoe.

623
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Your little gun in the shoe, you are turning Florida.

624
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I guess I've got to do it real quick.

625
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, do it.

626
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh, you shoot it, that was a shot, that was a shot.

627
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Wow, damn, lime in the mouth.

628
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Damn, dude, wow, wow.

629
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Well, how about that?

630
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You feel that tea rising?

631
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I do feel like my tea jumped 50 points.

632
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
They're points, that's not a level of...

633
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Orlando Mike, Orlando Mike's coming out.

634
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I was hoping they were coming up here to scold you.

635
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's like, oh no, what did Mike do?

636
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Well, we know what he did.

637
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
He didn't give Pizzarizzo full respect.

638
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And then you started noticing that a lot of people out there,

639
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
like Jones included, like Pizzarizzo.

640
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And something that we definitely have noticed

641
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
more and more as the years go on,

642
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
if Pizzarizzo is ever mentioned on the show,

643
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
we notice that one name is said,

644
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
of if you ever do Pizzarizzo on the show,

645
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
you need to have this person on the show.

646
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And the biggest obstacle to doing this was that we had not met her.

647
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This had not occurred yet, but now it has happened.

648
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
We met this person from the YouTube channel Park Stop

649
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and the podcast Park Talk.

650
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Please welcome Alicia Stella.

651
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Alicia Stella, everybody.

652
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yay.

653
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You know, it's amazing.

654
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
If anyone... Is this on?

655
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I think it is.

656
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
If anyone talks about Pizzarizzo for more than five minutes,

657
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I materialize at anywhere you are.

658
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Right. It's like, yes, Beetlejuice scenario situation.

659
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Pizzarizzo three times, here I am.

660
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Wow. Well, and we're so glad that you are.

661
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
This is a good excuse just to meet you in general.

662
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And we figured we might end up meeting you, you know,

663
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
just tonight right before the show,

664
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
but instead we ended up meeting you yesterday.

665
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And why is that? Where were you yesterday?

666
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That's the weirdest thing. I was in Pizzarizzo.

667
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Where was I in Pizzarizzo, by the way? Where did you find me?

668
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Well, you know, unlike, admittedly,

669
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
most days of this quick service pizza restaurant being open,

670
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
there was not a line and stanchions out the door

671
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
anticipating the crowds that were coming.

672
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But on this final day, there was a queue set up.

673
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
There was a rope drop for Pizzarizzo,

674
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
and who was not just in it, but number one in line,

675
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
but Alicia Stella.

676
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You know, it disappointed me, too,

677
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
that when I got there, there wasn't already a line

678
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
because I thought I was late. Oh.

679
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I thought there's got to be like 10, 15 people that are going to be there

680
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
because the park's been open for half an hour already.

681
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And no, I was first and I stayed first for another half hour.

682
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And I don't know if that's like testament to me or Pizzarizzo,

683
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
but that place was packed when you found me

684
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
at the back of the upstairs like a mafia boss eating spaghetti.

685
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm in that back booth.

686
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This is my restaurant.

687
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I can see clear across and seeing it full for the first

688
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and literally last time was magical, to be honest.

689
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Well, that mafia boss, you must have felt that way

690
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
because how many people came up to you?

691
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
How many people talked to you, recognized you?

692
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
This must have been, like, you really must have felt like you were in your element.

693
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I mean, it was next to the bathroom,

694
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
so I feel like people were accidentally finding me.

695
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You can't take credit for people needing to use the bathroom.

696
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
That doesn't have to happen.

697
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You are obviously very associated with Pizzarizzo.

698
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Can you broadly answer the question,

699
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
why is it that for five years we just say,

700
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Pizzarizzo, we've got to talk about it some day,

701
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and so many people would say, you have to talk to Alicia Stella.

702
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Do you know why that was four years ago?

703
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Anytime anyone said even the most slightly negative thing about Pizzarizzo,

704
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I have felt like it is my duty to defend it

705
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
because it is not the worst pizza at Walt Disney World.

706
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It is the second worst, okay?

707
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It has A.C. and very little buildings in that whole park have A.C.

708
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So, like, Disney food blog, I love you.

709
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I love AJ. Oh, I love you.

710
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But, man, every single time, the 10 worst restaurants at Walt Disney World

711
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and the thumbnail is Pizzarizzo.

712
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And it's like, AJ, come on, please,

713
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
pick a different thing to rag on just once.

714
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Can I, will you reveal the worst pizza?

715
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Oh, it's Pinocchio's Village House in Magic Kingdom.

716
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Okay, great.

717
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's not pizza.

718
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's if you put Play-Doh on the carpet,

719
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
smooshed it out, tomato sauce from SpaghettiOs, and didn't cook it.

720
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yeah, I feel like a pizza place in the dead center of fantasy land

721
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
is not going to be very authentico, you know?

722
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Pizzarizzo is great because it's small, but it's a large pizza for a rat.

723
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's rat-sized pizza. That's why it's rat-sized.

724
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Oh, that's all right.

725
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I like how you canonically absorb that. That makes sense.

726
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You also, for anyone just listening to this, as she referred to a rat,

727
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
she held up a rat because Rizzo is here. She brought Rizzo.

728
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Hey, how you doing?

729
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You know, when you got to see the quiet Muppet Vision,

730
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
was your pre-show also quiet?

731
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Because every time they introduced Mickey Mouse and it was Rizzo,

732
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
the crowd went wild in my pre-shows.

733
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Well, this is a sad thing. You know what happened to us?

734
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
We were rushed through the pre-show.

735
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I didn't get to say goodbye to the pre-show.

736
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm the person who doesn't like cues and stuff,

737
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and I was dying to see that pre-show.

738
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I especially wanted to see Rizzo as Mickey.

739
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I'm really sad I didn't get to see it.

740
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
We asked, like, we said, like, we'll just stay. We'll stay.

741
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
We'll just stay. And they said, you can't do that.

742
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
There are 700 people coming to every screening of this today.

743
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Any other day, you could have done that.

744
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Could have? Why did I listen to that person?

745
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm non-confrontational.

746
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I like hiding under tables just as much as Mike does.

747
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I made my pilgrimage to both Muppet Vision 3D and Pizza Rizzo on Wednesday

748
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and just kind of sauntered into both.

749
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. A normal day.

750
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
A normal day, yeah.

751
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
There was plenty of people in both,

752
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
but yeah, it was a little more manageable,

753
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
which was why I went then.

754
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah.

755
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So not only people are, you know, connecting the dots,

756
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
you know, between you and us, re-Pizza Rizzo,

757
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
but you also just, you spoke to a different media outlet

758
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
two days ago, you said, about Pizza Rizzo.

759
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Would you like to say what that was?

760
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
The story hasn't come out yet, but I spoke to the Wall Street Journal.

761
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
They're like,

762
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
do you have a moment of your time for a very important interview?

763
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And I get on the phone like, so what about Pizza Rizzo?

764
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The state of the world, and you're calling me, you know what?

765
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It is that important. It is.

766
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
We talked for 28 minutes, by the way.

767
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I spoke to them once, and I talked a lot,

768
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and they just used my explanation of what rides are.

769
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Like, they just used, like, this, the Haunted Mansion,

770
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
a scary haunted house that you go through in a doombuggy.

771
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And they cut whenever I was like,

772
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
here's what's really special about it.

773
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So I just sounded like an idiot with a little stipple drawing.

774
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
They contacted you for exposition.

775
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Basically.

776
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Boo, release the transcripts.

777
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Release the full Jason tapes, damn it.

778
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And the stipple drawing next to me is Tony Baxter.

779
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And I'm like, okay, well, this is not maybe punching above my weight here.

780
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Nonsense, nonsense.

781
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Two experts.

782
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Just two people explaining lines.

783
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You waited a line, and then you enjoy the thing.

784
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You are good at exposition, I must say.

785
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Thank you.

786
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Excellent exposition work tonight from Jason.

787
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You are clearly doing, like, a full media tour,

788
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
because you're here with us.

789
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You were there all day yesterday, Wall Street Journal,

790
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and then you're doing your on-the-ground reporting and discussion of it,

791
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
because I noticed I'm like...

792
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yeah, I'll be there tomorrow to vlog, so I'll get to do my own coverage, you know.

793
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Geez, wow.

794
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
There's so many ways to experience your views on Pizzeria Rizzo,

795
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
including on X.

796
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You said, you just posted two photos, and you said,

797
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
my final Pizzeria Rizzo, and that received over 2,000 likes.

798
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Massive, you're putting up stats.

799
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You are so, like, the algorithms are pushing people.

800
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
One of my posts was up to 4,000.

801
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I did a Last Supper, because that table is, like, really long,

802
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
but it has, like, a bench.

803
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So, like, me and my friends were all sitting there,

804
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and I'm like, I'm not in the center, though.

805
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Rizzo is in the center, first of all.

806
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
It's very important.

807
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's a distinction there.

808
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The Jesus of Pizzeria Rizzo.

809
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yeah, Rizzo won.

810
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Rizzo won.

811
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Rizzo won.

812
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But, yeah, I didn't see, like, I was just randomly posting things

813
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
to Twitter, by the way.

814
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's called Twitter.

815
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I wanted to.

816
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I should have.

817
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I go home at 3 a.m. in the morning, and I'm like,

818
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
4,000, 5,000 likes, 6,000 likes?

819
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
What, are people vicariously living through my Pizzeria Rizzo

820
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
last experience?

821
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Good, good.

822
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Wow, wow, you provided a VR patch

823
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
right into the last day.

824
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
When you've done a lot of writing about it,

825
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I also noticed you wrote something for touring plans.

826
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm going to read your own writing to you,

827
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
because this is like...

828
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Good, right?

829
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Do I have to get under the table?

830
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You are not mentioned in it.

831
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Good, good.

832
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

833
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
No, no, no.

834
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
This is a thing to be celebrated, I think.

835
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
This was years ago.

836
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I don't know what you wrote.

837
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I think you'll sign off on it today.

838
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
What you bring up is the struggle of admitting

839
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
that you're a Pizzeria Rizzo fan.

840
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You know, what with mics out there trying to shame you.

841
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You said, I'm not going to lie.

842
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It was hard to admit at first

843
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
that I actually like Pizzeria Rizzo.

844
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
There was a time not long ago

845
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
when it just wasn't something you admitted out loud.

846
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Sure, you might go there...

847
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
There's a weird Pride story going on in this.

848
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Sure, you might go there and enjoy your meal

849
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
between rides on Tower of Terror,

850
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
but you wouldn't dare post a pic of the, quote, pizza.

851
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You did still.

852
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That is still an interesting choice.

853
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Well, it's not pizza.

854
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's rat pizza.

855
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You wouldn't post a pic of the pizza on Pizzeria Rizzo.

856
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Then one day I decided to just let the world know,

857
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I like Pizzeria Rizzo.

858
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It's a coming out story.

859
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You just do a little copy...

860
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Oh, we signed this correctly, calendar-wise.

861
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I think it really shows the trajectory

862
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
of trying to improve the image of Pizzeria Rizzo

863
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
that just a few years ago,

864
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I had to frame it in such a way

865
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
that others could come forward,

866
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
that it can't just be me and Jack Black,

867
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
that others must know that this pizza is somewhat edible

868
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
and this location has AC.

869
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Well, let's talk about...

870
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Why don't we do kind of a gradient

871
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
from things that are sort of undeniable about it,

872
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
that are fun about it,

873
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
to things that maybe require a little bit more debate?

874
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Because in that article,

875
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
you said the six best things about Pizzeria Rizzo.

876
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You mentioned the air conditioning.

877
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
This is an important aspect, obviously.

878
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That's literally one of the six.

879
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So there is that.

880
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
What is your favorite?

881
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Because I noticed yesterday,

882
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
you didn't go up and eat in the banquet room.

883
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
You ate over by the...

884
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
You did the last supper table, as you said.

885
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You ate over by the caricatures,

886
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
the sort of classic Hollywood caricatures

887
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
of so many Muppets.

888
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And Muppets, it goes deep.

889
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It goes deep into characters whose names I don't know

890
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
and won't try to say,

891
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
because we'll get a lot of comments and emails about it.

892
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
For me, personally,

893
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and it's going to be weird using past tense terms,

894
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
but I would sit upstairs.

895
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I like the red and white tablecloth.

896
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I feel like the schmaltzy Italian music,

897
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
the red and white tablecloth,

898
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
the frozen cannolis that come to you

899
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and by the time you go to eat it for dessert,

900
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
it's finally de-chilled.

901
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
It reminds me of going to pizzerias

902
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and Italian restaurants of my youth.

903
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
This is like the 80s and 90s Italian restaurant experience,

904
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
where if Frank Sinatra's playing

905
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
or everybody mambo's playing in the background,

906
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I feel like I'm back there in my childhood.

907
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So you go in the ballroom

908
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and it's playing 90s party music.

909
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I want to get up and dance.

910
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
That's not what I want.

911
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I want a quiet meal with Frank Sinatra in my ear.

912
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Oh, interesting.

913
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That makes sense.

914
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That's a very well-justified choice.

915
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So are you fond of any of those pieces of art in particular?

916
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
There's some fake records on the wall that I'm quite fond of,

917
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
little puns there.

918
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
There's actually a piece.

919
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
There was a piece of The Streets of America on the wall.

920
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
This is tough.

921
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
This is tough, isn't it?

922
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
This is hard.

923
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm going to cry by the end of this.

924
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
This is some weird get-me-to-cry-on-stage experiment.

925
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It's not a trick.

926
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It's not a trap, I swear.

927
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Yeah, there was a subway station sign

928
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
from The Streets of America that closed down

929
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and they put it in there.

930
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So it's funny that that's now got to move.

931
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's like a time capsule.

932
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
We've got to move to a different location.

933
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Maybe it could be part of Monstropolis.

934
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Oh, sure.

935
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
They just put an eyeball on it.

936
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Mark my words.

937
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Anything that remains from the Muppet Courtyard

938
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
and stays from Monstropolis, they'll paint an eyeball on it.

939
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Oh, yeah.

940
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
That makes a lot of sense.

941
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That's easy.

942
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That's only two colors, Max.

943
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Got to save that money.

944
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So yeah, okay, you got records.

945
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
You got an Electric Mayhem record.

946
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
There was a record by the Mice Girls.

947
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Is that correct?

948
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
That's disgusting.

949
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Okay, yeah, yeah.

950
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That being a Spice Girls.

951
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But only four.

952
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Why are there only four?

953
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
What happened there?

954
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I guess they were portraying the era

955
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
post-Gerber Mice leaving.

956
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yeah, when Jerry left.

957
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Mice?

958
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

959
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I mean, mousetraps are a thing.

960
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I don't know where you're getting it.

961
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Oh, no.

962
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
One of the Mice Girls got snapped.

963
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yeah, yeah.

964
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Mice have lots of babies.

965
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's a numbers game.

966
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
We're off track.

967
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
There's photos all over the wall.

968
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
There was photos all over the wall.

969
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Okay, take your time.

970
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
They Photoshop rats into real photos.

971
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So it's like just people in New York,

972
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
and then there's a rat, and they're Muppet rats.

973
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So it's like, this is Muppet themed.

974
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
There was little hidden gags.

975
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Like the ballroom, the banquet hall

976
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
has a sign that says who's getting married.

977
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And it's like Phil and Jill.

978
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And if you remember Muppets Take Manhattan,

979
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
it's like, what do you think, Phil?

980
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
What do you think, Jill?

981
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It was like the marketing people.

982
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Anyway.

983
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Yes, when Kermit forgets who he is,

984
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
and then he knows all of these people

985
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
whose names rhyme.

986
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Yeah.

987
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
This is one of the big things.

988
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It's like a push pin.

989
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Like it's a sign where you push the letters.

990
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yeah, and then the letter behind it,

991
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
you can see faded letters for Emmett Otter,

992
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
a jug band that was performing there.

993
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And that's like a deep cut,

994
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
because that's not even on Disney+.

995
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
That is weird.

996
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
That's really strange.

997
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
As we hope that Muppet Vision 3D will end up,

998
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
damn it, right?

999
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
They have to put it there, don't they?

1000
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I mean, it's hard to get an applause out of that,

1001
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
because we all still secretly hope

1002
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
they're going to move it somewhere else.

1003
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1004
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Everyone in this room is like Magic Eye Theater,

1005
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
or that villain show they just opened.

1006
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
They put real seats in there, clearly.

1007
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
That's for the Muppet.

1008
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Yeah, can't they move it to one of the,

1009
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
like, five Disney World movie theaters

1010
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
that show essentially nothing?

1011
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
There's so many.

1012
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
You don't like 3D DVD extras?

1013
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
But I swear, there's one of those

1014
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
where they're still showing just a preview

1015
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
of the Tim Allen Shaggy Dog.

1016
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
No one's noticed.

1017
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
No one's tried to go in.

1018
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Well, Scott, it's a double feature.

1019
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's half Shaggy Dog and half Changing Gears.

1020
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
15 years.

1021
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Let's all correct Jason about the show

1022
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
none of us have watched.

1023
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
They're filming it with cast members on Tuesday,

1024
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I believe.

1025
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Oh, right, right.

1026
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Hopefully they get the curtain working,

1027
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
or at least fake it, have people quietly on the floor

1028
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
moving the curtain.

1029
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Oh, sure.

1030
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But they're not going to move the musket

1031
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
like animatronic stuff.

1032
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
They're just not going to do it set, I don't think.

1033
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
No, no.

1034
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So it'll be, anyway.

1035
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Is there any way to...

1036
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's a quiet sadness throughout the audience.

1037
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
We're all in the bargaining phase at this point.

1038
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Like, can't we just get a mini version

1039
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
somewhere in the park?

1040
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
With the large bar in back,

1041
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
this is essentially an Irish wake for a pizzeria.

1042
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
That's a good point.

1043
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Everyone gets sloppy drunk, we'll understand.

1044
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
We all have to cope.

1045
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It is funny that, though, that this is like,

1046
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
you know, we've maybe said, like,

1047
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I don't know, is the place a little light on theming?

1048
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And then the response is, no, there is a cork board

1049
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
with faded letters of an otter's funeral.

1050
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
What's great is that I actually covered the opening of this.

1051
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I was looking back at my article from 2016, December,

1052
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
when it first opened, and I'm looking at the bulletin board,

1053
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
and I'm like, they actually added more photos

1054
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
and little things to the bulletin board.

1055
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So this four-foot space has more theming

1056
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
than it did when it opened.

1057
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
So if anything, they've doubled the amount

1058
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
of Muppet theming in there.

1059
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Wow.

1060
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It went from 12 Muppet pieces of paper to 24.

1061
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Well, this is, let me bring up, this is maybe,

1062
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
this is a serious debate, this is a serious thing to bring up.

1063
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Maybe some of the disappointment,

1064
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
or just feeling like, all right,

1065
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
if anyone is not super in love with Pizzeria Rizzo,

1066
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
was it that when you think of a Muppet restaurant,

1067
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
you think of a crazy madcap place

1068
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
with a bunch of animatronics or puppets

1069
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
or videos of things going haywire.

1070
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Like, that might be the, and you know,

1071
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
and that's probably not the fault of the,

1072
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
like, they probably got an amount of,

1073
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
that was the original concept, is what we have just been told.

1074
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah, Melrose was actually built and designed

1075
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
to be Gonzo's Pizza Pandemonium, I believe?

1076
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Pandemonium Pizza Parlor.

1077
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
There's no other room where you can shout that

1078
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and expect recognition.

1079
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It's amazing, it's interactive.

1080
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You can still see the wood,

1081
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
the rats were going to be above you.

1082
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
The rafters, the legend is that the rafters were built there

1083
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
for tracked animatronics to be bringing the food back and forth,

1084
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
rats bringing the food back and forth.

1085
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And there was, something happened,

1086
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I can't quite put my finger on it,

1087
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
but something big happened that I'd rather not get into

1088
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
because Jim Henson passed away.

1089
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Oh, right, that, okay.

1090
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
There was a plan for a big, giant great Muppet movie ride,

1091
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
there was a plan for this whole area to be Muppet studios

1092
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
and they kind of backtracked

1093
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
and they turned it into Mama Melrose last minute

1094
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
because they weren't even sure they were going to have a Muppet area.

1095
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Wow, right, wow.

1096
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Because, yeah, Disney was actually going to buy the entire Muppets

1097
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
and that got sidetracked for years.

1098
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
What a strange thing.

1099
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So, like, there was, like, the madcap Muppet restaurant of our dreams,

1100
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
so how does it go from that to, like, many, many years later,

1101
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
it is suddenly open and there's a couple of bulletin boards.

1102
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You know, don't make me say the words modern Disney.

1103
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Ah.

1104
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Because I try to be positive on my podcast

1105
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and it's hard to be realistic and say...

1106
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Same aura has been said, yes, you're right.

1107
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I didn't, when I, in 2018, when I was criticizing it,

1108
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I didn't say these stupid Imagineers, why would they do this, right?

1109
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I didn't say that, right?

1110
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I don't know, check the, Doug Jones will have to tell us.

1111
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Never blame the Imagineers.

1112
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Did I say that?

1113
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Imagineers have great ideas, it's the money.

1114
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
It's the money.

1115
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Always the money, yes.

1116
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
No, and that's what, yeah, and if we're mad about things, it's that.

1117
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Because I'm sure if you asked Imagineers,

1118
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
would you like to build 20 animatronics and rats exploding out of every wall,

1119
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
or would you like 24 pieces of paper?

1120
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I think they would pick the animatronics.

1121
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
But I guess you have to go, all right, well, if this is,

1122
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
if what was budgeted was, like, kind of a quick turnover of the Toy Story thing,

1123
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
then I think you can tell that it was done with love

1124
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
by people who liked the Muppets, who were deep Muppets fans,

1125
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and who put those in the Easter eggs end.

1126
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
They printed out as many things on that laser printer as they could afford.

1127
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
They put it in as many Walmart frames on that wall as they could.

1128
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Color, ink, even, it's more expensive.

1129
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
You can feel the love was in, you know, the Photoshop.

1130
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
The theming budget might be $150.

1131
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yeah.

1132
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's like if we asked somebody to leave here, we handed them cash,

1133
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
will you go make a corkboard and bring it back for the late show?

1134
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Have you guys been to Regal Eagle?

1135
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
No, I haven't.

1136
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Audience has. They're an enthusiastic.

1137
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
We still have a lightly themed Muppet quick service restaurant at Walt Disney World.

1138
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It exists.

1139
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And it is even lighter themed.

1140
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It has four pictures.

1141
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
One for each barbecue sauce.

1142
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
How is the barbecue?

1143
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I mean, it's really good.

1144
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Oh, good.

1145
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It's shockingly good.

1146
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Good.

1147
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Like, I have to, like, beat around the bush on the Pizzarrizzo.

1148
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
High food standards in World Showcase.

1149
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
So, happy to hear that.

1150
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Well, that's interesting that the food is good.

1151
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Because...

1152
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So, one thing, I got to, you know, I went into Pizzarrizzo

1153
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and I explored it a couple of years ago.

1154
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And we'll talk about some of that stuff in a minute.

1155
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And I came to appreciate the Easter eggs in the theming.

1156
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
But yesterday was the first time that I tried the food.

1157
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Okay, you know, I'll make my way to the table.

1158
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I'm sorry.

1159
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And I'll very meekly say,

1160
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
what would a Pizzarrizzo fan say to somebody who thought

1161
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
that maybe it wasn't the best food that they've ever had?

1162
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Look, I use the quote when I call it pizza

1163
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
because it's really a pizza bread bowl.

1164
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Now, think about it.

1165
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So, I just need to change my thinking is all.

1166
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
If I am thinking of it as pizza, I might be very disappointed.

1167
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yeah.

1168
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You don't have to use the modifier very, but go ahead.

1169
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
You just change the incognito behavioral therapy.

1170
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
We say change the lens that you're using to look at something.

1171
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It's a bread bowl with a baked crust.

1172
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It explains the amount of bread around it.

1173
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yeah.

1174
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
The toppings in the center,

1175
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
because those are the pizza bowl filling.

1176
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
It really is.

1177
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
You get the quickest little smattering right in the middle.

1178
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
It really is like pizza, but tired of all that cheese.

1179
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah, it's a lot of crust.

1180
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Yeah, you know, Jason, we weren't with you.

1181
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So, we don't know your opinions at all.

1182
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
What did you think a couple of days ago?

1183
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You know, I had walked through it a few times before

1184
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and liked it, but Wednesday was the first time I ate it.

1185
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And it was a little earlier in the day,

1186
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
so Jane and I split a cheese pizza which came with Caesar salad.

1187
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Now, for years I've wondered,

1188
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
what is with this tiny Caesar salad?

1189
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
People must love this thing.

1190
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And I didn't realize it came with it.

1191
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Oh, you thought people were ordering it in addition?

1192
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I thought people were like, oh, I want some vegetables.

1193
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
The other option just said carrots.

1194
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
So, I'm assuming it was a wet bag of baby carrots.

1195
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
You thought it was the new butter beer.

1196
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Everybody's having the Caesar salad.

1197
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
But I went through the mobile order too quickly

1198
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
because I missed the partially frozen cannoli.

1199
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Oh, yeah.

1200
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
As someone who spent a lot of time growing up on boardwalks,

1201
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I love a frosty cannoli.

1202
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
But yeah, pizza risotto, it was very crust heavy.

1203
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Just say it was edible. It was edible, right?

1204
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It was.

1205
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Ah, woo! It was edible!

1206
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
It reminded me of back east where it's like,

1207
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
oh, you want to order in?

1208
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Do you want to do this or that pizza?

1209
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's like, oh, I'm sick of those.

1210
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
We can do DiCenzo.

1211
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It's like, ah, it's okay.

1212
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I guess we'll do it for a change.

1213
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
That was pizza risotto.

1214
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
What a review.

1215
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yes, these created edible.

1216
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
If they put that in a banner over the door,

1217
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
people would be like, I guess.

1218
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Third or fourth choice, it's something.

1219
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It was like my high school cafeteria pizza.

1220
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It was definitely some sort of like, you could buy this in bulk.

1221
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Maybe it was probably just frozen.

1222
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I don't know how they prepared it.

1223
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I'm just saying.

1224
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
But the pizza in high school was probably prepared already.

1225
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And it was like 45% crust.

1226
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Wait, you didn't have the square trays of pizza

1227
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
that they cut with the roller?

1228
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
You missed out.

1229
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
No, we weren't so lucky to have those.

1230
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
You missed out.

1231
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
But then they had just a very sugary tomato sauce.

1232
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I feel like it's the same as it was in my high school cafeteria pizza.

1233
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:28,000
What I wrote down was that the sauce tasted like tomato by way of metal.

1234
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
There was a metallic taste, yes?

1235
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yes.

1236
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I believe Dave Meske is with us, your buddy.

1237
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I think I'm quoting him correctly when he took a bite and then had some water.

1238
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And he said, I think the water enhanced the flavor.

1239
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's like ingredients of a soup add water, and then the flavors come to life.

1240
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Oh, I did have a non-alcoholic mocktail.

1241
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It was an alcohol-free peach Bellini.

1242
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Oh, the specialty of the house.

1243
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Yeah, it was the specialty.

1244
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
And it was delicious.

1245
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It tasted like I was just drinking slurpee syrup.

1246
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Yeah.

1247
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I know, it was great.

1248
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
We should have gotten that.

1249
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
That sounds good.

1250
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
It was.

1251
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It was really good.

1252
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Oh, boy.

1253
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Can I ask, is there a chance, do we know this is getting demolished?

1254
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Well, it's in all the concept art.

1255
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It is, right?

1256
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That's exactly the same building.

1257
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Even the big billboard that says it's rat pizza is still in the concept art,

1258
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
but with like an advert for Monsters Incorporated.

1259
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So, pizza razo is what I've been pitching.

1260
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Pizza razo, it's always watching.

1261
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
That's good.

1262
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
That's pretty good.

1263
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Right there, right there.

1264
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Because honestly, it's not like it changed that much from Pizza Planet.

1265
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
They just took away the video games and the fun.

1266
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You know what they'll do, too, to your point about the eyes?

1267
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
It'll be the little bready circle.

1268
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
One giant pepperoni.

1269
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah, one big pepperoni.

1270
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And then they'll pass that off as like, why did I only get one?

1271
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It's fun.

1272
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It's fun.

1273
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's because that's the pupil.

1274
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
It's the Mike Wazowski pie.

1275
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
The Mike Wazowski pie.

1276
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
It's Instagrammable.

1277
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
This is going to go viral.

1278
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I have a feeling there's going to be a lot of Mike Wazowski-themed stuff in the Monsters area.

1279
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
A lot of just a circle, you know?

1280
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Maybe two.

1281
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Sounds modern Disney to me.

1282
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Oh no, oh no.

1283
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
What have I done?

1284
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Let's talk about the cannoli a little bit.

1285
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I felt like narratively as I was disappointed by each eye.

1286
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And I really, because I'm like, I have an audience.

1287
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I want to come and say the food was wonderful and get a cheer.

1288
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And then I'm like, I have to live my truth.

1289
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
By the way, he was worried yesterday.

1290
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Not that I'm not worried now.

1291
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I'm just saying, what are we going to tell them?

1292
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
You literally have the biggest fan of all time of this restaurant.

1293
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And I'm calling it mid.

1294
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You have nothing to worry about.

1295
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
It's okay.

1296
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I can rely.

1297
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Now I know where the bar is.

1298
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
The bar is at Edible.

1299
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
But Scott has a car running back over in the parking garage to get out of here if he needs to.

1300
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
After that pizza review he just gave.

1301
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Look, I have spent a lot of years getting booed about living with the land.

1302
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I'm always prepared for the worst.

1303
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Yeah, see?

1304
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Boo this man.

1305
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Get him out of here.

1306
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Get him out.

1307
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Some audiences' reactions I don't like.

1308
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
But I bet I'm not going to get that same degree of boo about the cannoli.

1309
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I wanted to...

1310
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Narratively I was like, this must be...

1311
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I didn't like the pizza.

1312
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
This salad, I might say, is the literal worst salad I've ever had in my life.

1313
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
So it has to be that the cannoli will save the whole thing.

1314
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And here's what happened.

1315
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I took a bite of it.

1316
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I put it in my mouth and I said, mmm.

1317
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Because I wanted that narrative to be true.

1318
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And then I chewed and I chewed.

1319
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And 10 to 15 seconds went by.

1320
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And our buddy Andrew Grissom, who came out with us, said,

1321
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Scott, I noticed you haven't swallowed your bite yet.

1322
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And even I hadn't noticed.

1323
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I wanted to like the taste so very much, but it just sat there.

1324
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
It just sat there like I was chewing a paper towel.

1325
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Look, what I left out is that the pizzerias and Italian restaurants of my youth were terrible.

1326
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Nostalgia works in funny ways like that.

1327
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
What cities are we talking about?

1328
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
What part of the country?

1329
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
South Florida.

1330
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
A lot of old retirees.

1331
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
A lot of retirees.

1332
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Ah, Naples.

1333
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
No taste buds.

1334
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Pizza capital.

1335
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
No, Naples, Florida.

1336
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
What?

1337
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Is Pompano Beach not known for its pizza?

1338
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I started...

1339
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
We did eat in the banquet room, which we should talk about a little more.

1340
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Because a lot of the places is tables and it is restaurant style.

1341
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
And then you have...

1342
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I mean, it is this delightful room that is like a room that you could rent out theoretically, canonically.

1343
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
In story, yeah.

1344
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Yes.

1345
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And there's signage saying that it can fit 125 people, which equals 700 rats.

1346
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Just like that, which I like.

1347
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And then it does have this old Italian wedding venue vibe.

1348
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I mean, that's great.

1349
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's a lot of fun in there.

1350
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Mike, you were wrong to not go up into there in 2018, I have to say.

1351
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I was...

1352
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Well, thank you for scolding me.

1353
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Yes, I agree.

1354
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'm just trying to get you booed.

1355
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I'm trying to even the score.

1356
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Not going to work.

1357
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I know, I know that.

1358
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I'm too below.

1359
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I know that.

1360
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
The only person who's not getting booed whatsoever tonight is Jason.

1361
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
This much we know.

1362
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Well...

1363
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Will not happen.

1364
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Thank you.

1365
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And I liked that there was some music playing.

1366
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
We sat down and there was music playing and you'd see one person dancing.

1367
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
But mostly people eating it very seriously, much like the viewings of Muppet Vision 3D.

1368
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Everybody was so mournful and just slicing and cutting.

1369
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Or maybe that was just their live reaction to the food that they were eating.

1370
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I mean, it sounds like you're around tourists in 92 degree heat.

1371
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Yes, good point.

1372
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
They're dead inside.

1373
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's day three at Disney World.

1374
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
That's a good point, yes.

1375
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
But there would be a sign, hey, we walked in and don't stop until you get enough is playing.

1376
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And then eight minutes of silence.

1377
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
And then another song.

1378
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Why is that such a long break between songs?

1379
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Plenty of songs to be played.

1380
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I think the world has at least a thousand songs they can play.

1381
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
See, I had a different experience.

1382
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
There was a bunch of kids and adults dancing on the dance floor.

1383
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So it definitely added to the atmosphere.

1384
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Yeah, but there's such long breaks between the songs.

1385
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Yeah.

1386
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
You have to give the kids a break so they can go eat their kid's meal,

1387
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
which is a smaller version of Pizza Rizzo's pizza.

1388
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Yes, we got one kid's meal.

1389
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
That's what Andrew Grissom, our buddy, had, the smaller version.

1390
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And I want to say he did not finish the smaller version.

1391
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But he was getting up to dance very often.

1392
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Now, there is a touch of old Disney in the restaurant in that when you order a soda,

1393
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:11,000
they don't give you a lid, just like the 1970s Disney.

1394
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
That's a very specific poll.

1395
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
This was a no lid time.

1396
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
They didn't care if you get rain drip drops in your soda throughout the day.

1397
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Yeah, a little lead paint to enhance the theming.

1398
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
There are no lids at Disney World anymore unless you go to the DVC lounge.

1399
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Is that true?

1400
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Yeah, you've got to get the points before they get a lid.

1401
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Oh, jeez.

1402
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
When did they get everything?

1403
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
When did they get rid of lids?

1404
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
When they got rid of plastic straws.

1405
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Really?

1406
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Yeah.

1407
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Is it a Biden thing?

1408
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And they hide the paper straws behind the counter, so you have to ask for them.

1409
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Oh, wow, really?

1410
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And they dissolve within a minute, so you have to keep asking for them.

1411
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
You have to use nine paper straws in one drink.

1412
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Wow, I didn't realize that, no, there were no lids.

1413
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Now you know.

1414
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Now you've all learned.

1415
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
At one point, a song that I like came on, Footloose, by Kenny Loggins,

1416
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and I started making up my own song along to it because it kicked in right as my stomach was starting to feel a little not great,

1417
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
and I changed the lyrics and I turned it into this.

1418
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I'm going to get stool loose, stool loose, diarrhea out my caboose.

1419
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,000
He pulled this real quick, too.

1420
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I saw it happen in real time.

1421
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I had to transcribe it.

1422
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It's pouring out of me.

1423
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
He didn't work very hard on it.

1424
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I almost used the queasiness as an excuse to be a little, to revert to my no-launch Queen ways and to not go on rock and roller coaster,

1425
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:50,000
but I fought through the bizarre salad and through the tasteless cannoli,

1426
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
and I did the ride, and I survived, and I did not end up.

1427
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Thank you.

1428
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Oh, thank you.

1429
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
A cheer.

1430
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Let's hold on to that.

1431
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Let's hold on to the cheer part.

1432
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I like that.

1433
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
It should have been on the banner.

1434
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You may not puke this up on roller coasters.

1435
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Good.

1436
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But I, okay, you know what I think it might be time to do is that, you know, we've, we've, we've,

1437
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:17,000
this has been wonderful spending time with you, somebody who has a lot of pizza riso credentials.

1438
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,000
You know, you know, a Riz, as they say, a lot of Riz.

1439
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And there's somebody else here who I think has credentials possibly to match because, you know, we've all,

1440
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:37,000
now we're all people who have eaten at Pizza Rizzo, in one case talked to the Wall Street Journal about Pizza Rizzo,

1441
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:44,000
but there is somebody here who worked at Pizza Rizzo.

1442
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Seemingly because of our show.

1443
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Seemingly we caused employment.

1444
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And I am so curious to ask some questions about this.

1445
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:01,000
So now I would like to welcome to the stage, I'm so happy to welcome one of the best listeners a podcast could ask for,

1446
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Malia Schnefke.

1447
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Wow, in a Kermit column. Malia, hi, hey, good to see you.

1448
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
So thrilled to be here with Alicia for the Pride Month episode of Podcast the Ride.

1449
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
What was just shouted? What was just shouted?

1450
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Somebody shouted something?

1451
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Queen of Rat Pizza!

1452
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Queen of Rat Pizza! Wow!

1453
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,000
This is why you get to hold court where people are yelling Queen of Rat Pizza at you.

1454
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Now there are two people on the stage with pizza slice earrings.

1455
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Did you all not get the memo?

1456
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Yeah, I'm sorry. I should have gotten pierced.

1457
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I left my mind out for too long in the holes.

1458
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Is there a Claire's near here?

1459
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Statistically, yes. Very likely.

1460
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Most likely. So glad you could be here. Thank you for joining us on stage again here at Tin Roof as you did last year.

1461
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
This is the only room I've ever been popular in.

1462
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
This will change. This will change on this day because popularity is deserved.

1463
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It's been great meeting you through the years, including that I met you the first time at Pizzarizzo when you worked there.

1464
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I did. Very true.

1465
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:25,000
That was one of those Disney World fun little happenings where I indicated that I was there and you threw out,

1466
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:31,000
hey, I'm working if you want some rat pizza, and I was like, yes, I can make that work. I can pop in and do it.

1467
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And that was so delightful, I think four years ago or so.

1468
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So four years ago, as you may all remember, there was a small thing called the coronavirus pandemic.

1469
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And everyone that worked at Disney World got laid off via email at about 4 p.m. on a Saturday.

1470
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Oh, my God. Modern Disney.

1471
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
What were you doing then?

1472
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So I was actually working in costuming for some of the shows in Magic Kingdom.

1473
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And they all said, we're good. Thank you so much.

1474
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And eventually they said, you can come back to work, but all that we have available is quick service food and beverage.

1475
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And I thought, I don't need to do that unless because of this show and because of the Pizzarizzo lore,

1476
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I thought if my way to work back at Disney World is working in quick service at Pizzarizzo, that would be really funny.

1477
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And so I asked the recruiter in my interview, I said, I don't really want to work quick service.

1478
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But if you have a spot at Pizzarizzo, I would do that.

1479
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And wouldn't you know, in about June 2021, not a lot of people wanted to serve at pizza.

1480
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
But someone had to answer the call. And that was me.

1481
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Wow. What a tale.

1482
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Thank you for your service.

1483
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Thank you so much.

1484
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Now, Scott went through Pizzarizzo when he was there in 2021 and met you.

1485
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I went through in 2021 and I asked, oh, is Mel working today?

1486
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
And they told me they are off today.

1487
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Somebody had to do it.

1488
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
How dare you? You should be there seven days a week.

1489
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Saving away for the rats.

1490
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Okay. So and you've sort of assessed this as like, you've posted about like, I got a job there for the bit, essentially.

1491
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
This is a rare, this is an incredible thing to get to do, a bit job.

1492
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So lest anyone doubt my credentials, I did work at Pizzarizzo for almost six entire months because I thought that it would be funny.

1493
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And it was.

1494
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Okay. Day to day, just what are like, was there just a basic fundamental, it is funny and you were proud that like my job today is the rat pizza restaurant?

1495
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
It was also absolute hell.

1496
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Oh, that too?

1497
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
The people that work in quick service food and beverage are our strongest soldiers.

1498
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
That job is miserable.

1499
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:23,000
This, I, if you guys are familiar, it might be a little bit past your time, but Club Penguin, the online game, had a little mini game where you would work in the kind of pizza restaurant.

1500
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:30,000
And it would just go faster and faster and you would put toppings on the little pre-made pizzas until you lost.

1501
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And that is sort of what working at Pizzarizzo was like.

1502
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Except I was like putting pepperoni and sausage onto like frozen DiGiorno pizzas and burning all my fingertips off.

1503
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,000
So if you need anything crimes committed, I don't have fingertips because of Pizzarizzo.

1504
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Wait, so you have like information, you have like intel.

1505
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Oh, absolutely.

1506
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I can ask you questions about how Rizzo, like as a boss, like worked.

1507
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Okay, how early in the morning are the Caesar salads made and how long do they sit in the fridge?

1508
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So they are made actually every day.

1509
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:15,000
And it was one of the fun jobs because you just sort of put on these very long food service gloves and they gave you just sort of a bucket as well as like.

1510
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
That tracks.

1511
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Ah, the classic salad bucket.

1512
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Yeah.

1513
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And so you would have your pre-shredded lettuce that you would tear out of the little plastic bags and your giant plastic container of Caesar dressing and you would just sort of mix it together.

1514
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Like a vat, like a vat.

1515
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1516
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And you would just hand mix it together at about 8 a.m. every day and you would put it in all the little cups.

1517
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And like as far as jobs there went, it was pretty fun.

1518
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I like the three or four croutons right on top.

1519
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1520
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Especially after they've been in the fridge like six or seven hours.

1521
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Just hard as a rock.

1522
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's so good.

1523
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
So good.

1524
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
What's the is there something that you like?

1525
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Is it all just like the answer is it's it's just frozen and remade and it's just whatever.

1526
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Or did you see anything that would we would all be aghast at?

1527
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I don't think so.

1528
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Like as far as quick service restaurants like at Disney go like Pizza Rizzo and Mama Melrose's did share a like back of house kitchen space.

1529
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And so a lot of the stuff that we had was the same as what they had.

1530
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
And I don't think a lot of people really put that respect.

1531
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,000
It's amazing because I spent thirty eight dollars on an entree at Mama Melrose a couple of weeks ago.

1532
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
OK, but yeah.

1533
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
But the smell could not be beat.

1534
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Priceless wood firewood burning stove in theory.

1535
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Sure.

1536
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Actually, what was the smell situation day to day?

1537
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
So this was during covid.

1538
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And so I was just wearing the heaviest, hottest denim shirt and pants that you've ever seen in your life as well as like full double masked at the hottest oven you've ever seen.

1539
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Just absolutely dying, waterboarding myself with sweat, like cutting pizzas, burning my fingertips off.

1540
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
But it was, again, very funny.

1541
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
And I didn't have anything else to do.

1542
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I mean, you're right.

1543
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Did you hurt your arms hand tossing that dough?

1544
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1545
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Can we talk about the oven?

1546
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Is it load bearing?

1547
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And that's why it has to be a pizza restaurant every time they redo the land.

1548
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
When you have a pesto pizza in six to eight years when Monsters Inc.

1549
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Land reopens and it's a pesto pizza with the coldest, driest burrata you've ever seen to me.

1550
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Mike Wazowski's little eye.

1551
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
One little olive on top.

1552
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Sorry.

1553
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Sorry.

1554
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
That's actually burrata.

1555
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
There are standards for burrata.

1556
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
They can't call it that.

1557
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
But if you draw the O.

1558
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And you draw a smaller O inside and then a filled in circle, Mike Wazowski.

1559
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Something else happened, not during your employment, but that came from your love of this place.

1560
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And that is that what I have caught is that some sort of event was held.

1561
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And that, if I am correct, the event was Pizza Rizzo Prom.

1562
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
That's right.

1563
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Who were your, well, you know, at first, tell us a little bit about Pizza Rizzo Prom.

1564
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:22,000
So I think the idea of having a prom in the Pizza Rizzo banquet room had been sort of a joke amongst friends for a very long time.

1565
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Because you go there and you have a pizza restaurant.

1566
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And you think that it might be fun to put on very elaborate dress and like go hang out there and drink some mobile ordered Bud Lights.

1567
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And so when the closure was announced, my friends, Taryn and Allie and I talked about how this was the time we have to throw a party.

1568
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:57,000
And so when the closure was announced, my friends, Taryn and Allie and I talked about how this was the time we have to throw our Pizza Rizzo Prom before they take it away from us.

1569
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:03,000
And so we did. We did it in February. Alicia came. It was an absolute delight.

1570
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I spent $160 on my dress.

1571
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
As well you should.

1572
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I spent three months or how long was this since you announced? Looking for that dress.

1573
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I went prom shopping. I went total high school on this.

1574
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:25,000
You have no idea. I made the joke that the three like happiest moments of my life was my wedding day, the birth of my child and Pizza Rizzo Prom.

1575
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And I don't think I'm kidding.

1576
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That was like the best experience.

1577
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Was anyone else here at Pizza Rizzo Prom?

1578
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I don't believe it.

1579
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
It's 125 people in that room.

1580
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
What was better? High school prom or Pizza Rizzo Prom?

1581
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Pizza Rizzo Prom without a doubt. I got to be gay there.

1582
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
It's better to be an adult than be a teenager any day.

1583
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
The vibe seemed a lot better than my high school prom.

1584
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Absolutely. It was so special.

1585
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
What did y'all get up to? How did you make it special once you were in the prom event?

1586
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,000
So right before the prom, I sort of got very scared that perhaps thousands of people might show up.

1587
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And I was going to get banned from Disney World because I we had no RSVP process.

1588
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And people from like the Disney food blog were reaching out and saying, hey, can we like write up about this so people can come?

1589
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And I said, you have one point four million Instagram followers.

1590
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Please do not do this so I don't get in trouble.

1591
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
But all of our friends showed up and we wore silly little outfits.

1592
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
We had a little costume contest and it was a delight.

1593
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
We just sort of hung out and ate frozen pizza and did the Cupid shuffle.

1594
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Absolutely. Yeah, we had our mobile ordered Bud lights.

1595
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We took pictures and that is what prom should really be.

1596
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
There there was a prom court. There was absolutely.

1597
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Yes, we had our little costume contest to sort of, you know, spread the love of prom court out and do something that was a little like fun for everybody.

1598
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
So we had our different themes and people wore Muppet outfits.

1599
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
People were kind of traditional prom outfits.

1600
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
People dressed as Pizza Rizzo. Yes.

1601
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:10,000
My friend Tara and my co-chair had a sort of very elaborate outfit that displayed the entire menu of Pizza Rizzo sort of about their person.

1602
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
We had people dress up as the actual ballroom complete with like the little ivy walls and stuff.

1603
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
By the way, co-chair.

1604
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
There were their positions in the organization.

1605
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
The loop of music in the in the room.

1606
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Yeah, it's small. It's about 30 minutes.

1607
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yeah. Do you know all of it?

1608
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Like, could you remember?

1609
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
You don't have to do it now.

1610
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I'm just saying. But you're like, oh, here.

1611
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I feel good by James Brown is coming up next.

1612
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I feel like there are like at a max 10 songs on that music loop.

1613
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And sometimes they just play without the pauses in between.

1614
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And then sometimes you have to wait eight minutes for the Cupid shuffle.

1615
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
The DJ is taking a break. Absolutely.

1616
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
This wasn't just that something was wrong that day.

1617
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
This is a known thing about Pizza Rizzo, the eight minute music gaps.

1618
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I feel like that's a pretty new thing.

1619
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
It didn't used to be like that.

1620
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Correct me if I'm wrong.

1621
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I actually had a concern that the floor was going to give out.

1622
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Because if anyone remembers this building when it was Pizza Planet, there was no room here.

1623
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
There was just a balcony and you can see down into the ordering stations.

1624
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
This is an addition that Rizzo built.

1625
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I don't trust Rizzo and his building code.

1626
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
So it says it can hold 100 people.

1627
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
We were like 70 to 90 people at our most.

1628
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And we're dancing all the same time on this tiny dance floor.

1629
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,000
And I'm like having visions of like those other countries where the floor collapses at a wedding.

1630
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
And I was so, I literally, I was having a heart attack.

1631
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I'm not enjoying the prom. I have to step outside.

1632
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I'm like, please don't die.

1633
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
And loved ones like, so what happened?

1634
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
How did Alicia die?

1635
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Well, long story.

1636
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Just as the fortune teller foretold.

1637
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
But we did get that group photo.

1638
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Absolutely, it was so sweet.

1639
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
It was truly the most special day.

1640
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Everybody was so cool and so chill.

1641
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And not weird and aggressive, which is what I was afraid was going to happen.

1642
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
That I was going to get banned from Walt Disney World for inciting riots.

1643
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I think Muppet fans, we're a pretty calm bunch, surprisingly, considering how weird Muppets is.

1644
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Absolutely, very like earnest, kind-hearted, just like people ready to play.

1645
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
It was a delight.

1646
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
There were tourists outside the doors because we had took over the whole thing.

1647
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Small children that were like, what is happening?

1648
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
And they're looking in like, what in the world?

1649
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Because we're dressed to the nines.

1650
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
The assistant manager just making phone calls like, hey boss, there's people in the restaurant today.

1651
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
What do I do?

1652
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
There were like three people in business casual that were just sort of posted up outside.

1653
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
And we sort of took turns going up and being like, hey, I promise we're all going to be cool.

1654
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
This is all that this is.

1655
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
We didn't bring our own like Bluetooth speaker.

1656
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
We're not here to truly like start a riot and chain ourselves to this building.

1657
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Like we're just going to eat our frozen pizza and hang out.

1658
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
And that is what happened.

1659
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And everybody was normal.

1660
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It was a delight.

1661
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Someone asked me where like how we smuggled in the disco ball or put up the decorations on the walls.

1662
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
And it's like, no, this is how this always is.

1663
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
It's always finally utilized.

1664
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Wow.

1665
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And that's potential.

1666
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Yeah.

1667
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
That's one more thing it has.

1668
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
We haven't brought up a disco ball.

1669
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It did have theming.

1670
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
It had stuff.

1671
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I did see a tweet yesterday that, you know, Disney corporate was like asking people in more complicated outfits to please not pose for photos together in order to protect character integrity.

1672
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And if there has ever been a phrase that is called for a wedgie, it's we must protect character integrity.

1673
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Are you talking about the Muppets?

1674
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
People brought Muppets so good that they were getting in trouble.

1675
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Yeah.

1676
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
For having Muppets.

1677
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Yeah.

1678
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And it's like Disney, if you brought your own Muppets, we wouldn't have to take them.

1679
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Exactly.

1680
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Did somebody bring a Muppet and then have them throw the pizza up?

1681
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Was that?

1682
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Oh no, I'm sick.

1683
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
They just throw it in their mouth and it falls out to the side.

1684
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
They just throw it down, I guess.

1685
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:37,000
We need to protect character integrity for when there's a single three second you'll miss it Janice that pops up when you get a launch on Rock and Rollercoaster.

1686
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:48,000
They're going to move that Wilkins coffee can that was in the Pizzeria lobby into the queue of a new Rock and Rollercoaster and then you'll all see how much we care about Muppets.

1687
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
There's going to be a flat for Animal on the big Hollywood sign on the ride.

1688
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
That's what we were saying.

1689
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,000
We think the theming on the new ride is going to be you go through Animal's mouth one time, the end.

1690
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
As the end of the re-theme.

1691
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
We will be lucky if we go through Animal's mouth.

1692
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Yes.

1693
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Can I predict real quick, I have a prediction the overlay will take two and a half weeks.

1694
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I've already said overnight, but okay.

1695
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It's like Price is Right rules.

1696
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
You're going to win, I bet.

1697
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Here's the thing, if they bring back Ken Marino for the pre-show.

1698
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
That'd be great.

1699
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
What a nod.

1700
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Then I'll be okay.

1701
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Well, okay.

1702
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I mean, clearly what we're finding here is that this place has fostered community and fun.

1703
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,000
So much like, you know, I think it was really about like baking pizza riso your own.

1704
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
That was the answer.

1705
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
That's what you did.

1706
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's an empty shell that we could put whatever we wanted into it, literally and figuratively.

1707
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Yes, like the pizza itself, mostly empty.

1708
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
But if you put your own, bring your own toppings, you could have a great time.

1709
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:04,000
But what we're finding, I think, maybe what we're landing on is that that initial discussion of pizza riso is good.

1710
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I mean, the vibes feel pretty good right now, don't they?

1711
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I mean, it's getting much easier to make that verdict.

1712
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:20,000
And when we were up there and meeting a bunch of listeners and talking to Alicia and seeing it full and packed and people in amazing shirts and everybody so nice up there,

1713
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I started thinking about where this all began.

1714
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And that like, you know, with the initial debate and pizza riso is good, that statement coming from our pal Doug.

1715
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:38,000
So when I was up there, I texted him and I said, you know, we're doing a show tomorrow and it's going to be about pizza riso.

1716
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
And I said, do you have a statement about the closing of pizza riso?

1717
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And he sent one. But then also then after sending the statement, he said, well, you know, I'm at L.A.X. right now.

1718
01:25:49,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I'm coming to the show. So now to make the statement officially here in person, pizza is the longest time defender on Podcast The Ride.

1719
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Please welcome our pal Doug Jones.

1720
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:09,000
This is very brief statement.

1721
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
This is basically what I texted you yesterday.

1722
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I'm just going to read it out loud in front of the audience.

1723
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Oh, well, thanks for saving me the reading work.

1724
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
I mean, thank you for flying across the country so I could save my voice a little bit.

1725
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I'm so happy to see you, by the way, Doug.

1726
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Happy to have you on stage with us finally.

1727
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Let's you start at all this.

1728
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
How do you feel right now?

1729
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I'll tell you how I felt yesterday when I texted you.

1730
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,000
And then I'll follow that up by just my opinions on some things that were expressed on stage.

1731
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
OK, OK. All right.

1732
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And this will all be very brief.

1733
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Here we go.

1734
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I never thought I'd get anyone to take me seriously.

1735
01:26:47,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Thank you, good boys and fellow Cliffords, for re-evaluating Pizza Rizzo as one of the finest theme park quick service restaurants of the 21st century.

1736
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
We had to. We had to.

1737
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Thank you for your bravery so early.

1738
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Yes.

1739
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So early.

1740
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
You spoke up just like you wanted.

1741
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Yes, we're speaking up.

1742
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
But it seems like you have to speak up about some other stuff, too.

1743
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Just there was some criticism of the quality of the food.

1744
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
And I just to that, I just want to say, shut up.

1745
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
It's it's fucking rat pizza.

1746
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Wow.

1747
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Wow.

1748
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Doug, you said it.

1749
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Aggressive.

1750
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
It's fucking rat pizza.

1751
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I refuse to use the past tense here at the end of the show.

1752
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,000
It is fucking rat pizza and Pizza Rizzo is good.

1753
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And who's here?

1754
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Stay up with us.

1755
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Stay up with us.

1756
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And let me say to the group and to all of you, you survived podcast the ride.

1757
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Oh, my God.

1758
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000

1767
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Thank you, everybody.

1768
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
A tin roof Orlando.

1769
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Who's sticking around for the 10 o'clock?

1770
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Are we going to see again?

1771
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Good, good.
