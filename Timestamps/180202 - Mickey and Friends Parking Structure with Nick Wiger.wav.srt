00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,140
Warning, today's podcast clocks in at more than two hours and it's about a parking garage.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,940
It's the Mickey and Friends parking structure with Nick Weiger on Podcast, The Ride.

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,380
Welcome to podcast the ride a theme park podcast hosted by three members of an unsuccessful barbershop quartet

4
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,080
Joining me as always Jason Sheridan. Hi and Scott Gardner. Hey, that's right

5
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,620
And that that real mean diss was written by our guests today

6
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:54,200
You know him as a writer from comedy bang bang and at midnight and from the podcast doughboys ladies and gentlemen, it's Nick Weiger

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,480
Friends, that's why I'm known as the successor to the roast master general

8
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,540
When Jeff Ross hangs it up, I'll be assuming his mantle wearing his

9
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,100
General leasimo outfit whatever whatever. Yeah, he's got angley custom. Yeah

10
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,840
Yeah, you'll eventually grow to be able to fit into it perfectly

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,280
After the race after after the war a real a real thrill to be here guys really really enjoying here

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,420
Thanks so much, yeah, I don't know why we had you on

13
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,340
second of your we've had Mitch on right already and I don't know why we didn't have the like

14
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,520
informed person with a lot of

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,460
Theme park opinions. I don't know why you weren't first. Yeah. Well, I think you really though

16
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,760
Like I understood that you wanted to hear from Mitch on the episode. He was on

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,580
discussing

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,280
Disney world in Florida versus Disneyland out here in California. I understand you wanted to get his trenchant insights like

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,080
Disneyland's bad

20
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:05,040
Disney world so much better. So he pointed out that Disneyland is small. Yeah

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,540
There's more of it

22
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,100
we've also like

23
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,940
Like like we've we've all talked about

24
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,920
Theme park issues with you guys and you bring up writing park stuff on this on the show sometimes and I feel like you're your

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,300
opinions kind of I

26
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,940
don't know they they fall in line with how you guys are on the show where Mitch is this like a

27
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,640
kind of

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,520
populist

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,060
Distrusting immediately like he hates IP

30
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,060
Right in with him hating the new but the IP if the IP was when he was a kid, it's fine

31
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,000
That's what yeah

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,760
As to fall within that sweet spot of like having come having come out between like 1980 and like

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,540
1997 and if like it's in that range if it's in the those two the final two decades of the 20th century

34
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,780
It's good

35
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,640
Outside of that. It's bad

36
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,940
Yeah, I don't know like like and I don't want to just turn this into a proxy, you know sort of

37
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:07,280
Doughboy spat without my co-host here, but I do I do think that I do think that it's

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,280
It's interesting the resistance I get it but but some I noticed there's some sort of some resistance towards you know

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,500
the big one I feel like recently is

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,520
Tower of terror retrofitting that tower terror terror out here in LA retrofitting that as the Guardians of the Galaxy ride

41
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,400
and you know I get some hostility towards that because you have like this want this version that

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,320
exists that you're familiar with and

43
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,000
Then it gets replaced by this thing that was just like basically because it was a popular movie that came out in the past

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,100
ten years

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:46,340
But I mean, I think like if you actually take it on its merits the Guardians of the Galaxy, right is good, right?

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,680
Like it's really fun. It is a good ride really well received that animatronic is yeah one of the best animatronics in a long time

47
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,180
It's really good

48
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,580
And then Mitch just hates it without ever having been on it

49
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,880
Like he just he says it's bad and then if someone else has like written it and says it's bad

50
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,880
He's like they're right and if someone's like that's actually pretty good

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,880
He's like what are you talking about like it's it's maddening to have a discussion with them

52
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,020
Well, that's a weird one because like Tony longtime

53
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:22,260
Imagineer Tony Baxter who like helped build both tower of terrors is like yeah the the California adventure one was

54
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:29,080
Okay, but he was like totally fine with them redoing it because it's missing like the main

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,540
Well, I was gonna say and funny enough

56
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,040
We're pretty sure we we met him right after he rode the Guardians of the Galaxy ride for the first time

57
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,340
Yes, right Wow all three of us all three of us. This is before the podcast

58
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,560
This is like this is early last year

59
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,840
We were walking between Disneyland and Disney were excuse me just California Adventure

60
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,660
And we saw Tony Baxter and I was looking at my phone and Scott goes. Oh my god

61
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,840
It's Tony Baxter which most mild mannered you can you can all kind of our code when we all met like oh

62
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,000
We're all theme park fans apparently you know so and you start talking about Tony Baxter right away

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,920
He's one of the like code with that's like one of your ways in if you really end it

64
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,700
He's like he got it star tours. He did Indiana Jones. He did figment in Florida

65
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:17,300
Okay, he's done it so my Disney in Paris on her mountain big Thunder Mountain like this is a major heavyweight in the Imagineering

66
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,740
Akinda maybe this probably isn't perfect, but a kind of like a Steven Spielberg

67
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,340
It's kind of like oh this guy's had this degree of influence on his field. Yeah, I mean

68
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,720
Yeah

69
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,540
Similar to that Mike that you would like recognize it a deep comic book artist on site

70
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:41,980
Which a lot of people who've even read his work wouldn't like know what he looks like we know the iconic right only Baxter mustache

71
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,520
Yeah, so he had just ridden the ride

72
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,740
And we were walking me like oh excuse me

73
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,600
We're big fans of you and he like he's like well

74
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,220
Did you did you ride it and he pointed at the point of it and I was like yeah

75
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,340
And he's like give it the big thumbs up oh there you go and like not and obviously he wasn't gonna be like oh

76
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,500
Fucking IP man like right in rocket raccoon right still

77
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,460
Was my opinion to because the version in Florida is a little taller

78
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:16,340
But also there's a sequence in Florida that they never replicated anywhere else where the elevator leaves the elevator shaft and pushes forward

79
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:22,840
It's unbelievable through a giant recreation of the Twilight Zone opening credits. Oh my god

80
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,800
Cool. Yeah, and such a letdown when you go on this one, and it doesn't have that yeah

81
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,620
Oh, I didn't even know about that. Yeah, it was taller

82
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,360
It's not is it taller. Maybe a little bit

83
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,380
It'll talk to you and the whole line is you walk up and there's a whole like there's all this like greens like shrubs

84
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,080
And like it's really sets the mood very well

85
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,320
And now like at the end to like there's a there's a show scene at the end when you come down

86
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,820
And there's like the puppet from Twilight Zone at the end and like there's a whole little room as you're like pulling back

87
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,760
That's not in this version. This one just like pops you in gets you up and down and it sucks compared comparatively

88
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,420
It's still a good fun ride that I write but it's when you're like comparing it to that. Geez. This is that's crazy

89
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,540
This is the hill that Mitch is dying

90
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:14,400
Lesser did even like the Twilight Zone the Tower of Terror to begin with or is it just the idea the awful notion that the new

91
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,740
Guardians because they are new that they're in the theme park. Well, that's what it is

92
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,360
Like no one cares about these characters and then like some people say that a message boards too when it's like that the numbers

93
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,000
Really tell you otherwise. Yeah, it's not true at all. These are very popular kids like these movies a lot

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,260
Well, I'm like Florida there, you know, yeah, they're taking these characters

95
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:40,340
Nobody cares about and and you know get kicking out, you know, Ellen and Bill Nye

96
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:47,160
Yeah, I don't know it's it's an odd I yeah, I'm off I

97
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,100
There's a lot of I don't I don't even like Marvel movies

98
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,040
I'm not even sure where I land on the new Star Wars movies, but like in the parks all bets are off

99
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,640
Yeah, we're all pretty

100
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, we're all pretty progressive when it comes to like changes right park. I feel like you know, we're we're not conservative

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,380
We're not stodgy conservatives

102
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:12,120
well for me it's like and I appreciate that perspective because you guys very easily could be you know cranks and it would still sort of

103
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,940
I mean, there's a world where you guys are theme park cranks and you don't want anything to change

104
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,860
But I think like

105
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,340
For me the big the big factor in towards what Scott was saying because I'm not someone who sees every Marvel movie and the

106
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,540
Ones I see are generally like like, you know, check out Ant-Man and like alright, you know

107
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,180
Yeah, that got the job done. Like I don't I don't have like a I'm not I'm gonna say static

108
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,980
Reaction to seeing Thanos or whatever like I don't care that much

109
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,660
But I understand these movies are you know important to some people and I also

110
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,580
For me the big proof of concept for this sort of theming can result in a great

111
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:56,180
Park attraction is Cars Land. Yes my favorites and the Cars movies are not great like they're fine

112
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,680
I think I don't think I'd go any higher than fine

113
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,000
Would you go all the way into like bad terrible? Are you mad at him? No, they don't suck

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,420
They're just like they're but you know, I'm not gonna go full lights camera Jackson and say that's Pixar at its best

115
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,280
There they're fine they're probably

116
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:22,580
Towards the the the low end of Pixar's output. They're like they're not that great. They're not the good dinosaur, but they're not great

117
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:35,160
Not so they open the land yeah, the good dinosaur land could be fine. Yeah. Yeah

118
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,900
Yeah, so so yeah, I mean like you put more Marvel shit in this the park

119
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,760
I don't care if that's what triggers great new attractions

120
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,620
And I agree I think I think you'd be really impressed to find somebody who doesn't like Cars Land that right?

121
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,980
It's an incredible addition and

122
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,840
Yes, just some of the most the best like immersive theming and rock work and gives you that route 66 vibe

123
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,260
And yeah, you can like a vibe from a movie without liking the sure. Yeah, absolutely

124
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,280
Yeah, the aesthetic is great for a theme park. It just really really works

125
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,240
Well for something that you're going to inhabit

126
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,460
I had one thing on Tower Tower of Terror real quick the the because I've only been on the LA version now

127
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,480
I'm very excited to try the Florida version to see this this extra

128
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,320
Leg that Jason mentioned, but so do they do they still in its most recent?

129
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,900
Because I can't remember the last time I wrote it before it got converted

130
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,000
They still have a moment where like a bellhop would give a little orientation in the lobby

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,560
They sort of like a lobby or there was a point where a bellhop would sort of give a little speech of like

132
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,820
You know like welcome to the Tower of Terror

133
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,660
This is a this is a tower of mystery and grandeur where any like there was like a little live-action

134
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,920
Huh, I don't I don't recall that this so maybe this was something because I this this would have been early a visit

135
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,500
In the very early 2000s, right observe this but I think they they later took it out

136
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,360
Because it was a moment. I remember that really took me out of the Disney

137
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,860
Experience because the performer was so awful

138
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:11,400
Like it was this woman who was had been cast as a bellhop and she was supposed to talk about this spooky corridor

139
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
Where you know?

140
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,800
Whatever where the rules of science do not apply and where you might meet an untimely end

141
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,040
but she's delivering it like like

142
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,080
This is the Tower of Terror

143
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,920
That's really tipping a lot of what's about to happen

144
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:36,120
And she was really like it was just it was just the worst like most stilted delivery to the point where I was like

145
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,800
How did you get this job? Like why are you here?

146
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,940
Why aren't you a cashier over at the like next to the a bugs life like stage show?

147
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,680
Like why is why is this your job in Disney parks? Yeah. Yeah, that's very odd because the cast member interaction

148
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,620
I associate with Tower of Terror is like once they make sure you're buckled in and the door is closing

149
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,360
Like the I think they kind of give them the freedom to have some fun with it

150
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,720
Oh, like sometimes they'll go like your rooms are ready sleep

151
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,100
well

152
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,880
or like some people some people get really in character other people would just be like enjoy your stay, you know, like

153
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,240
And and not really do a big thing about it

154
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,920
But the ones who are really into it like really would go into it like Haunted Mansion

155
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,280
It's a good area. Yeah fun and get somebody with a lot of personality

156
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,420
How do you end up with this flat person but you get a lot of duds

157
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,840
Yeah, you do get a lot of duds on Haunted Mansion

158
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,080
You get a lot of duds at Tower of Terror where people just kind of brush

159
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,320
I mean this sounds like it's just like she was reaching and didn't get it

160
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,100
Yeah, she yeah, she was she was trying but she didn't have the chops to pull it off. Yeah. Yeah the the other thing the

161
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:49,660
Speaking of the the bellhop who has a little bit of creative liberty the last time I rode the actual Tower of Terror

162
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,160
As with my wife and

163
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,120
the

164
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,460
So like you finish the ride and the doors open at the end and our bellhop attendant had like was crouched down

165
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,680
And then so when the doors opened he jumped up and went ah and gave us like an extra scare and everyone loved it

166
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,500
That's great. Yeah

167
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,620
I've had that happen. I think once and yes, it's delightful

168
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,040
It's great when you get because I do think at these parks you get

169
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,080
Like there's an extra you can get an extra bit of magic by the cast member doing something fun and like that

170
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,020
There was a time when the stormtrooper I'll never forget. It was a guy dressed as a stormtrooper

171
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,880
I felt like a guy grabbed my arm aggressively. I turned around

172
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,300
It was a stormtrooper in line of star tours Wow

173
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,620
and then like there was a kid there and he was trying to cut the line and he like

174
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,520
Booted the kid like softly with his foot to get him out of like out of the line

175
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,960
I it's we all like we're delight would delight it. It's crazy how that does that is such a big deal

176
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,680
Right having like a college student try a little bit

177
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,000
That sort of

178
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,260
Well, like that's that is a big big deal. And yeah, you can really it can really bring it down when there's not doing it

179
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:03,280
There's this great in thing. I recommend to anybody going to Las Vegas where there's a there's in the M&M store on the strip

180
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:11,220
There is a 3d movie that was made only for that specific location with the like the the

181
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,560
90s

182
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,220
CGI

183
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:19,320
Red and yellow the I don't know. I never met the guy. All right does exist

184
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:27,160
From the Christmas ads but they let you there's a little like adventure of them in Las Vegas in a 3d movie and the the in

185
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,240
to get into it is like a you're in an M&M's laboratory and

186
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,880
At the beginning a really nonplussed high school student in an ill-fitting lab coats

187
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,600
It's like welcome to the M&M's laboratory. I am the professor

188
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,760
I've been twice now here at least but the two is that extra or is that free? That's just free

189
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,540
Strip especially. Oh my god. Oh man get a couple drinks and wander into the M&M's

190
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:02,260
3d movie it's like packed every time but I still feel like I was shocked when I ran into what do you mean?

191
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,460
There's a 3d movie up here and then like, you know bad stilted interaction with like red

192
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,000
What are you doing red get out of there red? It's it's it's something else

193
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,740
So he's acting against the pre-recorded film for a little bit

194
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,860
There's some like machine that they get sucked into and then you move into their adventure like oh

195
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,560
I think I think I think one of them loses their M and that's the plot

196
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:33,820
And then but then the solution at the end ends up being all the minis who all like form giant objects together

197
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,820
I'll have the fish and finding Nemo like they all work as nanobots

198
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,660
And rescue the M from some scary factory check it out

199
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:49,240
Three years we're just gonna dissect the M&M

200
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:59,960
Well, that's well we should talk a little more about your theme park history you're right now your Southern, California native

201
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,660
What'd you what'd you like growing up? Yeah, so from Lakewood, California

202
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:11,680
Which is a suburb of Long Beach, California a little better known and that's the city in which I went to middle school in high school

203
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,660
And we had the the orchestras and bands I played in at school

204
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:24,880
Charles Evans Hughes middle school in Long Beach and Long Beach Polytechnic High School would sometimes make

205
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,380
trips to Disneyland to play in the

206
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,880
What is it? What is that? The the

207
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,900
Carnation Plaza, is that what it's called?

208
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:42,960
Is that now become part of this little fantasy land

209
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,940
Is that what they call that now

210
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,720
But are like kind of outside the cast

211
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,260
Yeah, it used to be associated with the Carnation company and and you would go would be near where they they sell the ice cream and we

212
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,380
do a little orchestra show or

213
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,060
When I was in marching band boy, you know what?

214
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,060
I guess I don't remember ever actually marching but we must have what at why else would we be there?

215
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,640
So we must have done we must have been involved in a parade in some capacity

216
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,660
but so like yeah, I made a lot of outside of just just going a lot with my

217
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,180
Family because we were close by and it you know, it was like a 25 minute drive and it was it was

218
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,040
You know probably about an annual thing

219
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,440
I probably I'd go an additional time most years just for some band trip and we'd also go to

220
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,920
Six Flags Magic Mountain, but that was usually just like a fun thing a fun activity for the band

221
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,100
So big yeah, right, but I but pretty early on, you know, like it at age 12

222
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,500
I was in the backstage and I was seeing you know

223
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,420
I remember seeing Merlin smoking a cigarette and I was just like wow, this is really

224
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:51,720
This is crazy to see behind the scenes at Disneyland at an age where I'm young enough where I don't you know, I

225
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,980
Understand that this is like a show but I'm also like not quite an adult where I you know

226
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,040
Fully grasp until I see it that oh, these are just people kind of doing a job, you know

227
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:09,500
Yeah, sure. Um, and yeah, I mean and so it's so a lot of trips there. I was very very like you guys

228
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,040
I was very scared of

229
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,560
Unlike you guys I grew out of it

230
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:26,960
Yeah, I also grew out of it at some point and I will pretty much ride anything all right

231
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:33,040
Standing up thing because I've ridden some standing up roller coasters and they are not made for men of a five one

232
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,920
They either hurt my shoulders or my dick

233
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:46,340
But it's a yeah, I do remember I went to Disney World when I was a kid kind of all over the place here

234
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,000
But when I was like even though we went to Disneyland a lot

235
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,680
We got we did take a family trip to Disney World when when I was eight where I remember crying on

236
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,980
Their big thunder mountain equivalent they have a big thunder mountain there, right?

237
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,780
Yeah, big thunder. Yeah, yeah that we're crying on their big thunder and that that kind of scared me off of thrill rides for a bit

238
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,880
And then I got back on that horse eventually I think due to peer pressure

239
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeah at Six Flags Magic Mountain some classmates cajoling me got me to ride Colossus a wooden coaster there

240
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,640
At age 11 or 12 and from that point on I've enjoyed the role. I've enjoyed the coasters. Mm-hmm

241
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,540
and then a lot of time spent at

242
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,060
Probably the the the amusement park I've been to the most it might honestly be Disneyland at this point

243
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:36,500
But but at some point in my life, I just racked up so many trips to Wild Rivers, which is now closed theme park

244
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,140
Raging Waters is the other big Southern California water park

245
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,540
And that was the one that's in Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. They go down the slide with Napoleon

246
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,620
that's the one in San Dimas, California and

247
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,840
But Wild Rivers was like the one in Irvine and I went did you ever go there Scott? No, I do not

248
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:01,580
I'm trying to think that's where is that where the Irvine Meadows is? Yeah. Yeah, and there was also like a safari park

249
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,980
Yeah, there was yeah that that there was there weren't I don't know if they were of the same ownership

250
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:12,720
But it was the same general area and so I went there a lot for just one just day camps like Cub Scout day camp or just

251
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,760
Like, you know

252
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,420
Whatever those those camps are that they that parents drop off their kids during the summer just so they don't have to take care

253
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,900
Of them

254
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,300
I was in like I was in those like constantly like school would end and then it was like in a day camp for the entire summer

255
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,640
Just to get out of my parents way. I guess actually they were probably working is what it was

256
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,920
They were they had jobs to go to and this was a functional daycare

257
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,400
But not always at Wild Rivers not always at Wild Rivers, but it was like a very frequent trip like oh we're taking this

258
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,340
This is a cheap, you know, whatever like it costs eight dollars per kid to get him in

259
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,080
And I remember we'd pack lunches to go there

260
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,020
We'd have a sack lunch that we'd eat and then we just ride we just go on water slides all day

261
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,240
So you didn't there wasn't some educational onus you know, you could just run around. No. Yeah, pretty much

262
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,060
I mean, I remember being hurted a little bit

263
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,340
But beyond that it was just a way to keep kids occupied for you know, you know six to eight hours

264
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,400
Everybody in the in the the unified shirts. Were you all some like some particular monkey?

265
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,680
We must have been yeah, we must have been we must have had whatever that camp shirt what what the hell

266
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,320
I can't even remember the name of the camp down

267
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,980
But yeah, we must have we must have had something like that

268
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,640
and

269
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,420
Yeah, honestly, like I don't remember that this is a this is a little bit of a of a tangent

270
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,380
But you know something of a doughy kid

271
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:34,220
But I don't remember there being a big shirt on swimming contingent at that point

272
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,160
There was still like I because I do remember being shirtless there and feeling a little embarrassed

273
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,820
But yeah, that's tough. Right you said like wait or like middle school. This was younger than that

274
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,500
This was this was this was as a preteen

275
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,240
This is when we went to Wild Rivers, but I had a weird that this is a thing

276
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm just remembering I told for whatever reason I guess I thought it would be a funny story to tell my parents

277
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,160
But I made up a baseless lie about this kid Matt

278
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,420
There's this ride at Wild Rivers called the Python which is this this like kind of crazy

279
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,500
waterslide

280
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,580
wasn't I think the craziest one was a Cobra and the Python was like the Cobra jr and

281
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,440
So I told my parents that this kid Matt

282
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,000
like he loved the Python and he wouldn't stop writing the Python and

283
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,800
All day he'd ride the Python and then just run back up the stairs and write it again on a continuous loop and

284
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,100
They thought it was so funny, I think they told Matt's parents about it

285
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,000
And then I thought back on it was like why did I come up with that?

286
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,800
And why did that why would that resonate as like a good story? I have no idea when this began

287
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,360
I was worried you were gonna say that Matt was a lifeguard or something who touched you inappropriate

288
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,980
No, it wasn't even that was the thing it was like a total white lie

289
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,040
It was just like why like this is a harmless thing

290
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,060
But also completely untrue like why did I say maybe there was an element of truth

291
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,860
Maybe he said it was his favorite ride at some point and exaggerated. I don't even remember it

292
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,700
But yeah, it's weird. My actual childhood was just doing that for real

293
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,700
Like that was the reality my parents lived right there was some

294
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,740
Right. I can't remember what it was now, but I just remember there was one night if it was

295
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,180
If it was a waterslide connected to like a big

296
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:30,260
Themed hotel pool or if it was something in it would have had to have been something in Florida where my brother and I would just

297
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:35,280
Get off and our parents were just like, you know on a bench close by or something

298
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Because they didn't really want to ride it or they had written it enough and we would just do the like we're going again

299
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,160
and just go again

300
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,900
because every now and then like

301
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:51,240
The Florida parks like if you stay at the Disney hotels like hotel guests get an extra

302
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,020
Either hour or so in the morning or hour and so at night. That's amazing and then it's like

303
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,600
Really empty like the whole park, right?

304
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,480
And I'm sure it was something like that and I can't remember what it was now

305
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,180
I yeah, I stayed at the the Disneyland hotel and they have this really cool

306
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,360
Waterside that's like kind of looks like the old-school monorail

307
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:19,100
Setup, but with a waterslide inside it and I I did it over and over you could not get me out of there

308
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:25,320
But then I had to go because my wife said we had to go because the wedding we were going to was in

309
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,140
20 minutes. This was five years ago and I was at the wedding with very wet hair

310
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,740
I don't know why I didn't then use a hair dryer to fix this right? She's still mad about that one

311
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,860
I used to David love for

312
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,320
Such a slobber your wedding

313
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,180
I did that same thing two years ago did not have a wedding to go to did not it just

314
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,140
Throw that slide a bunch because no one else was there lucky you have adults

315
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,920
Three of us all have I have a still my I

316
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,660
We there was it was very late at the park and I was there with my mom and sister and they were gonna let us

317
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,660
Ride start tours because no one was in line and they were gonna just let us do it

318
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:09,340
My sister got sick like on the second time and I was so mad at her because we had to get off like so

319
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,180
Like I think there's something common here that we would all ride these things for infinity

320
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:21,760
We would all we were worried your story about about the Python we would all we're all guys that would ride the Python forever

321
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,440
Yeah, it's plausible that that that's like it's like I didn't it didn't even need to be made up because I probably there

322
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,140
Probably just another kid. I could have just said that about I don't know

323
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,460
I don't know where it came from it also

324
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:37,260
Integra people have been listening to this podcast a little bit a big common thing seems to be trying to break the record on

325
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,100
these rides

326
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,980
I did this 18 times I

327
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,660
Yeah, my friend Perry was touting his Dudley do right rip saw falls record I couldn't tell you the accuracy

328
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,420
They probably tell kids every day. You just broke the record

329
00:25:53,420 --> 00:26:00,620
The records are not being kept right so and if it's next to water, it's impossible to keep the records

330
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,700
so

331
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:09,600
Well, I mean my my favorite like family story of like redoing stuff a bunch and I may have told I can't remember

332
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,180
I told this before on the show

333
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:17,220
I do want to make my dad call in and tell it because he tells it a very long a longer version a very funny way

334
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,260
There used to be like this

335
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,540
Immersive comedy club in Pleasure Island in Florida

336
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,220
Which was like a district of nightclubs Disney had in the early to mid 90s

337
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,660
And there was a place called the adventurers club, okay, which was like themed to a

338
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,580
Early 20th century like explorers club and rice there was loosely scripted

339
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,800
Mostly improvised like should there be a different show in the library and then in the study and then in the bar and there was

340
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,340
a giant animatronic

341
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:51,520
like totem that would talk to people and there was a night where I made my dad get up and

342
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,720
Do the bit with the totem because they gave you a pin they gave you an adventure club pin that you couldn't buy and I'm like

343
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,880
You gotta get me that

344
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,720
But then we came out like as it was closing and it wasn't a place I could go to alone like because it's an it was

345
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,600
Like at a certain point they're like you have to have a parent with you here

346
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,600
It is a nightclub district and we came out and there was like an electrical storm going

347
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,200
And the bus stopped back to the hotel was like two and a half blocks away. Oh, yeah

348
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,780
So we're running through like thunderstorms is like terrifying like they is going above us and just like walking

349
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,300
Walk back into the hotel and they're just laughing at us in the lobby

350
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,400
I like the people working the front desk that pin is a potential conductor of lightning. Yes

351
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,920
You have it still yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Oh, yeah wonderful bring it on the show

352
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,880
Yeah refer to it for being yeah, I clink it around on the mic the the summer that reminds me the summer

353
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,740
We went to Disney World

354
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:53,780
My family went to was Disney World and it was just like I had never really I mean it rains out at Disneyland

355
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,600
But it's not like I guess as common as it is in Florida

356
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,960
And so there was like a torrential downpour and so we had we basically were in a situation where we had to get

357
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,260
Ponchos and I remember I was very excited to get a

358
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,280
Dick Tracy rain slicker

359
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,860
It is famous. There was one. Yeah, the Warren Beatty Dick Tracy movie was in theaters and

360
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,160
It was like a you know, like like his like his famous yellow raincoat

361
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,660
except it was in poncho form and then it had Dick Tracy written on the back and his silhouette and

362
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,720
I was so excited to wear it and I wore it like, you know

363
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,400
The for the all the rain that was going on and then when it was back to school time

364
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:38,020
I still had this Dick Tracy poncho, but it was like Dick Tracy wasn't cool anymore

365
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,280
And so I remember wearing this Dick Tracy poncho while it was raining but just leaning

366
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,860
Against a tree so no one would see the Dick Tracy logo on the back

367
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:53,000
They just thought I was wearing a plain yellow poncho. It's like a giant logo with him looking at the watch. Yeah

368
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,100
There would have been there would have been a pretty tiny window and Dick Tracy was cool

369
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,280
Yeah, yeah, no cuz I remember when the McDonald's promotion was going on that was fun that was fun

370
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,360
Yeah, and but that was it. I once the McDonald's promotion was over. I feel like no one cared any

371
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:14,660
That was either the first or second movie. I saw in theaters Wow trace it really no one which is kind of horrific

372
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:20,940
So there's some weird stuff in that movie lips manless getting the bath is so yeah

373
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,760
they have so they this this guy and they've all got grotesque makeup, which is horrifying in and of itself, but

374
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,240
Lips manless is killed very early on and the way they kill him is he's like he's very scared

375
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,160
He's like not the bath big boy. Not the bat

376
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,660
Like he's like very afraid of dying and then they just cover him with cement

377
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,660
This is what's called the bath. I like they put him in a crate and they cover him with cement

378
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:49,120
Alive and then they throw him into a river and it's just like very early on in the in the movie and it's super grim

379
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,560
It's like something that would be in like, you know, Donnie Brosco. It's just it's it's very I'm pretty sure I then like

380
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,320
Made my action figures take the bath

381
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:07,480
Incorporated that into my child like fun play with play dough with like play dough or sand or something

382
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:14,720
So Nick, yes, we're doing theme parks like we're two were three guys who when we were kids we were like

383
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,820
Dreaming of them. Did you have like kind of an obsession with them?

384
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,480
Or was it just some fun thing you did once in a while? I would say more towards the ladder

385
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,360
It wasn't a thing I was thinking about all the time. I certainly had some some great

386
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,620
Memories and some great days spent there

387
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:36,300
But maybe because I went with some frequency that the man I got kind of got numb to the magic a little bit

388
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,220
Right. It wasn't a thing. I was I was constantly daydreaming about

389
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,480
Right. So just a regular

390
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:50,600
Attachments a regular kid. I think I was more I was more interested in video games and sure then than than theme parks

391
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,440
That's by the way the normal reaction

392
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,180
Human reaction to be like, oh that's fun to go to once in a while

393
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:03,260
As opposed to me or you guys who would see the stock report come in and there was a picture of all the balloons on

394
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,760
Main Street and I used to just sit there dreaming about owning a bunch of balloons

395
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,560
Like those did the Mickey year balloons like it's so vivid in my mind of like wow, they're all the different colors

396
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,980
Will I get to see Disney afternoon Avenue a second time while it's open?

397
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:26,200
Yeah, yeah god pretty pretty fixed. What do I what's your what's your deal these days? Do you do it often?

398
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,120
Yeah, I mean I went to Disneyland last year

399
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,900
With some co-workers after a job that it ended and that was kind of just like a fun work thing

400
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,920
But you know, I definitely like the adult theme park experience. I think adult theme park experience has gotten better

401
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,140
Especially I think with there's more

402
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:49,160
There are more grown-up beverages, you know, like there's more like nice places to get a drink

403
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:55,600
Not just like cheap beer if you if you're into alcohol and and also I feel like

404
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,000
I

405
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,440
Don't know. I feel like this is just because the attractions have gotten better. It's like you can still you like

406
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:08,400
Like the you know, you can still have the nostalgic appreciation for the these old ones that you went to as a kid

407
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,600
You're Pirates of the Caribbean's and your Matterhorns and what-have-you but like that like the new attractions coming in and being sleeker

408
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,720
It's like it's something that you can go and still be kind of impressed by

409
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,920
You know, you don't have to just be a kid to be wowed by something

410
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,100
You still can kind of like we're talking about with Guardians of the Galaxy

411
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:29,020
You still see this these the new tech that's being shown off there and be like, oh, this is pretty cool

412
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:35,580
That's a lot of it for me and why I don't really care what the IP or characters like it like matter what it's a display

413
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,260
Of some insane often like military grade technology that when would you like?

414
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:46,160
Why would you get to experience this? Yeah as a civilian that's that's kind of like that sort of true throughout, right?

415
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,540
Like I mean certainly like flight simulators comes from the that came out of military technology

416
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:59,660
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, like some area 51 right our tours probably out of simulator technology

417
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,540
It's just like the same. It's just like simulating and then of course mission space in Epcot

418
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:09,600
Which is literally simulating going into space, which is why it killed a couple people

419
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,420
Going into space is very hard on your body. That's not a thing you should be doing

420
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,400
You should not eat a cinnamon roll underneath

421
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:26,220
Drink a big sugary coffee drink and then experience a few G forces not spaceship Earth mission space

422
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,160
No, no, I said you're eating. Oh, I see. I see beforehand you get right

423
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:35,600
I thought you were saying that your experience on spaceship Bruce was it was so intense

424
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,620
That it was too much for you

425
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:45,320
I had a pre and post I had one beforehand to ready myself and then one to reward myself for doing

426
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,920
Quick sign. Oh, you can take food and drink on spaceship Earth because I did it last time I was there

427
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,680
That's crazy

428
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:57,600
Like I had like a bag of something like nuts and like a water and no one stopped me

429
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,060
So you could like throw a big beer on to the Steve Jobs esque figure

430
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:07,480
Yes in his garage. Yeah, you could ruin the Sistine Chapel

431
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,260
Oh

432
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,280
It helps it with ice really

433
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,920
Easy, so well so of everything of everything in the theme park world

434
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,400
You sent us a list of stuff to talk about and few options

435
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,640
Yeah, we went through it and considered it and of all the things for some reason we landed on we really wanted to talk about

436
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:33,580
The Mickey and Friends parking structure. I love it at the very least because it's a very funny episode

437
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:40,760
Like I can only like I'm just imagining people's reactions of looking at their phone on a Friday morning

438
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,120
I was like, oh, there's a new app. What the hell?

439
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:51,960
This boring man wants to discuss a boring topic I guess that's on brand the ball road carpool

440
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,880
Yeah, it's it's pretty elemental

441
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,420
Yeah, when I been thinking about in the last couple days was this

442
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,360
Was it was it kind of a dare or was it or do you do you do you have a lot of stuff to

443
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,680
Say about the Mickey honestly, like I'm not sure how much I have to say like I mean

444
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,740
I think we could probably find it did you know discuss anything at like this this podcast is all about you know, yeah

445
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,080
Yeah mining minutiae

446
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:26,740
Stringing that thread. Yeah, I can so, you know, but honestly, this is a thing

447
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,520
My wife Natalie and I when we go to

448
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,700
Disneyland together and you know, sometimes you'll get the Mickey and Friends parking structure and other times

449
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,300
You'll get some other lot like the woody lot or something some just like adjunct lot

450
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:45,420
But we're always like there's always like an extra thrill when we get that Mickey and Friends parking structure and it's thing

451
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,780
We've talked about because she you know design is something that she is

452
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:55,660
very conscious of and it's a thing that I'm I'm aware of and I used to ostensibly be a

453
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:01,260
Designer of working working in the video game industry. So it's just such a a great

454
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,040
Functional I'm using the word design again

455
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:10,900
But design is a great functional design and and and it's just so efficient and I feel like it's like the beginning of

456
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,740
In the same way that I mentioned raging waters earlier and like when you park it raging waters is my memory of it

457
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:22,000
It's like a dirt lot. It's like so janky. It's like yeah, it's like the

458
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,540
sloppiest

459
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,620
Beginning of what's supposed to be a day of suspension of belief or just like a day of fun and

460
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,860
Windy and sharp hills and weird turns exactly. I went up there

461
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,180
Yeah

462
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,240
And then you get on like an an

463
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,500
Unair-conditioned bus like just said like a decommissioned school bus and that's what's taking you to the park proper

464
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,820
Like that's their tram system

465
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:47,960
Like it's really really janky and then that's that's your end of day too. Like after you've had a day of fun

466
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,420
That's how you're going home that so you you're in your you're beginning and end

467
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,300
It's being bookended by this kind of like a clumsy

468
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,280
Experience and I think the opposite is true with the Mickey and Friends parking structure because you're going in there

469
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,740
It's a breeze you're being guided like basically

470
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:08,420
Directly to a space because of the cone system and the you know, they've got an abundance of attendance

471
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:13,440
They've got so many attendance working there showing you exactly it feels like you're getting valet while you're driving yourself

472
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,380
It's like they're guiding you to exactly where you're supposed to park. It's a perfect use of every space is occupied

473
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,420
It's not like there's a you're gonna drive by a bunch of empty spaces and and you know

474
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:30,100
It's all being used and then there's the escalators that go this to me is what puts it over the top

475
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,100
There's escalators that go directly from your level to the ground

476
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,380
Yeah

477
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:40,280
You don't have to go like down a flaw a few flights to some other levels of the parking structure that you'd have no reason

478
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,260
Like if you parked on level four

479
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,740
There's no reason you'd ever have to go to level two

480
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:49,360
You've gotten there's nothing for you there. You want to go from four to the ground. They have a direct path

481
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,180
And and to me that's very elegant in terms of getting in and out at the end of the day

482
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,420
Damn, yeah, really?

483
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:03,220
You're run down by the level. We're blown away by that. Yeah about this. Yeah, and I absolutely agree. It's

484
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,720
Yeah, you know, you know, you don't really find and by the way just to totally

485
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:14,000
In case you don't know this is the major parking structure at the we're talking about a parking garage

486
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:21,520
But not just any part garage for a time and it may still be this was the biggest parking garage in America

487
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Like this part garage built in 2000 deal with the I will tell you that

488
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,860
No longer it is no longer to look at these notes

489
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,460
It is okay

490
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:35,240
The largest parking garage in the United States now is at the SeaTac airport in Seattle and no

491
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:42,380
Wow spaces out ranking the Mickey and Friends parking structure. I want to say that full name every time. Yeah

492
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,640
Like Guardians of the Galaxy mission breakout

493
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:53,860
Mickey and Friends parking structure has 10,000 spaces the biggest in the world is the West Edmonton Mall in Canada

494
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,720
20,000 Wow

495
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,500
double imagine a structure double the that's crazy

496
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:05,300
Yes, it requires such imagination. Not even the Imagineers could dream it

497
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,880
But everybody at the time it opened though the biggest parking

498
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:17,820
Yeah, right an interesting jumping off point to just talk about how Disney handles transportation in general

499
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:23,140
Sure, let let's go Jason and I did we were talking about this Jason and I are not from Southern, California

500
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:31,140
So we never got to experience the original Disneyland parking lot, which is famously just a parking lot in it's where California Adventure is now

501
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:37,560
Yeah, it's just a parking lot in front of the theme park and you would park and walk up like what let's ask you guys Scott

502
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,060
California boys, you got to tell us what was it like I

503
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,860
Remember it being and Scott I'm interested in your thoughts

504
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:51,220
I remember being a gigantic surface lot just like a huge like just basically parking as far as the eye could see I remember

505
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:57,100
It being similar to what would occur if you angry about that

506
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:06,240
But what you would what you would encounter at outside like for me just I remember going to angels games and Dodgers games

507
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,460
The same sort of thing just like the giant like ballpark

508
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,620
surface lot and then certainly like the characters

509
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,040
Which is an element they've retained it at you know

510
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,300
I basically I think at every theme park parking structure and then it's certainly a thing in the Mickey and Friends

511
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:29,000
Parking structure, but there they it's actually color-coded and then tied directly to the escalators. So it's it's like even more clear

512
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,960
It's even harder to mess up

513
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,440
But the but yeah, it's just giant surface lot and then you know

514
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,720
You'd be parked next to dopey or whatever and that would be your guide

515
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,000
You'd have to remember that to find your car at the end of the day

516
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,740
I remember being easy to get like lost like it was just like a little too big and sprawling

517
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,120
I don't know what's your memory then those characters were very small

518
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,980
Like you have to squint probably to be able to tell which dwarf it was or whatever

519
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,980
Is that pongo or is that?

520
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,940
So did they have like I have so many questions about what it was like

521
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:08,420
So was it like because in the new Mickey and Friends parking structure, they have they'll have like a whole level

522
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,360
That's Daisy. Yes, and they'll have like a number and letter that corresponds with so be like Daisy 2d

523
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,260
And that's like a section of the parking lot. Yeah, and you'll remember there

524
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,640
Did they have these numbers and letters to correspond or was it just like that joke on the Simpsons where we're in the itchy lot?

525
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:28,780
Yeah, just the character and you have to remember like that's could be like one of a thousand spaces

526
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,400
Yeah, I don't remember specifically enough, but I don't think it was as

527
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,960
Crystal clear as it is with the Mickey and Friends parking structure

528
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,840
I remember it just being the character and then you just you know

529
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,680
You'd be there be goofy and then you just kind of know you were generally in the periphery of goofy

530
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,900
You're kind of in his territory. But like that. Yeah the Mickey and Friends

531
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,320
Structure so they even go to the level where on the receipt

532
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,660
They have the they have like a guide printed on it

533
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,740
Yeah, you like and if you have a you have a writing implement in your car

534
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:04,460
You can circle. Yeah, you can circle the G and you can circle the 7 and so, you know exactly where you are on whichever

535
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,040
Characters level you're at it's pretty great. I fun little game of bingo. Yeah

536
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,200
I had never realized because I like those escalators and I always use the escalators

537
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,620
Elevator buttons in the garage elevator have the characters on yeah

538
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:24,500
So if you just remember if you don't remember what level you number you're on, I just go like, oh right. We're at goofy

539
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Yeah, let me shut it out real quick to six mini five Donald for goofy three Mickey to Daisy one

540
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,780
I think nothing one is just no one is Chippendale. Oh

541
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:41,800
God I took the time to make a list and I screwed up the list according to the elevator buttons

542
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,560
Is this Daisy's highest profile like attraction in the park?

543
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,580
I does she get any any anything bigger than this house in Toontown?

544
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,260
Yeah, it's sort of a facade though you can't go into it

545
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,380
I don't think it's like Minnie's house where there's a little like area actually to go in

546
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:05,260
It's just sort of a painted flat. Maybe right as Daisy's house. Does she just live it's or is it like a floor in Donald's boat?

547
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,700
Like under the she's on the starboard. Yeah

548
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,840
I'm not even sure if Daisy is fleshed out and like the classic Carl

549
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,440
Banks or Carl Banks Carl Barks. What was the name the cartoonist?

550
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,860
There's a series of Donald and uncle Scrooge comics that are like worldwide beloved and it's like

551
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,200
If Daisy

552
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,740
Poorly flesh. Yeah

553
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:38,380
Much more so and looking real bad these days next to Minnie who this week received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame

554
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,760
Congrats many. Congratulations to many Katy Perry was there in Minnie s. Cogarb

555
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,820
Saluting her and welcoming her. I guess a million dollars by the Disney Corporation

556
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:55,420
Where Minnie's dress and show up with Bob Iger? That's a little fun for dad though, right? Oh, yeah

557
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,480
There's two the two sexiest women he knows

558
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,620
Minnie and Katy Perry. I just saw her live

559
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:06,840
Two three days ago. Yeah, I went to Vegas to see her specifically and

560
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,120
Instead of the instead of anything instead of talking about something sexy that happened

561
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:17,480
I'm gonna say how she played basketball against a dad in the audience like a giant arcade style

562
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,980
Basketball game with a big inflatable ball and the dad one must have been a thrill for the

563
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,360
And if we really gave me the taste to I went straight into the New York New York casino

564
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,240
Past all of the casino games straight to the arcade

565
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,380
I had to play some hoops myself

566
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,980
It was great though

567
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:42,280
I don't know if this Katy Perry tour is still going or if she's done her LA dates or what Katy Perry a lot of fun

568
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,700
Yeah, and we enter not in the mini dress

569
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:55,480
It was Karl Barks I looked at us, okay, don't get mad at me what about yeah, yeah, you're correct that

570
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,080
Daisy's pretty that's a pretty big representation. Yeah, I'm pretty underrepresented

571
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,220
Utilized it should be like stitch instead of Daisy

572
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:10,560
But I think they I think they're I have to think just because the the psychology of this is

573
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,140
So thoroughly thought out that I think they they must be a reason why they I think they want to justify the color pink

574
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,160
I think they're like, oh we want this to be the pink

575
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,020
I'll make this the Daisy level right the color coding is very very clear

576
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:28,460
It might even be to the degree where it accommodates the colorblind like it might just fall into that red green spectrum

577
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,280
Sure, I don't know so like yeah, maybe not

578
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:39,640
Isn't there a thing in the 80 like there's a very specific set of rules of like the central six or the means that like

579
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:44,040
Characters you mean yeah that like Mickey Minnie Pluto goofy

580
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:50,740
Donald Daisy like there there are very there were and I think it loosened up and now I'm sure it's but then Chippendale

581
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:57,500
Are on this too. So yeah, that's true. They got enough floors become primary because yeah as of the 40s and 50s

582
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,900
They were just like pests bothering Donald right suddenly there among the primary

583
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:08,240
Best of friends with the whole game. I would think Pooh Bear would you would go with over the Chippendale, right?

584
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,620
Yeah, he's much more prominent in the part somewhere. There's no is there a poop

585
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,920
There's no put this Toy Story lot ease or there was

586
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:23,060
And there's a Pinocchio. Now why is Pinocchio one of the primary ones? Yeah. Hmm. I don't work a variation

587
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,380
Oh, there you go. There probably is something to all that

588
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:33,240
I'm sure if you looked into it. Yeah, yeah, I think in the old in the original lot they were I think they chose characters

589
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,560
They tried to have all 26 letters of the alphabet

590
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:42,120
But there are I think are no characters of X Y & Z. Although I thought of Zorro right away, but other than that

591
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:47,420
It's I think I think they tried to represent a through through W and they were sort of organized alphabetically

592
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,360
Oh, so there's some info for you salivate over that old school

593
00:46:51,940 --> 00:47:00,220
Parking lot information one of my favorite anecdotes about the original parking lot at Disneyland is is and I forget who the two

594
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,900
of this is credited to but like

595
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,200
when

596
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,380
California Adventure first open and they were doing like cast member previews and

597
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:15,120
Imagineering previews and stuff for family like two longtime Imagineers were like walking out afterwards and the one goes

598
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,260
So what did you think and the other goes? Well, I liked it better when it was a parking lot

599
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,540
Which is such a devastating

600
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,580
Going on like a brand new park, right? Yeah. Yeah

601
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,920
Well, so that that's the whole history of it is that up until the mid 90s

602
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,320
You could park in the spring lot that was right next to Disneyland

603
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,260
You're essentially at the ticket booths and at the train station

604
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,900
Right away and you could see that from your car

605
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:47,060
That area that was taken out to build California Adventure so that there was like a just a short walk between the two

606
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:53,680
Right. Yeah, there was Disney has bought up odd areas of land all over that Anaheim campus

607
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,080
But it makes more it made the most sense to have the two parks next to each other and even now it's a question if

608
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:03,020
They ever did a third where would that go when how would you connect with every monorail?

609
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:08,580
Would there be yeah, everyone says it's the Toy Story parking lot, which is a little little ways away

610
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:14,640
It's the one that's zone yield for a park for a new park. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's like a little bus ride

611
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,600
It's right by the Anaheim Convention Center

612
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,140
this is a

613
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,880
Question that they're running into at the Universal Orlando

614
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:28,660
Resort because that resort was designed very much like Disneyland where it's like the original Universal Studios Park

615
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:35,700
had a second park built like right next to it like essentially like a block and a half walk and

616
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,700
now that and they

617
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:44,620
Gradually built hotels and a city walk there and now they keep adding hotels and they have a huge plot of land down the road

618
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,720
But like at the time when they're like we're gonna buy this Florida property and try to compete with Walt Disney World

619
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,400
They're like they didn't want to build and sustain a massive

620
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,140
Transportation infrastructure like Disney World did so they made a design closer

621
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,700
Actually to Disneyland where it's like the two parks are next to each other and people can walk there

622
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,600
Or they have a handful of boats and you could take a boat from the hotel

623
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:14,580
To the two parks, but now that they want to expand and build a third park

624
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:19,360
It's like farther away, so they're gonna have to start having I don't know buses

625
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:27,280
Is there a creative way to do it like it's pretty cool that Universal now has the the the Harry Potter

626
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,820
Harry Potter in Islands of Adventure and Diagon Alley in

627
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,360
Universal and the train can take you to both right?

628
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,480
There's some ride that maybe somewhere in the Marvel Universe

629
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,500
potentially there's a rainbow bridge you could walk on or there's a you know,

630
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,380
What else Tony Stark has some new?

631
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,160
Tony Sager Reed Richards is

632
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,660
Hop on to onto the shield supercarrier that takes you over

633
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:02,200
The carrier yeah, yeah, it's just like not clothes just the Hulk's bridge

634
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,440
It's very green

635
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,840
I will say that speaking of

636
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,300
The two points that I thought of while you're talking Jason and one about Universal

637
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:19,940
So I want to I had fairly close a couple years ago

638
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:24,660
fairly proximal Disneyland trip followed by a

639
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,980
Universal Studios a Hollywood trip and

640
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,240
the difference between the Mickey and Friends parking structure the elegance of that and the

641
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,680
Jurassic parking that they have there

642
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,040
It's like it's night and day even though it's but it functionally as a little parking structure

643
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,280
The Jurassic parking has all the pitfalls that exist in you know

644
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:49,060
Like like a poorly designed like mall parking structure or ballpark parking structure where you've got all these these these different levels

645
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:54,080
You got a cycle through endlessly you got a hunt for a space a little bit

646
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,440
Where you park like the iconography is not super clear in terms of which which air you know, like

647
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:05,680
Like was I in J6 was I in L1 like one, you know, you can't quite

648
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,120
Parse it perfectly and even if you write it down or take a picture of the pillar you parked by

649
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,860
It's still a little bit of an ordeal to find your space and then walking through it

650
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:18,540
You got to walk through a lot of other cars like that that if you've got a family if you're pushing a stroller like that's

651
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:23,200
A little bit of a hazard. You've got other people looking for parking and maybe making abrupt turns

652
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:29,180
Trying to snag a space and you got it. You got a family in tow. You don't necessarily have those same sort of

653
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,940
Black marks that you're dealing with if you're in the Mickey and Friends and also too

654
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,500
So, you know Universal is different because you're walking right into the park

655
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,480
It's like it's like right butted up against Universal City Walk, basically

656
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,700
So you're basically just in the same way that you would walk into downtown Disney and then be in the Disneyland proper

657
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:52,860
Like you're right that you're right butted up against it. There's a there's a tram ride for the Mickey and Friends structure

658
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,260
But it's a nice tram ride. It's very pleasant

659
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,120
And it's kind of like a gentle sort of I feel like when the kids that are on there

660
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,020
They're building anticipation a little bit. They're like getting excited because they're like, oh my god

661
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:10,500
This is like the ride that's taking us to Disneyland. This is akin to the the helicopter that's taking us into Jurassic Park

662
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:16,220
a little small thrill that's that's that that tells of

663
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,700
Bigger thrills to be had in the future. Sure. You get a look you get a ride right away, right?

664
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:25,480
Yeah, that is a thing to talk about I think that I think that tram is very pleasant

665
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,940
I like the look of that thing they get it

666
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:33,780
That's a that's a that's a neat shiny classic car vibe the white with the red stripes and yes

667
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:38,980
That's very appealing. I'm gonna I don't want to I don't want this to turn into a fight. Oh boy

668
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:43,320
But I'm gonna say I like the Universal parking garage

669
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:49,880
You're right about everything but what's interesting about Universal parking garage is like you don't know where you're parking on on occasion

670
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,020
You just walk out and you're right where you wanted to be and on occasion

671
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,200
It's a 10 or 15 minute walk, right?

672
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,600
So like on occasion I park and I go where are we and I go down an escalator and I'm like

673
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,940
Oh, we're right here at the margaritaville at City Walkers

674
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:05,920
I'm like we're right here on sometimes so like there's sort of a fun chaos that I find

675
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,000
It's like sometimes you have to get an elevator that's themed a curious George there

676
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,120
That's the whole level or that's the whole parking structure, but then you get to kind of walk have a nice city walk walk

677
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,620
Which I honestly and this is the controversy this is where the controversy will come in

678
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:24,900
I kind of like walking through City Walk better than I like riding on that tram to Disneyland

679
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:30,080
which maybe this I should save this for later when we were gonna say controversial things, but

680
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:36,540
The tram I find I don't think is it's the the though

681
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:41,060
What happens what happens you leave the tram from the parking structure and it's like what five minutes to get to?

682
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:44,940
Downtown Disney basically right in front of their world of Disney, which is a giant store

683
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:50,320
I don't think it's themed well enough. I don't I can see through the fence

684
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:55,120
I can see the buildings the show buildings for Pirates of the Caribbean or Indiana Jones fair

685
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,580
I can see right through it and honestly it starts to trip off by going

686
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:03,040
Oh, yeah, Pirates of the Caribbean is in that big on like

687
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,560
People are having

688
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,900
For me Jason I'm saying for me

689
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:16,460
All right, I agree that dad on the trip of the California isn't going all that show buildings really ruining the magic

690
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:22,940
But you get magic built up when you walk past the sock market a little bit a little bit that giant

691
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,840
Gaudy King Kong sign that all feels like I'm already in this nonsense

692
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:35,800
Cosmetics yeah when I was first out here in LA and I had an internship on the Universal backlot and I

693
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:41,440
Go up and eat it city where they were there was like dollar taco night at a what is that?

694
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:46,560
She rubio there used to be a row. Yeah, it's fish tacos that a dollar fish tacos on Tuesday nights

695
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:52,480
Tuesday night CityWalk in the fall looks like the world ended and someone left the lights on

696
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,620
like to just eat a giant plate of fish tacos and like

697
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:03,360
Watch weird watch music videos on the giant CityWalk screen and every now and then there would be an interstitial ad for just like

698
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,040
And it's just a logo and so I whispering CityWalk it's just like yeah

699
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:13,360
This feels real like end of the world this feels a real apocalyptic people hate on CityWalk

700
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,520
We're going to do at least one episode on CityWalk eventually

701
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,980
Oh, yeah, not a couple parts because there's so many different places there. I do love CityWalk

702
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:26,920
so that's that's sort of I'm biased to get toward it and especially because the

703
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,400
Hollywood CityWalk and the Orlando CityWalk may as well be different planets

704
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:38,500
Really differently because the one is catering to like locals going out for the night and the other is catering to like people in town for

705
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,140
Vacation so one got tricked. Yeah

706
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:46,620
If you're a local who goes to CityWalk a lot you're a weirdo like us

707
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:52,140
Yeah, but one definitely feels more like a mall and the other feels more like

708
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,580
People who are hammered right?

709
00:55:55,180 --> 00:56:01,920
I would say and and I like CityWalk and I also like downtown Disney, which I think is maybe not as

710
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,620
It doesn't feel even though it is it doesn't feel as crassly commercial as as as Universal CityWalk

711
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:13,240
It doesn't feel like there's as much like stores just selling like like dog shit like just trying to like, you know

712
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,780
Just selling whatever there's like a sock stores

713
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,420
Is that still there? Yes, I believe

714
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,460
There's like a popcorn store, there's just so many so many stores

715
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:30,480
Right just right garbage just chintzy garbage and and and I feel like at the at

716
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,760
Downtown Disney's there's not that same effect here

717
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,480
Here's what I would say it just to just return to what you're talking about with the tram earlier Carlson

718
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,560
I think you make a very valid point in terms of entering the park. However, the thing I would say is

719
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,660
It's very nice at the end of the day

720
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:50,760
And and it's sort of like especially I feel like if your parents and you got some kids who are maybe wound up all day

721
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,140
And now they're crashing it just gives you a moment to decompress that tram ride

722
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,440
It's like that tram ride back is like, okay

723
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,940
This is the day is over the day is done

724
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:03,480
and I feel like if you're if you're you're tugging your kids through

725
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:09,640
Universal CityWalk trying to make your way to trying to figure out what level you parked at at Jurassic Parking and you know

726
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,460
You still got that chaos basically until you got them in the car and you're like shut up, you know

727
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:19,920
And it's like that that's the energy that's carrying you out at the end of this day versus like like oh, this is our

728
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,060
This is like the end of Lord of the Rings where Frodo is getting on

729
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,660
To the little boat and he's going to like sail off into the distance

730
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:32,880
Like that's the equivalent of the the tram ride towards the the Mickey and Friends parking structure

731
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,640
Except like Frodo's competing for space with like 700 other

732
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,900
Yes, that was gonna be I agree with you that ride can be very pleasant

733
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,740
But a ride itself, right the right itself

734
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:49,100
But the lead-up is kind of a nightmare because there's a million people there to queue up a little bit and I mean as most people

735
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,600
I don't have kids

736
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,600
We don't have kids. None of us have kids

737
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:02,020
They're not even coming soon like

738
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:13,000
These are four men whose bloodlines are going to end

739
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,560
Not as fun as a theme park

740
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:25,280
But oftentimes we'll just walk from Disneyland to the Mickey and Friends parking structure

741
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,600
I didn't know you can do that

742
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:31,440
Like I've done this at least ten times because sometimes even though you're dog you're dead tired

743
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,440
You go well 15 minutes or I stand in front of I don't even know maybe it's 15 minutes for this tram

744
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,900
Let's just walk so you walk through downtown Disney you walk all the way and then you see this glorious parking structure in the distance

745
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,940
And you're going on these days. I almost find that that's even maybe a more

746
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,620
Visually interesting walk sometimes than it is to go on the tram

747
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:55,080
But you have to pop the Disney bubble to do it

748
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,420
You have to essentially go into Anaheim streets a little bit

749
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:02,540
But there's also Disney streets to like it's all

750
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:06,540
Kind of only Disney owns the streets. I think because they're the Disney

751
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,500
I don't think the Disney like street signs

752
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,420
Yeah, I guess so

753
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:16,040
But it is like you're crossing streets and I wonder now cuz they they have moved security to like right next to the Mickey and Friends

754
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:21,660
Parking which is better. Yes, they move the metal detectors like right at the bottom

755
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:25,140
And where you yeah where you look yeah, right? Yeah

756
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:29,120
Yeah, and I used to be by like the world of Disney

757
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:35,640
it used to be by like the ticket booths and everything which was was very jarring would lead to traffic jams and

758
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:42,580
Honestly, I think it's better having it at there or on the other side of the property right the Esplanade like just yeah

759
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:47,080
Knock it out if it's unpleasant and it sucks, but it's part of the world we live in now

760
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,740
So like yeah, just bang it out and just get through it. Yes

761
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,020
I also don't I'm now I'm being real negative and this is not I did not go into this

762
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:57,720
No, it's a thing. I'm gonna like take you to task or anything. It just these are my feelings

763
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:03,900
I will say so now Bill Maher

764
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,260
New rule

765
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,000
Mickey and Friends blows

766
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:10,740
I

767
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,080
Do here I'll say some good nice things about Mickey and Friends

768
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:18,260
There is a an exit on the five which is the freeway you're on you generally take to go to Disneyland

769
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:24,480
It's the specific Disneyland exit. So you go in the left lane, especially you have to think you have to be a carpool to be in

770
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:24,820
it

771
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:31,200
And you go off on a kind of a left exit on the freeway and you go sort of on this

772
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:37,980
Like specifically made for Disneyland bridge kind of thing and then they redirect you like it's an express lane

773
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:44,240
To get to Mickey and Friends. Yeah, and I love it and that feels like a ride to me that feels like my first ride

774
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,660
Zooming over the side streets

775
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:52,240
Yeah at the end of the day they flip it. Yes, and that goes the other way

776
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,640
So you leave your Mickey and Friends you again feel like you're going on one last ride

777
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,080
And then you go right under the five and you're back to the real world one of the last times I went

778
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:06,640
I was I was riding out of there with my with my roof down and the fireworks are going off

779
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:08,820
Car yeah

780
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:14,740
That's that's your Frodo sometimes you can catch the fireworks from the tram, too

781
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,260
I mean

782
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:20,200
I like the trans just cuz I like the modes of transit at Disney Mike always makes fun because like

783
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,700
Anytime we've been at the park together. We're trying to figure out what to ride or stuff as long waits

784
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,320
I'm always the first to go like well

785
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,960
Maybe we should amble on over to the Mark Twain River Boats

786
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,480
Just ride the train for the rest of our lives, but you

787
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:41,100
Not only does he do you like the train you like the Casey jr. Train, which I do like Casey jr. Train

788
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,740
I've written all I think I have only written that ride with you

789
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:49,200
Yes, I made you ride the Casey jr. Train and once or twice we were in like the cage

790
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,140
Car like it's a very tall man and I'm crouched into this thing

791
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:56,880
Sitting on the caboose part just happy as a clam

792
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,080
Employees are like there's plenty of room in there on the other side for kids and a family

793
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,600
Like no no no let the adults have the cage to themselves

794
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:11,920
They must always be a little concerned when adults without children get on Casey jr. Oh, yeah, no, it's gotta be a flag

795
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,460
No, it's like they've got a flag and it's like going on a little spaceship outside a market or something

796
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:28,360
It's tiny we shouldn't go on it. No, it's great. The storybook boats are great, too. I do like those

797
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:34,620
Yeah, I like the speaking of transportation guy. I do remember going on trips to

798
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:39,000
To Disneyland as I mentioned this earlier when we were doing this for for orchestras kids

799
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:46,760
And I remember my buddy John Civi had found out I think through a previous family trip that there was a so the arcades in

800
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,480
The starcade I think is the big one, but the arcades that are at Disneyland

801
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:56,320
This was when Mortal Kombat was was first in arcades and they had turned the blood off

802
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:03,440
The Disneyland ones but he had found out that there was an arcade in the Disneyland hotel that had Mortal Kombat with the blood

803
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,700
Awesome. So on this school trip, we took the monorail over to the Disneyland Hotel

804
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:13,740
this is before Disney downtown Disney I think even existed there was just it just went to the hotel and

805
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,320
Not being guests there. We like went into the lobby had a little

806
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:22,980
Lunch at whatever the monorail cafe was and then we went over and just was good. It was pretty good

807
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,960
Yeah, that's a first place. I had a vanilla Coke

808
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,140
Yeah, right. Yeah

809
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:38,720
And then we went and we played we played full blood full fatality Mortal Kombat for most of this trip

810
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,720
There's a hack. Yeah

811
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,280
Anytime travelers. Yeah

812
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,840
I

813
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:49,520
Sorry, oh no, I was gonna say I mean I I did that last time I was there

814
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:55,880
I not not to there but I love eating at the hotel like it's such an easy pleasant experience

815
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:04,240
at the hotels usually especially at the quick service like restaurants like in off hours or like lunchtime because people don't

816
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,980
Unless you're staying there like a lot of people don't know like yeah, there's a really nice like one

817
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:13,620
Whitewater snacks at the Grand Californian is like in the very back

818
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:22,560
Yeah, it's just so quiet and they pump in the sound effect like it's it's up against California Adventure

819
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:28,800
So they're pumping in like very pleasant folk music and sound effects and what do they have?

820
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:33,060
Is that like a hot dog and burger stand? What is it? It's like nachos

821
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:37,740
Flatbread pizzas. Okay and burgers. Yeah, they rotate it

822
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:46,680
Say what Tango row a terrace at the Disneyland Hotel also very good

823
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:53,080
Unusually empty the park lunch spots usually very crowded the hotel lunch spots much less so

824
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,900
Yeah, I love them. Even those downtown Disney spots are often very very crowded

825
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:02,860
Yeah, that's good to know that the hotel itself has some the the Grand Californian too or just this just the Disneyland Hotel

826
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:07,800
All all three of the hotels that I've never been inside Paradise beer now

827
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:11,660
They say that but oh, they all have restaurants of different like levels a little junkier

828
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:15,880
But they have like they that's where the like the good like character breakfast

829
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,680
Oh, yeah for kids

830
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,000
Yeah

831
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,780
You can find like there's like little slick the steakhouse in the Disneyland Hotel if you go to the bar

832
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:28,360
Especially later you can get a lot of the menu there. Oh, not usually that crowded Napa Rose

833
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,200
Well, it's probably one of the best restaurants at a

834
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,120
Disneyland period you can get the full menu at the bar

835
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:40,140
Natalie and I went to Napa Rose and got the the chef's I know this thing

836
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,880
We got the chef's tasting menu ones

837
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:47,360
Whatever you have like reserve it and you like sit at the counter and then they're they like prepare all the courses for you

838
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:51,240
And you can like it you can watch them kind of make it and they have wine pairings and everything

839
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:54,520
And it was a delightful anniversary dinner. Yeah

840
01:05:54,520 --> 01:06:01,300
Also you did a club 33 once I've been to club 33 one time

841
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:07,260
I I was I so used to write for this TV show called at midnight that was hosted by Chris Hardwick

842
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,720
Chris is a very

843
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,340
Was a very generous boss and as part of his

844
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,180
Like as part of it is gratitude towards the writing staff

845
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:24,220
He used his leverage as I think it whatever membership he has club 33 to get us all in to club 33 for a meal

846
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:29,820
And so I had a lunch there and it was have you guys ever been inside? I've never been I did one time

847
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:34,680
Yeah, shout out to David love. Thanks for getting us in. Yeah, it was it was it was

848
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,620
Picturesque in there is very very like it just an amazing

849
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:45,540
Exactly what you expect us to be like that felt like this real secret society and and you know a cabinet with this

850
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,600
Ultra-expensive top-shelf liquor that you could buy by the bottle

851
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:56,000
But the the thing and this this might be more for for us than than for your listeners and unless they they happen to know him

852
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:03,980
But like this this was like a random day in the summer and we were going to club 33 for lunch and

853
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:09,100
Randomly I ran into our friend Doug Jones was just there

854
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,440
He was hanging out at club 33 and I just like oh, this is perfectly appropriate

855
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,240
This is this guy. Yeah, I've seen parks so much. Of course. We just be here. Yeah

856
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,140
Yeah, it was it felt like such a random confluence to just run into a guy

857
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:27,700
I know it at this exclusive club within this theme park. You thought it would only be like Archdukes, right?

858
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:28,520
Yeah

859
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,860
See you have Pepsi or something

860
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:35,540
It is like a thing you would expect like like kind of the and maybe this was kind of the lunchtime crowd

861
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:39,460
but you expect people to be wearing, you know, sharp suits and and

862
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:45,820
You know cocktail dresses, but then it's just like a dad wearing Birkenstocks and cargo shorts, you know

863
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:52,000
How was the food? I don't really remember this. I remember being like this is my thing also with Carthe Circus

864
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,280
I really like the food of Carthe Circus. I don't like there's nothing like it's just a very nice restaurant

865
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:02,600
There's not a lot in terms of like some story about the shoe. Am I wrong? I like it's great obviously very good

866
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:09,060
Yeah, I would say not mind-blowing not like I had like fried chicken and it's not like oh, this is the best fried chicken

867
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:13,740
I've ever had but like this is very good. And you know, certainly there's a gigantic markup on it

868
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,700
This cost like $30 or something

869
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:21,580
It's absurd but it's a year you're paying for the atmosphere and the exclusivity and the fact that you can get alcohol inside

870
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:25,440
Disneyland and those weird toilets. There's like weird old like

871
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:31,680
Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that I think they also had mouthwash in the bathroom, which was nice

872
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,640
Oh, that's very fancy

873
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:40,320
I was just reading a story about one of the first female imagineers and she looked at the plans for Club 33 and she had to

874
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:44,720
Tell Walt she goes this bathroom for the women is too small

875
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,280
And he said you're right and they doubled it

876
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:54,040
Yeah, they got a like literally like a one woman could not fit in. Yes. I think so. Yeah

877
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,940
I think she was also saying female beauty was so

878
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:05,020
Yes, I think that's what she was she would know literally she I think she she said something in an un-pc way about women of size

879
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,480
Would not be able to get in the bathroom

880
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:13,320
So they they doubled this so they took apart away of the kitchen and then right Walt is like 85 pounds

881
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:18,180
Whatever weight he made Lillian stay at

882
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:24,020
That's the weight women should be isn't there a story about a woman who is an astronaut like the

883
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:29,920
Sally Ride and they were sending her in the space and they were like will a hundred tampons be enough, right?

884
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:32,080
They just had no sense

885
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:38,420
That feels like that's like a

886
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:41,460
A few years from now when they've they've run out of

887
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:48,520
Saving mr. Bank stories. It feels like they're gonna make a hidden figure style movie about this first female imagineer that has to be in the

888
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,100
Pike, right? Yeah

889
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:53,400
I mean a lot I was reading I was very interesting because she was talking about how it was like no one listened to her

890
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,400
Like just go to straight 12. She's very she said Walt was very nice

891
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,600
Okay, a lot of the imagineers were just dicks who wouldn't who would ignore things

892
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,400
She said she designed a lot of the Haunted Mansion. Well getting her name. Her last name is Norris

893
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:10,800
I really should look that up if he won if Walt wants to talk to a woman. He'll draw one

894
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:19,340
Still love drawing all the time I look up her name

895
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,240
I do think right now though while people are listening to this they're gonna go

896
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:29,620
When are they gonna go back to the parking garage? Yeah guys stop talking about we didn't want engineers and we didn't want a tangent

897
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:32,600
Anywhere in this thing. Let's get back on track. So

898
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,000
Well now this is actually the opposite of the parking garage

899
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,300
but I think this parking garage is is especially indicative of

900
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:46,880
Southern California car culture because like I mean all of the Disney parks have some sort of parking option

901
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:53,580
Sure, Florida if you're going to the Magic Kingdom you have to park across the lake from it and take the boat or Monorail over

902
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:54,540
To the Magic Kingdom

903
01:10:54,540 --> 01:11:01,940
The other resort of parks in Florida all have parking lots in front of or next to it at the international parks

904
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:09,760
There's a much bigger emphasis on like public transit. Yeah, I do I do wish there was because I'm someone who I

905
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,660
Love, you know, like when I'll go I'm an NBA fan and we'll go

906
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:16,500
Go see the Lakers play in downtown and Staples Center for more we live in Santa Monica

907
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,440
I'll take the train and and it's it's great. It's great to not have to worry about parking

908
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,240
I would love it. This was this was a few years ago

909
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:29,120
I think when Obama's infrastructure plan was being floated and they used it as like a talking point to be like like

910
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,340
You know, he wants to build a high-speed rail between

911
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:37,880
LA and Disneyland and it's like it's like well that would that makes it that would be amazing

912
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:45,740
Because it's a huge tourist destination people fly into LA they would 100% make use of and locals would 100% make use of like

913
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:49,300
That makes a lot of sense. But as a talking point, it's something that you can

914
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:53,720
Bat down but yeah, I wish there was a better. I wish there was a train option

915
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,120
I wish you could take you you didn't have to drive there

916
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:00,820
but because you have to drive I think the the bikini friends parking structure is is

917
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:05,760
You know as as good as it can be basically. Yeah in Disney Paris. I was reading in

918
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:11,620
Disneyland Paris there is a major like regional hub like a two-minute walk from the park for the train

919
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:19,960
Tokyo Disney a train station. Yeah, and it's and it's like not the weird thing not too Disney-ified

920
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:25,980
It's like just barely off the property just like a couple steps away. And so there's just like

921
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,520
Train station weirdos. It's like it's wow

922
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:35,520
Not a magical Disney train station and that being like I think it's like 20 minutes outside of Paris and that you're like in the

923
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:41,780
Magic of Paris and then you're just in some weird European suburban dirty train station

924
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:45,140
Yeah, really that I mean I we haven't talked about Disneyland Paris a ton on here

925
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:52,160
But I like I found it sort of odd and janky and sketchy and that train station arrival was part of it because you're thinking

926
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,340
Disney and train. Oh, it's gonna be a med

927
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:56,520
It's gonna be like an old Victorian train station

928
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,640
Then it's just like lockers and people sleeping on the ground and it sucked

929
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:08,020
What you would like sounds like what the Tokyo experience is where like they have a monorail there that goes around the whole property

930
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:10,540
But you have to buy a pass for it

931
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:16,900
And it's like I believe technically part of the transit system in Tokyo so you can buy a monthly pass or use like a subway

932
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:24,300
Ticket to ride the monorail even though it's on private property and operated by the Oriental Land Company who runs Tokyo Disney

933
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:30,040
Hmm. That's awesome. But it takes you right it like what you need to get around Tokyo already what takes you

934
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:36,460
I think you can use that pass or at least buy like a monthly Disney pass if you work there and it's got stops at

935
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:40,620
all the hotels and like the partner hotels and then there's like the

936
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:46,740
Entrance to the property right by the way Oriental Land Company sounds like ominous. That sounds like a

937
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,160
relic of a

938
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,720
colonialism like it was established by the Netherlands in like the

939
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:57,320
1500s and had its own Navy it does but I believe it was established by the Japanese government

940
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:00,240
Co-run the Disney Park

941
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:04,200
Autonomy in the way, and they put a Tokyo Disneyland

942
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:08,340
Yeah, they dumped a ton of money is which is why I suppose like to I which we have not been yet

943
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,000
Tokyo Disney Sea which is like this was like the greatest theme park in the world

944
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,620
I thought I've heard this so much money from that Oriental Land Company. Yeah Wow

945
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:21,260
Hearing it in English in America. It is a weird. It's got a weird

946
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:24,060
Right

947
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:30,100
Like my grandparents say that word where it's like, oh, I know you don't mean this maliciously

948
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:35,300
But we don't really say that anymore. Sure, but it sounds like the third Reich development

949
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,440
Yeah, something

950
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:44,180
Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna tie a couple things together here you mentioned Tokyo Disney Sea

951
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:48,960
if you I'm gonna talk a little bit about the sort of the history and why the

952
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,000
Friends parking structure exists

953
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:59,220
Do you guys know sort of the anything about like the weird bidding wars between Long Beach and Anaheim that took place? Oh, no

954
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:02,260
No, I don't think I do. So okay. So

955
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,220
All right, and interrupt me with the jokes or something

956
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:18,580
Podcast with interruptions. I've never heard of such a thing. I demand it

957
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:23,640
Okay, so mid 1980s Michael Eisner takes over the Disney Company

958
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:29,440
He wants Disneyland to be more like Disney World where there's multiple parks and multiple hotels

959
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,380
But he immediately gets acquainted with there is not a lot of land in

960
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:40,140
Anaheim and they don't own any hotels at that point like but in the mid 80s Disney did not own the Disneyland Hotel

961
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:45,940
It was built by a friend of Walt's named Jack rather and Walt was just so desperate to get a hotel

962
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,880
Opened there that he said like whatever you want

963
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:54,600
Well cut you a great deal and Walt's leased the land to the guy for 99 years

964
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:01,040
It's yours for an and you can use the name Disneyland and no other hotels in this area can use the word Disney

965
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,580
So this guy Jack rather has this cake deal

966
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:06,080
They've made the monorail go right up to that hotel

967
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,300
But Disney was not pocketing any of that hotel room money

968
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:15,540
So major like lack of income for Disney for many many years Eisner's like done break it get him out of here

969
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:23,960
They did basically a hostile takeover of the rather corporation. They just bought up the entire thing Wow similar to the way that they just bought

970
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,520
Fox where it's like

971
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:32,860
Well, if you won't give us X-Men then we'll like we'll just buy the whole thing. So they they took over

972
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:33,660
rather

973
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:39,260
So now they only Disneyland Hotel, but in the rather corporation also owns the Queen Mary

974
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,320
so

975
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:46,120
That gives them ownership of this big like plot of land on the Long Beach Harbor and now

976
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,660
They've got this bargaining chip. They say to the city of Anaheim

977
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:52,280
We would love to build a second park here

978
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:57,200
But we really need is a parking structure and we want you to build it and Anaheim's like that's bullshit

979
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,100
Oh, that's really stupid. Well, if you don't want to do it, we could always just go over to Long Beach

980
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:07,940
We already own the Queen Mary, right? They've developed plans at this point for something called Port Disney. It's very similar to Disney Sea

981
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:13,360
Yeah, like Disney Sea I remember this this is a thing growing up in the Long Beach area

982
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,280
I remember reading about the ongoing

983
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,660
Port Disney

984
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:22,740
You know it would end up being a debacle and never happening in the the local paper the press telegram

985
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:25,340
There's a lot of updates about the about this ongoing thing

986
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:29,440
And I remember there there was a point where it was like it looked like we're gonna get a new Disney Park like right

987
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,900
Like, you know, very very close by yeah, how close would that have been for you?

988
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:33,340
That's true

989
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:36,440
I mean it would have been like a 15-minute drive for us for my child at home

990
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,500
Right there right by my high school. I mean it could have gone anytime I wanted. Wow. Yeah

991
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:45,420
Yeah, and like right. Yeah, if you've been if you've been to Long Beach, yeah, I would have connected all of this stuff together

992
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:50,700
There's a big mall there called the Pike and there's all these hotels and stuff and like it all would have been this massive

993
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,940
Disney campus and they were also gonna build like over the harbor

994
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:59,180
They were gonna reclaim land and build it on the ocean Wow the Sierra Club

995
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,560
protested it and had a big like

996
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:08,380
Yeah, really tried to get it to not happen and somebody a guy from the Sierra Club issued a really lofty statement about like the hubris

997
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:11,020
of man to build above the sea

998
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:15,660
That's funny cuz the joke I make is is when

999
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:16,720
Eisner

1000
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:17,380
opens

1001
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:23,500
the Grand Californian and California Adventure as he did it with the hubris of a bad God like

1002
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:27,460
Californians come to this park themed to California

1003
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:31,260
Made a miniature cow. There's no need to do the rest of California

1004
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,820
so anyway, like they and

1005
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:39,300
They've got options now in Anaheim and Long Beach and Eisner issues this this odd

1006
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:46,200
Statement about like well, it's just we'll go with whatever city wants us more and that caused Anaheim to cave and they said yeah

1007
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:46,480
All right

1008
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:53,880
We'll build you at the time the idea was three different parking structures the the city of Anaheim would build them

1009
01:18:53,880 --> 01:19:00,560
Give Disney like just this tiny lease and that is what happens. So the Mickey and Friends was built by the city of Anaheim

1010
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:05,920
The city of Anaheim gets no money for that. I think they get it. They get it like a dollar a year, right?

1011
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,560
It's like some token amount. Oh, yeah, yeah something like it's like bear like legal minimum, right?

1012
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,700
Yes, he has had Anaheim by the balls

1013
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:21,400
Forever and there recently has been a big yeah about like a non Disney what mayor was installed sort of an anti

1014
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:29,520
Within the Anaheim City Council, there are people who are there councilmen who were kind of bought by Disney and right who are not

1015
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,560
It's a very like Congress NRA

1016
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:38,520
situation like Disney hasn't had there hasn't been any tax on tickets for years and years and years and then some people finally were

1017
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:44,540
Like that's fucked up. Right like when you see there are parts of Anaheim that are in terrible shape

1018
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:47,720
This is like blocks away from Anaheim. They're like, yeah

1019
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:55,320
Really like really lower in terry is in the city could use that money and what they were talking about was like a single dollar of

1020
01:19:55,340 --> 01:20:01,620
Entertainment tax right on every Disneyland ticket and Disney freaked out this cannot happen

1021
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:03,600
and also

1022
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:09,240
So there was an LA Times article kind of revealing a lot of this information and sort of the the odd

1023
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,720
relationship between Anaheim and and Disneyland and

1024
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:18,920
Disney was so displeased with this article that they told the LA Times fine. You can't review our movies anymore

1025
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,780
I remember this yeah happened a few months ago. That was all

1026
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,280
Essentially related to like the parking situation

1027
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:31,760
Right. Yeah, and also and this now we're really getting into the driest of dry territory

1028
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,760
There was another parking garage. They wanted to build. Yeah, the Eastern Gateway project

1029
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,140
Yes, which is a whole thing and they had a whole design for it

1030
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:43,620
And there was a bridge that was gonna take you over like, you know, those right like Captain Cook's is like a restaurant

1031
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:46,800
There's like a desert Denny's right there. Yeah

1032
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,580
Harbor Boulevard, it was gonna be a bridge that was gonna take you from the

1033
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,140
New parking garage right into Disney and

1034
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:58,820
They were like, well, you can't do this because this is gonna block off all the businesses

1035
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:03,600
Yeah, those businesses would have been I mean, yeah, but those businesses are kind of leeches like let's be oh, yeah

1036
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:10,060
Yeah, I mean why they're there to begin. Yeah, the Mimis cafe right there is just leeching off of Disney's, you know

1037
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:13,820
I mean, I mean to see me me's go. Yeah, I like the rest of it. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good

1038
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:18,280
Captain kid's buffet though what you mentioned that what that place is like dog shit

1039
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:24,580
Reviewed is the worst restaurant in Orange County and they're leeching off the logo of red Robin. It's

1040
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:25,760
Yeah

1041
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:31,340
Yeah, they were gonna build essentially a second Mickey and Friends parking structure

1042
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:36,820
and so people coming from the north would park at Mickey and Friends people coming from the south would park at this other one and

1043
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:41,780
He could not get through Anaheim City Council. They would not get it through

1044
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:44,760
so now part of the situation being as

1045
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:51,040
To in the in the mid-90s when they could say we're gonna bail and go to Long Beach instead they can't do that now

1046
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,540
They can't exactly say we're gonna go right right Star Wars land somewhere else, right?

1047
01:21:54,740 --> 01:22:00,580
So Disney sort of doesn't have the bargaining chip like they had in the night at this point people listening to the podcaster like talk

1048
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:02,300
about the restaurants again

1049
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:07,080
Jesus Christ talk about that lady whose name you

1050
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,320
Tanya Tanya Norris

1051
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,460
I know I know

1052
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:16,520
Needed more parking spots for years. Yes, they certainly need them before Star Wars

1053
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:21,860
Oh, yeah, and we got a disaster brewing. I would love to break this story to Nick if he doesn't know

1054
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:25,340
They are building a new

1055
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:30,740
Parking structure Wow right by Mickey and Friends about the same size. Am I correct?

1056
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,240
I there's essentially duplicating or duplicating Mickey and Friends

1057
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:38,880
6000 is about six thousand. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so it's a little

1058
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:44,640
Now and maybe one day they'll get that Eastern Gateway parking garage. So that's a little present for you

1059
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,480
That there'll be another

1060
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:53,340
Well-designed parking structure coming soon efficient. Yeah, so they're building the parking structure because Star Wars land is coming, right?

1061
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:59,840
And what's also gonna happen is they're building a giant hotel over downtown Disney. So you're losing ESPN zone

1062
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,240
You're losing rainforest cafe and the movie theater and the Earl of Sandwich

1063
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,380
And this is all just this massive

1064
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:11,160
Construction project that they're like fast-tracking. Yeah, there's a lot of acreage though those oh, yeah

1065
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,920
Yeah for rest or those three restaurants in that movie theater

1066
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,760
They'll be retail and restaurant space underneath the hotel

1067
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:20,480
Okay, as people are coming in and I'm sure like Earl of Sandwich will be back in there

1068
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:25,540
There could be a small weird ESPN zone in the hotel. We don't know they're talking about stuff like that

1069
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:34,520
It's possible like with especially like with a beloved restaurant like the rainforest cafe. Yeah, let's

1070
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:38,220
We've talked about this for either Sheridan's love the rainforest

1071
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:46,120
It's certainly pretty fine. Like I went with a friend a friend's 21st birthday. We went to that rainforest cafe

1072
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:51,300
This was back in college. So that was that was a real hoot right spent a 21st birthday there

1073
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:56,780
yeah, what she wanted to go to she wanted this was this was my friend's girlfriend and

1074
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:59,600
she was also my friend and and a group of

1075
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:04,300
Friends and wanted to go to Disneyland for 21st birthday and then for dinner went to the rainforest cafe

1076
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:10,060
It worked out nicely. Oh, yeah, I got in high school. I got way too high in there

1077
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:15,240
Oh boy, and I just sat silently freaked out by animatronic monkeys

1078
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:25,300
Didn't say a word to my dinner guest and friend and that kind of informs my my marijuana experience to this day

1079
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:28,580
I think that was the last time I went to a rainforest cafe

1080
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:32,920
I'm thinking thinking back and I this was that that 21st birthday and I

1081
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:38,920
Remembered that the I got a Caesar salad because I just like eating garbage all day at Disneyland my stomach hurt

1082
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:44,820
So I got something very and it was like a very weak like not good salad. Yeah, their foods not great, right?

1083
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:51,240
No, it's terrible. No, they like fun fruity fun fruity drinks and like fun appetizers

1084
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:54,920
That's my yeah, it's like eating the blue bayou. It's like yeah, it's the experience

1085
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:58,720
I drove down alone a couple years ago to see Dick Van Dyke in a parade

1086
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:02,760
And

1087
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,340
That's a true story no one would go with me

1088
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:11,180
It was his bird 90th birthday and I was like, well, what am I gonna get the fucking chance to see this old man again?

1089
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:15,020
And he was in a parade like waving. It was like two seconds

1090
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:19,000
And then I parked it downtown Disney and to get validation. Yeah, I was like well

1091
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I'll get it to go order at the rainforest cafe and I went up to the bar

1092
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,660
I ordered like a cheeseburger and then got it parking validated because I wasn't gonna be I wasn't gonna be a bad boy

1093
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,560
And get the part like lie and say oh, I just came from the restaurant validate

1094
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,360
I've been a bad boy a few times you have well in the past. They're a lot more strict nowadays

1095
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:44,600
Although I didn't out I've been a bad I've been a bad boy in regards to using the movie theater to park for free

1096
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:52,120
Oh, right cheat. I said earlier where you buy a ticket you get it validated then you cancel the ticket on fandango

1097
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:57,580
This this is no what would dick van dyke say if you heard of this nefarious behavior?

1098
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:02,360
This is the way this is the way that isn't the way Burt would behave. It's the way that mean old banker

1099
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:06,780
He also that's true. Oh boy. That's a good point. He liked bird not like the banker

1100
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:12,300
Well, look, I the movie theater is going away. So I won't have the opportunity to be this bad look

1101
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:17,780
They're pressed for parking. Okay. Yeah, this keeps coming up. So I had the cheeseburger long story short

1102
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:21,920
I had the cheeseburger and it was just the worst it was so bad

1103
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:25,200
Like how was it could it be this bad? You got to go? Yes

1104
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:30,140
You drove it back to LA and then a layer no, no, no, I ate it while I drove

1105
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:36,980
I'm very good at driving and eating. Yes. I have a whole system down

1106
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:39,780
I can do it on the freeway if I have to

1107
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:45,420
But I think I had eaten most of it by the time I even got to the freeway and it just how did they how is it?

1108
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,160
This bad. Yeah, it shouldn't be this bad. How could it be? So yeah

1109
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:55,940
The only reason anyone would ever eat it is to sit next to like a firm that's alive

1110
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:58,800
Yeah, the feeling is the whole point

1111
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:03,120
It's like getting a Chuck E Cheese pizza delivered

1112
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:10,400
Just want the food. All right, we could do it was the to-go box like a big clam or something

1113
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,200
Styrofoam box

1114
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,780
It was a styrofoam box from islands because they don't do to-go orders and to go to a store to borrow

1115
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,300
Some weirdo

1116
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:25,980
I want to say many of your stories could probably end with long story short. I ate the cheeseburger

1117
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:31,780
Yeah in the car I drove or begin with I was driving to a parade by myself

1118
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,480
Yeah, I

1119
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:39,820
Just wanted to return to this new this this duplicate Mickey and Friends this Mickey and Friends

1120
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:45,300
Sequel lot real quick, but I'm very excited about this this new structure franchise to expand right?

1121
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:46,780
I

1122
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:47,880
Want to make a prediction?

1123
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:54,940
Which is I don't think they're going to use the blank and friends designation for the name of this new lot, right?

1124
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:00,700
because I think it's going to be too confusing to guests and I think because they have

1125
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:03,140
Some other properties under their umbrella now

1126
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:05,740
They are going to make use of that in their parking

1127
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:09,660
Nomenclature and this will be the Avengers lot

1128
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:16,520
One for level two black widow level and so on Wow, yeah

1129
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:22,840
It's just writes itself seven levels. It's associated with their own Avengers member

1130
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,400
I think that's a very good prediction and it's very likely

1131
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,860
I think there's also a chance that they go with avatar and it's

1132
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:37,520
It's the banshee it's unobtainium for level three or it's so I think it could be

1133
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,060
Each child each of the child avatar children

1134
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:45,660
You know, I have friends who've listened to the podcast regularly and they they took some time to ask me

1135
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:48,520
What is your guys deal with avatar? Do you like it?

1136
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,600
Do you not like you failed to convey right right? What is your talk about it?

1137
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:56,820
Yeah, we've talked about it in like seven different episodes. I you know, I just brought it up again

1138
01:28:56,820 --> 01:29:02,120
The Chronicles of Jake Sully and the Navi people here's here's what happened

1139
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:05,940
This is this should not be a thing we get into at the end of a podcast

1140
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:07,880
But I will get into it a little bit

1141
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:14,160
What happens with me is I get fascinated by something that I think I don't like and I I obsess on it

1142
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,120
I make a lot of jokes

1143
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:21,540
I'm like very dry with it and then after a while I like it it happened with Jimmy Buffett

1144
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:29,260
Yeah, it happened with Duffy the Disney bear sure from Tokyo Disney Sea and it's like I make enough jokes about something and then one day

1145
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:32,240
I wake up and I like it. So I guess I like avatar

1146
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:37,320
Yeah, I guess I like it but it's fun to say the mighty Akron in like a very dry

1147
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,340
I think we're referring to the fact that even though

1148
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:44,340
This is the highest grossing movie of all time or one of them and there's these

1149
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:48,260
Mega-budget sequels that have been coming for a decade and there's old theme park about it now

1150
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:52,380
That these things that nobody could just tell you the mighty Akron

1151
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,120
You're right, right

1152
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:58,600
It's like yeah really hold on to that fact to even remember it right or that or that the thing is the Hallelujah Mountains

1153
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:04,360
Like quote a line from Avatar it's not there isn't something that comes to the tip of your tongue, right?

1154
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:07,840
No, everyone's seen this movie. It's my feeling about the Star Wars prequels

1155
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:13,560
Which I know you guys have talked about always a ton about the start Star Wars, but it's like the three movies are bad

1156
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:18,660
There's so many bad choices, but I've seen them now so many times. It means so many jokes. I like them

1157
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:24,140
Yeah, I like them. I like them. Yeah, I like but I don't like them in this weird way that a lot of people are like

1158
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:28,440
Well, they're good. They're actually really good. Right? I mean that's crazy, but I do like them

1159
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:34,580
I like Dexter Jekster. I like waddo. I like the podracers. I like I need to know all the names sure team

1160
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:36,640
Toppa Gaileys is a name I know

1161
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:42,540
That most people don't know and I but I like him. I don't know much about him, but I like team Toppa Gaileys

1162
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:46,360
What what is he with it? We keep it quick, but what is he?

1163
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:54,940
Yeah, he's one of the podracers do you know the names of the two-headed the Greg proofs and oh, I'm yeah

1164
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:58,080
Yeah, what's that character's name? I can't think hmm. I don't remember

1165
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:04,740
I did at one point somebody is shouting at the podcast right I tune in and Weiger was on it and nobody knew

1166
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:08,160
The one pull I have is what tambor. Oh, yeah, what?

1167
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:11,900
Senator lot Dodd is one

1168
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:15,680
Of Christa lot

1169
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:16,940
Oh

1170
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:20,840
God George Lucas took to a Democrat Senate senator and a Republican senator

1171
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:24,840
They're lions of the Senate. Yeah, it is a kiss. That's one of the senators

1172
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:30,440
I think he's like the same races new gun rate Wall Street shill Christopher Dodd

1173
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:37,700
Commemorated in a Star Wars film I

1174
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:43,040
Looked this up a second ago while you were talking Carlson about avatar because this this is a thing

1175
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:48,400
That we saw Taruk the first flight. Yes, Cirque du Soleil

1176
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:54,880
Inspired by Avatar, which was pretty entertaining. This is sickening. Yeah, say how much money we spent it was too much

1177
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,900
What's like a hundred and fifty dollars?

1178
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:00,180
Money, I don't know what we were thinking. I

1179
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:04,440
Seats just good seats. They weren't mind-blowing. They were good seats

1180
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:09,580
Did you know they bring you up and interact with you and bend you around or something? No, they did. Oh, yeah

1181
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:11,240
Not really. I mean, it's a pretty good show

1182
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:18,320
It was just like it was gibberish like trying to get the story of the Taruk and because there's a narrator explaining everything

1183
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,860
That's happening. You watch all that you're still not quite clear on what's going on

1184
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:29,000
Wait explain where this lands in the in the world of Avatar in the kingdom of Avatar. It's the it's it's it takes place on the

1185
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,740
Avatar planet and it's just it's just a purely Navi story

1186
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:37,380
Yeah, what is the is to root the Avatar planet? No Taruk is the legendary?

1187
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:40,060
Wyvern they have to fly

1188
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:45,480
Yeah, but like to Rook is then I'm trying to remember because they're the Banshee is in it

1189
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,260
But to Rook is like a bigger version

1190
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:56,880
Again who's like a harbinger of of death and and by the end of it spoiler alert the young Navi who has yet yet to prove

1191
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,620
himself has

1192
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:04,020
Taken control of the mighty to Rook and he rides him into battle and that's respect of his drive

1193
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:09,120
It's still a spoiler if you like stop paying attention during this

1194
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:13,900
So this is reminding me and Mike you may have been with me because it's happened

1195
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:20,180
Comic-con a few years ago, but we came out of the place we were staying and maybe I was with someone else and

1196
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:23,400
like a van pulled up and parked and

1197
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:27,440
Like a passenger van and a bunch of people got out half in Navi clothes

1198
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,880
And oh, yeah people who were gonna be handing out flyers

1199
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:41,200
And they just seemed miserable like they were all like had coffee cups and like half in their costumes half in their street clothes

1200
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:46,180
All right, let's get ready for the day

1201
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:50,220
Yeah, so I found that it's increasingly the name of the

1202
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:56,940
The Greg Brooks character. I have no idea even how to pronounce this food food and bead

1203
01:33:56,940 --> 01:34:02,220
They were called but collectively they're called food is in bead and no do

1204
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:06,540
That's the name of the character in the prequel to the announcers

1205
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:11,560
The two guys that are announcing the pod race that's considered cannon yes, yeah, this is from

1206
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:18,060
Cannon tab of wookie pedia not under the legends tab. Okay, these are all

1207
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:23,980
This is like the these references are like the last remaining cars at the end of the night in the Mickey

1208
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:36,520
One of the thing I'll say this about Mickey and friends real quick that I like I and this sort of contradicts what I was

1209
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:42,360
Saying before I do like now that you can sort of see Star Wars land from the parking garage

1210
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:48,020
Because you can see how big it is how expansive it is when it let me be clear once it opens

1211
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:50,860
I don't want to see it. I want it to be covered completely

1212
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:53,120
Right now while it's under construction

1213
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:56,680
I love and I make my girlfriend do it every time I go

1214
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:02,340
Let's go to a higher level so we can get a better view of it and we go up the stairs and I take a look

1215
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:06,120
And I just like breathe it in for you know a couple minutes

1216
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:10,880
And I and I and I annoy her probably by saying I go I think that's the where the queue is gonna be for the

1217
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:17,300
Millennium Falcon ride and I think over there is where the the toy Darien toy shop will be like I've done this with you a

1218
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,980
Couple times, but sometimes I'll be with my wife, and I will say well Mike's not here

1219
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:23,780
So we don't have to go look at the Star Wars construction

1220
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:26,840
We could skip the stop this time

1221
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,580
But it I admittedly it is very it's been good

1222
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:34,820
That's like the best vantage point to watch yes the growth of that thing which has been incredible over the last year

1223
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:41,200
So that's another good thing I like about Mickey and friends right great views hey great views of all the new landscaping

1224
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:47,280
They did at Frontierland. You know all the plates making they did to blend the two areas

1225
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:54,440
Landscaping placemaking city planning yeah the old Star Wars senators. We're hitting all your favorites

1226
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,140
There's what's interesting also?

1227
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:04,060
They do a very good job especially earlier in the day when you're coming into Disneyland about having all those like people on staff

1228
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:07,240
Directing you to spaces and telling you where to go

1229
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,160
I have come in later in the day

1230
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:12,920
And that's an interesting thing and a weird thing only annual passholders do where you go

1231
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:17,440
I'm gonna go down at nine o'clock sure I'm gonna hit the park then and it's a little more lawless

1232
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:21,780
And it's a little interesting that way you can kind of go a little different routes

1233
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:27,940
There's you know you can you can sort of try to park closer and no one's telling you where to go

1234
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:32,820
so it's an interesting and it's it's it can be it can be very rewarding or

1235
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:37,180
It can be a big pain in the ass because you go all the way around the parking garage trying to find a close spot

1236
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:42,280
And there's nothing and then you got to go all the way back so it can there can be big rewards

1237
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:46,880
But you also it can be very hard trying to find a spot at the end of that especially when it's later in the night

1238
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,040
That's what I like about the at the end

1239
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:54,260
That's that's that's an interesting thing to know about going later in the day if I ever were to do that but

1240
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:58,940
What I do like about it early on is that they're making those decisions for you

1241
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:02,340
What can yes stressful moment hunting for parking in a large?

1242
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:08,680
Cavernous structure ends up being something where you're just being guided directly where to go and all you have to do is follow the leader

1243
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:14,580
I think it's interesting to like sometimes if you're if they're directing you to the roof of the structure

1244
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:18,800
That is a very good thing and sometimes. It's very bad like it seems like they load

1245
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:25,780
Based on like whatever algorithm they had that tells them to load from the bottom up that day or top down that day or skip

1246
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:27,320
a level like

1247
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:32,180
Whatever system they had for crowd projections or like how they should fill it out

1248
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:38,180
I'd like to point out also that they I agree that I think the flow in the place is great

1249
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:42,860
And you rarely end up you don't really end up in a traffic jam at the end of the day which is your aim for?

1250
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:46,360
Disneyland but apparently when it was

1251
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,400
developed

1252
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:53,780
Michael Eisner really specifically took credit for the flow of it

1253
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:59,020
He said he like made a point of saying it's this new thing speed parking and I actually personally

1254
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:01,560
Figured out how it would he did sort of?

1255
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:06,720
Shaking credit and apparently for the first couple months it did not work and they had to redraw it

1256
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:11,220
Oh, so whatever I did or did not lay out did not work as well as today

1257
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:17,760
Well when he's on the podcast will get will give me a hard questioning about it an hour about just the parking

1258
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,560
contributions

1259
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,780
Well, well, what do we think? Yeah, do the regular?

1260
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:27,440
the structure the so we so what we do obviously with

1261
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:31,920
The rides as we say do we want to keep it as is do we want to plus it up or do we want to?

1262
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:37,960
Burn it down for insurance money. So I'm thinking we do the same scale to do our same choices for this

1263
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:44,500
I have thoughts. I'm sure you guys do too. I'll make sure that I do by the time your thoughts. Okay, great

1264
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:51,000
Jason do you want to start or do you want me? Oh sure. No, I'll go ahead. I say I do like this parking structure

1265
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,160
I say plus it up. What's are obviously doing they're building another parking structure

1266
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:59,920
Go even further because I put a put a

1267
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,560
Monterey Alcafe type restaurant. Oh, what are these parking structure?

1268
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:10,220
I would love like if I want a quick bite to eat at the beginning or end of the day that would be a

1269
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:14,960
Real treat right? I would like that a lot. What type of food? Oh

1270
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,940
I would think you would want to go broad

1271
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:24,700
I think you would want like either like some some sweet maybe some simple ice cream selection some sandwiches or burgers and like

1272
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:29,120
Personal pizzas like personal pizzas are always agreeable. That seems excessive

1273
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:34,900
Structure I think that would be great. I

1274
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:35,840
Think I

1275
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:41,480
Cheese or pepperoni sir like something simple. Sure where they don't have to customize it too much

1276
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:45,500
Bring for us cafe burgers without the cafe. Yeah, rainforest mini

1277
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,400
I I think maybe you could I you know

1278
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:51,080
I would say maybe like a coffee kiosk or just even just a guy with coffee

1279
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:56,280
Or some waters could probably clean up there. Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea especially in a hot day

1280
01:39:56,280 --> 01:40:00,880
I honestly I'm just gonna vote for keep it as is. I think it's very functional. I think it does its job

1281
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:03,540
I think what you're talking about the exit also speaks to in the same way

1282
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:05,540
They have escalators going directly to the levels

1283
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:09,560
They have a direct exit from each level that you could you could go in your car

1284
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:15,040
You don't have to circle around and and let other cars merge in which is pretty efficient. I think it works

1285
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:20,220
Well, I think it's it's a model for what theme park parking structures should be and I'm glad they're replicating it with a second one

1286
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:26,360
So is so yeah, I vote keep it as is. Okay. Wow. That is a good answer. I have

1287
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:30,880
I would say plus it up and this is a silly idea

1288
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:36,420
But if you can give me a little more Disney magic in the actual parking garage

1289
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:41,900
Like for instance say you're walking down and like maybe every 30th parking space

1290
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:45,420
They have like Doc Hudson from cars parked there

1291
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:47,660
Oh, that would be fun. Just something like that

1292
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,220
Like a little you don't even have to notice it every time

1293
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:56,500
Maybe there's only one of the Disney's cars parked on a level each time and you got to go find them or something

1294
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,860
Which I guess now that I'm thinking about it means you're like

1295
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:06,260
Running around looking for lightning McQueen, right might not be a good idea, but I think it's fun. I think it's good

1296
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:09,440
I think yeah, you do just little things like that

1297
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:12,300
I don't want I will say this when I was a kid

1298
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:16,400
I always kind of wanted the characters to be working at the parks

1299
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:22,040
So once in a while Goofy's in the ticket booth when you drive up you hand him your annual pass

1300
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:27,380
He fumbles around with it. Maybe hands you back a piece of bread or something from the thing the bread

1301
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:29,680
He was eating bread in this scenario

1302
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:35,900
But something like I want a little more if you give me a little more magic at the start and then on that as far as

1303
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:41,620
When you're taking the tram, let's get that fence has got to go that fence has got to be I can't I don't want to see

1304
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:46,240
Through it. I want some I don't want to see the big building. I want to be

1305
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:55,520
Transported to a magical place and I would like a lot of theming to happen on that little journey. So plus it up. Okay, I

1306
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:56,480
think

1307
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:00,620
Having the levels named after the characters is good

1308
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:07,300
But I think that the Disney lexicon is so deep at this point, especially with all of their recent mergers

1309
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:10,240
What if every single parking space?

1310
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:11,980
Has its own character

1311
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:19,540
And you start stretching and it's every it's all 101 Dalmatians, right it's every

1312
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:22,880
999 happy haunts. It's

1313
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,160
you know

1314
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,120
every

1315
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:31,680
like every every every extra in the Avengers were pointed like you have to like zoom in to

1316
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:38,260
Like somebody getting blown up in some see you like zoom into like a little pixelated head every pod racer including team topa galey

1317
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:46,100
Every student quadrenneros is in there every every padawan every student from Xavier's Institute

1318
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:51,200
Mm-hmm. All right, they're getting the X-men. Yeah, so I think they great specific characters

1319
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:59,360
Who are the only place that they are in Canon is in these spaces Ludwig von Drake's great nephew that kind of yeah

1320
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,980
Yeah, it can be a great source of future ideas

1321
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:04,920
characters from shows that were

1322
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:08,540
Greenlit to pilot by ABC and ultimately not picked up

1323
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:12,620
the character Dave Chappelle played on the show

1324
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:18,040
No, it wasn't called friends. He and Jim Brewer were on a really like vaguely titled

1325
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:23,800
It may have been called neighbors or something like that get Jim Brewer the neighbor on one of those parking spaces

1326
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:30,560
So deep and it's a way to honor the vast Disney ABC ESPN ESPN anchors that

1327
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:32,620
Yeah

1328
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:37,520
Is that Chris Berman is that one of them? Yeah, there's a rich eyes in there's a rich eyes in space

1329
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,840
This this is fun. You get a deed there

1330
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:46,560
You would be so bizarre if you got the same one twice, right every every every visit difference. There you go

1331
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,280
It's very exciting. Yeah, that's a great idea. All right

1332
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:54,660
So yeah, I think there's our there's our take on the Mickey and Friends parking strike

1333
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:58,800
But if you want a sequel start demanding it now and we're happy to do so

1334
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,040
Or maybe we wait until

1335
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:08,820
Until the Avengers lot is open. Yeah, I think that's that's we've got our sequel already scheduled for us. Yeah. Yeah much like Marvel itself

1336
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:10,540
We've got it penciled in for

1337
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:13,560
One a year

1338
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:18,400
Hey, well while we're here, let's do a quick thing at the end

1339
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:23,140
There's a segment that we we've only done once before and I don't remember how we did it before but I believe it may have

1340
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:25,940
involved a scary whisper which was

1341
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:33,500
Confession land and what this segment is that's very committed to is it what this segment is is we

1342
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,400
confess

1343
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:40,720
deeply held theme park it world secrets things things that we believe that we think may be

1344
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:45,080
Unpopular that we've been afraid to come out of the closet with but here we're in a safe space

1345
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:51,220
And we think you we are with you listeners as well. So we're gonna share some unpopular theme park opinions. Sure

1346
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:53,460
Mike, would you like to go first? Sure. I'll go first

1347
01:44:53,800 --> 01:45:00,380
I think this would get me tart and feathered if I said it outside of the place that I'm gonna talk about

1348
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:05,680
Sleeping Beauty cast or she's yeah Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland

1349
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:08,120
Is too small

1350
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:14,820
Wow, and it's sacrilegious. I know to say this because it was the first park. It's an icon of Disneyland

1351
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:20,880
But what they're doing now in Hong Kong Disneyland is they're taking a very similar castle and they're plussing it up

1352
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,780
They're making it bigger. They're making it a little more

1353
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:27,440
Impressive. Mm-hmm. Let's do it here. I don't know. Let's do it in Disneyland

1354
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,080
I think you know, I don't want it

1355
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:34,220
I don't want you to demolish it make a totally different looking castle, but let's make some towers that are taller

1356
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:38,580
Let's let's do something fun. Like let's we don't have to be a

1357
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:42,900
Frozen in time, you know, we're taking this idea. Let's let's make it a little tall

1358
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:49,620
It doesn't have to be giant doesn't have to be like the Cinderella castle in Florida. I just think let's let's fuck around with it

1359
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:51,660
Yeah, I think that's fair

1360
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:55,980
Do we all I don't know. Yeah, there's another what's everyone's feeling on that's me about that

1361
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:59,340
I think it'd be a bummer to see it like closed for that's true time

1362
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:04,940
And I don't like there's been bad things messing with those castles like when the Disney World one was a birthday cake

1363
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:06,480
Well Jason, I love the birthday

1364
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:10,560
The unpopular opinion hate the birthday cake

1365
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:16,200
I watched a lot of old Disney specials on YouTube and stuff and I'm disappointed when it's a birthday cake one Nick

1366
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:19,220
Do you know that I saw no what is it?

1367
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:26,220
Cinderella castle and Walt Disney World into a big pink birthday cake. What was the occasion the 25th anniversary of Disney World?

1368
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:30,280
Oh, wow. Okay. So this was this was how recent was this?

1369
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:37,900
96 oh, okay. Wow that Disney World is that yeah, we're coming up on the 50th anniversary of Disney World Wow

1370
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:40,500
Oh man, that is gaudy and tacky

1371
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:43,600
Well little Jason little Mike loved it

1372
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,980
Melting away like like that cake

1373
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:52,480
Little Jason was a chubby boy. I don't know little Michaels excuse. Oh

1374
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:57,480
So you were imagining eating the I was just see I was just floating towards the castle off the ground

1375
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:01,380
Quick the 25th anniversary is over. We need someone to eat

1376
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:09,540
A typical Jason dream. Can you do it little boy? I I will serve

1377
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:15,100
This is a little bit of a tangent but on the Sleeping Beauty's castle up front a few years ago

1378
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:17,360
I shot this commercial with a guy

1379
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:22,400
With an actor and an older actor and he was telling me that his previous job

1380
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:29,200
like he just worked a job as the major Domo in character at Sleeping Beauty's castle and

1381
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:36,600
And but the for the occasion the event it was was that Lars Ulrich the drummer from Metallica his

1382
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:41,780
he had a set it up where he was going to propose to his

1383
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:46,000
His then is his girlfriend then fiancee

1384
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:53,260
At Sleeping Beauty castle but have it be this big like in character thing and it's just like I would like I would

1385
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:58,640
Specific that it was a Lars Ulrich blew my mind because it was like the least metal thing I could imagine

1386
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,640
Yeah, because his girlfriend must have loved Disney

1387
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,280
It was been like she was wanting to be a princess or something like that

1388
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:09,980
But just the fact that he was going to these lengths to entertain Wow this the the guy behind, you know

1389
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:13,820
Ride the lightning that that was yeah was ultimately where his life ended up

1390
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:16,880
Like a lineup of characters and this guy was one of them

1391
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:17,100
Yeah

1392
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:23,320
He was he was like the I don't major to I think it's like an attendant like like they had they were like in the carriage

1393
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:26,360
Like they wrote the carriage up after hours or something like that

1394
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:31,380
And he was like he was like like like like you like you know your highness or whatever just sort of doted on them

1395
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:37,120
And then he had a proposal to her at the storybook castle at Disneyland. It's very very bizarre

1396
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:42,180
Oh, I have been thrown because major Domo is a yes. That's what I have to neo and I thought he was playing

1397
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:46,700
That I pointed at Scott like oh my god, what's

1398
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:50,620
Neo yeah, because I was starting to do the math of wait is Lars Ulrich a big captain

1399
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:57,760
Yeah, no I think I think this was I think this is a character and I think this has some sort of royal

1400
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:02,660
It's like a royal title of some sort like a royal attendant. I see. Yeah, we don't know the real time

1401
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:03,820
We just know that's a character

1402
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:07,040
Like the Disneyland thing

1403
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:12,860
Wow, okay, well, I don't know not a big disagreement there. Yeah, I'll make it a cake. That's all right

1404
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:16,180
Yeah, don't turn it. Okay. I'll be honest wouldn't mind if it was a cake

1405
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:19,680
But okay, all right

1406
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,760
I'll go okay

1407
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:29,440
Nick I was thinking about you being on the show you host a very popular food podcast and this actually came up in conversation

1408
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:37,020
you know how many bars and and place there are to get a drink at Disneyland a California Adventure and

1409
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:42,800
I like those places and always had good food and drinks and good service

1410
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:47,600
But like we're talking about the tram ride getting you into the park

1411
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,760
I think Disney's got a

1412
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:54,900
Totally revamp how they get people in and out of those bars because some of these places

1413
01:49:54,900 --> 01:50:00,820
They run like any bar in LA where you just if it's too crowded

1414
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:07,220
You just show up and wait until a seat opens up or like the Cove Bar at California Adventure

1415
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:10,160
Which is currently closed. It's being redone

1416
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,020
Just has like a queue

1417
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:19,600
it just has a line like a ride and and like a line people wait in until a table opens up and

1418
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:25,820
That's fine. If I'm going to J's bar in Silver Lake, California or

1419
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,740
On Ventura beautiful

1420
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:37,120
Beautiful Studio City, California, but I expect a little more panache from Disneyland like there are like tiny

1421
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:43,360
restaurants that that that will text you when your tables ready and I

1422
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:45,560
Need to make

1423
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:51,380
buzzers this so in the world of these magic bands to get you on the rides way in advance

1424
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:55,940
How is there not a better system especially in a place like sorry where we can say

1425
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:59,980
I'm gonna say this doesn't sound like a confession you're making this just sounds like a good idea

1426
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:04,440
Everyone would agree with I just think I think it's a so it's it's a hole

1427
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:07,240
It's it's a source especially like Trader Sam's like

1428
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:12,040
Controversial opinion to have this is just a good idea you

1429
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:16,960
Trouble coming up with I think they need to

1430
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:23,360
Make the bars a little better in terms of getting you in there, and I'm surprised they haven't done it so far

1431
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:25,060
This isn't good idea land

1432
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:32,340
We like your idea, but I'm coming in soft cuz I

1433
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:37,620
The first time we did this I said sometimes I miss the original California adventure and everyone

1434
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:46,400
All right, but that was not see now that you just walk up to stuff cuz there were no lines, right?

1435
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:52,420
I want a little of that ease no one was queued up to do the tour of the mission tortilla factory

1436
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:57,860
Yeah, I was the king of that place. That's what I would do where I would just go again

1437
01:51:57,860 --> 01:52:03,820
Mine's a little more Disney

1438
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:12,340
Classicist and I don't know if I don't know how you guys will feel I I don't like the dole whips

1439
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:15,200
I

1440
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,760
Had my first

1441
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:22,300
With you and Lindsay and I know I I didn't dig it and maybe I do it again

1442
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:23,680
Maybe I need to remind myself

1443
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:29,860
But I don't know I found it to be sort of like weird and watery and Shincy and after all the build-up

1444
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:36,960
I just didn't it was not the like grand perfectly crafted magical dessert that I might have imagined

1445
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,320
I find it like that the the sort of

1446
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:41,080
Therapy

1447
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:47,360
Watery thing that the McDonald's soft serve comes in it feels like like what like canned peaches

1448
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,820
Sit in it's like just the goo

1449
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:52,780
It feels very I don't know it feels very can't fit

1450
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:57,360
I think if you like I think if you crunch the number they charge like like

1451
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:03,400
450 for that thing I think production costs of each dole whip have got to be seven cents no more

1452
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:08,360
Yeah, it's pure profit right you got the float or the regular one just the regular one the regular one, okay?

1453
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:14,160
I think that's right. Uh-huh all right, but you responded sharply to that. Yeah, I mean those are I love the dole whip that for me

1454
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:16,240
That's the light when I go to Disneyland. That's a sweet treat

1455
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:20,820
I've got my eye on and then I got it. I got to try that at some point when I'm over in it

1456
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:24,060
I'm turning off Twitter notifications the day this comes out

1457
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:27,320
Scott's about to get his ass ripped out

1458
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:32,520
Everyone ends up just being mad at Sheridan for proposing having a more sensible view

1459
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:36,140
We like the chaos

1460
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:45,180
Nick you know if you get a dole whip at the Disneyland Hotel you can pay an extra markup in the poor shot of rum on it for you

1461
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:47,000
Whoa, yeah, okay?

1462
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:50,440
I'm into that you could so you can go play bloody mortal combat

1463
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:52,380
and get hammered on rum dole whip

1464
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:56,880
Which which bar is this in the it's like the coffee house. Oh the coffee

1465
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:01,000
It's like yeah, just a quick little window at the Disneyland Hotel

1466
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,300
You gotta come down with you got a roll with us down there

1467
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:09,120
You know I 100% could that idea of making that boozy I think that's the only way you can improve that thing

1468
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:12,640
Yeah, yeah, give it give it another shot Scott. I probably should you know what else

1469
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:17,600
I think I think that the like the weight is so crazy and the fact that there is such

1470
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:22,400
Look that is a congested area already in Adventureland like to me when I hit

1471
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:28,360
when I'm heading into Adventureland trying to get an Indiana Jones fast pass or something and it is just

1472
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,880
Packed to the brim with strollers

1473
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:34,040
And then you run into that line that is super long and that bathroom is really credit

1474
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:37,940
That's the exact zone where I think oh, maybe we shouldn't have come today

1475
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:43,180
Really crazy sure so I think I'm associating it also with the with the crowd

1476
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:45,640
Yeah, and and maybe just over hype

1477
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:51,100
I think it was presented as you know they have these these these pineapple things, but I don't know it's like

1478
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:56,760
I think Disneyland is like incredible restaurants at this point. I really like Napa Rose really like heart they circle

1479
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:00,940
So if you see a list that's like but the number one is still the soft sir

1480
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:07,200
I just don't I think it's a little over built up right yeah, yeah, it's not transcendent, but it's

1481
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:13,920
As an adult I noticed the artificial taste now right but then after a while you go well the artificial taste is good right

1482
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:19,860
And then it just whatever takes over. You're also you do you love the sugary bullshit. Oh, yeah, I am a

1483
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:26,660
Yes, I have when we were somebody asked just on Twitter what our favorite beer it up caught was and I drank

1484
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:28,320
No beer in Epcot

1485
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:33,560
I just drank colorful drinks that look like those Vegas those slushy Vegas booze drinks

1486
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:36,560
So like it would be like the rising Sun in Japan

1487
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:43,440
And it was just like a red cherry drink that you would get like it's just a slushy with with a little booze in it

1488
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:47,260
So yeah, no I like artificial bullshit. Yep. Yeah

1489
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:49,080
My turn yeah, okay, all right

1490
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:53,480
I got I got I got to I'll give the first one quick because I don't think it's going to be as controversial though

1491
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:55,960
Some people might be upset another food one

1492
01:55:57,880 --> 01:55:58,320
Big

1493
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:05,880
Turkey legs take a hike. I don't like no big turkey legs. I think they're gross and I think they're I

1494
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:08,000
Feel like you're gonna get sick when you eat them

1495
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,960
And I feel like I don't like what like it feels perverse to see these people just walking around these big hunks of meat

1496
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:19,620
Like these kids with these giant hunks of meat these that are as big as their thighs and then as you bite into it

1497
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:23,060
It's like there's like mid-rare turkey like just a little bit

1498
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:28,700
They're never thoroughly cooked and it's just got to be the cheapest meat like what you're talking about with the markup for the

1499
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:29,860
Dole Whip, I think it's the same sort of thing

1500
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:36,180
I think they're getting those things for like ten cents a pound and and they're selling them for for a huge markup and it's

1501
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:40,840
Pure profit, but I think they're disgusting you see some weird colors in those things. You really do

1502
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:48,640
Pinks and purple right very unsettling. Yeah, it's like it's it's like subway meat, but it's like on a bone. It's really gross

1503
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:52,500
It's really low grade meat Jason's been oddly quiet during

1504
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:04,120
I

1505
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:06,020
Castle cake giant turkey legs

1506
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:13,240
I think we I think people forget they're meant to be shared in terms of the size

1507
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:18,680
Wow, some of that color and though are you sharing it? Right? I don't get it that much. I mean, I think it's

1508
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:21,140
It's not one of my go-tos anymore

1509
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:26,560
But at a certain point it was oh, yeah around 11 or 12. Yeah, I put one of those babies away

1510
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:29,900
I think I think they're I think they're for kids but also but maybe kids should be eating them

1511
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:32,820
I would pay a hundred dollars for a photo of you at 11 with a giant

1512
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:37,620
I can't see

1513
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:45,000
I I've never had one. Yeah, I don't had one

1514
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,020
I think a turkey leg can be good if you get like that the leg at a Thanksgiving dinner

1515
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:53,340
That can be you know, you get a well a well-cooked turkey, but I just the theme park for right

1516
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:57,640
I would stay away from but yeah, I was just gonna say I think this is not that controversial here

1517
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:01,900
But I do think like that is a big thing with a lot of people. There's a shirt. There's a new shirt

1518
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:03,860
I just saw that it's like turkey

1519
01:58:03,860 --> 01:58:05,980
It says turkey leg and you can get it Disney now

1520
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:11,620
So it's so popular that they listed on the in the thing where you list like the all the Jackson 5

1521
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:14,700
Like Michael and Tito and germaine. Yeah

1522
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:18,060
Yeah, like churro and turkey leg as well

1523
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:19,600
Maybe multiple sure

1524
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:24,780
With like churro and Mickey ice cream bar and yeah

1525
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:28,060
So so it's like a thing as much as we don't care

1526
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:33,160
I do think that like it pulled well enough in like surveys of like would you wear a shirt that?

1527
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:37,660
Probably talked about eating a giant turkey leg and people like yeah, I'm sure there are people who love it

1528
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:40,100
I do remember on a fairly recent visit to Disneyland

1529
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:47,380
I saw like a like a 30 something dude wearing like a nightmare before Christmas hoodie and then a Jack Sparrow like Mickey hat

1530
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:53,180
With like the dreadlocks and then it carrying a big turkey leg and he was having more fun than I'd ever had it

1531
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:54,980
Yeah, like a big shit, right?

1532
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,860
But but so that's that's my one opinion

1533
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:04,160
But my other one that I think will be a lot more controversial and I think will may even make me a priya

1534
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:05,680
to listen podcast

1535
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:09,140
Not into fireworks. Oh

1536
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:15,720
I think they're I think they create a

1537
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:21,020
Their necks up to look at it to gawk it at things or maybe if they don't have an ideal

1538
01:59:21,020 --> 01:59:26,340
Angle in addition to all people just just staking out various places to sit and stand and watch it

1539
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:27,200
I don't like that

1540
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:32,980
there's like that they've created that as a profit center for the park that like you can buy like a

1541
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:37,920
Good seats to watch like the world of color or you can buy like a little picnic basket to watch it

1542
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:43,860
I I to me it's like that's that's not what's fun about a theme park is is finding some place to sit and look at

1543
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:49,100
I just like I want to like go on attractions and I don't like that

1544
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:54,040
It's positioned as this big thing at the end of the day and I think it just kind of

1545
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:58,940
To me it disrupts the park way too much the fact that this event exists

1546
01:59:58,940 --> 02:00:03,720
So just to be clear when you say fireworks world of showcase or world of world color. Jesus Christ

1547
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:07,260
We've been recording for what feels like four hours now talking about the garage

1548
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:12,020
I've supplied you guys with your longest dullest episode

1549
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:21,280
World yeah, so world of color does not have does it have fireworks like you're saying any sort of show outdoors

1550
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:25,220
Oh a firework sort of thing. No, no, I know I'm just saying so you said you didn't like fireworks

1551
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:30,580
I'm just your blanket saying sort of any of the live shows and like fantastic doesn't really have fireworks

1552
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:32,100
But it has like pyro effects

1553
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:37,840
I may I may have been conflating them all under the sort of the sort of nighttime night time spectacular

1554
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:43,520
Yeah, I think the whole nighttime spectacular thing. I'm not really into I understand there for families

1555
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,620
I understand there for kids

1556
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:49,460
but I just see so much of the park getting roped off when they're going to happen and I and I just feel like there's

1557
02:00:49,460 --> 02:00:51,340
such a disruption and

1558
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:54,800
And I like I'd like to I'm fine with stumbling upon them

1559
02:00:54,800 --> 02:01:00,380
Like I'm fine if fireworks are just happening, but I'd like it being a big to do. I'm just not into it

1560
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:05,880
Hmm. I'll say one in and when we did this before was like just shows and parade

1561
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:11,220
Yeah, and I forget if I threw fireworks into there, but I yeah, I definitely agree, but I you know what?

1562
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:12,460
I'm glad they

1563
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:17,400
They had the bad thing is that they create a bottlenecks and bad credit flow

1564
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:21,380
Good thing is it eats up a lot of people and that's a good time to hit rides, right?

1565
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:26,000
You can get on Space Mountain sure if you plan accordingly last time we were there

1566
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,220
We were I don't know what I fell asleep at the wheel as far as planning

1567
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:32,880
But we kept running into shows and parades and it was very frustrating

1568
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:39,680
So I get that concern but I will say if the shower parade is right the Disney magic

1569
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:43,180
I mean if we saw the Main Street Electrical Parade when it came back

1570
02:01:43,180 --> 02:01:48,700
Tremendous, I mean, it's so great to see that. There's a certain I don't forget what the fireworks show is now

1571
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:53,300
But there is one that there's one that was like during the 60th

1572
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:58,920
Celebrated like all the movies and that one's like fine, but then there's one that like is just about the theme parks

1573
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:02,440
So like sitting with everybody watching fireworks

1574
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:07,900
But then playing like Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean and then like having these new projections they have on the castle

1575
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:10,280
I mean, it's a it's a magical time

1576
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:15,620
Come on. Yeah, so good selling. Yeah, it's like an uncle guilting us

1577
02:02:15,620 --> 02:02:23,300
Has Mc but then that takes the boats out of Commission for the night and right in the Mark Twain around at night

1578
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:29,000
And that's I think that's a missed opportunity for that giant body water at California Adventure

1579
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:34,500
They never put any boats on that add some real kinetic energy to that part of the park. That's a good idea. Yeah

1580
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:40,720
And you don't like the Mark Twain repurposed when all the characters are on it later too cuz that takes you out of the illusion that

1581
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:45,380
It's just from the turn of the century. I think it's a little disrespectful. I

1582
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:48,180
Think they're having a little too much fun for my taste

1583
02:02:48,180 --> 02:02:51,420
We've got streamers down guys. We've talked about it

1584
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:56,260
I think before on this but Jason has a certificate because he drove the Mark Twain. Oh, yeah

1585
02:02:56,260 --> 02:03:01,740
I got the captain the Mark Twain one time. That's fun. Yeah his birthday. It was great talking. It was my birthday years ago

1586
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:09,380
Yeah, when you were a child, yeah, you just like you were really you want to talk about a pig and shit

1587
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:15,620
Yeah, I got a side of guest book there's a guest book up there oh man, yeah

1588
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:20,580
Yeah, that's pretty great only way to improve it as if the Mark Twain was made a cake

1589
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:23,500
We need you to drive it and eat it when you're

1590
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:29,240
That is going to 100% your his dream tonight, oh, yeah, he falls asleep

1591
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:33,120
I don't think we're at the point where we have listeners who would do fan art yet

1592
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:37,660
I don't think anybody's that committed. I think the free time you call it right calling the shot now

1593
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:44,760
There's somebody will drive and ask for this. I want artwork of Jason driving the cake mark 20

1594
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:49,460
My first request to the audience if there is one

1595
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:55,920
Maybe a bit ambitious to start with I'll say if you want to put in all of the phantasmic characters

1596
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:03,220
No, no, I'm not having that oh wait, yeah, no wait, that's against her it's here that alright it'll add time anyway

1597
02:04:03,220 --> 02:04:04,520
Have you listened to nothing?

1598
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:08,080
Do you understand my whims or not?

1599
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:13,540
Yeah, all right fan art. It's time. I'm calling. I like that

1600
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:19,060
Podcast arc where it doesn't like naturally happen. Oh, right. Somebody did a drawing of me. I'm like, yeah arts now

1601
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:22,120
Here's what it is get to work. I

1602
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:24,000
Think that's right. I think that's good

1603
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:31,300
We haven't been aggressive about anything else in our lives and this time now it's time for that now it's time to demand

1604
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:40,260
Alright well on that note Nick wager you survived podcast the ride. Thank you so much for being here. It was a blast

1605
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:43,140
Yeah, thank you so much. Yeah, three and a half hours

1606
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:46,840
Avatar land weights worth

1607
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:51,000
Anything you'd like to plug or direct people to

1608
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:55,820
If they made it hey, you know check out doughboys the podcast about chain restaurants

1609
02:04:55,820 --> 02:05:02,080
We have new episodes every Thursday host it with my friend and previous guest of podcast the ride Mike Mitchell

1610
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:04,340
So give that a listen if you like if you like

1611
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:09,000
Hearing two men talk about food. I had a very funny realization earlier

1612
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,900
Which is if people listen to this but have not listened to doughboys yet

1613
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:19,100
They will spend a few minutes at the top of the show going who is this guy Mitch? They're really ragging on

1614
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:24,400
The assumption that we know all his opinions at the same time I guess he was on our show

1615
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:26,940
Yeah, I guess that's true. Yeah, but I also find it

1616
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:33,900
I feel like probably a ton of our audience has to be doughboys fans already and and rightfully so and thanks for

1617
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:38,820
Yeah, thanks. Thanks for doing a little merger here. Of course. My pleasure is a blessed

1618
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:41,140

1620
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:50,100
Podcast the ride on Twitter and Instagram

1621
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:52,140
any anything else for this and

1622
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:54,560
Let's get that fan. Let's get the fan art

1623
02:05:54,560 --> 02:06:00,740
I mean if we could have multiple people doing different art from different perspective like everyone can bring their own art style to it

1624
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:01,520
I think that would be great

1625
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:06,860
Maybe split up where somebody does just like the black and white and somebody else fills in the color, right?

1626
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:13,440
There's a way to ease the burden. I think I'll also throw this in cotton candy smoke poofs coming

1627
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:15,740
Yeah of the boat. Oh

1628
02:06:15,740 --> 02:06:23,840
Also, can we have on the dock waiting for the boats arrival a Scott Gardner enjoying a dual whip

1629
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:29,980
Thought bubble I was wrong

1630
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:33,700
I'm eating this and my own shit and

1631
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:39,000
Meanwhile there is on in a canoe is Mike Carlson with the thought bubble

1632
