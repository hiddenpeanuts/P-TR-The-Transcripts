1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,480
Warning, the following podcast contains general pleasantness, an East Coast meat check-in,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,200
freaks and a whole new level of niche beach boys talk.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,320
All this plus Ian Riccobani joins us to talk Disney World Resort TV.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,280
Put this episode on an endless loop.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,000
It's podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,720
Welcome to Podcast, The Ride, a theme park podcast hosted by three men who would love

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,880
to see the world presented to them on a TV in a hotel room running in a pleasant loop

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,280
over and over again.

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,560
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,880
I love that loop.

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,080
We all love, well, any loop maybe.

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Don't you think?

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Any loop, yeah.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Most loops?

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,120
But I was definitely a kid who as soon as I walked into a hotel room, I turned on the

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
television.

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Well, sure.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Scott Garner here too.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,600
Did you also have this loop fascination?

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,240
Absolutely, and I hope that before I die that my life loops before my eyes.

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,920
half hour of all the best stuff that I could have done and did set to very pleasant music.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,440
Well, that would be good if it was infinite too, because then it means like you have forever

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
life.

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Life doesn't end.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,040
If I could just, wow, okay.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,040
I think that is my, we're coming out strong on today's topic.

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
That's heaven.

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
I've described heaven.

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,480
This is how high we are on today's topic that I have just described it as my idea of what

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,120
eternal life should be.

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
Yes.

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:58,240
Watching an endless loop of the best possible activities available in my life.

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,880
This is going to come up with our guests and I'll bring them in one second, but it's like

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,520
when an artist passes away and their greatest hits goes into circulation and they start

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,120
doing different greatest hits, box sets.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,720
That's what you would get in heaven is just your greatest hits on a loop in your head

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
forever.

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Geez, cool.

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Which would be awesome.

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,640
Is it going to be weird like some of the Michael Jackson greatest hits where like three of

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,840
them aren't me and I'm watching it like this is not, I know my own voice.

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
This is not me.

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,320
Yes, there will be those, but you'll be like kind of in the background of the memory and

46
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,680
you'll be like, oh yeah, I did.

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,880
I came in the door during this like weird blow up between two people.

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,000
It's a weird memory that you're seeing, but you go, oh, whoa, I was there, but it was

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
very brief.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,160
So that's similar to like, you know, Michael did like write the second verse of this.

51
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,400
He was involved a little bit.

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,920
I grazed this memory.

53
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Okay.

54
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Then it's allowed in the greatest hits.

55
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Yeah.

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Perfect settled.

57
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
But yeah, we have a lot to get to.

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
So let's bring the guest in.

59
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,040
He's a professional wrestling broadcaster and commentator for New Japan Strong and Ring

60
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
of Honor.

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,000
And more importantly, he's a Beach Boys aficionado.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,280
It's Ian Riccobani.

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,640
Welcome to Podcast the Ride.

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
Hey everyone.

65
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Thanks for having me.

66
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,800
I think the most important is Beach Boy aficionado.

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,520
My son's middle name is Wilson.

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Wow.

69
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Really?

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Wow.

71
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
That's beautiful.

72
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,640
That's all right.

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,680
Well, that bears that.

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,560
That's like a tattoo that you gave your son.

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,800
Not even to yourself.

76
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,120
You passed it on to.

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
And that's what it is.

78
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,000
But that's what the Beach Boys are all about, family and generations, you know, harmonizing

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
together.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So that's beautiful.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, sure.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,260
And it's all about just remembering the good times, right?

83
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:48,440
That's my favorite Beach Boys genre is none of their actual hits is the everything that

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,360
happened from 1981 to present where it's just talking about how it used to be the good

85
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
times.

86
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,840
I know that is it is a full speaking of greatest hits.

87
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,760
You could absolutely do an album, a greatest hits album that is just the songs that are

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,840
nostalgic for the past, which was so crazy now that their height was like their height

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,440
was only like five, six years long.

90
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,360
And then it's been decades and decades of, hey, remember the good times three years ago?

91
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,840
It started with do it again.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,040
We got to get back together and do it again.

93
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,360
And then there's songs that quote, do it again.

94
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,880
We got to do it again with Barbara and Rhonda.

95
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,560
Probably no, it's no, not Barbara and Rhonda.

96
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,200
And they might have Barbara and Rhonda.

97
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Yeah. Yeah. Unless they got it wrong.

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,200
They're they're they're all confused.

99
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,840
But yeah, I know it's like, yeah, nostalgia for themselves has been their brand since

100
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,080
the late 60s.

101
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,800
It's been incredible.

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,080
I mean, even that song that ended up on Baywatch that was a weird cash grab that was on that

103
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,360
early 90s album that they did Baywatch just to just to remaster.

104
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,120
I know Mike's Mike's been watching them start to finish in beautifully remastered high

105
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,000
definition. No, Scott has me.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, yeah.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,920
Oh, yeah. The second time I've confused the the likes and

108
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,240
enjoyments, the first time I reached out to Mike, I was all excited because I thought he

109
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
was talking about help.

110
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,840
The song about the health food restaurant Brian Wilson started.

111
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,600
Oh, H.E.L.P. on the way.

112
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,920
Yeah. Which was the worst turn off so accessible, baby.

113
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,440
H.E.L.P.

114
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,400
And then as the address of the of the when Brian Wilson opened a health food store

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,840
called the Radiant Radish.

116
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,920
Yes. I don't know how in the world he was the owner of a store.

117
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,520
How did like just notoriously out of it troubled man and then in the middle of all that,

118
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,000
he ran a store.

119
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,040
Did he like order the pills and the supplements?

120
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,080
What did that mean that he owned a store?

121
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,040
Which lasted longer than the height of the Beach Boys.

122
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,760
I think it lasted like five years.

123
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,280
I think it was open longer.

124
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,120
I think it was like 68 through 74.

125
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
It was open. So really.

126
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,560
So is Wikipedia should say health food store owner, a musician.

127
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Yeah. I could be giving misinformation.

128
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,400
Yeah. Wow. Wow.

129
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,920
That's insane. So what really you reached out to Mike hoping to treasure trove of

130
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,400
Beach Boys stuff and only now are we unlocking it.

131
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,120
And the listeners are reaping the rewards of songs that they have never heard of.

132
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,600
Well, it may never look up.

133
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,840
I'm sure they've brought the recent compilation sale on sailor, which is a combination

134
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,560
of the 1972 album and the 1973 album Holland that was just released on Spotify.

135
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
It's great. Oh, baby.

136
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,480
That's that's my sweet spot is the I love Carlin Passions in Holland

137
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,880
and I love the live album in concert from 73 where you got Blondie and Ricky Fetar

138
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,360
in the band. So the band is actually good live, maybe for the only time.

139
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,480
In their history, Dennis Wilson, history for you guys, Dennis Wilson, the drummer

140
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,680
of the band, walked through a plate glass window

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,480
and shattered his hand and thus making him not able to drum for the band.

142
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,800
But he still wanted to go on tour, you know, and get drunk and get laid and everything.

143
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,960
So they had to hire a different drummer.

144
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,280
And then he just like stood up in front of the stage with his band bandaged up hand

145
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
just like just and he was there just for charm.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,080
Because they were. Yeah, yeah.

147
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,160
Just to almost like the the mighty, mighty Boston's side

148
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,960
dancer guy, except without the dancing. Right. Right.

149
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,520
And Dennis obviously was the sex symbol as identified by Drew Carey

150
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,320
a couple of weeks ago at the Grammy Salute the Beach Boys, to which Mike

151
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,440
Love looked like someone insulted his mother because obviously,

152
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,360
obviously, Mike Love is the sex symbol. Yes.

153
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,960
This is something Scott and I were just talking about a couple of days ago.

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,240
Mike Love's presence on this CBS Beach Boys special from the like balcony.

155
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,360
Essentially, his Statler and Waldorf esque presence.

156
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,400
He was literally a Statler and Waldorf in their spot in the theater.

157
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,840
Yes. Watching all these new acts.

158
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,120
I guess he didn't, you know, make fun of him terribly.

159
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,400
Maybe after the fact, though, I bet. Right.

160
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,240
You know, we we were talking about I thought he liked

161
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,600
Pentatonix the best because he was like standing for them.

162
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,000
And he gave a big thumbs up.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,560
But I don't know if you notice something different

164
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,440
as far as his enjoyment of all the acts.

165
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,600
He's tough to read because if he's at an event, he plays the game well.

166
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,640
He plays the game really well.

167
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,280
So it doesn't matter which administration it is, because, you know,

168
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,240
some people say that, you know, he's with 45.

169
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,840
But let's not forget it was Ronald Reagan who did not let the Beach Boys

170
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,440
who had to he had to fight his interior secretary

171
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,120
to allow them to play in Washington, D.C. in 1983.

172
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,960
Yes, indeed. Yeah, because they brought the wrong elements.

173
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,320
The Beach Boys did an annual concert in Washington, D.C.

174
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,480
and it was canceled by James Watt in the Reagan administration, who said,

175
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,040
No more of this.

176
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,720
We're getting some family friendly entertainment.

177
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Wayne Newton will be doing it. Oh, wow.

178
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,400
Kicking off a giant controversy.

179
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,560
Everybody was furious at James Watt.

180
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,800
You know, like the the only correct case of anger at anyone

181
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,720
in the Reagan administration, otherwise flawless.

182
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,800
Eight year run and the only time anybody got anything wrong.

183
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,840
But then it then it led to great footage of all the Beach Boys

184
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,960
showing up, hanging out with the Reagans and Dennis drunkenly,

185
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,880
sweatily hanging off of Nancy.

186
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:21,840
Just like just sweat, drip a puddle forming at Nancy Reagan's feet

187
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,760
as this man in the final throes of his life soon to drown.

188
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,880
Hanging out of the White House with our first lady. Wow.

189
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Now, and now, Scott, you're you may be more of an expert than I am.

190
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,000
Was that the same clip where he goes where he just yells his name

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,800
uncontrollably during the introductions?

192
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,240
I had never seen that.

193
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,040
You sent that to me.

194
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,960
I was I was trying to do some the backlog of when did when have we

195
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,680
interacted on Twitter before about the Beach Boys?

196
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,200
And that was one where the bands all introducing themselves.

197
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Hey, I'm Al Jardine, I'm Bruce Johnston.

198
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,880
And then he gets to the mic and just goes, yes.

199
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,680
It was the the the Miss World yelling France of its day.

200
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,040
The Howard Dean moment.

201
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

202
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,160
It bridged the gap.

203
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,120
That was the great yell of the 80s.

204
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,160
Then then Dean took it over.

205
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,240
So many great yells over the years.

206
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,440
Wow, Scott, how does this feel?

207
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,520
Because we've teased long teased you doing a full Beach Boys podcast.

208
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,320
Does this feel like cathartic in a way to keep to say this out loud on a microphone?

209
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,360
Mainly look, am I am I thinking about the listener

210
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,720
who grew tired of this in the first minute? Absolutely.

211
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,160
But am I also thinking of the episode after episode slog

212
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,120
of hearing about the perfect albums by Green Day and Brian Setzer

213
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,000
and Aerosmith, the bad boys?

214
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,840
I feel like I've earned this.

215
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,160
I'm not going to milk it, though.

216
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,840
I'm going to step away.

217
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,920
We don't have to do this forever.

218
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,600
But, you know, although maybe we should just go straight into an after show

219
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,160
when all is said and done.

220
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,800
But you know what?

221
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm I'm going to take it and I'm going to milk it.

222
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,960
Well, I'll let Ian, if you want to have just for now,

223
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,320
have a closing thought on the Beach Boys, not that I can't come back

224
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,880
during the episode, but I was going to.

225
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
You sent me a video earlier today that you wanted.

226
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,080
You said you wanted to be played on the podcast periodically. Oh, sure.

227
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,920
So, Brett, there's the file is called Love.

228
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,560
If you could queue that up.

229
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,920
Yes, this is Christmas.

230
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,760
And this is just a little a little snippet.

231
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,840
Yeah, obviously, this is my favorite beach.

232
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,400
But I think it's everybody's favorite beach boy.

233
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,520
It's it's Mike Love.

234
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,240
So that's my that's going to be my next child's middle name.

235
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,600
So Mike Love, all one word.

236
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,880
I'm going to mine.

237
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,240
I'll call them love, but they're named after Jennifer Love Hewitt.

238
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,280
Oh, very good.

239
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,640
Yeah. OK, OK.

240
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,560
My favorite of mine is a young young man.

241
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,240
That's what you've alluded to.

242
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,360
Well, you had the answer this when we were talking about who is

243
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,960
who's Hollywood's leading man and leading lady today off of those posters.

244
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,120
And you had Jennifer Love Hewitt so in the tank ready to go.

245
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,080
Yes, it was Chase Meridian and Jennifer Love Hewitt.

246
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,120
Here we go. This is the clip.

247
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
Oh, boy. Yes. OK, Mike.

248
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,200
I knew it was going to be this Mike Love.

249
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
Very if you don't know the whole history, the cockiest man on the unit

250
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,640
in the universe.

251
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,560
And this is him on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.

252
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,920
I am very much a ladies man.

253
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,040
I admit to that. Yes.

254
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,560
Life in prison as ladies, man, just imprison me with a few ladies.

255
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,840
That's all I ask.

256
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,080
No, it's true. I do like girls.

257
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,800
He does. He committed to the hat thing a long time ago.

258
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, he may have forcibly committed to the hat thing due to his early baldness.

259
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,600
I just was looking at a photo in 2012 when they sang the national anthem

260
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,320
at a Dodgers game, and it was it's the only time I think I've seen him

261
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,480
without a hat. Oh, yeah.

262
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,880
In decades and decades, like only only for America.

263
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,080
Will he allow his bald head to be seen?

264
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,800
Well, yeah, I've only I just recently saw a photo of little

265
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,640
Stephen Van Zandt without his like trademark bandana around his head.

266
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
Shocker. Yeah, shocker.

267
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,800
I don't know. I forget even where I saw it.

268
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,120
It was probably like taken away like the lawyers from the East Street

269
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,640
Band probably got it removed from the Internet promptly.

270
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,320
This is what sleaze merchants allowed took this photo.

271
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,120
This is like upskirt photos back in the day.

272
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,360
Shock. That's not that's like against.

273
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,360
He needs to give you express written consent.

274
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,040
The nude leaked pictures, people's nudes leaked.

275
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,720
Same situation as little Stephen not having his bandana on in a photo.

276
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,360
Yeah, I got an RAR file.

277
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,040
It's a bunch of pics of little Stephen without

278
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,480
you got 65 pics.

279
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,000
I will turn you in, but no, give it to me.

280
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
Give me the hard drive.

281
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,040
Sands Band pics.

282
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,440
How could they do that to the producer of Southside Johnny's?

283
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,800
I don't want to go home.

284
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,120
Of course. Well, right.

285
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,760
Ian Cole writer, co-writer as well.

286
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,960
Yeah. Yeah, you're checking everybody's boxes, including with your

287
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,120
as discussed before we started recording your background of Phillies banners.

288
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,200
You're aiming to please all of us individually. Yeah.

289
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,720
Yes. So thank you for that.

290
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,800
Before we start, we will talk about at least a little bit about

291
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,520
Disney World Resort TV today.

292
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,280
But is there any Ian, you've been a longtime supporter of our show.

293
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,680
And we'd like to thank you for that.

294
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,320
Are there any gripes you have?

295
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,760
Are there any sort of other thoughts you've had recently

296
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,200
that you want to like lay into us about?

297
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,640
We're here. We're ready.

298
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,680
We'll take it. You know.

299
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,840
Wow. I think I I went through a period last year

300
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,720
where my wrestling future was in doubt because, you know,

301
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,600
it was unclear where Ring of Honor would go.

302
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,120
And thankfully, Tony Khan bought us the owner of a W.

303
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,720
So at that time, I released all my gripes. I wrote them down.

304
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,960
Most of them had to do with with your old pal, Grandpa.

305
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,680
But not not Al Lewis.

306
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,960
Most of them had to do with you bringing up the new grandpa monster.

307
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,400
And you see he. Oh, oh.

308
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,680
Yeah, he's he.

309
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,040
I have a long time running rivalry with him, but only in my head

310
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,720
because he's like the local celebrity here in the area.

311
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,640
I'm from Allentown, Pennsylvania.

312
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,760
He's from the Bethlehem area, kind of a sister city.

313
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,400
You talk about Daniel Roebuck, Daniel Roebuck, fake Jay Leno.

314
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,040
And he on the hospital my sister works on.

315
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,840
There's see, I'm so angry.

316
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,880
I can't even formulate thoughts.

317
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,960
I'm usually professional.

318
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,480
I'm sorry. Yeah, I get it.

319
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,920
They put these photos of the covid-19 vaccine.

320
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,880
It was very exciting. Get your vaccine. We have them here.

321
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,440
They had Larry Holmes, heavyweight champion of the world.

322
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,320
Amanda Seyfried, Daniel Roebuck.

323
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,680
And really, oh, yeah. Yep.

324
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,480
So I just say that's the level. Wow.

325
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,720
Yeah. He's that big.

326
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,880
I wait. So then do you but do you have an issue with that?

327
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
Or is it like professional jealousy?

328
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
100 percent professional jealousy.

329
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,440
Yeah, I'm just jealous that, you know, they're not talking about

330
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,040
Ring of Honor enough in the morning, the Allentown morning call

331
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,560
in the Salisbury press that circulates in the township.

332
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,520
You know, that's that's all I'm I'm jealous of.

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,720
You know, do you ever just go to the famous Allentown rest stop?

334
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,560
Very large rest stop there.

335
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,920
And just listen to see if anyone like, oh, did you see Ring of Honor?

336
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,240
Did you watch Honor Club this week?

337
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,200
Or or are they all just like, did you see Daniel Roebuck's Instagram?

338
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,640
Yeah. 100 percent.

339
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,120
Are they at the Bethlehem, the casino that used to be a steel mill?

340
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,920
All right. And where they're all talking about Roebuck.

341
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,360
I I bet, you know, I try and keep myself again, you know,

342
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,680
uncertain times, I tried to keep myself stress free.

343
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,960
I just tried to just try to rein it in that Allentown rest stop.

344
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,640
Really, I'll tell you what, it gets under my skin.

345
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,520
I collect magnets when I went out to Disneyland.

346
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,600
I ended up with 4000 of them.

347
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,520
Every city I go for AEW, a ring of honor, New Japan.

348
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
I get the magnet at the airport.

349
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,760
The Allentown rest stop does not have Allentown magnets,

350
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,080
which is probably the only rest stop I've ever been to

351
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,840
that does not have its major city.

352
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,320
So I personally I personally confronted the Allentown mayor about this

353
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,680
to have some political injunction so that we can get some Allentown pride around here.

354
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,880
Wow. Did he respond?

355
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
He did. He's great.

356
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,240
OK. Oh, he said.

357
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,640
He said there's nothing he could do, but he took the time to respond to me.

358
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,320
So that's not in the May.

359
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,680
I feel like if you what's the thing that like the Defense Act,

360
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,440
like what was supposed to be invoked to get all the vaccines made?

361
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,160
I couldn't even devote it. Couldn't see.

362
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,680
Couldn't he invoke some kind of state that like, all right,

363
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,320
everybody who's not working, get to work and start making defunct

364
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,080
like plants, plants that usually make like war weapons that are now not working

365
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,960
or now retrofitted to make magnets for Allentown.

366
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,760
I think that should be nationwide.

367
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,960
But if there was if there were less weapons and more fun

368
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,560
souvenir magnets from Allentown, yes.

369
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,960
My. Yeah, OK. Yeah, it can be.

370
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,840
Well, yeah. All right. It's all Allentown.

371
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,280
Well, they've had such a drought for so long that demand has been.

372
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,960
They deserve it. Yeah, yeah, you're right.

373
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,760
And it makes sense. All right.

374
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,280
So people in Washington, Oregon and Kentucky and all over

375
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,120
will be making Allentown magnets.

376
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,880
Well, and I'd also all of our listeners around this area.

377
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,040
Could you stop talking about Daniel Robuck and talk about Ian Riccobani, please?

378
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,080
Thank you. That's what the we're calling for today is just I know you're going to.

379
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,440
I know you want to talk about Daniel around the table,

380
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,200
but give it a rest for a few weeks.

381
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,400
Get Ian's name out there.

382
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,920
You know, he's very good at what he does.

383
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,600
So, yeah, I call on everyone there and around the nation.

384
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,560
Change the conversation.

385
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,120
Yeah. Jason, could you talk to your family?

386
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,600
Yeah, I'll put a call in.

387
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,680
OK, because we need a little bit more in and a little less, Daniel.

388
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,040
But it doesn't count if they just like they have to go to a public place.

389
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,760
His Jason's family has to like go out and that's not about it.

390
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,800
That's not it. That's not going to happen. OK.

391
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,760
I'm just saying it doesn't get they can't if they do it in their house.

392
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,960
Nobody's going to hear unless they're shouting out of the house.

393
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,920
Well, they could shout out of the house. Yeah, sure.

394
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,640
OK. They're going to scream our guest Ian's name out the window

395
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,760
of their window to increase his public profile. Yeah.

396
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,600
OK. We'll do.

397
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,320
Well, I like that. We'll do.

398
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,200
So, yeah. OK.

399
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,160
So if grandpa is the number one thing and we've we've addressed it,

400
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,440
let's talk a little bit about Walt Disney World Resort TV.

401
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,400
Ian, you're a massive theme park guy.

402
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,640
So much so that we used a YouTube video a few weeks ago that you posted.

403
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,800
I didn't even realize it until Scott pointed it out

404
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,120
that you had posted the dinosaurs MGM Studios.

405
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,800
I don't know, Parade Float little show, what you would call it.

406
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,280
But kind of a show, kind of a parade that's

407
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,080
that's only documented by like two or three YouTube users.

408
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,520
And as I'm looking at it, like, wait a minute.

409
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,720
And he's supposed to be on the show soon.

410
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,160
Amazing. Thank you for thank you for your work.

411
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,720
I guess your mom's work.

412
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,760
Doc, yeah, Shelley Riccobani.

413
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,480
She she used Jason's Jason style, rise and grind.

414
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,080
When we went to the theme park,

415
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,120
my my dad, my dad worked like 60 to 80 hours a week.

416
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,960
And we I was a spoiled kid.

417
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,520
We had everything we could ever ask for.

418
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,640
Right. But it was because my dad worked so much.

419
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,840
My mom worked 40 hours a week.

420
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,760
Manager McDonald's in Allentown, shout out, I'll tell you again.

421
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,160
But the the big thing was when we went to Disney World,

422
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,560
we were going to get our money's worth.

423
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,440
So my dad had it scheduled, but he let my mom pick the tent pole events.

424
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,240
So before FastPass, before everything else, you looked at the schedule.

425
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,800
You saw when the parades were.

426
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,320
And God darn it, we were going to make all of them.

427
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,640
So that's why that's why there's such great parade footage.

428
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,920
Ace Ventura, MGM Studio footage.

429
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,080
It's all on my YouTube page.

430
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,480
I found I went on your YouTube and I found the playlist of vintage

431
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,000
Disney home movies.

432
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,680
See, and you see you really you're the one of the main sources,

433
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,360
not just on dinosaurs, but yes, that that Ace Ventura show of like

434
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,040
there's a Toy Story parade, the Aladdin parade.

435
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,080
There's a kind of obscure.

436
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,400
Oh, I mean, not obscure, but just that you posted it with a full photo.

437
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,760
The full title, 1992, MGM Studios, Walt Disney Resort, Muppets on location,

438
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,960
Days of Swine and Roses.

439
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,920
Yeah, you get full proper title of this Muppet, the show where the Muppets

440
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,320
were suited characters, not puppets.

441
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,760
It was pretty cool.

442
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,520
And I remember there's one that that we definitely have that

443
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,280
that we haven't been able to find.

444
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,920
It's of the Ninja Turtles.

445
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,680
And it wasn't quite a show, but they were out and about.

446
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,200
And there was music blasting and they would meet people and take pictures.

447
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
And they had the stampers instead of the autographs.

448
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,280
They have the stampers.

449
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,800
Oh, yeah.

450
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,360
So we have one of those laying around somewhere, too.

451
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,440
We just haven't found it yet.

452
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,760
But you could thank Shelley and Rick Ibbani for all that.

453
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,280
Yeah. Wow. Wow.

454
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,400
And I do. Yes. Thank you for all these.

455
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,920
But this was a this is all second gate stuff.

456
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,200
So to fill in main gate listeners to to like more obscure topics

457
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,040
we've covered on the second gate are things that you've just mentioned

458
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,640
that you've posted this live show with the characters from Dinosaurs,

459
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,960
the ABC show, and then a live show.

460
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,760
Strangely, weirdly in Disney of Ace Ventura,

461
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,600
like a little mini stunt show with Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

462
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,560
We were debating these actually on the second gate.

463
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,720
Which one gives you which one was better?

464
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,880
Which one gives you more of what you want out of the IP?

465
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,760
And you might be the only one qualified of the four of us here.

466
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,320
You did watch all of them and posted the videos and had a chance to rewatch.

467
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,440
Can I give you this little versus Ace Ventura show versus Dinosaurs show?

468
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,280
It's without a doubt Dinosaurs.

469
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,160
I mean, they are we go.

470
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,000
What the pictures don't quantify or capture

471
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,680
and the video doesn't quite capture is just how larger than life

472
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,440
and how cool it was to see Earl to see the baby.

473
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,680
There was something that whole trip for me, I was five years old, was a was a blast.

474
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,720
I remember that's some that's pretty much my earliest memories of anything

475
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,360
where I remember it crystal clear.

476
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,720
There's something something clicked in my brain and was like, yep, this I'm going to remember this.

477
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,640
And I remember that was one of the last things we did before we left the park,

478
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,960
before we checked out of the hotel.

479
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,320
And it was just absolutely incredible.

480
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,800
The float was actually pretty big because they reuse the same float over time.

481
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,960
They reused it for some other parade.

482
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,160
So if you would ever see it in MGM, it was actually quite big, even as an adult.

483
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,800
I ended up seeing it.

484
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,600
But I just remember the costumes.

485
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,720
I remember thinking, yeah, these are the dinosaurs.

486
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,160
And I didn't have that same feeling with Mickey or with Goofy or Pluto.

487
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,600
I kind of knew I kind of knew the kayfabe of Mickey, Goofy, Pluto.

488
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,480
But I was like, no, those those are the dinosaurs.

489
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,200
Those are absolutely who I see on TV every week.

490
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,200
Wow. Good point.

491
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,640
Yeah, this this this is you're putting Mike in a losing position here.

492
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,400
You were arguing the point of Ace Ventura, which I was saying is one of my least

493
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,000
favorite things we've ever I found it so monotonous.

494
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,680
Covered some drek.

495
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,960
We certainly have. Yeah.

496
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,440
Well, but I love some of the dress.

497
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,760
Some of the shirt, a lot of the drek I celebrate.

498
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,640
Was the Ace Ventura live show not good?

499
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,120
Am I am I under rating it?

500
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,400
It was OK. I remember my brother liking it a lot.

501
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,600
He's eight years older.

502
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,680
I would have been out of an eight, seven or eight at the time, I think.

503
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,400
My brother was probably 15, 16.

504
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,560
So it was more his speed.

505
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,520
You can hear my dad chuckle.

506
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,080
You can hear my dad really.

507
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,760
I think it's for the dads, honestly.

508
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,800
Yeah, my dad. This makes a lot of sense.

509
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,960
More mature viewers like the Ace Ventura thing.

510
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,600
People that were a little more sophisticated, like Aces show at MGM Studios

511
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,520
versus the dinosaurs, which is more juvenile, I think.

512
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,920
This is a hell of a way to put down five year old Ian.

513
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,120
Well, look, I just I'm trying to save a bit of face here with my opinion,

514
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,200
which is still correct, sadly.

515
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,600
That's what I'm determining now.

516
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,800
It's not me for us.

517
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,720
Sadly, yeah, for everyone else.

518
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,800
I'm right. Always. Yeah.

519
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,160
One against three.

520
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,880
One one completely defeats three.

521
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,600
One does defeat three.

522
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,040
It's the ultimate handicap match.

523
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,840
Yes.

524
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,240
Sorry, that cut you off.

525
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,960
Were you saying something, Ian?

526
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,440
No, no, I was only going to add that

527
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,880
there that same trip that I saw Ace Ventura actually was in the

528
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,240
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids play area.

529
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,960
There's I have a video of that from the previous trip, the dinosaur trip.

530
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,240
But in the one where we saw Ace Ventura actually knocked down Sting's child,

531
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,200
the wrestler Sting in the play area.

532
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,760
He started I started crying.

533
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,680
He was fine. He got up, ran away.

534
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,920
Sting came over and I didn't.

535
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,640
This is this shows you what a what kind of a kid I was.

536
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,360
I didn't understand that he that it was Sting because he didn't have his makeup on.

537
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,440
He had his flat top, but he didn't have the makeup on.

538
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,360
He didn't. And my mom goes, Ian, are you OK?

539
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,120
Check if the little boy's OK.

540
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,560
Oh, Ian, that's Sting.

541
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
And I was like, no, it's not.

542
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,680
And she goes, yeah, come over.

543
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,800
So she walked me over and I get a good look at him.

544
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,640
And I notice it is Sting.

545
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,560
It is I start to get it.

546
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
And I just start crying even more.

547
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,000
I don't want to bother him.

548
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,520
And now I now I work with him.

549
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,440
Wow. Wow.

550
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,560
This is terrible.

551
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,840
And he would tell him that story.

552
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,360
No, God, no. And I actually

553
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,320
I actually briefly briefly spent some time with him on Thanksgiving Eve.

554
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,600
We went back to the hotel together.

555
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
I don't know Sting very well.

556
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,080
He's a super cool dude.

557
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,760
Super nice. His family's great.

558
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,240
As I've come to learn later

559
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,480
when I'm not physically assaulting them in a theme park.

560
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
But yeah, he's he's he's a cool dude.

561
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,040
I've not yet told him that.

562
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,640
Which does mean you've met the kid.

563
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,560
I've met his wife as strange as that sounds.

564
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,160
She's a super talented person

565
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,480
that I've worked with in different aspects.

566
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,920
But I've not yet met Garrett.

567
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,760
No, that would be what.

568
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,240
But, you know, you do know his name.

569
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,480
That's a crazy way to like, yeah, awareness

570
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,240
to have of just a kid you bumped into in 1992.

571
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,040
Nice to see you.

572
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,760
I bodied you in 1992.

573
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,000
I don't know if you recall

574
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,640
is by the big Kodak film canister.

575
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,840
Yeah, it was by the end.

576
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,360
I remember I was goofing around by the end and I jumped off and yeah.

577
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,040
So you jumped off the top rope.

578
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,080
Yeah, which I've done in a ring.

579
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,480
I've done in a ring of honor ring.

580
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,120
My only match.

581
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,160
Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

582
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,000
So you were down there to see pro wrestling, right?

583
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,440
Or was or did you?

584
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,240
No, it's crazy because just just random luck.

585
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,640
They were filming Thunder in Paradise.

586
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,200
They were filming WCW.

587
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,120
They were right. All kinds of stuff.

588
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,960
Every reason for staying to be there.

589
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,880
My dad called the Grand Floridian because he heard

590
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,400
that's where everyone was staying.

591
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,640
And he said, hey, is Hulk Hogan staying there?

592
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,800
And they actually told him he was.

593
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,760
They actually told him.

594
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,560
They blew. They just blew his spot.

595
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,760
They said, yeah, he's here.

596
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,280
All the wrestlers are here.

597
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,520
And he won his room number.

598
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,320
I don't know. My dad's a sweetheart.

599
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,520
Hates wrestling.

600
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,360
But he wants chase down Lex Luger in a limo for me.

601
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,880
And he wants called the Grand Floridian to see if Hulk Hogan was.

602
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,720
Wow. How do we how do I know it doesn't feel like one of these things

603
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,440
that didn't change until after 9 11 that I know these feel like completely

604
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,760
unrelated avenues, but it doesn't.

605
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,960
Don't you feel like that is true?

606
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,280
That somehow one of the residual effects of September 11th was now

607
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,680
a hotel will not tell you of that famous wrestler is staying there.

608
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,120
If you a stranger calls.

609
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,680
Yeah, I think you can still check in under and assumed like, hey, could you put

610
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,600
here's my credit card and ID and everything, but could you list the

611
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,800
the occupancy as like Alan Smith or whatever?

612
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,360
I don't know. I think that I think that was outlawed nationwide post 9 11.

613
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,280
I think that Sudan are gone across the board.

614
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,080
No, that's not true.

615
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,240
But to be one hell of a way to combat terrorism.

616
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,440
You know how you know how they got the jump on everybody.

617
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,600
Fake names.

618
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,800
Do you think true? Yeah.

619
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,560
If Hulk Hogan checks in now, he goes under his thunder and paradise character name.

620
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,680
Hold on. It's loading a Randolph J.

621
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,120
Hurricane is that is not. Yes. Yeah.

622
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,720
I know Mr.

623
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,240
Hogan is not staying here, but there is a certain Randolph J.

624
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,880
Hurricane, if you'd like to meet him.

625
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,480
Also, Chris Lemon is staying here.

626
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,000
No, no interest. That's fine.

627
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,960
You know, I'm all right.

628
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,920
What have you never heard of him?

629
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
No, no, no. I've seen him many times on the show.

630
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,200
I do not want to meet Chris Lemon.

631
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,640
Real quick, you know what?

632
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,800
We were talking about this, too.

633
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,200
You are working at Universal Studios now currently.

634
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,600
Yeah, I'm a theme park attraction kind of sort of weird.

635
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,480
But it's tons of fun.

636
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,560
I have access to maybe one of the cooler things ever.

637
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,680
And it's one of those things where sometimes you don't want to see how the sausage is made.

638
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,040
But going backstage on the sound stages and the backlots

639
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,600
to see the performers on stilts, to see the Mardi Gras folks,

640
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,760
to see the different parades and things is really incredible.

641
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,720
It's a really top notch organization.

642
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,920
Yeah. So so, yeah, you're doing you're doing Ring of Honor.

643
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,920
Once a month, a couple of times a month.

644
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah, just about once a month these days. Yeah.

645
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,320
And you're shooting it inside one of the Orlando sound stages that like

646
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,360
can you can you tell us, is it secret?

647
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,000
Is it but up to like City Walk?

648
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,760
How close is it to the hard rock?

649
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,160
How close is it to the hemisphere dancer?

650
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,320
If if I'm if I'm

651
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,000
if I have my geography right, when I look out, it looks like where the

652
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,640
islands of adventure, Jason's favorite area.

653
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,160
I'm with the obelisk in the middle.

654
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,120
Oh, right. There was just an episode on it.

655
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,000
You can you can see that port of entry.

656
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,320
Yes. Yes. Port of entry.

657
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,840
Got it. Jason took the obelisk off the table, refused to acknowledge it

658
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,960
within the well. We didn't talk about obelisks at all

659
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,040
because there's no obelisks at play. It's a lighthouse.

660
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,800
Oh, man, Ian.

661
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,400
No, Ian, that's fine.

662
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,800
You're not you're a guest. You're a guest here.

663
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,280
I think in a vague shape sense, you could call it an obelisk in the Vegas.

664
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,920
It's the weenie. It's the park.

665
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,640
It's the weenie. Yeah. Yeah.

666
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,360
And we can all agree on that, that it is a weenie.

667
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,880
So in relation to this weenie,

668
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,840
you're saying you're how where can you see is there a window

669
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
where you see it out the soundstage?

670
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,520
So we can see we can see the Seuss land to our right.

671
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,480
What the craziest part was was the announcers get a trailer there.

672
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,240
So I had this nice trailer with like Pac-Man and like a full oven

673
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,200
and stove and TV and it was pretty neat.

674
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,520
They it was it was pretty cool.

675
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,000
So I walk out of this trailer.

676
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,240
I would take a look and I'd see the the Dr. Seuss rides on my right

677
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,960
and then sort of directly in front would be the lighthouse.

678
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,480
So it puts us kind of in the if you're walking into the park,

679
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,360
it would almost be like straight on kind of islands of adventure

680
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,840
if my geography is right now.

681
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,640
I've only been to islands in ninety nine.

682
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,920
Like we went we went there in ninety nine or two thousand

683
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,440
shortly after it opened.

684
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,280
And then twenty twenty during the pandemic, I took my

685
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,840
I'm a very responsible father.

686
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,280
I took my both my children and my wife during

687
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,680
a international pandemic to a theme park.

688
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,720
But those are the you know, those are the only two times

689
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,960
I've been inside islands of adventure.

690
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,440
Jason's about to press end on this zoom window.

691
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,840
Jason is seething.

692
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,080
You get those numbers up or you're gone.

693
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,600
Yeah, I see the rage.

694
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,760
You know, you take an extra day, you know, you ask Mr.

695
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,520
Khan like, hey, can I fly back two days after we finish?

696
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,320
You know, I'll get the ticket myself.

697
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,400
You have Tony Khan, Tony or Tony and Shot Khan.

698
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,600
Gotcha. Yeah.

699
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,120
The ultimate guy, the ultimate guy, in my opinion.

700
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,760
Oh, really?

701
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,640
And yeah, so so that's pretty cool.

702
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,280
I mean, is there I don't want to we'll edit this out.

703
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,200
Are you can you could you just walk right into the park?

704
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,320
Is that possible? An arrangement?

705
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,040
I think there's an arrangement you can add.

706
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,320
There was a spot in the in the group email

707
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,320
and the prep email that said for for ticket information.

708
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,800
OK, please contact someone.

709
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,280
So I do think there is a element of either complementary

710
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,120
or severely discounted tickets at play.

711
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,840
Yeah. OK, so you don't we wouldn't have to.

712
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,800
You wouldn't have to like find a hole in a fence and sneak under it.

713
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,880
You could just we were explicitly warned not to do that, that we would.

714
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,360
There would be professional fines and suspensions for real.

715
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,360
And not just the television.

716
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,280
If we snuck in.

717
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,440
So they have cracked down on that at Universal Studios Hollywood, too,

718
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,120
because you could just walk into the theme park from the back lot

719
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,680
like many years ago.

720
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,960
And now there's giant like fake hedges

721
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,920
because it's it's the Jurassic World and the exit from Nintendo.

722
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,480
So it's all blocked off now.

723
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,240
You can't just kind of I think you can get back there if you work there.

724
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,640
But like it's not like just like a big open gate.

725
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,800
You can just sort of wander into. Right.

726
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,040
You need a jet pack or something. Yeah. Yeah.

727
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,680
Rocket shoes. All right.

728
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,760
Well, it sounds like you have the opportunity and the option, which is nice.

729
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,160
Right. Have you dined at City Walk recently?

730
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,840
Or is it sort of in and out to do the job?

731
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,280
So it's funny you mention that because City Walk,

732
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,120
my brothers lived in Orlando since 2003.

733
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,880
So while I've not been to Islands of Adventure, but more than twice,

734
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,720
I've been to City Walk probably two or three dozen times.

735
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,880
I love numbers.

736
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Yeah, we like that.

737
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,080
These are Pizer Puckets for numbers.

738
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,800
Yeah. My wife and I are big, our big Disney heads.

739
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,000
You know, we take the we take the kids down, but even it's like having

740
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,720
your favorite candy, you can have your favorite candy too many times.

741
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,400
Sometimes you just need to mix it up.

742
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,760
You need to get some carob cake like like Brian Wilson sang on on HLP.

743
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,960
On his about the radiant radish.

744
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,280
Yeah. I end up with a ripply chin.

745
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,680
What a condition is that?

746
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,640
Yeah. So we'd mix it up.

747
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,680
If there was a free night, we'd obviously go to Margaritaville.

748
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,760
I've been to Margaritaville many times.

749
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,920
And we used to go to the NBA restaurant.

750
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,240
We went to the NBA store and then the hard rock is right next to it.

751
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,880
So we've we are City Walk veterans.

752
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,800
And I used to go see Impact Wrestling there.

753
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,560
So my my summer's home from college.

754
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,680
I'm from Pennsylvania, but my brother is down in Orlando.

755
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,000
I'd go visit my brother and I would drive, drive over and

756
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,760
and see Christopher Daniels, Samoa Joe, the folks I work with now.

757
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,920
So it's it's a very small world.

758
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,760
It's weird how all of it interconnects.

759
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,360
Wow. Where was the impact tapings?

760
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,240
It was in pretty much the same sound stages.

761
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,720
Oh, wow. OK, so that is the place.

762
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,320
Like, that's the wrestling place for decades now.

763
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,360
I guess. Yeah.

764
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,280
There was a weird small one called the AWF in 93.

765
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,480
Before that, there was one by Eddie Mansfield

766
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,040
that Kevin Kelly got his start in.

767
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,640
Billy Gunn got his start in that one, too, at a universal.

768
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,560
That's forever ago, then.

769
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,960
Yeah. Sorry, I just that was insulting to Kevin.

770
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,600
No, we'll edit that out.

771
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,280
I don't want them mad at me.

772
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,440
Wow, man, that's cool.

773
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,920
So, yeah, we're really we're we're the city walk thing.

774
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,280
It's like Islands of Ventures, sure.

775
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,000
But city walk. Yeah, that's yeah, that's our vibe, as you know.

776
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,600
So absolutely.

777
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,960
Which I'm glad we're we're in agreement on that one.

778
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,080
But not and just really quick, though, to back up to something you said,

779
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,800
you said in front of Mike and Jason, sometimes you can get sick

780
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,720
of your favorite candy and need to mix it up and have something else.

781
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,640
Well, he was talking.

782
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,800
This is this is a strange observation.

783
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,880
He was saying like metaphorically, because he was literally talking about candy.

784
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,640
I would have been furious. OK, OK. Yeah. Yeah.

785
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,200
You just put other candies in the bulk candy bag to mix it up.

786
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,880
Oh, you don't need to know.

787
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,880
As long as you're replacing it with other candy.

788
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,040
All right. All right. Yeah.

789
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
I figured that could have been a controversial statement.

790
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,160
Right. Yeah, no, it is.

791
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,360
But I think he was sort of using it in a very like ethereal.

792
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,240
I mean, not a specific candy based argument.

793
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,640
Yeah, yeah. So I'm less upset about it.

794
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,920
But now you're talking about it, maybe I will be upset.

795
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,600
Came on and I'm really ruffling feathers.

796
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,920
I'm so kindly.

797
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,440
You're so kindly told Allentown in Bethlehem to shout my name from the

798
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,200
from the rooftops out the window.

799
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,440
Well, I'm picking fights.

800
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,840
So, you know, it's OK.

801
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,120
We're trying to mix it up here.

802
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,400
We're going to keep it keep it lively.

803
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,680
It's like Club Random.

804
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,000
It's look, we say a lot of you're saying a lot of a hot topic

805
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,480
opinion here, OK? And that's what's happening.

806
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,360
We're basically doing a club random here as far as the opinions are concerned.

807
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,160
You know, you're you're a guy used to like helping set up feuds

808
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,440
and angles and stuff, and it feels like you're trying to build them on this show.

809
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,840
Now, too, it's just second nature to you.

810
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,800
That's true. Absolutely.

811
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,520
Yeah. And that's the play, too.

812
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,800
And you got to get so ingrained with it.

813
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,680
Like I made Chris Jericho so mad that I feuded with him on AEW for about 12 weeks.

814
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,160
So it helps publicity wise.

815
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,800
Did I take a beating? Did I get slapped in the face? Yes.

816
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,600
Do I did that?

817
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,840
Was that horrible and was it embarrassing to my family and my friends? Yes.

818
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,280
But I was on I was on television and got to feed one of the greatest of all time.

819
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,280
Sure. Sure.

820
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,240
But that was 12 weeks where he could have been lurking around

821
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,800
any corner with a belt at any time.

822
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,640
And I assumed he was. I really did. Sure.

823
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,280
Sure. And well, by the end of this podcast, I don't know.

824
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,240
I may slap Jason in the face. Oh, OK.

825
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,600
I said may. I didn't say it was going to happen.

826
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,440
Not guaranteed. But it's possible. Sure.

827
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,280
We've never gotten physical as far as being upset with each other on the podcast yet.

828
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,440
Yet. So I don't think we've ever gotten physical in real life,

829
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,080
because I feel like that's one I would lose.

830
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,280
Maybe. I don't know. OK.

831
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,520
Well, I've never seen you in a fight of like a real fight.

832
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,480
So neither have I.

833
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,960
Well, that's true.

834
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,960
I mean, I used to backyard wrestle and then we used to like fight with each other.

835
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,640
But it was never like fists.

836
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,440
We were not like punching each other.

837
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,600
So and watch out if there's any tennis rackets anywhere nearby,

838
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,880
because this is Mike is the master of.

839
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,720
I've been playing a little tennis in my golden years.

840
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,640
So I am in. Yeah, I'm in good condition.

841
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,560
Yeah. Other than that.

842
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,880
But you'll switch to pickleball soon enough.

843
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,960
Well, I'm dying to do pickleball.

844
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,120
That's the hottest game. Have you heard? It is hot.

845
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,240
Yeah. People are playing this.

846
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,040
It's like tennis, but it's easier, I think.

847
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,760
I think it's easier on the joints. Yeah.

848
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,880
Parents can't stop talking about it.

849
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,520
My parents can't stop talking about it.

850
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,800
There you go. All right.

851
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,120
We got it. We got to talk a little.

852
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,520
Disney World Resort TV.

853
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,520
This is a topic you brought up, Ian, which is a great topic.

854
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,440
Something we've talked a little bit about on the show, but haven't like

855
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,640
we haven't gotten into it as much as we probably should have at this point.

856
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,680
So, yeah, if you want to talk about like your affection for this,

857
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,640
just to start us off.

858
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,280
Sure, I'd love to.

859
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,440
And I want to give a shout out quick,

860
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,800
you know, for fun and lightheartedness.

861
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,640
Obviously, podcaster I had to place to be for a little bit,

862
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,960
a tiny bit of history, more academic.

863
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,320
I go to retro WDW.

864
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,800
Hal Bowers is a guy there who's inside and out, knows everything about Disney World.

865
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,720
So I got with Hal and said, hey, when did this start?

866
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,440
And he said about 1973 was the first time that they had ever kind of

867
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,080
written anything down about the resort TV.

868
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,520
So it was pretty much there from the start.

869
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,120
Channel five was the resort channel and channel one was a radio station

870
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,440
through the TV.

871
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,280
So somewhere along the way, channel one became the bulletin board,

872
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,640
maybe the radio station, the combination of both.

873
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,400
And then channel five became the resort TV we know and love.

874
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,360
And I really take to it like when you go to a baseball game

875
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,040
and you see you go to Citizens Bank Park and you walk in

876
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,800
and then you walk, you're walking toward your seat

877
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,960
and it's the first time you see a glimpse of anything.

878
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,840
It's the first time you see what you came to see.

879
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,120
And it's that magic feeling and magic moment.

880
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,160
So I think it was Jason who said, when you get in the room,

881
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,240
you turn on the TV. And that's what I did.

882
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,840
And some of my earliest memories of going to Disney World

883
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,560
are the flying Dumbo are going on Big Thunder Mountain with my dad

884
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,600
for the first time or the dinosaurs parade.

885
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,480
And then actually the resort TV.

886
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,520
And it's something where it has that pleasant

887
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,640
Ville effect, which you don't really realize until later,

888
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,360
where not so much not so much now because now there's full cable in the room.

889
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,560
But but back the first time we stayed in the Disney World Resort in 1992,

890
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,880
we stayed in the Disney Inn RIP.

891
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,440
I think they just call it something else now. But

892
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,320
they the shades of green, I think.

893
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,040
But the Disney Inn at the time, you got like two channels.

894
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,160
You got like the radio station, which was the bulletin board.

895
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,160
You got the Disney Resort TV and then maybe ABC

896
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,520
or maybe PBS or maybe Fox.

897
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,440
Like you really didn't get much.

898
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,920
I didn't say this. Yeah. This is new context to me.

899
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,520
Yeah. So when when you were there, Mike, it just it just really you felt

900
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,360
you felt kind of stuck, but also willingly

901
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,800
willing to be ingratiated, willing to be a part of the scene there.

902
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,880
Yeah, it is funny.

903
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,600
And I'll play I have just a clip like if people don't know what we're talking

904
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,040
about, just like the vibe of it.

905
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,280
But it is very much watching it now.

906
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,840
I go, oh, this is like like the kids are like stuck in a reprogramming camp

907
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,720
or something where they're becoming super soldiers.

908
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,600
And it's like you're watching a video of like, hello, welcome.

909
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,240
We will be training you to turn into killing machines.

910
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,040
And you're like, this is awesome.

911
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
Like just the pleasantness.

912
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:53,480
Any sort of context or any sort of like any sort of message would be

913
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,640
you would be responding well to it.

914
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,960
The way they present the information and the visuals, which, Brett,

915
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,200
if you could, I have a resort TV intro movie

916
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,720
just like this. It's so it's just a wash.

917
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,520
Yeah. Washes over you of like, oh, my God.

918
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,720
And it's very dry, especially in the early years.

919
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,560
Yes. In the 90s, they start to make it a little more dynamic.

920
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,480
To which I say, all right, easy now.

921
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

922
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,720
So, no, show us the rides and what there is.

923
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,400
This is 94s in room resort TV.

924
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,520
So, yeah, whenever you.

925
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,320
Welcome to the Walt Disney World Resort.

926
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,560
43 square miles of nonstop excitement for everyone.

927
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,360
There's almost no end to the things you have to look forward to.

928
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,280
And you've chosen a wonderful time to visit.

929
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,520
You'll find fabulous fun, spectacular entertainment

930
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,680
and brand new attractions all over the Walt Disney World Resort.

931
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,520
Here's a quick look around the world to help you see the most,

932
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,960
get the best value and have a vacation dream come true.

933
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,960
I mean, and then the Disney MGM Studios,

934
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,280
the most popular movie and TV studios in the world.

935
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,440
See a star and be a star as you thrill to great attractions

936
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,040
and see real production in the works.

937
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,480
Reach the height of.

938
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,600
And yeah, like it just like, yes.

939
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,360
And remember, you will kill without remorse.

940
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,200
Don't worry, that part of your brain will be excised.

941
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,960
And you're like, yes, good, right.

942
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,080
It's so pleasant. It's so it's so amazing.

943
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,280
I feel so much more relaxed. Yeah.

944
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,200
For watching it.

945
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,080
And just just to be really clear, if you're staying anywhere

946
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,720
on property, any actual Disney World Hotel.

947
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,480
And at this point, you know, it's not like Ian was saying now.

948
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,720
Now you have cable, you have a lot of channels, a lot of which are Disney

949
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,440
related channels that are exclusive to there.

950
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,200
But the main thing is there's always been at least one channel

951
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,200
devoted to this half hour loop that is telling you all the things

952
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,160
to do around the world and, you know, shining light on some of the less

953
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,040
famous thing. You know, you came here for the parks,

954
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,440
but maybe you don't know about the recreation or the nightlife.

955
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,320
And these. Yeah, I absolutely.

956
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,960
A key part of vacate these vacations for me like you could because it

957
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,120
it means that the magic doesn't end when you go back to your room.

958
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,320
You can go back and watch footage of all the rides that you went on

959
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,560
and footage of all the rides you're going to go on tomorrow.

960
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,320
It's just a perfect way to like keep you locked in.

961
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,280
Like I never have to break this mode.

962
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,920
I can just stay here. Right. Tire vacation long.

963
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,880
And it was sometimes like practical.

964
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,120
Like that's how we would find out about if we somehow miss

965
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,800
announcements of new things in Disney magazine,

966
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,040
Disney Adventures, the Wonderful World of Disney, the Disney Channel.

967
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,480
If we somehow still miss a video that came to you in the mail,

968
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,440
a vacation planning video every year, inevitably,

969
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,840
because we sent away for it every year.

970
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,720
The Burn Bombs guide.

971
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,800
We all we all had seven opportunities to learn everything

972
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,280
that there was to do with the resort.

973
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,920
But if you missed any of those, then this is your list.

974
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,480
You can you can catch it here.

975
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,600
Yeah. But also if you just like, yeah, like you were saying,

976
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,600
footage of the rides, nicely edited footage that it's not

977
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,760
it's not like now where like YouTube, you can construct

978
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,480
a Zapruder film of a ride.

979
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,520
You can see any ride night or day, any angle you want. Yeah. Yeah.

980
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,440
Yeah. One of the points that they really emphasized in the early ones,

981
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,400
the earliest one on YouTube, I think, is from 81.

982
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,800
It's with Susan. We all have Susan.

983
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,000
Susan's the best.

984
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,720
But there there's a couple that are floating around on the

985
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,040
on the black tape trading market from seventy five, seventy six.

986
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,280
Not on YouTube, but Susan really emphasizes

987
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,760
it's a two day park. Now, to Jason's point,

988
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,160
there were times in my life when I was a kid where we went just about every year.

989
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,640
My grandparents lived in Florida.

990
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,960
My mom loved Disney. My dad put up with it.

991
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,440
We had a good time.

992
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,680
But we didn't always get on the rides we wanted to get on

993
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,480
because there often were lines that were 60 minutes,

994
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,600
90 minutes for the simplest things like Dumbo, like the carousel,

995
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,320
like anything that I could do when I was smaller.

996
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,360
And, you know, sometimes Splash Mountain forget about it.

997
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,720
It was two hours and we just had something else to do.

998
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,240
We were going to go to the Hoop-D-Do review.

999
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,600
We were going to go somewhere else. So we just couldn't do it.

1000
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,120
So it was really neat, too, to see the new attractions that maybe

1001
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,240
you didn't get on this time.

1002
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,800
If you were spoiled like I was, if you if you had family like I did down in Florida,

1003
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
you might get to see next time or you might be able to

1004
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,200
to scream and scream and cry enough to get your parents

1005
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,920
to try and wait around in line for for two hours to hit Splash Mountain

1006
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,600
within the first two years at open.

1007
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,120
Yeah, that makes it like I'm sure.

1008
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,440
There was plenty of stuff that we didn't get to do

1009
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,040
because we weren't even we weren't as on top of it, I feel like,

1010
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,160
because even you guys when we were young, our family, I mean.

1011
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
But like, yeah, we that video, if yeah, if you're just listening to this,

1012
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,880
this video showed like a home improvement thing

1013
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,080
that I didn't know existed that we went right in that zone.

1014
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,160
Is that the thing where you're like your mom and dad or the kids are in the shows?

1015
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,720
Like because you saw the Lucy.

1016
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,760
We have to ask Ian because I honestly don't know.

1017
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,080
I think that was one superstar television.

1018
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,960
Was that our television?

1019
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,440
OK, that was superstar television.

1020
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,080
Yeah, you can be on tools.

1021
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,680
You can do the conveyor belt of chocolates with Lucy. Right.

1022
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,240
You could be the Debbie Dunning character.

1023
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,600
Wow. On on tool time.

1024
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,040
You wouldn't want to that one replay.

1025
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,600
You want that? You want the real deal.

1026
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,920
You want you want to be talking to Debbie? Well, sure.

1027
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,040
I mean, we've debbies come up recently because there's a video

1028
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,280
that's gone viral on my Instagram.

1029
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:45,480
I'm the tool time girl from home improvement sitting on William Shatner's lap.

1030
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,040
Viral for you is namely Debbie Dunning and well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1031
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,000
All right. Right.

1032
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,600
Debbie's I'm happy to see Debbie.

1033
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,600
But again, anything with the William Shatner in it is what I'm and you'll see.

1034
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,720
So you'll see a babe in your feed if Daniel Roebuck is talking to one.

1035
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,840
If Roy Roebuck.

1036
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,440
Now we got beef.

1037
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,400
Yeah, I'm the one.

1038
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,440
I'm the one saying Roebuck again. Yeah.

1039
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,800
I'm just saying facts. Look, he's a part of our culture.

1040
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,520
You can't not talk about him. That's right. That's true.

1041
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,520
That's fair. That's fair.

1042
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,680
What are the the most interesting things about about fake Al Borland, right?

1043
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,160
Was a lot of those things, sometimes they're blinking. You miss them.

1044
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,880
I mean, there there are different videos that I've watched of this resort TV

1045
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,880
where there were things in the park that only lasted a month

1046
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,720
and then were quickly retooled or replaced. Right.

1047
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,680
You know, the superstar television that moved by so quickly.

1048
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,080
Who wants to be a millionaire?

1049
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,760
My high school English teacher, his brother was the Regis Philbin

1050
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,360
at the theme park for. Oh, wow. Wow.

1051
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,440
But his his big exciting moment was that he was in, I believe,

1052
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,960
the 2002 version of The Loop, and he was prominently highlighted.

1053
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,480
Last name, Marsico.

1054
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,520
My my English teacher was Richard Marsico.

1055
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,200
I forget his brother's name, but he was Mr. Disney Marathon.

1056
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,360
He was Mr. Who wants to be a millionaire?

1057
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,880
So it was very exciting. He was a big resort TV star.

1058
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,600
So yeah, do you have any footage of that anywhere?

1059
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,240
Like just take you. Oh, wow.

1060
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,960
Yeah, I can I can send that over.

1061
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,640
But it was it was an exciting time, especially in, you know, 2003.

1062
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,440
The next time I went, because now I knew now I knew one of the stars.

1063
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,440
And we waited and then we saw him and he was on it for like two seconds.

1064
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,720
It was like the first time I was on MTV.

1065
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,520
I was on for Blink and You'll Miss It.

1066
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,840
Got real excited.

1067
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,720
And then it just moved on.

1068
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,160
But we got to see him.

1069
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,760
Wait, that way you were on MTV.

1070
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,920
I was I was in a special with Bill Gates.

1071
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,080
I guess what?

1072
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1073
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,960
It was called the notorious BG hosted by Gideon Yago.

1074
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,320
Wow.

1075
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,240
And I thought TV was going to be easy.

1076
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,160
I thought, wow, it's my first week at NYU.

1077
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,040
I'm answering this casting call.

1078
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,520
I got cast.

1079
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,000
Wow. I'm going to get on all of these.

1080
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,760
And I didn't appear on television for another five or six years.

1081
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,080
So, you know, wow, defeated by the pressure.

1082
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,000
Luckily, there's like no footprint of this.

1083
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,920
Maybe there's a Getty Images photo, which you are not in.

1084
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,360
I'm sorry to tell you, you did not make the images photo.

1085
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,600
It's just Bill and now I was wearing a bright orange shirt.

1086
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,680
I can send I screen grabbed it at the time.

1087
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,960
I think it's the only surviving

1088
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,800
memento of the occasion.

1089
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,960
This fine broadcast.

1090
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,920
That's surprising to me.

1091
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,480
The MTV generation loves Bill Gates.

1092
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,760
He's so cool.

1093
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,240
Wow. So, yeah.

1094
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,560
So so there's got well, first of all, there's got to be in the warehouse somewhere.

1095
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,120
There's like a beta max of that or something, an old tape somewhere.

1096
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,720
But it's the least organized, but it's badly organized.

1097
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,000
And Jason was probably in charge.

1098
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,600
I probably dropped it.

1099
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,120
Really? Yeah.

1100
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,920
Yeah. So flying everywhere.

1101
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,640
Can I bring up one of these things you talk about?

1102
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,400
Things that you might not remember, if not for these resort TV compilations.

1103
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,640
And one was there was a really brief snippet of if in that intro clip

1104
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,920
that you played, Mike, but Brett, I'm going to call for

1105
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,720
the clip called Mickey Mania.

1106
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,880
And this is a whole this is a whole other thing to talk about.

1107
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,200
I don't know if you people generally remember the Mickey Mania parade,

1108
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,880
but I think I forgot about this documentary.

1109
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,960
Is it familiar that you were there? OK, OK.

1110
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,080
Inside. Yeah.

1111
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,640
Do you guys remember what I'm talking about?

1112
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,280
What I'm talking about? Mickey Mania.

1113
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,200
I don't think so.

1114
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,520
I feel like I've heard the phrase before.

1115
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,600
Well, yeah, you have Mickey Mania.

1116
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,160
But I think I know because you have.

1117
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,880
I think I have seen this.

1118
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,640
Let's let's let's watch this.

1119
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,600
Like this really made me shudder seeing a clip here.

1120
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,280
One of the newest delights is the Mickey Mania parade.

1121
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,280
Yeah.

1122
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,400
Salute to the world's most famous mouse.

1123
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,560
That's very big indeed.

1124
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,560
The for the listener and Brett, I had a still, but you could also just go back.

1125
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,760
Can you just find the moment where there's like a big in flat?

1126
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,760
Yeah. OK.

1127
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:12,000
This I think the premise of Mickey Mania is that how do we pack a parade

1128
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,200
with as many depictions of Mickey as possible?

1129
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,800
Some of them literal and some of them abstract.

1130
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:23,080
And this frame, I really jumped out of my skin where there is a Mickey

1131
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,600
with the head that we know, the mascot head that we know, but then a big,

1132
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,360
tall inflatable body.

1133
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,360
So I'm getting some of those like size issues that I have.

1134
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,160
Right. This is too big of a Mickey.

1135
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:38,680
And then lots of like it's almost minions before minions, like little inflatable.

1136
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,880
Like they're four feet.

1137
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,280
I don't even know what they are.

1138
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,120
Are there people in them or their children?

1139
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,560
It's like, what do you call it?

1140
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,160
They're like eggs.

1141
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,960
They're like Mickey dolls.

1142
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1143
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,680
The whole thing is like a Russian nesting doll of Mickey cracked open.

1144
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,720
And then 400 Mickeys came out.

1145
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,200
This is a terrifying parade.

1146
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,280
Mickey Mania should be called like a nightmare abstract abstract nightmare

1147
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
Mickey. Yeah.

1148
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,240
It's like you're just seeing him in a different weird.

1149
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,240
You're having a Mickey mayor.

1150
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,760
I remember my mom.

1151
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,280
She was like Arsenio Hall.

1152
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,880
She it was like she was like, oh, I'm going to be a Mickey.

1153
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,360
She it was like she was with the dog pound.

1154
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,960
She was in like, oh, she's I swear.

1155
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,680
And my brother can confirm this Mickey Mania.

1156
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,880
It was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, dog pound.

1157
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,120
Wow. Whoopin it up.

1158
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,160
Loved it. Like this reaction.

1159
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,680
So you had like you had to be there, but it was a crowd pleaser, it sounds like.

1160
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,640
Oh, loved it. Absolutely.

1161
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,120
Wow. That's interesting.

1162
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,000
I mean, I guess, look, if you're there live, you know, you're going to see a lot of

1163
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,520
everyone likes Mickey.

1164
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,400
So I guess maybe it played better live versus now we're looking at it on some old

1165
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,160
archival footage, basically.

1166
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,280
And yeah, maybe it doesn't read right to your brain.

1167
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,480
Sure. But I would have been swept up into Mickey Mania if I would have given the

1168
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,360
giant inflatable Mickey a big hug.

1169
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,200
Right. It's it's really interesting to look at these through the because I like

1170
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,960
jumped. I watched some for the 80s and the 90s and 2000s.

1171
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,560
And you can always tell what they're pushing at any given time.

1172
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,640
Yeah.

1173
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,760
But there are weird moments where it's like, oh, they're really giving the hard

1174
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,760
sell to the magic carpets of Aladdin, the little spinner ride that is kind of in an

1175
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,440
odd spot of adventure land.

1176
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,360
Did you guys ride over a very boring.

1177
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,360
Did you guys come across a thing?

1178
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,360
Does the phrase pal Mickey mean anything to you?

1179
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,760
No.

1180
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,280
No. OK. This is in.

1181
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:40,800
I don't have a clip of this, but it's in a 2000s one in the top seven must sees

1182
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,680
2003 with Chris.

1183
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:50,920
Chris was before Stacey and some of these things we're talking about have hosts

1184
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,080
seemingly the very early ones did, but not always.

1185
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,360
Not always a weird disembodied voice.

1186
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,360
But then you start getting kind of like fun, relatable personalities.

1187
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,360
Yeah, yeah.

1188
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,520
Very much of a piece of the 20.

1189
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,400
If you remember, was it hosted by Maria Menounos, the 20?

1190
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,640
The movie theater?

1191
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Sure, sure.

1192
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,240
It's like a fake countdown thing, but it's like produced by whoever.

1193
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,880
The Disney one is so funny because it's like the top seven things you must see.

1194
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,680
And every item is like actually 10 different things.

1195
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,920
Well, there's a lot of sub things within these things.

1196
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,240
Yeah.

1197
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:36,640
But so pal Mickey was like a stuffed Mickey who would talk and it would tell you like

1198
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:42,640
behind the scenes stuff or like showtimes and continue to do this when you went home.

1199
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,440
So imagine carrying a stuffed Mickey in Orlando where it rains every day.

1200
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,240
It's like it talks to you.

1201
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,560
We're sort of in like a tickle me Elmo zone.

1202
00:56:54,560 --> 00:57:00,560
But specifically, they said you can buy this or rent it at your hotel so you can rent

1203
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,400
a nasty electronic stuffed Mickey.

1204
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,640
Wow, pal Mickey.

1205
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,160
This might we may need to do a full episode on this.

1206
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,400
Yeah, we might have to dig into pal Mickey because this like predates like they're putting

1207
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,200
Alexa's in a lot in the hotel rooms.

1208
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,920
It says, yeah, he's the talk of the park on the box.

1209
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,360
I had never heard of this.

1210
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,240
I've never, no, I've never seen this.

1211
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,840
I don't know.

1212
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,360
It's probably going to be too hard, Ian, for you to see unless you Google it.

1213
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,320
You can play games with him.

1214
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,680
You know, like pal Mickey will speak the names of Disney characters.

1215
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,520
He'll say things like when I say goofy, squeeze my left hand.

1216
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,280
When I say the name of someone who can fly, squeeze my right hand.

1217
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,880
That's a game Jason and I have played, though.

1218
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,600
So I get that part of it.

1219
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,360
Does he say soak your head fresh, boy?

1220
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,880
Very good point.

1221
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,400
Maybe if you take my gal,

1222
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,000
you take your own head and put it in a fucking toilet.

1223
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,640
She kisses you.

1224
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,800
Don't don't let her.

1225
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,320
You know what?

1226
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,360
I'll happen.

1227
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,200
I don't care if she wants to.

1228
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,800
That sounds like a Mike Love lyric, like the very few Mike Love Pence song.

1229
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,400
Oh, yeah.

1230
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,440
Weird, vindictive, right?

1231
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,880
Angry, petty.

1232
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,600
It says part tips on here, too.

1233
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,080
So, yeah.

1234
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:18,600
Yeah.

1235
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,240
Did you know that your dad is not

1236
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,120
spending the money that he could be?

1237
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,760
He's not unlocking all of the magic that's possible.

1238
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,320
Look in your dad's wallet.

1239
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,120
If you see any dollars in there, you find somewhere to spend.

1240
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,800
Yeah, feed them into my mouth.

1241
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,200
Someone in your family is at that bar at the Squan and Dolphin

1242
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,920
where people go to have affairs.

1243
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,480
But I'm not going to tell you.

1244
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,040
Well, that's the crazy part, because I mean, the resort TV was so

1245
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:51,800
so ingratiated, so known that they spoofed that element of the resort TV.

1246
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,080
So resort TV worked for my family.

1247
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,080
I remember very specifically 1992 Disney and they saw the super duper pass

1248
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,480
advertised and man, we had to upgrade immediately.

1249
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,920
My mom ran down to the concierge super duper ticket.

1250
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,520
Here we come. But dinosaurs, a previous topic, spoofed this whole thing.

1251
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,640
And one of my favorite episodes, we say so land where Earl Sinclair is on every chair.

1252
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,400
The boss is on every channel and he's telling Earl to buy more stuff that we say so.

1253
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,760
He can't escape him. Oh, gee.

1254
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,080
So you could like if you were if you were weird, you might say that this.

1255
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,120
Well, we love that you never have to unplug from the Disney machine.

1256
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,520
Some people view this as then you go home and are told more ways

1257
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,920
that you could give the company money.

1258
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,480
And you will be giving money to 24, 24, seven for, you know,

1259
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,040
five, six, seven days.

1260
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,760
A cynic might say that about resort TV.

1261
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,560
That's fully no cynics are present.

1262
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,800
Right. This room or Zoom. Right. Right.

1263
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,240
So, yeah, because because, yeah, this the loop in the 94 one ends with

1264
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,840
a big push for the vacation club.

1265
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,600
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1266
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,680
Yeah. Like you like, hey, if you like what you're doing right now,

1267
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,760
why go anywhere else ever in the world?

1268
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,120
They'll say in them like you could be a property owner here at the

1269
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,440
it's as bald as that. Yeah.

1270
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,600
Yeah. It's by the way, there are multiple versions of Pal Mickey.

1271
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,320
There's like different outfits and there's a sorcerer's apprentice pal Mickey.

1272
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,200
I've never seen this before.

1273
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:28,600
So anyway, this is the path to you finding things to be more interested

1274
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,800
in than your daughter.

1275
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,520
Well, now, did you know that something you can take care of that looks like Mickey's?

1276
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,800
Something our daughter does not.

1277
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,920
My daughter does not give me park tips.

1278
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,440
Honey, I got you more stuffed animals.

1279
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,200
Now you have to keep them in the box and they are rotting.

1280
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:49,040
They stick. But you can have them on this high bookshelf

1281
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,000
where you can't touch them.

1282
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,320
Brett, could you bring up this is a video.

1283
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,480
I think this is from the 95 resort TV.

1284
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,600
Could you bring up the video called Disney Nights?

1285
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,320
And it's it's just this will get confusing because I also sent a video

1286
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,960
called Disney Nights.

1287
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,520
Maybe it's the same thing.

1288
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,560
It's a big part.

1289
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,440
It's totally it's a very of its time sort of thing.

1290
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,800
Oh, yeah. Pleasure Island.

1291
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,680
That's what it says.

1292
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,800
And now set your sights on the evening lights.

1293
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,600
You're having some fun on those Disney Nights.

1294
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,720
Wow, that is so great.

1295
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,920
That logo is so good.

1296
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,240
That voice. Yeah.

1297
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,200
When the sun goes down all around.

1298
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,400
The night time fun comes to your town with Disney Nights.

1299
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,800
That's very lecherous. I'll be honest.

1300
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,280
It makes it funny that then the next thing is like the luau with Mickey and Minnie.

1301
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,920
Mickey and Minnie will wear Hawaiian skirts for you.

1302
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:58,520
Like things are not very nighty necessarily.

1303
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,480
Mickey takes off his little red shorts and puts on a hula skirt.

1304
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,480
When the sun goes down, so do Mickey's shorts.

1305
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,800
His little red shorts.

1306
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,200
The moon comes up and the skirt does too.

1307
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,800
The luau hooptie do review and before that, Broadway at the top

1308
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,480
are always pushed, but in different ways.

1309
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,120
And like in the 90s and 2000s, it's the land.

1310
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:25,080
It's the other two shows being exciting endeavors.

1311
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,600
And then in the 80s, it's like you and your family can enjoy

1312
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,960
three different dinner theater shows.

1313
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,320
It's just very, very restrained.

1314
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:39,160
And the 80s ones too spend like a third of the video

1315
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,960
talking about different recreational opportunity.

1316
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,720
Like it sounds like Hank Hill describing Disney World.

1317
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,520
It's like all now they want you in the park and they want you spending money.

1318
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,440
But at the time, it's like here's a free recreational

1319
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,520
activities included at your resort.

1320
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,840
1995 was the only time that they wanted you a little horny.

1321
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,760
Oh, yeah, just a little bit.

1322
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:07,280
But I did see the one talking, the one Pleasure Island.

1323
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,800
It's like there's nightclubs to country music, 90s hits, improv comedy.

1324
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:18,520
And it's just like, oh, man, no, I don't want to hear about improv comedy.

1325
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,120
Watch as they get a suggestion.

1326
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,240
Where will they go?

1327
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,640
And you had to get the babysitter too.

1328
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,120
I mean, that that's a hallmark from Susan.

1329
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,560
Again, we love Susan.

1330
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,880
She might be the first girl.

1331
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,880
I know this is your I don't want to impose my my will here,

1332
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,280
but you had a lot of guys.

1333
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,680
You haven't had a lot of girls just saying Susan.

1334
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,560
She's like one video.

1335
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,720
She should be a PTR legend, you think, maybe?

1336
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,880
Oh, maybe.

1337
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,120
Or she just come up more on the show.

1338
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,200
Yes, at least at least the latter.

1339
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,680
But she's always talking about what year do we see Susan?

1340
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,600
I feel like I didn't see Susan.

1341
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,760
I'd like to. Oh, 81.

1342
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,520
81. She's believed to have been on before that.

1343
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,560
But 81 is is the.

1344
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,160
Susan sightings were rare, but not uncommon.

1345
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:07,400
And before I documented a viewing of Susan was in 1981.

1346
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,640
I'm such a dummy.

1347
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,680
I went to YouTube and typed in Susan as if that would.

1348
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,840
You know, I'm getting a lot of suggestions for other thing.

1349
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,480
Boyle, Sarandon. No, no. Stop.

1350
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,000
Stop giving me second names.

1351
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,520
I want Susan full stop.

1352
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,080
Yeah, it should be like Cher.

1353
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,560
Yeah, you know, and it's Susan.

1354
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,840
A weird thing, though, is that so there's the early 2000s videos.

1355
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,360
And that's I said, that's a woman named Chris.

1356
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,240
And then Stacey takes over in 2006.

1357
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,080
I know this because she posted about it on Instagram.

1358
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,480
She was there from like 2006 to 2020.

1359
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:52,000
And but there's a two hour early 2000 video with Chris.

1360
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,120
And then there's a Stacey video for a few years later.

1361
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,680
And she is saying basically the same script.

1362
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,600
They made the video.

1363
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,360
Yeah, they remade the video. Interesting.

1364
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,920
Humiliating for Chris.

1365
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,960
Yeah. So these were my words.

1366
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,600
I know them so well, I can recite them by heart.

1367
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,720
Do we know if, sir, is it like a obviously it's not like a Supreme Court

1368
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,360
justice where you serve on Disney Resort TV forever.

1369
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,880
So we sure. I mean, I don't want to.

1370
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:21,920
Oh, I guess you're right.

1371
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,440
No, you're right. We actually don't.

1372
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,960
You're right. No, you're we don't know.

1373
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,480
Maybe they retired.

1374
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,560
Yeah, it's like it in that Stacey has a lot of land

1375
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,680
holdings from a billionaire that she didn't disclose. Right. Right.

1376
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,680
Some shady dealings.

1377
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,280
The improvement. Yeah.

1378
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,360
Yeah. There's some corruption with Rady Creek. Yeah.

1379
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,880
And that's why Ron's going to get in there and take care of all this.

1380
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,120
But maybe, yeah, maybe Chris is like, I'm holding out being the resort TV host

1381
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:51,000
until a new CEO that is more politically aligned with me comes into power.

1382
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,440
So that's really when you're resort TV host.

1383
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,920
Yeah, you have to resign strategically.

1384
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,800
So they appoint someone that's more of your sort of political persuasion.

1385
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,760
So maybe that's what Chris was doing. I don't know.

1386
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,000
Yeah, you got a target on your back.

1387
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,960
If whether you're you're Susan or Chris or Stacey,

1388
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,920
you know, the position everybody wants, this would be a good choose your fighter

1389
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,480
screen, assuming that we can find we just need to send us

1390
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,520
and send us Susan so we make sure we can represent Susan.

1391
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,440
Yeah, we're in 81.

1392
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,120
Who was the CEO? When was E.

1393
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,720
Card Walker Card Walker appoint Susan to resort TV?

1394
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,040
I he almost had to.

1395
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,240
I mean, because he was he was breaking ground on Epcot.

1396
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,160
He was getting ready.

1397
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,600
But I wonder if he I wonder if he delegated that because Epcot was so close.

1398
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,960
Right, right. Epcot getting ready for that.

1399
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,600
And one of the things everybody seems to have in common again,

1400
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:45,440
I think the hosts are for the dads because these are conventionally attractive,

1401
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,040
maybe 25 to 30 year old women.

1402
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,240
And the dads are there.

1403
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,080
And so you might, you know, they might be listening to the conventionally

1404
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:57,920
attractive 25 to 30 year old woman more so than J.D.

1405
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,720
Roth, who was the host of Disney's Inside Out, which they promote during the.

1406
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,320
That's a twerp.

1407
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,360
Dad doesn't want to see J.D. Roth.

1408
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,360
Yeah, give me some eye candy.

1409
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,200
But dad would like to see the champ, George Foreman.

1410
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,320
Yes, he also hosted Disney inside and out.

1411
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,160
He's not talked more about the rate of the Disney.

1412
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,680
That's another we in our list of everything that tells you what you could do at Disney

1413
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:25,160
World. We forgot, or unless you said it, that there was a weekly show on the Disney

1414
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:28,920
Channel where George Foreman shows you what to do at the parks.

1415
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,000
And before a weird time before that, I believe a monthly television show,

1416
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,400
which is a very odd schedule once a month TV.

1417
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,360
That's like the Colombo schedule.

1418
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,920
Yeah, it's when they when he feels like it.

1419
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,360
Yeah. Yeah, really.

1420
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:49,080
Well, and those went these the hosts all have a real like,

1421
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:54,240
you know, like don't start picturing it's it's not it's no bikini babe, right?

1422
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,040
It's not very heavy.

1423
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:55,960
Most like this.

1424
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,520
No, yeah, no, Debbie Dunning.

1425
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:57,920
Yeah.

1426
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,000
Uh, all the babe of the decade.

1427
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,600
No, like you know, it's it's the most like kind of gap ad

1428
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:12,800
like, you know, sporty vest and sweater over your shirt.

1429
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,680
And like and it's probably at some point like cargo pants.

1430
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,320
And then maybe they'll like, you know, they'll go to a thing where,

1431
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,200
you know, there's like a bunch of dancers of some international flavor

1432
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,200
and she'll get in there and like, whoop, whoop, like she'll like dance

1433
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:30,240
slightly for two seconds and then laugh how hard like I can't believe I did.

1434
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,920
Yeah, it's the same type of woman.

1435
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,440
It just shifts as time goes on.

1436
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:40,000
Well, in 2001, you since you mentioned gap at the 2001 video,

1437
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:46,360
it's four or six people in different colored polo shirts and khakis.

1438
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:51,080
And they're they're not really established who they are or what they're doing

1439
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,400
or why we would know them.

1440
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,200
Jane was guessing they were like in park face characters,

1441
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,160
because she's like, I that could be a princess, that could be Aladdin,

1442
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,880
you know, that could.

1443
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,240
But they and they do that like

1444
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,440
editing trick of like they pop in from the side of the screen

1445
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,880
or like they're upside down from the top of the screen.

1446
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,920
We're getting kooky in the 2000s.

1447
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,920
To check out one of the videos, by the way, does.

1448
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:23,840
I know I was I looked a bit foolish when I suggested people

1449
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:28,400
read the brochures or guidebooks before they go to the park back in the 90s.

1450
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,200
I gave was it when did you look foolish?

1451
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:37,560
Well, I believe it was Aaron's father who hated the living seas pavilion.

1452
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,720
Oh, yeah. Your father.

1453
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,240
They went to. Yeah, I know.

1454
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,720
Zarin's family. They went to Epcot.

1455
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,600
The first thing they got on was the sea cabs.

1456
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,760
They were like, this sucks.

1457
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,800
We hate this place. And they left.

1458
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,600
So only so my wife and I only did.

1459
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:53,320
We've discovered Epcot together because she threw it all under the.

1460
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,000
Her family hated the sea cabs so much. Yeah.

1461
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,840
So is that is that a contrary?

1462
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,440
And I don't know your leanings is that is that too harsh?

1463
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,560
I love that.

1464
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,720
But that was the maddest my father has ever been at me.

1465
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:12,480
I accidentally smashed a virgin strawberry daiquiri at the living seas.

1466
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,320
It was the big meal.

1467
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,520
It was to celebrate my parents anniversary.

1468
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,560
It was their 10 year anniversary in 1996.

1469
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,440
We were in the living seas with the sharks and the fish and everything around.

1470
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,720
They got me a virgin strawberry daiquiri.

1471
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:30,440
Not only did I spill it, the glass smashed and I've never been yelled at

1472
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,200
later in my life. So wow.

1473
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,960
Yeah. Dark family memories abound at the living seas.

1474
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,360
I guess so.

1475
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,560
So sorry, you were in the middle.

1476
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:43,680
Well, I was going to say that the 1987 Resort TV video,

1477
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:49,120
a very dry man says to make the most of your visit to Epcot Center

1478
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,720
in the Magic Kingdom, review your guidebooks before you arrive.

1479
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,360
So you should say you should have done your homework.

1480
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,040
You know, yeah, you need to watch the channel that tells you

1481
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,800
that you should have read your book.

1482
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,600
Yes. Only then.

1483
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,960
Yeah, channels only 17 minutes long. So

1484
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,680
speaking of something for the dads and when I say dads, I mean me, daddy,

1485
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,160
specifically me.

1486
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:19,720
There's a clip I found again in 94 that I I almost fell off my chair

1487
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,480
when I was reviewing this clip because it comes out of nowhere.

1488
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,000
And there's sometimes I think on these there would be all of a sudden

1489
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,200
kind of an ad for a Disney adjacent thing, not something necessarily parks related.

1490
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,120
But someone appeared on the screen,

1491
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,560
and I guess I'm going to give it away by name, the file name

1492
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,920
when I call it for it right here, Brett.

1493
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,720
But if you, Brett, if you could play the file just that's called Freaks,

1494
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,360
I would appreciate it because this gentleman appeared and I

1495
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,760
I've edited just his sort of dialogue together from this.

1496
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:55,720
This is an ad for Disney's Gargoyles hosted by Jonathan Freaks,

1497
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,960
one of my favorite guys ever in room only in your hotel room.

1498
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,880
Can you watch this exclusive Freaks?

1499
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,760
Yes. And Freaks, by the way, on Picard season three is killing it.

1500
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,120
He is flawless.

1501
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,800
He is right. He is maybe the best of all the actors on.

1502
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,160
And they're all doing great.

1503
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,480
But I'm very excited about Picard. But here we go.

1504
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:15,160
This is John and the Freaks 1994 Gargoyles in Room promo.

1505
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,000
I'm Jonathan Freaks, one of the actors helping to bring the new animated series

1506
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,720
Gargoyles to life when our Gargoyles

1507
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,480
their ugly stone statues that adorn the walls of old buildings.

1508
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,920
There was a time 1000 years ago

1509
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,480
when gargoyles were real living creatures.

1510
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,280
Now the castle has been moved from its homeland,

1511
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,040
the top of New York's tallest skyscraper.

1512
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,760
I played David Sanatos, the rich and powerful businessman

1513
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,360
who seeks to exploit the might of the gargoyles for his own purposes.

1514
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,200
Wow. Wow.

1515
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,440
This is so exciting when I saw this and I didn't see I if I had seen this

1516
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,960
when I was a kid, because I was a big next generation fan as a kid.

1517
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,880
So this would have

1518
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,840
I would have been much more excited than seeing any sort of nice lady.

1519
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,800
Oh, my.

1520
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,360
Freaks alert. Freaks alert.

1521
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,440
So, yeah, so that you could see stuff like this.

1522
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,200
There was a time on this earth when man could marry a gargoyle.

1523
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,800
No one would look down on this.

1524
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,880
It would be celebrated.

1525
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,880
Everyone from the village would come out with their gargoyle wives and applaud you.

1526
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,080
Yes, I was.

1527
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,560
My only complaint was this was not an hour long.

1528
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:29,680
This is and this is before Beyond Belief Fact or Fiction,

1529
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,560
which is the Fox show where he would they would show you

1530
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,600
like little short stories and ask you, is it fact or fiction?

1531
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,000
And then he would reveal at the end and he was very dramatic.

1532
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,320
And if you ever repaired a bicycle, like if you ever

1533
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,960
he kind of looks like with a long.

1534
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,600
Yes, it looks like the set as well.

1535
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,960
Yes. Yeah. There was smoke on the set.

1536
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,280
And people have made great compilations of these videos, too.

1537
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,480
So. So the pitch on that show might have been

1538
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:59,800
have you ever sauntered around a smoky blue room and said intriguing things?

1539
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,360
I have. And I'd like to do it again.

1540
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,960
Gentlemen, I have a television idea for you.

1541
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,640
Another resident of the Lehigh Valley.

1542
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,760
I'd rather instead.

1543
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,840
No offense to Dana Roebuck, but Jonathan Freaks really

1544
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,600
have him on the on the hospital billboard promoting vaccines at all times.

1545
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,040
Wow. That's crazy.

1546
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,000
They aren't hyping freaks.

1547
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,680
Roebuck now breaks.

1548
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,640
It's adult film star Devin.

1549
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,720
It's the champ Larry Holmes.

1550
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,760
It is Lisa and another adult film star.

1551
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,680
There's two stars that are like prominently displayed.

1552
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,680
Well, they're they're notable.

1553
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,840
They're the notable figures here.

1554
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,160
So we shouldn't be notable, I'm just saying.

1555
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,160
Sure. And Will Riker should also have a spot at the table.

1556
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,080
Absolutely.

1557
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:49,120
It should be Amanda Seyfried, Riker, Larry Holmes,

1558
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,080
various adult film stars, in my opinion. Great.

1559
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,880
This is a very interesting collection to throw out the first pitch

1560
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,600
at the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs Minor League Baseball Team.

1561
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,840
Right. Briefly, briefly called the Lehigh Valley Scrapple.

1562
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,240
The Scrapple. Yes. Is that true?

1563
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,000
Yeah, it is. Yes.

1564
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
How is this never come up? Do you have the cap?

1565
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,800
So I have the cheesesteaks hat in my office. OK.

1566
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,480
So but every year they they change.

1567
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,360
I'm currently wearing an Iron Pigs hat.

1568
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,960
They they they have a great merchandise director, Mike Luciano Luch.

1569
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,280
They have a very innovative general manager who did

1570
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,480
win your own funeral night.

1571
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,120
You as you went into the as you went into the ballpark,

1572
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,400
he handed you a ticket. Wow.

1573
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,120
They did a nice drawing. You went up.

1574
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,360
You won a casket. You could win a casket that night.

1575
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,040
Just one of the one of the great minds in minor league baseball.

1576
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:44,440
And yeah, they were for one night last two two seasons ago.

1577
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:48,000
They were the Scrapple, which is very exciting night in the Lehigh Valley.

1578
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,200
Yeah. Wow.

1579
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,880
Jason, why weren't you there doing something like that?

1580
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,360
Seems like we should have flown you out.

1581
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,960
Yeah, no, I agree. I 100 percent agree.

1582
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,320
You should have been playing in the game. I've had the hat.

1583
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:03,920
They still there's not the the MI LB website.

1584
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,720
You can buy minor league merch and they do have a hat

1585
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:09,040
with like a piece of Scrapple on it. Wow.

1586
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,440
And how do you feel in general about East Coast meets?

1587
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,640
Love, love them all. I love them all.

1588
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,120
And I'll tell you what, the

1589
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,560
that was one of my biggest difficulties at Disney World

1590
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,600
because I was so used to these weird East Coast meets like Scrapple,

1591
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,360
like the Canadian bacon,

1592
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:29,600
you know, just used to just weird East Coast.

1593
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,240
You know, I was talking to Jason briefly, you know,

1594
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,360
he's from a little further south.

1595
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,280
I'm from a little farther north, but generally the same area.

1596
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,080
And we have just various concoctions

1597
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:45,280
and just mixes of meats that you really don't find in the American southeast.

1598
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,120
So that was always a difficulty going to Disney World as a kid,

1599
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,560
because as a kid, you're a picky eater.

1600
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,880
So I ate a lot of bananas and cereal at Continental Breakfast.

1601
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,480
That's OK. Sure.

1602
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,720
You can you can I ask, do you maybe this is too personal,

1603
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,360
but do you have Scrapple in the house?

1604
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,920
Not in the house. I will order Scrapple.

1605
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,280
I have ordered Scrapple at the diners around here.

1606
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,280
We have a lot of diners.

1607
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,840
We I've worked at some of the diners around here.

1608
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,480
The Mayas Diner giving free publicity here.

1609
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,720
But, you know, the Scrapple is readily available.

1610
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,440
In fact, if you don't have Scrapple,

1611
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,760
one of the reasons I don't go to the Waffle House in the area

1612
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,800
is because they don't have Scrapple.

1613
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,840
Wow. OK. So that's like a must when you're having like a fun diner meal.

1614
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,600
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

1615
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,040
Hmm. It also feels like so you I guess your ideal

1616
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:38,400
iteration of World Showcase on a childhood Epcot trip was that it's like

1617
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,840
Japan, Italy, Philadelphia.

1618
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,240
Yes.

1619
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,520
Well, that's so you bring up a good point as someone from the area

1620
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,280
and maybe Jason can relate.

1621
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,320
A lot of the American Pavilion is centered

1622
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,640
solely around Philadelphia and around the American Revolution.

1623
01:17:55,640 --> 01:18:01,880
Oh, yeah. The American Pavilion and Liberty Square also like very

1624
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,240
both those places, like very familiar, because it's like, well, we already

1625
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,760
we saw these on day trips.

1626
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,680
We see all this crap all the time or we live next to it, you know.

1627
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,040
So we have a fake.

1628
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,280
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1629
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,600
Oh, yeah. We have a fake Liberty Bell in Allentown.

1630
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,680
So it was weird.

1631
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,320
The progression, it was like a reverse Russian nesting doll,

1632
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,440
because I would see the fake Liberty Bell that they created

1633
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,760
to hide the real Liberty Bell in Allentown.

1634
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,720
And then I would went to Philadelphia, saw the real Liberty Bell.

1635
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:35,600
And then I would go see the slightly enlarged, embellished Liberty Bell

1636
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,920
at Liberty Square within the confines of the American Pavilion.

1637
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,560
Which which bell was your favorite of the three?

1638
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,000
Oh, you can't make me choose.

1639
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,760
I'm sorry. That's one question I won't answer.

1640
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,080
OK, that's fair. Toughest question.

1641
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,400
Jason, have you seen these bells?

1642
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,040
I've well, I've seen the original.

1643
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,920
OK, in Philadelphia.

1644
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,520
Yeah. So you've seen the Disney World.

1645
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,760
Yeah, I've seen the Disney World.

1646
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,080
But I'm sure I've seen the Allentown one.

1647
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,680
I don't think I've seen the Allentown one. I'm sorry.

1648
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,480
Have you seen the Lego one in the Philadelphia Airport?

1649
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:04,840
That one's pretty cool.

1650
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,840
I have seen the Lego one a number of times.

1651
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,520
OK, well, that's three, Jason. Which one?

1652
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,760
Which one do you like of those three?

1653
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,240
Pick a bell.

1654
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:14,760
Uh, I had to go with classic, even though it's kind of like fortified.

1655
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,040
It's like Fort Knox now.

1656
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,000
It's surrounded by so much glass. You can't get close.

1657
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,800
No, you can't. OK.

1658
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,640
OK, so original we got.

1659
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,920
Well, we'll do a fake Bell Final Four next year.

1660
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:26,520
Well, that's a good one.

1661
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,360
I was going to say you can't ignore Knott's Berry Farm.

1662
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,120
Oh, yeah.

1663
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:30,880
You make it out here.

1664
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,200
We get this Knott's Berry Farm fake bell too in their fake Independence Hall.

1665
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:34,960
Oh, yeah.

1666
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,840
Mm hmm. Yeah.

1667
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,440
It's got to be a lot of fake bells.

1668
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,680
I hadn't considered that. Yeah. Yeah.

1669
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:40,880
It's just too many.

1670
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,200
So what they what there should have been if there's already so much Philly presence,

1671
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:50,440
it essentially the American adventure should be called just Philadelphia.

1672
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:54,200
And then and there should be you should be able to get an upside down

1673
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,040
Liberty Bell full of Scrapple. Oh, sure.

1674
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,960
Yeah, there's your that is a really good idea.

1675
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,960
I mean, they have that Sam the Eagle barbecue restaurant now.

1676
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:10,240
Yes. So it's not much of a leap to do like a Philadelphia meat tasting plate.

1677
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,680
You get Scrapple, you get pork roll, you know.

1678
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,920
Mm hmm.

1679
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,680
Ham, you get hot and sweet Italian sausage.

1680
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,840
Oh, a common bread.

1681
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,560
If you go to a diner and order like breakfast,

1682
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:27,680
that it's like a long list, writing of like meats you could get.

1683
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,240
And in some parts of the Northeast, they're like,

1684
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,640
would you like some hot Italian sausage with your pancakes?

1685
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,480
And it's delicious.

1686
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,880
You know, I mean, it sounds good. Yeah.

1687
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,080
And you can even get various salami's like if you go to the right places,

1688
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,560
you'd be amazed at what kind of curated and salted meats

1689
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,400
you can get with your breakfast. Sure.

1690
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,040
Was this ever a consideration for you, Jason, in moving to Los Angeles?

1691
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,240
The difficulty of leaving the meat options behind?

1692
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:58,160
Well, you know, someone when we did the our first show at Dynasty Typewriter,

1693
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,600
someone did bring me like a pound of Scrapple.

1694
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,880
So as long as listeners bring you the meat,

1695
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:08,600
as long as you use our audience as a meat delivery service, then

1696
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,800
then you're fine not having it in your native language.

1697
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,760
I think there's a butcher or two in L.A.

1698
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,640
that will do like a case, like a thing of pork roll.

1699
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,000
You want to give some names out?

1700
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
We have a show coming up. I don't know the name.

1701
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,160
Listeners. Yeah, Jason's got an empty fridge.

1702
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,280
Pork roll is usually my go to.

1703
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:29,120
If you Taylor Ham, as it's called in some parts of New Jersey.

1704
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,120
If you could give him a piece of meat that's as big as the meat

1705
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:35,480
Fred Flintstone gets put on the side of his car at the start of the Flintstones,

1706
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,840
that would be really good.

1707
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,160
The bigger the piece of meat for Jason, the better.

1708
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,760
So attack him after the not attack.

1709
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,720
I shouldn't say that.

1710
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,640
Place the meat on. You know what?

1711
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,040
Wait for Jason to get in his car,

1712
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,000
pull around, wave him down in the street,

1713
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:54,640
and then put the giant piece of meat on the side of Jason's car.

1714
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,760
Yeah. Jason's car over and it falls over, tips over on one side.

1715
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,080
That's how we should do it.

1716
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,960
And he'd be mad at first until he realized what was happening. Right.

1717
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,760
Oh, it's a big slab. Exactly.

1718
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,840
I'm in heaven now. Sure. Yeah.

1719
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,880
And then I don't know. He'll figure it out from there.

1720
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,200
What else we got in resort TV?

1721
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:17,240
Can I just you know, some aspect we have not talked about

1722
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,080
is music.

1723
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,840
I am just in heaven, especially in these 90s ones,

1724
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,840
because listeners might know I love my just like

1725
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,880
hotel jazz, which is whatever's playing, you know, like the Spotify mix

1726
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,360
that the band Telethon sent me of what would have been playing

1727
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,880
in the contemporary lobby circa 94.

1728
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,200
I put this on so much, it relaxes me so much.

1729
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:40,760
And, Brett, if there's a video called Magic Kingdom Tip,

1730
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,280
and this just gives you this is just like the oxygen to the brain

1731
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:49,200
of delightful anonymous jazz and graphic transitions.

1732
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,520
This is this is what you need to hear.

1733
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,800
Hi, I'm Denise.

1734
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,280
Here's a tip to make sure there's a nice woman named Denise

1735
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,360
that's happening here at Walt Disney World like a Mickey theme park

1736
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,880
guidebook and entertainment.

1737
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,600
She's really talking too loud over the music.

1738
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,960
Yeah, I wish. Yeah, it really gets in the way.

1739
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,720
But those little trends is I really because I will look.

1740
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,120
Ian, you brought this up as a topic where for many years

1741
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:24,040
I've been putting these on my wife and I just like what we want something brainless.

1742
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,880
We don't want to get involved in a, you know, in a serious plot

1743
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,760
of a movie or something that's going to upset it.

1744
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,800
Can we just like crack open some wine and watch some resort TV

1745
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,360
and feel like we are in the the the Magic Kingdom

1746
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,080
or in the the vacation kingdom circa 1995?

1747
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,760
Yeah, it's interesting you bring that up because I have one of the most

1748
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,960
caring, understanding whites in the world.

1749
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,960
I travel a lot and I'm away from home a lot.

1750
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,000
We have two kids.

1751
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,400
I put her in impossible situations.

1752
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:58,000
But the biggest backlash I've ever gotten from my wife

1753
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:02,040
was there was a streak during the pandemic where early on,

1754
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,240
when we weren't sure how much we had to stay in our house,

1755
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:08,840
where the only two things I would want to put on the TV were Dick Tracy.

1756
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,440
And the Walt Disney World Resort Television.

1757
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,040
Wow. It got to a it got to a boiling point.

1758
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:20,440
And I'm wondering if this is like that chemical they say your brain

1759
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:25,000
releases before you think you're going to die, where you try and you just

1760
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,800
have that one moment of euphoria.

1761
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,040
I'm wondering if I was chasing that because it just it just ties

1762
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,040
all of those things tie so much to some of the last, like

1763
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:40,640
absolutely 100 percent carefree moments that I've kind of crystallized in my mind.

1764
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,480
And I was trying to chase those.

1765
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,960
Maybe I was trying to chase those down just in case the play.

1766
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1767
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,560
What I was saying at the beginning about wanting your life to flash before your

1768
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,080
eyes with pleasant music like that.

1769
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,040
Absolutely. There's something so cosmically.

1770
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,560
Certain listeners, if you never watch one of these blocks, you might be like,

1771
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,760
OK, they've played clips and everything, but now they are saying that this is like

1772
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,160
the be all end all of their instances.

1773
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:08,040
They're watching these and that it's it's a conflict in a marriage that

1774
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,720
you can't watch them during that.

1775
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,880
But there is some boy.

1776
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,480
I mean, you guys know you've watched these just for fun.

1777
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,120
It's true. Really. It's so much.

1778
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:20,800
It is like getting a little quick like for this half hour that I'm watching this.

1779
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:25,560
I'm getting a miniature trip, not just to Disney World, but to the past of Disney.

1780
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,120
Well, yeah, I will watch these.

1781
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:31,160
I will go so far as there's a channel on YouTube.

1782
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,440
It's just a constant live stream.

1783
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:38,280
It's called WDW Today, and it is the bulletin board channel.

1784
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,720
It's like a recreation of the bulletin board channel.

1785
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,200
And it just plays forever.

1786
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,240
And it just tells you like the weather, the park hours.

1787
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,960
And it's just I will put that on when I'm like puttering around the house, you know.

1788
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,800
Yeah, it's it's the one thing that has really been consistent

1789
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,560
to with the excitement of Disney World with with my kids and I.

1790
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:06,320
And there's there's rides that they like that maybe Zach likes that I like

1791
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,360
or Nora, our daughter, that I like.

1792
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,360
But there's always difference of opinion.

1793
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,520
But the first thing that they've done when we've gone to Art of Animation

1794
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:18,360
or when we've gone to the different resort hotels is they want to turn on the TV.

1795
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,240
They want to see they want to see what's going on at the theme park.

1796
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,280
One of the things that they like that I like is seeing the characters in situations

1797
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,680
they normally wouldn't be in another hallmark that you see a little.

1798
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,400
They give you a taste.

1799
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,240
They give you just a little maybe Goofy's on the ride

1800
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,680
or that shot of all the characters of all our best friends

1801
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,840
just standing in front of the big the castle like we just saw.

1802
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,400
Sure. You know, they just want.

1803
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,800
Yeah. Wow. Wow.

1804
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,040
Or like, you know, you always get is the characters golfing.

1805
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:49,000
You get like, oh, yeah, Pluto or Goofy and Pluto out on the links.

1806
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,760
I've talked about this before, where I want the characters working in the park more

1807
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,400
because I think and this resort TV may have set the unrealistic standard

1808
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,480
that they were actually the ones like operating the park

1809
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,800
or participating in the park more like on a tourist level,

1810
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,680
which, of course, is not possible.

1811
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,000
But I do wonder because, yeah, when you watch these,

1812
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,520
they're in all sorts of situations that you're probably not going to see them

1813
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,520
in the actual park.

1814
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,320
Yeah, this could be a false memory.

1815
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,120
But in one of the film and television ones, I think Goofy is a director

1816
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,680
in that MGM or maybe, yeah, or or Donald has a clack clack board.

1817
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,840
So, yeah, there's a stake of production.

1818
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,280
Yeah, she's come on.

1819
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,800
Did you even interview these candidates?

1820
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,480
Yeah, you know what they're going to get up to.

1821
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,480
Yeah, that's that's going to end up like a Josh Trank.

1822
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,960
It's fantastic for a situation.

1823
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,880
You don't want it's going to be all sorts of chaos.

1824
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,720
I fired Kelsey Kennedy.

1825
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,360
Didn't like my vision.

1826
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:54,280
I really was set to do a Star Wars movie, and then he got fired.

1827
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:57,400
Sadly, me and Trevor had a lot to bond about.

1828
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,720
I had to say, I like to watch it going through a bunch of these.

1829
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:07,040
I like seeing this stuff that like, I don't think the Fort Wilderness

1830
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:12,320
Resort has an old timey car that sells dry goods at each campsite anymore.

1831
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,120
Or, uh, uh, Brett, will you?

1832
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,880
I got to go punch the wall at that one.

1833
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,600
I know. I know.

1834
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,200
Costs cutting goods, cost cutting ruins people's memories.

1835
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:27,240
Brett, will you bring up the one titled Empress Lily River Boat?

1836
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:32,760
And just these old photo, these old footage of people eating

1837
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,960
like pretty gnarly looking food always makes me laugh.

1838
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,600
Or step on board the beautiful Empress

1839
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,600
Lily River Boat in Walt Disney World Building and select from three fine

1840
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,960
restaurants, the Empress Room, Fisherman's Deck or Steermans Quarters.

1841
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,440
The Steermans Quarters.

1842
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,440
Can we look at that plate of food?

1843
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:56,440
What do we got?

1844
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:59,440
I don't recognize what's in the middle.

1845
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,440
Jason, could you venture again?

1846
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,440
What do you think that is?

1847
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,040
Is that Filet of Soul?

1848
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,520
It looks like white fish.

1849
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:09,920
And with like broccoli with just like splats of mayo or vanilla ice cream.

1850
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,920
Sure.

1851
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:15,640
Multiple, like there's like, okay, make sure there are several gravy

1852
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:20,240
but we promise you, on the Empress Lily, we are a boat and you will get

1853
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,720
several gravy boats upon seating or your meal is free.

1854
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:24,720
Right.

1855
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,520
But there's just, I mean, there's so much in those really early ones of like

1856
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:33,240
very old people who look like they have only eaten the lobster thermidor

1857
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,840
at every meal for years.

1858
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:41,840
Like they look like they are falling to pieces and the food just looks awful.

1859
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,920
Are you really upset mostly because there's not any sort of East Coast meats

1860
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:48,920
presented there?

1861
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,600
No, no, the presence of lobster thermidor is fine.

1862
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,600
You don't see that that often anymore.

1863
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,600
But there's other weird like there's no way this is still around anymore.

1864
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:02,600
Brett, will you queue up Wonder of Walt Disney World?

1865
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:03,600
This is another thing.

1866
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,200
There was a few things that like, oh, I forgot about the Walk Around Chicken

1867
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:14,200
Little or the Wonders of Walt Disney World school credit course that you can

1868
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,200
take and fill out on your own time.

1869
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,680
You knew that and forgot about it?

1870
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,680
No, no, I never knew that.

1871
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,680
Interesting.

1872
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:30,680
Wonders of Walt Disney World, a special entertainment program for youngsters

1873
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,680
10 to 15 proves that learning can be fun.

1874
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:38,680
This program takes advantage of the rich learning resources of Walt Disney World

1875
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:43,680
Resort to provide courses in energy, creative arts, entertainment and ecology.

1876
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:51,160
For more information and enrollment in Wonders of Walt Disney World, call 828-2405.

1877
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:54,160
I'm so confused by what we just saw.

1878
01:30:54,160 --> 01:31:00,160
There was a bunch of kids like being taught and they're just being shown a bunch of pipes.

1879
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:02,160
Where are they? What is this? What school is this?

1880
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,160
Well, plants. There were some plants.

1881
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,160
Okay, okay. Pipes can be closed.

1882
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:08,160
Some pipes are closed to plants.

1883
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,160
Learn about pipes and plants.

1884
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,160
Some plants can fit into pipes.

1885
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,640
And then do a worksheet in the Magic Kingdom.

1886
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:18,640
My guess is like, okay, take your kids out of school.

1887
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,640
Bring them here when they're in school.

1888
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,640
And we have educational opportunities.

1889
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:28,640
Because we would always, if we went a couple of times during the school year

1890
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:34,640
and inevitably someone would try to go like, well, write up how I spent my vacation report.

1891
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,640
You would try to look for like, oh, I guess this is educational.

1892
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:43,120
I have to like go through the motions of doing this.

1893
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,120
I see.

1894
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,120
This is like the roots of when you get met, when you think of like,

1895
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,120
I'm going to the park, but it's for work.

1896
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1897
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,120
I'm going to do it for fun.

1898
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,120
Work trip.

1899
01:31:55,120 --> 01:32:01,120
Also, if you're trying to convince people that learning can be fun,

1900
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:05,120
you cannot say it in the voice, learning can be fun.

1901
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,120
That is the funniest shot.

1902
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,600
You've got to give it something or get fire a different voiceover person.

1903
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,600
Or just try it sexier, you know?

1904
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,600
Ooh, look at Disney Nights, learning can be fun.

1905
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,600
See what you learn about on Disney Nights.

1906
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,600
Disney Nights School.

1907
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:27,600
So I will say this, my wife did a master's in international education.

1908
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:33,600
And she actually connected with Living With the Land in 2011, 2012.

1909
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:38,080
Part of her project was farm to table food and part of her thesis.

1910
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:42,080
And they were actually able to provide her some resources and point her in the right direction

1911
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,080
in some of the things that were more difficult to find out.

1912
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:52,080
So yeah, there are actual, it's funny because what they advertise was totally what Jason said.

1913
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,080
It was, hey, can you do something with the kid?

1914
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,080
Can we get him a note?

1915
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,080
And great, he was here, he learned something.

1916
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:02,080
But if you actually contact them with reasonable education requests,

1917
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:08,560
it's been my experience, my wife's experience, that they will actually respond and give you some information.

1918
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,560
That's the funniest thing about that footage is it's like the driest narrator,

1919
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:18,560
the boringest footage of kids scribbling begrudgingly in worksheets.

1920
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:24,560
But yeah, there's real educational, there's scientists, there's food science people,

1921
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,560
there's biologists, like that will talk to you.

1922
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,560
So okay, here's what I think.

1923
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:37,040
Very famously, Scott got a lot of maybe listeners upset because he said that he didn't love living with the land.

1924
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:43,040
There were some things that used to be on the ride that they removed, which we agree were better.

1925
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,040
The song, of course, being number one.

1926
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:49,040
No one's ever been able to provide a good defense to why it's better without the song.

1927
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,040
Scott's right on that one.

1928
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,040
Scott is right at Gmail.

1929
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:57,040
But perhaps if we reach out and ask for an academic opportunity for you,

1930
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:05,520
in a clinical way, like a learning scientific way, perhaps this is the key to unlocking your love of living with the land.

1931
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,520
So if I'm able to do an immersive and learn all about farm to table.

1932
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:17,520
If we send you on the Behind the Seeds tour, which was not running last time I was there, but is back, I believe.

1933
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:23,520
And then maybe they'll have a couple worksheets for you to do, and then you'll sort of test your knowledge of what you've learned that day.

1934
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
And then we'll redo the episode and it'll be a whole different ballgame.

1935
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I guess probably why the ride hasn't stuck with me is that I did not do enough worksheets.

1936
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
That's right.

1937
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,000
That's where you really, it like codifies what you just experienced if you write it down.

1938
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:48,000
And silly me, I was just running off to the next ride, a ride with a voiceover, more to look at.

1939
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Right.

1940
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
But maybe worksheets are the key.

1941
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,480
Yeah, and I, go ahead.

1942
01:34:54,480 --> 01:35:00,480
Yeah, you weren't yet told by resort TV that you needed to do the pre-work involved in going to Living with the Land.

1943
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,480
Right.

1944
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:06,480
If you're planning on visiting Living with the Land, read the brochure that explains why the ride is interesting.

1945
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:12,480
Then fill out the brochure at the end to make sure that you understood what you saw.

1946
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:18,480
The brochure is a Scantron if you look on the back and you can fill in the little rectangles.

1947
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,960
And we'll run it through the Scantron reader at Living with the Land.

1948
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:28,960
A score of less than 70% will require you to go on Living with the Land again.

1949
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:34,960
This is the tone, by the way, that they used to sell you on Epcot Center in the 1983 video.

1950
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:40,960
Pavilions based on transportation, imagination, computers.

1951
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,960
Like it is the lowest energy.

1952
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,960
Space travel.

1953
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:49,440
I wrote down one of those that, yeah, like this is an exciting sentence if you said it excitingly, but they say it like,

1954
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:55,440
Epcot Center is a new world of wonder. You'll want to take the time to fully explore.

1955
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:59,440
Two days would be optimal for, yeah, well it sounds like, oh, I mean you sound excited.

1956
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,440
So I guess I should be too.

1957
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:05,440
Yeah, two days. Two days for Epcot, two days for Magic Kingdom. That's what they suck with.

1958
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:11,440
Do you think he was the father of the teen ride attendant?

1959
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:17,920
Because all of the teen ride attendants, do you think he was the godfather of that voice?

1960
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:27,920
Because every teen ride attendant that I've seen at Dorney Park, at Disney World, Six Flags, has that voice just in their own way.

1961
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:33,920
Oh, Vlad, please keep your hands and arms inside the vehicle at all times. Enjoy your ride on Twister.

1962
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,920
Was that the professor at the Eminem show as well?

1963
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,920
Oh yeah, yeah. I am the professor.

1964
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:46,400
I'm going to do some Eminem experiments today. Wait a minute, Red. Red, what are you doing? Don't mess with that, Red.

1965
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,400
Yeah, that's a very good point.

1966
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:56,400
I would be sad if this went away, honestly. Does it sell me on the fun of doing worksheets in the park on my vacation?

1967
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,400
Not necessarily, but is it part of the comfort that I get from these places?

1968
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:12,880
I'm watching people in a place of entertainment, not even half speed, be like 10% of the energy a human being should be able to manifest.

1969
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,880
And sometimes the musical equivalents of voices like this.

1970
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:22,880
I love the- and that's why I don't know if I always like the must-do Disney's with Stacey, because we're shortcutting a lot.

1971
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,880
This person looks like they're having a lot of fun, and I don't know how I feel about that.

1972
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:31,360
Slow down.

1973
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:37,360
That's interesting. Ian, you're a broadcaster. Have you ever thought about how you would approach hosting one of these videos?

1974
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:49,360
It would be a dream come true. I've got to work Madison Square Garden. I've got to work AEW pay-per-views, New Japan pay-per-views.

1975
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:55,360
The Disney in-resort TV would just absolutely be the top of the top.

1976
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:01,840
I've got to work with Gideon Diego. You would think maybe you couldn't top that.

1977
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:05,840
No, he was very nice. I shouldn't joke. He was a very nice man.

1978
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:15,840
But yeah, I would approach it with a little pep in my step. I don't know that I'm for the dads, but one of the strange things in these videos, they're hyper-inclusive.

1979
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:26,320
Even to the 81 video, there's women playing tennis, which I didn't think because of our cultural norms was shown on TV until 2015.

1980
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:32,320
DeSantis would have stopped it. That's now illegal again. For a brief window, it was allowed.

1981
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:40,320
And there's men doing childcare, which again, in 1983, not a thing that was in the zeitgeist.

1982
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:50,800
And there's people of color interacting with one another, which again, you'd be surprised, not something that was shown on network television often, even through 1981.

1983
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:58,800
So these in-resort TVs were very ahead of their time. They were culturally relevant. They were very progressive.

1984
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:04,800
I think our friend Ron would probably say that the woke mind virus was infecting the Disney resort TV at the time.

1985
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:13,280
But it's something now that you can look back on. And it was pretty cool that they were on the right path.

1986
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:21,280
And something to be nostalgic for just was accounting for all of the folks that could and would come to Disney.

1987
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:25,280
Was it driven by money? Absolutely. They wanted to get everybody of every...

1988
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,280
Sometimes it works out that way.

1989
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,280
Right.

1990
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:37,760
The people putting the videos together, these are wonderfully made. There's wonderfully shot footage throughout them still to this day.

1991
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:43,760
They're wonderfully made, wonderfully edited, great music, great performances. We like all our...

1992
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:53,760
Everybody from Susan to Stacey. Sure, they're getting the marching orders from the evil entity that wants you to spend as much as possible.

1993
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,760
But there's some hearts within the assignment in these, I think.

1994
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:00,240
Sure.

1995
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:04,240
100%. And Mike, to get back to your question, I would put my heart and soul into it.

1996
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:14,240
I would study the greats. I would study Susan. I would study Stacey. I would study Dennis Marsico, the host of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in MGM Studios.

1997
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:26,240
I would call JD Roth. I'd try and connect with him on LinkedIn and give me his best delivery tips on how to convey what time is the best time to go to the Hoop-Dee-Doo review.

1998
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:32,720
And really, what time is the best time to go to the Virgin Megastore, even though I'm RIP.

1999
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:34,720
Yeah, yeah.

2000
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:44,720
And I would listen. I would soul search. I might do that thing Aaron Rodgers did where he went into a place of seclusion and was not connectable by anybody.

2001
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:50,720
To really just feel resort TV in my heart.

2002
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:57,200
Look, this, if anybody's listening to this from the Disney corporate, like you've proven, I think by now that you're the guy for the job, I think.

2003
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:59,200
Thank you.

2004
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:07,200
So, yeah, I mean, they're obviously knowing you're going to do the work. You already have, they know you have the chops and now they know you have the passion.

2005
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,200
Yeah, that was.

2006
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,200
I appreciate that.

2007
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:15,200
That little speech was beautiful. I think we have elevated what we've been talking about this whole time in a wonderful way.

2008
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:23,680
I think the last thing before we go out is like, feel free to just like, okay, my question is, of course you would do it with passion and conviction.

2009
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:27,680
But is there like, you know, there's recurring things in all of these videos.

2010
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:33,680
It's always the same, you know, like climb aboard a doom buggy and take a trip to the 990.

2011
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:41,680
Like there's like recurring almost like the same things are said no matter what year it is about the rides or about like the nightlife heating up at Pleasure Island.

2012
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:44,160
Do you have anything in mind that you would like to tell people about?

2013
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:52,160
I want to tell everybody in every Disney World Hotel about this thing and I might do it this way.

2014
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:54,160
And if you don't have anything, I have copy I can give you.

2015
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:56,160
But feel free.

2016
01:41:56,160 --> 01:42:04,160
I would love to tell folks in extremely broken Spanish and German about the pavilions that they could go see.

2017
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:12,640
That would be so broken that it might be charming, but also broken enough that they think I might be being disrespectful.

2018
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:22,640
So yeah, there's one or two videos where it's like they say a food dish you can get at each pavilion and they're doing some voices.

2019
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:24,640
But we're not going to throw around names here.

2020
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,640
We're not going to throw around names.

2021
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,640
It wasn't Susan.

2022
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,640
I know that Susan, not my dear Susan.

2023
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:39,120
I would love to hear from you about respect, sensitivity, everything that you would bring to this job, which we hope maybe we've given you a good audition here.

2024
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,120
And what a delightful thing to talk to you about for a while.

2025
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,120
Ian Riccobani, you survived podcast The Ride.

2026
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,120
What a pleasure to have you.

2027
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,120
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2028
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:49,120
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2029
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:51,120
Sure.

2030
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:53,120
I would love to plug Ring of Honor.

2031
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:55,120
That's kind of my home base, home promotion.

2032
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:59,120
If you like professional wrestling, Ring of Honor is pretty bare bones.

2033
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:05,600
To quote the great Richard Christie who once called the wrestling show, it's about the wrestling in Ring of Honor.

2034
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,600
So we have a lot of fun there.

2035
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,600
I'm on New Japan World quite often, which is another Japanese wrestling promotion.

2036
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,600
Quite fun.

2037
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:19,600
Every Wednesday night on TBS and every Friday night on TNT, AEW is on.

2038
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,600
And occasionally I pop in and say hello there.

2039
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,600
I do get excited though.

2040
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,600
I get passionate.

2041
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,600
And I wish, I just wish maybe there was some...

2042
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,080
Scott, you mentioned you had some copy.

2043
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,080
Well, oh.

2044
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:36,080
Ian, you might be going, I think you might be going somewhere that was interesting to me.

2045
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,080
I think. Is that where you're, are we on the same page here?

2046
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,080
Yes, okay.

2047
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,080
I think so.

2048
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:46,080
Well, real quick, I just wanted to say too, you can get, Ring of Honor is on Honor, is it HonorClub.com?

2049
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,080
Is that right?

2050
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,080
It's HonorClub.com, watchroh.com is how I remember it.

2051
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,080
Gotcha.

2052
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,080
And you get the Ring of Honor app, it'll take you right there.

2053
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,080
Yes.

2054
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:02,560
And it's like a stalling history, Samoa Joe, CM Punk, Brian Danielson, everybody that's ever been anybody has come through Ring of Honor, yep.

2055
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,560
Yes, yes.

2056
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,560
But yes, so I texted Ian earlier today, because I had an idea.

2057
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:14,560
And I wanted to put his particular skills, not to the test, I just wanted to show off.

2058
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:18,560
And there's a thing on the podcast that's come up a few times now.

2059
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,560
We did a second gate on something called the Hyperspace Hoopla.

2060
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:33,040
And it is, of course, a dance off with Star Wars characters where you would see that modern songs would play and Darth Maul would twerk or whatever.

2061
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:37,040
And something happens at the end of the video that we sort of had a bit of a debate about.

2062
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,040
A certain character appears.

2063
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:45,040
Jason and I were a little bit more on the side of the audience who seemed shocked that this is what had actually happened.

2064
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:51,040
And Scott was a little more skeptical because he said, well, this character is in the parks already. What's the big deal about it?

2065
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:55,520
I did not view it as the finest live theatrical moment ever assembled.

2066
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,520
Right.

2067
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:03,520
But so I thought, you know what, Ian does play by play for professional wrestling.

2068
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:07,520
And I thought maybe if he added his voice to this clip, it would be a little more clear.

2069
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:15,520
You would feel the excitement more because he does this very often when he has to set, you know, somebody runs down a ramp and you didn't know they were going to be there.

2070
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,520
He adds that bit of excitement.

2071
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:26,000
So I sent him this clip and I said, would you do us the honor of essentially calling this part of the hyperspace hoopla?

2072
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
And Brett, if you could, it says dance. It says dance at the start of the clip.

2073
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Should we close it out with this?

2074
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Should I say the boring stuff?

2075
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Oh yeah, let's do that.

2076
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
For us, you can find us on the socials at Podcast the Ride.

2080
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:56,480
Now that that's out of the way, let's let's go out on the true order of the day.

2081
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,480
I'm very excited for this.

2082
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:00,480
OK, OK, here we go.

2083
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:04,480
And we're starting here with Queen Amidala and Princess Leia dancing.

2084
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:10,960
And here we go. Queen Amidala, Princess Leia, Gangnam Style.

2085
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:18,960
Here you see the most iconic cantina, the Gamorria Guard, Darth Vader in the house with the stormtroopers.

2086
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:20,960
I see a Tusken Raider. Things are getting wild.

2087
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:24,960
Darth Maul there with the Royal Guard.

2088
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,960
And we are really getting down now.

2089
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,960
We are moving. We are shaking.

2090
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,960
But what is this?

2091
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,960
Wait just a minute.

2092
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,440
Could it be? Yes, there he is.

2093
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:37,440
The big man himself.

2094
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,440
The mouse is in the house.

2095
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:43,440
Mickey Mouse, the one true Jedi bracing us with his presence here.

2096
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,440
And he's getting down.

2097
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,440
He's getting down at hyperspace hoopla.

2098
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,440
Mickey Mouse in the house.

2099
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:53,440
M-O-U-S-E.

2100
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,440
Wow.

2101
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:59,440
Channeling Michael Jackson as he points to the sky.

2102
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:03,920
What a way to end things here today on Podcast the Ride.

2103
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,920
Unbelievable.

2104
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,920
Forever.

2105
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:09,920
