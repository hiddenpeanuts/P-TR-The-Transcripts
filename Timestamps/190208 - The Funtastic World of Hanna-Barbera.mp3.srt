00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
Hi, I'm Lindy Katye.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,920
And I'm Kelli Nugent, and we co-host the podcast Teen Creeps.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,160
We talk about YA Pulp Fiction, but this week we took a little detour

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,720
to talk about the 1996 classic The Craft.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,200
And we were joined by our movie expert, Oscar Montoya.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,760
Yes, yes. Hi guys, thanks for having me.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
So fun. We covered a lot.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,560
We talked about how Ski-O-Rick is hot now for some of us,

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,080
but also maybe this is the last time we'll ever podcast together.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,800
We talked about what we would do if we had the power of manna within us.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,600
We talked about the real black girl magic, which is never aging.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,920
We talked about how the scariest part of kissing someone is if you are wearing a heavy lip

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,520
and the lipstick is gone after you kiss.

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,480
We talked about wet pet San Pablo.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,000
We talked about Frieza Balth being truly a goddess.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,280
Legendary.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,000
So if any of that appeals to you, which it does and should and also does,

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,080
you should check us out this week on Teen Creeps right here on the Forever Dog

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,600
podcast network, wherever you get your podcasts.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
Keep it creepy.

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,520
Forever. Dog.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,040
Warning. The following episode contains a mercurial casino magnate, a guest crushing parade,

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,880
dozens of animals wearing neckties and two elderly men in sweaters playing God with their pencils.

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,040
Yabba Dabba Doo.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,560
It's the Fantastic World of Hanna Barbera on Podcast The Ride.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:07,600
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by Mike Carlson, Scott Garner

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,920
and Elroy Jetson himself, Jason Sheridan.

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's get it out of the way.

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,120
See, I thought you were going to go with a line about a double decker salami and cheese sandwich.

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,880
I could have done that.

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,680
That's something that he's after in the show.

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,600
In the pre-show, Yogi is eyeing a guy's sandwich in the queue line.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,880
It's tempting to say you have boo boo aspects, but I think Yogi has the greater hunger.

34
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,200
So you have to merge some characters to make it work.

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,120
And I am a little peckish.

36
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,520
So I've said to your that you're a peckish.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,720
I describe you as that.

38
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,220
Yes.

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,240
Yeah, I enjoyed that.

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,960
That's great.

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,460
Okay.

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,600
I felt a little bit like blunt, but I got like I was trying to be clever or something.

43
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,680
I'm like, I'll just call Jason Elroy.

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Don't stop there, Mr. Barbera.

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,520
Yeah, I know.

46
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,080
Well, thanks so much for Mike for drawing both of us at the

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,000
before we started recording.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,500
Sure.

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,320
Filling in our body and using the paintbrush that contains all of the colors.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,040
Of course.

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,920
But not erasing us because then you would get a lawsuit from the Looney Tunes,

52
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360
Warner Brothers animation for that gimmick.

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
You're talking about like the...

54
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,120
There's that one where they draw Daffy Duck and then they erase a little.

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,440
Oh, the famous one.

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,080
I see, yes.

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,720
The cartoon where it is coloring in.

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,920
Yeah, well, we're talking about some gags that are in the pre-show of today's topic,

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,120
the funtastic world of Hanna Barbera.

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
And I'll go ahead and tell you guys right now,

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,520
the vast majority of what I have to talk about is the pre-show.

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm very pre-show focused.

63
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,760
Yeah, the pre-show is the more interesting part of the ride.

64
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,880
To me.

65
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,680
No, but I would agree with you because I spent a lot more time looking at that.

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
I watched the ride itself, which is a 3D ride.

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,040
It's very universalish in its tricks and its 3D simulator type thing.

68
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,800
But it's fine.

69
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,520
It's fine.

70
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,020
Yeah.

71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,680
All right, everybody, we're going on a fine ride today.

72
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,360
I got very interested in the history of the company, Hanna Barbera,

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,440
because they really saw every iteration of animation in America,

74
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,760
like post-war, I guess even some pre-war or some during the war America.

75
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,320
Well, that's all news to me.

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,160
This will be stuff that I don't know.

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,120
But really fast before we get into all that, Jason, you're talking about studios and lawsuits.

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,320
There's a big thing going on right now that I wanted to address that our listeners might

79
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,040
not know about.

80
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,360
A little bit less smooth of an agreement than the one between Universal Studios and Hanna Barbera.

81
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,920
I'm talking about something that's going on right now with a place called Fox World, Malaysia.

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,560
Malaysia.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,880
This is a really fun story that's fun for us to listen to, probably not fun.

84
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,360
Less fun for the residents of Kuala Lumpur.

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,960
Or an hour or so outside of it, which is where this park is being built.

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,400
We're going to have to put the pause button on what exactly is going on,

87
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,080
because I think nobody's sure at this point what's going on.

88
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,760
But yeah, this is intended to be the first Fox theme park in the world.

89
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
They've licensed their properties to other things, but they've never specifically made

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,520
an entire Fox World.

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:55,040
In 2013, they set out to do so and reached out to a company called Genting, Resorts World Genting.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,320
The list of what they have done is very long.

93
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,640
There's a ton of, but it's mostly international stuff.

94
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,360
In Singapore, I believe they are mostly owned or entirely on Universal in Singapore.

95
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,680
Here in America, they own the Fox Woods Casino.

96
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,480
Norwegian Cruises, they're ultimately the parent company.

97
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,320
But they're mainly like a casino entity.

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:32,160
And their main, their most ambitious campus is in the mountains up above Kuala Lumpur.

99
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,600
You have to take essentially what's the Disney thing, the Skyliner.

100
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,360
It's those kind of cars to get up into the mountains.

101
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,160
The gondola.

102
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,120
The gondolas, yeah.

103
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,000
To get to this magical world of a giant casino.

104
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,040
There's indoor skiing up there.

105
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:57,840
There's already an indoor theme park there called Skytropolis, which is confusing that a sky

106
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,760
themed park would have a roof on it, but that's what they went with.

107
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
They have the void there.

108
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,640
There's all kinds of crazy stuff, but the crown jewel of it was to be Fox World Malaysia.

109
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,640
However, in the last few months, it has all fallen apart with a series of lawsuits that

110
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,920
goes both ways.

111
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,120
Fox v. Genting, Genting v. Fox.

112
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,400
And we were passing this link around because of a couple pretty interesting details of what

113
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,440
Fox is alleging.

114
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,040
Feel free to say what I mean.

115
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,960
I can say, well, I just the variety article has a wonderful sentence in it where it says,

116
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,920
in a counter lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Fox alleges that the project was doomed

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,880
by Lim Kok The, the mercurial chairman of Casino Conglomerate Genting Malaysia Bearhead.

118
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,160
Now, who among us has not been fooled or tricked by the mercurial Lim Kok The?

119
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,880
They say he's been around for thousands of years, inhabiting new bodies and being reincarnated,

120
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,800
tricking people left and right.

121
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,000
It was just a little like I sometimes like the journalistic language of like these dry

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,080
reporting articles end up with these weird turn of phrases where it's like, yes, that is not too

123
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,200
judgmental.

124
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,760
That's it seems quote unquote objective, but like the mercurial chairman really makes him sound

125
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,560
mischievous.

126
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,320
The Mercurial Malaysian Casino Chairman Lim Kok The you think has a ring to it that it's hard

127
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
to be objective about, right?

128
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,280
Yeah, it's well, you know, this brings me to my bigger point, which is that we came across

129
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,440
an article that is very much on the Fox side of things, presumably because it was in a

130
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
Hollywood trade.

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,480
So they're going to take the side of the studio and the evidence they present admittedly is does

132
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
not look good for Resorts World Genting.

133
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,320
Some of the things that they said that the lawsuit alleges is that there are cars on some

134
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,240
rides with bubbling paint.

135
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,640
It's set to open by the way, they've pushed back the date it was going to open several

136
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:06,880
times.

137
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,760
The original goal was like fall 2017.

138
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,840
Now, and then they just kept keep kicking it down the curve was maybe looking like February

139
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,680
2019, clearly not going to happen.

140
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
So bubbling paint on a car is a problem.

141
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
There was a ride built without an emergency exit.

142
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,960
That's my favorite detail.

143
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,680
Even though all of the plans that they had looked at contained the emergency exit, somehow

144
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,240
they're walking around the physical space and there is not one.

145
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,960
Well, the bubbling paint, they just call Pixar peering it.

146
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
We allow it when it's companies we trust.

147
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,520
Sure.

148
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,800
They at least built emergency exit.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
Well, those were the last we've ever had to try one.

150
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
They were already there.

151
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,920
They didn't have to build new ones.

152
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,320
When are they going to plus up the emergency exit?

153
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,680
They need to add Garland's voice to the Midway Maniac.

154
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,400
This way!

155
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,200
You can do it!

156
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,680
They I would think that we should do an episode on emergency exits is a certain point.

157
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:01,920
Maybe.

158
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:01,920


159
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:01,920


160
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:01,920


161
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,080
Maybe.

162
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,160
Maybe.

163
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,240
Maybe.

164
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,320
Maybe.

165
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,400
Maybe.

166
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,480
Maybe.

167
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,560
Maybe.

168
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,720
Maybe.

169
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:02,800
Maybe.

170
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,120
Maybe.

171
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,520
Maybe.

172
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:03,600
Maybe.

173
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:03,680
Maybe.

174
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:03,760
Maybe.

175
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,080
Maybe.

176
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,160
Maybe.

177
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,560
That episode is not forced by some traumatic events that we participate in.

178
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,680
That would be an important one.

179
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,080
Let's make it our decision when we do the emergency exit.

180
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,520
The between trampling.

181
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,960
Oh, no.

182
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,000
This is too real.

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I feel like it's extremely possible.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,480
Yeah.

185
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,280
Will Star Wars Galaxy's Edge make it a year without a death?

186
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,360
I don't think the ad ad is going to fall on anybody.

187
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,160
It's just sure correct.

188
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,440
The rides don't seem like they're that dangerous.

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
But the massive humanity, yes, very.

190
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,520
Yeah.

191
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,840
Yeah.

192
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,720
Extremely possible.

193
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
Will it be us?

194
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Could it be us?

195
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,440
Time will tell.

196
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,040
It wouldn't be the worst way to go.

197
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,560
At least I got to see half of a fake cliff.

198
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,760
But I didn't make it in.

199
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,920
But and then, well, I'll save my my two favorite things for last.

200
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
Amazingly, this is not my favorite shitty detail.

201
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,400
A ride called Scrat's Nutty Adventure based on Ice Age was built with visible

202
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,720
patchwork on the mountain facade, not Galaxy's Edge quality.

203
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:04,880
No.

204
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:14,880
And then also there were parade floats built that were so wide that spectators would not

205
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
fit on the sidewalk.

206
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,360
It's amazing.

207
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,120
This is so great.

208
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,840
And the problem was flagged, apparently.

209
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,360
They said, isn't that going to be too wide?

210
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,160
Hey, don't worry.

211
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,080
And then they brought them in and they did fit down the street.

212
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,400
Yes.

213
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,200
But without any room for anyone to stand on the street.

214
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,880
And I think in the legal document, by the way, I read both legal documents.

215
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,720
Not word for word.

216
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,640
There's a lot of legalese in there.

217
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,240
I'll go to law school and then be able to fully comprehend it.

218
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,560
But but seeing that explain that, like, you know, there was no room for spectators,

219
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,720
thus defeating the purpose of a parade.

220
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,400
So I'd seen that in the legal document, but I also enjoyed imagining, like,

221
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,160
look, honey, here comes the parade.

222
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,760
Oh, God.

223
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,400
No.

224
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,720
No, what was do we know what the float was?

225
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,240
I don't know.

226
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,120
I mean, it's something Fox affiliated.

227
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
So it could have been.

228
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,240
I'm hoping, OK, there were going to be things in this park centered around the film epic,

229
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,680
an epic features my favorite character, my favorite anime character of the last decade,

230
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,840
the famous Nimlu voiced by Steven Tyler, which I may have talked about before.

231
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,400
If I haven't, there's this EPK that I love where he where Steven Tyler says,

232
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,160
I've always wanted to be one of those animated characters.

233
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,840
I got my wish.

234
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,240
I'm I'm Nimlu.

235
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,280
And then he scats for a while.

236
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,560
Which one was epic?

237
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,720
I only know it because I saw it randomly in a hotel room.

238
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:00,800
It oh, well, the characters I watched a press conference of the announcing Fox World Malaysia

239
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,800
and a bunch of characters come out and a voiceover person is like, please welcome Scrat from Rio.

240
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,880
You know, Pepe.

241
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
I don't know who's in Rio.

242
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,920
And then like and then the leaf soldiers from Epic.

243
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,280
Oh, I do know this.

244
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,840
I forgot one of my things at my old job.

245
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:27,200
I used to have to put like master archival digital copies of 20th century

246
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,160
Fox under multiple levels of encryption on hard drives to ship across the city.

247
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,640
I don't quite know why they weren't sending these digitally,

248
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,560
but I remember Epic in a dozen different languages.

249
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,560
So anyone got if anyone found out what happened to each leaf soldier

250
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,280
before the events of Epic played out.

251
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,760
So what I think maybe like they were the park didn't has not opened,

252
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,400
but there was a strong risk of a child suffocating on the Nimlu's big foot.

253
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,240
So you can't open a park in those conditions.

254
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,960
And then finally, the one I actually grazed over this, Jason,

255
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,240
but you pointed out the best detail in the article, which is the the show.

256
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,680
Oh, yeah.

257
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,120
That there was I'll just read from the legal document

258
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,760
demonstrating how little thought it gave to the integrity of Fox's intellectual property.

259
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,320
Genting proposed taking some of Fox's most significant science fiction film properties,

260
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,520
Alien Predator and Alien versus Predator,

261
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,360
and using the main characters in a cruise ship style dance show

262
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,840
featuring a dancing alien and predator.

263
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,600
I mean, there's so many levels, one that they're concerned about the

264
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,800
integrity of alien and predator and alien versus predator.

265
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,720
We all know Alien versus Predator.

266
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
There is no film with higher integrity,

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
more integrity per second than in anything else committed to celluloid.

268
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,880
And the other thing, what is the phrase cruise ship style dance show?

269
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Now I have been on one cruise in my life, actually a Norwegian cruise line cruise

270
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,000
many, many years ago.

271
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,040
No, Genting thanks you.

272
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,320
And I don't I guess it would just be like, all right,

273
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,120
we're going to have a dance contest and maybe limbo and maybe like people join along.

274
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,560
Oh my God, like a conga line with the predator.

275
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,680
With the predator.

276
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,000
I mean, that's all I can think of.

277
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,200
When they say cruise ship, doesn't that mean like kind of almost a review type show where

278
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,040
it's not a full Broadway production?

279
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,240
Oh, that's possible.

280
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,960
Yeah, I see.

281
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,160
It's the greatest hit.

282
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,200
That's sort of what I think.

283
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,000
But maybe I'm wrong.

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,480
Who knows?

285
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
I think Disney's trying to do more like full musicals on the cruises.

286
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,000
But so would have been like a history of Broadway as done via Alien versus Predator.

287
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,960
The xenomorph.

288
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,720
The xenomorph sings, we're in the money.

289
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,600
He like picks up the like the fit like in 40 seconds treat picks up and like, oh gosh,

290
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,560
it's a nickel.

291
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
And that's how they go.

292
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,760
We were in the money.

293
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,640
The xenomorph would have sung like would have like like,

294
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,720
like because it never has a voice in the movies.

295
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,160
That's true.

296
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,560
So they have just done a fun, funny voice.

297
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,920
I bet you could fake it.

298
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,920
I bet it would start like that and then clear, clear it's the road.

299
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,120
And then it's got a beautiful.

300
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,960
Oh, slime in there.

301
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,440
Sorry.

302
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
One chorus line of people.

303
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,280
Right at the moment, the little mouth comes out and sings, we've got a lot of what it takes.

304
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Holy shit, you should be writing this.

305
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,720
Yeah, the idea that this was going to be a bad show.

306
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,320
No, yeah.

307
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,760
Get over yourselves.

308
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,360
This would have been great.

309
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,320
Every every it would have been viral.

310
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,840
People would have been talking about it.

311
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,360
Yeah, the audience would standing ovation for the little mouth.

312
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,960
Alien and Predator doing the floss dance, hitting the dab.

313
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,000
I mean, people would have been losing their minds.

314
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,360
I got like all of this.

315
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,480
So many of the stuff we talked about and liked and like the commentary we did on the parade.

316
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,680
It's like so much of that is fallen by the wayside because companies are concerned about the

317
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,720
integrity of their intellectual property.

318
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,560
It is so boring.

319
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:20,800
Yeah.

320
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,600
Bullshit.

321
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,800
I'm a big proponent of the Star Wars holiday special.

322
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,520
I wish things were that fun ever.

323
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,880
I mean, does it suck?

324
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,040
Yeah, but it's such a blast.

325
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,960
I don't want to weigh in either way.

326
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,160
I don't hate the new movies or the prequels as much as anybody, you know, whatever.

327
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,880
I will say this.

328
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,520
I would rather watch the Star Wars holiday special than any of one through three or seven and eight.

329
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,760
Or solo a Star Wars story.

330
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,260
Sure.

331
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,140
I don't think we'll ever have a fun Star Wars movie ever.

332
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,660
I don't think it'll ever happen.

333
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,020
I'm making damn sure.

334
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,380
If they did a holiday overlay of Galaxy's Edge, of Life Day, of the Wookiee Holiday

335
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,100
life, people would lose their minds.

336
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,860
Like doing like just a purposefully kind of campy, like just for this, we know that it's

337
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,140
a little silly.

338
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,980
I mean, look what Spider-Verse did.

339
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,060
Spider-Verse had fun.

340
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,380
They put the fun on to Spider-Damn.

341
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,580
He gets to have fun.

342
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,140
But Miles Morales can still be vaguely serious.

343
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,420
They need to like find like if there was a if just for the holidays, Cantina overlay of Life Day.

344
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,140
Of course.

345
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,180
And it's a little like it's a little show over in the corner.

346
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,420
Yeah, that would be wonderful.

347
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:36,980
I don't know.

348
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,060
I think Star Wars is going to have to really had it like money wise, head into the toilet

349
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,260
before we get fun stuff.

350
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,420
Yeah, they have to like be throwing everything at the wall.

351
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,340
Yeah, because that's when fun stuff happens, which I have a perfect transition back to

352
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,620
Hanna Barbera, but I don't know.

353
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,900
Are we done talking about Malaysia?

354
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,940
I forgot a tiny bit more.

355
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,060
Yeah, let's go more.

356
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,260
Then I'll remind me of how good the transition would have been.

357
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,980
OK.

358
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,820
OK, so we'll go up and keep going with Malaysia.

359
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,060
I'm still going to give you the transition point.

360
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,540
Well, yeah, maybe give it to me again or whatever.

361
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,820
We'll keep talking about Fox Malaysia.

362
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,180
OK, well, you know, there's not much more to say other than just a couple points.

363
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,420
I it was, as I said, very one sided seemed like Genting's problem.

364
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,860
However, Genting was the first to sue Fox.

365
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:27,300
And I read that legal document and what that paints is a picture of a giant conglomerate

366
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,580
that is not being responsive, that's not being helpful, that's not giving like

367
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,380
style guides of characters and logos.

368
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,660
They didn't even like send a proper 3D rendering of what the 20th century Fox

369
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,620
you know, the sign with the searchlights.

370
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,500
That was going to be the big fountain at the entrance.

371
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,900
They didn't send like the specs on that.

372
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,940
So it got built weird because they had deadlines to hit.

373
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,300
And they were like, this is wrong.

374
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,060
Well, why didn't you send us anything?

375
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,780
And they'd, you know, like they'd say things like this character is too chubby

376
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:06,420
or this shade of yellow is too saturated, but then not provide the proper color to use instead

377
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
or presiding more precise direction.

378
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,380
If anyone listening has ever dealt with a major company of Fox level and can imagine

379
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,060
that company being very disorganized and unhelpful, I can believe this very easily.

380
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,460
Oh, yeah.

381
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,740
Putting all of the blame on this place and like noting things to there's all this stuff

382
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,060
where they like rejected an entire attraction design because they didn't like where the

383
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:35,220
AC unit went or they'd go like, where are the speakers going?

384
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,100
And they were like, well, we don't address that to like three months down the line.

385
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:44,020
Rejected. So the park being a disaster and not opening for many, many months, very,

386
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:51,220
very possibly due to Fox like incompetence and and things like them saying we want a

387
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,580
Percy Jackson ride.

388
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,620
And they thought of a Percy Jackson ride and then changed their mind and said,

389
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,660
never mind. We wanted this to be an Independence Day ride.

390
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,180
Not an easy change to make.

391
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,540
However, it would have resulted in the attraction Independence Day defiance.

392
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,820
Hell of a ride.

393
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,500
I want that ride, whatever that is.

394
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,900
Well, and so let me tell you then, like this whole thing, this is beyond just like,

395
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,740
you know, as a couple attraction, this is like a 25 attractions, at least.

396
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,220
And about a year ago, we did a whole like what if there was a Fox theme park?

397
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,980
Thanks to the Disney merger, a lot of it was going to be there.

398
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,180
There's alien rides.

399
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,260
There's something called Aliens Terra Forma.

400
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,660
There's the epic hummingbird flyer.

401
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,980
There's ESD Global Defenders.

402
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,020
You of course know that in the second Independence Day, ESD stands for Earth

403
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,220
Space Defenders.

404
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,420
Yeah, we all know that.

405
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,660
I watched that.

406
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,260
I watched that movie all the way through.

407
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,740
And it's not great.

408
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:55,300
Once the giant alien starts chasing the school bus driven by Judd Hirsch around the desert.

409
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,420
Hurry, Judd.

410
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,140
Hurry, Judd.

411
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,540
As we go back to Area 51.

412
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,340
Is that what the ride is?

413
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,180
You're on the school bus with Judd Hirsch?

414
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,780
I mean, can you imagine?

415
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,740
Oh, man.

416
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,260
There's a robot Judd Hirsch driving a bus and then you have to load onto it.

417
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,940
That would be amazing.

418
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,740
And he has to keep like breaking and adjusting his glasses and popping heart medicine.

419
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,860
Talking about his son, David.

420
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,980
He's very impressive.

421
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,340
He knows everything about cable.

422
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,140
I wish he was around now, but we didn't get the license for him.

423
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,300
There was a ride called Big Weld's Zeppelins.

424
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,060
You know, Big Weld, guys, obviously, Mel Brooks's Carrick beloved.

425
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,820
A CEO character from Robots.

426
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,700
Oh, of course.

427
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,900
You're going to meet Big Weld.

428
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,060
There was a Planet of the Apes thing.

429
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:48,180
There was a big water show called the Century City Lake Spectacular.

430
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
There's no lake in the real Century City.

431
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,500
What could that be based on?

432
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,780
Don't know.

433
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,260
The general notion of Century City existing.

434
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,180
And a Night at the Museum shooting game.

435
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,660
Their midway mania was for Night at the Museum.

436
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,580
So all of this stuff was getting prepared.

437
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,380
And I'm sorry, there's more here than I even realized.

438
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,660
There was going to be, OK, let me spell this out.

439
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,020
A ride built by the company Dynamic Attractions.

440
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,020
And what this was going to be was very much a Radiator Springs Racers.

441
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,540
And it's even in like a canyon area, which they have built.

442
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,100
There is this fully built canyon and a track on top of a hill in Malaysia.

443
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:35,540
And it was going to have this special type of ride vehicle that can do jumps and is articulated.

444
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,940
What I'm saying is this is the Donkey Kong ride vehicle.

445
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,060
And it was going to open there first for a ride based on Sons of Anarchy.

446
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,820
Yeah, I mean, that's not a bad idea, honestly.

447
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,020
But yeah, and they built this entire canyon.

448
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,420
This is Ice Age Mountain, like a coaster that goes in and out of the mountain.

449
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,060
Yeah, the concept already is cool on the Ice Age.

450
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,300
Thing I would love to ride the Sons of Anarchy,

451
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,940
Colin riding down this road, e-ticket attraction like that.

452
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,900
The name I don't know.

453
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,620
I'm guessing that's the first lyric of the theme song.

454
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,300
I mean, that is crazy.

455
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:21,620
This dynamic attractions, not a dog like a two bit dog and put it's a real themed entertainment.

456
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,460
Yeah, design company.

457
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,780
I think this park was going to be good.

458
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,540
It seems like claustrophobic, like it's jammed into a very small space.

459
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,580
But there's overheads.

460
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:36,260
And what's so crazy is these gondolas have been passing over the construction area for months.

461
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,220
So anybody can get up there, take pictures of this thing.

462
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,820
And it looks better than California Adventure did on day one.

463
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,060
So anyway, what ends up happening is Fox is not happy with the quality of things,

464
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,580
but Genting is blaming them.

465
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,260
And I don't know.

466
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,700
I hear what they're saying.

467
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,540
They seems like Fox was kind of difficult.

468
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,260
And then suddenly Disney swoops in.

469
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,220
We're buying Fox.

470
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,780
Wait a minute.

471
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,180
Sorry, you're building a theme park with a casino company in a casino,

472
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,300
like next to a casino in a casino town.

473
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,100
I don't think so because apparently I didn't know this.

474
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,620
Disney has a lot of problems with casinos in general and has tried to push them out of Orlando

475
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,860
and anywhere near Disney Park.

476
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,700
Yeah, they're part of a massive like group in Orlando trying to keep casinos out.

477
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,820
Oh, really?

478
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,940
Of Disney and various other businesses trying to keep them out.

479
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,420
I see.

480
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,580
Are there casinos on the Disney cruise ships?

481
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,740
I bet not.

482
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,700
I would have to think not.

483
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,660
I guess not.

484
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,900
But most cruise ships usually do have them.

485
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,100
Do we know why Disney is trying to keep the casinos out?

486
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,740
I would imagine there has to be some sort of reason of like,

487
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,060
it's not some altruistic reason.

488
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,820
It's probably some reason of like.

489
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,340
I would think optics at the very least of like Mickey Mouse,

490
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,380
like Mickey Mouse on tokens or Mickey Mouse.

491
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,180
Oh, well, I understand like not having a Disney family thing.

492
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,740
But I mean, like just having casinos around.

493
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,100
They don't have.

494
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,180
It's not only that they don't want casinos around.

495
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,620
When they bought Star Wars and Lucasfilm, they got rid of all slot machines.

496
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,580
Oh, interesting.

497
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,860
Related to Star Wars.

498
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,900
So they want zero crossover to this area.

499
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,400
Okay.

500
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:13,860
I guess you're right.

501
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:19,540
So maybe it's morality, quote unquote, but it's yeah, I know it's got to be something more like,

502
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,180
you know, Orlando's case, they just don't want the competition

503
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,340
for people going there instead of Disney World.

504
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,580
Right.

505
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,860
But is it like the casinos then have to like,

506
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,300
we'll end up giving more like taxes to the local government?

507
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,860
You know what I mean?

508
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,220
Isn't there some there's I feel like there's always some secret reason of like,

509
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,620
if people swoop in all of a sudden, like those people are going to be giving the government taxes

510
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,380
and the Disney will have to pay like there's something.

511
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,140
Somehow it raises the wealth of the state and now the minimum wage goes up.

512
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,180
Or right.

513
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,780
There's some tricky thing in there.

514
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,820
That's what my guess is.

515
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,620
But I could be wrong.

516
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,940
Maybe it's just a holdover thing from years ago.

517
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,580
I think so.

518
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:59,060
So in order to uphold their family friendly morality, they have to break billion dollar

519
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,740
contracts and leave theme parks sit rotting on top of a mountain.

520
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,140
So there's all this back and forth.

521
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:13,780
And now what you have is a fully built, good looking theme park that's just like, well,

522
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,740
I don't know, we're going to keep building it and see what happens.

523
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:23,140
And it's a possibility that another company like Universal or maybe even Six Flags moves in

524
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,300
and just has like, you know, it's like moving into a house.

525
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,900
You didn't have to pay for the construction of.

526
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,980
Is there a chance that it just becomes a freestyle music park?

527
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,620
Oh, man.

528
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,900
Well, if we keep going, I mean, come on.

529
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,220
Why?

530
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,460
Maybe this is the place to launch.

531
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,100
Well, yeah, Hard Rock Park 2.0.

532
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,060
Because, yeah, you could do like turn the sons of anarchy ride into the leader of the pack ride.

533
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,020
I think there's a lot of.

534
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,500
Change.

535
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:52,980
Change.

536
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,300
And it doesn't end too well, though.

537
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,660
That's not we could change.

538
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,100
I mean, happy and we're changing.

539
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,300
Or it's like toad and you end up in hell.

540
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,340
That's true.

541
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,060
Truthfully, I'm not quite sure how sons of anarchy ended.

542
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,460
I've only seen like stray episodes here or there.

543
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,340
Oh, but we don't.

544
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,380
We're leader of the packs.

545
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,180
The IP.

546
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,660
Yeah.

547
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,860
Your goal is to be not the leader of the pet.

548
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,300
You don't want to be the one who dies.

549
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,100
Yes, exactly.

550
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,300
So the unlike creator Springs racer, the loser dies.

551
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,060
But at least you get a song written about you.

552
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,100
And I also think with a mountain, with a coaster weaving in and out of it,

553
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,660
perfect place for Led Zeppelin the ride to.

554
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,060
Of course.

555
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,140
You've got all kind of in the mountains.

556
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,780
No, it's like like exactly.

557
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,460
But it's perfect for that.

558
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
And then you've already got a zeppelin ride.

559
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,140
You just convert.

560
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:40,980
What's his name?

561
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,180
Hotbot.

562
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,260
Mel Brooks, his character, the Brooks, a tron.

563
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,900
Big Weld.

564
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,620
Big Weld.

565
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,100
Thank you.

566
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,660
That's a zeppelin ride already.

567
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,700
Yeah, I think it's easy.

568
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,420
I think it's easy.

569
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,580
Let's get I mean, I know Bingkowski didn't buy.

570
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,540
He wasn't responsible for freestyle music,

571
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,580
but maybe he could put us in touch with the freestyle music.

572
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,700
Or no, no, wait, Bingkowski.

573
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,900
We got to get Bingkowski.

574
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,700
What am I saying?

575
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,540
Of course we got to get big house.

576
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,940
And you go and he's probably already like on top of a mountain in Malaysia.

577
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,500
He's like been living in solitude for five years.

578
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:14,980
Oh, yeah.

579
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,380
Meditating and like and, you know, perfecting his martial arts skills.

580
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,180
So he's going to be like, like, excuse me, are you are you John Bingkowski?

581
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
And he turns around like, yeah, right.

582
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,540
Like the nomad who like I used to be.

583
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,140
I haven't been for a long time.

584
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,340
That name in a lifetime.

585
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,980
Excuse me, sir.

586
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,260
Are you made of pure light?

587
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,740
Yes.

588
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,580
I've been up here meditating for so long.

589
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,700
I'm just pure energy.

590
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,100
I mean, I'm going to toss out a new generation ride

591
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,340
because it's perplexingly such a huge hit.

592
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,300
Bohemian Rhapsody ride just based on that one scene

593
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,100
that's been going around Twitter the last few days of like the they're at a restaurant

594
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,700
and there's just so many edits.

595
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,140
There's so many cut to everyone talking.

596
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,140
I know exactly what we are.

597
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,300
We're a band for outcasts and anyone who feels like an outcast

598
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,100
because we are outcasts ourselves.

599
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,620
What is this?

600
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,100
Boy, I don't this was this Oscar winning.

601
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,820
I don't know.

602
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,180
I still haven't watched it yet.

603
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,660
So you're saying I mean, one of is probably some other mountain that is, you know, it's

604
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,220
scaramuchas layer.

605
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,260
I don't know who's considered the villain of the song, but he mean rhapsody.

606
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,140
But you know, you meet all of them and you do.

607
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,940
And there's a dance show where you learn how to do the fan dango.

608
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,740
Well, it's a cruise ship style conga line.

609
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:45,300
And then you are turned around and given a mic stand and you have to do the live aid

610
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,020
performance.

611
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,500
Remember, you haven't played together in many years, although that's not true.

612
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,740
Now go maybe.

613
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,700
OK, instead of Alien versus Predator, how about Freddie Mercury?

614
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,700
Not Freddie, the villain of Freddie.

615
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,540
Freddie Mercury versus the villainous music executive Ray Foster.

616
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,180
Oh, he's played by Mike Myers, not a real person who existed in real life.

617
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:08,900
Oh, man.

618
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,220
Really?

619
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,980
There's fictional people in this, too.

620
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,140
Yeah.

621
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,420
And I'll get some greener when I get home.

622
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,940
No, no, I haven't seen any of it.

623
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,660
Oh, my God.

624
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,980
It's a composite character, to be fair to the movie.

625
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,900
Based on generally the idea of a bad executive that could exist.

626
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,860
Based partially on the real head of the record label and based partially on Chairman Lim

627
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,660
Cock-Thay, who also found time to say Mercurial.

628
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,540
Oh, wow.

629
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,780
You know, very Mercurial.

630
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,220
Freddie, I would say.

631
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:46,180
You know, every time like there's some funny business in the theme park world and there's

632
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,460
plenty of funny business in the domestic parks, the American parks.

633
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:56,020
I try not to, you know, I try to be cognizant of like a Western worldview.

634
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,980
And it's like, look, not every theme park outside of America is a scam.

635
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,340
There has been a number of scams.

636
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:10,020
That said, there's a big announcement recently about Lionsgate opening in Asia Park.

637
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,900
And I meant to tweet this out recently.

638
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:19,700
Have we seen any updates on that Times Square, Lionsgate thing from our very first episode?

639
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,980
I don't know.

640
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,700
So it seems like Lionsgate Asia further along than a Lionsgate Times Square.

641
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,740
This is the type of I think I said this on our text chain.

642
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,460
I said this is the type of project I imagine we could have a shot at designing.

643
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:40,500
Maybe not this level, but something overseas with some properties, like just some very rich

644
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,700
person like is fooled into somebody else by getting us.

645
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,620
And then we just designed the whole park and the whole thing falls apart very quickly.

646
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,300
Maybe like literally it opens and all the walls just collapse.

647
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,820
It's like they didn't hire any engineers.

648
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,700
They just hired us.

649
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,220
And then they like fly us out and we're like, oh, great.

650
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,420
We'll supervise the engineers.

651
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,620
And they're like, no, it's you three.

652
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,420
You're building it like something weird like that.

653
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,460
I do feel like that's possible where we get hired to do something.

654
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,020
Sure.

655
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,260
Yeah.

656
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,540
Well, that's what I said.

657
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,740
There was another, a smaller indoor thing that the Marvel theme thing that fell apart

658
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,180
in I believe Thailand.

659
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,780
And it seemed to mostly be like one or two simulators and then a large shop and some

660
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,820
very, very poorly made statues.

661
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,900
But it cost a lot to get in.

662
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,300
You had to pay essentially to get it.

663
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,940
You were essentially paying to go into a large store.

664
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,860
But a significant amount of money based on like this is what the average resident of

665
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,540
Thailand makes in a day.

666
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,460
You had to pay that to get into this glorified shopping experience or something.

667
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,060
They're like, well, it fell apart.

668
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,260
We don't know what happened.

669
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,740
And everyone else is like, yeah, we know what happened.

670
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,300
Sure.

671
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,580
There is something weirder about the foreign ones or that the universal Dubai where they

672
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,780
built only the gates and then none of the rest.

673
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,420
So it's just a field with the universal.

674
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:00,660
Okay.

675
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,460
So there's some pretty funny, really funny ones.

676
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,780
This is all episode down the line, like all of the bizarre collapses.

677
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,940
But yeah, not all of them are like they even the Fox lawsuit mentions how we trusted this

678
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,340
place, Genting, because they did a pretty good job with universal Singapore.

679
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,460
It's fairly well regarded.

680
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,460
So what happened here?

681
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,540
So Genting, we don't know exactly, no.

682
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,900
But Genting did a good job.

683
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,300
It's not.

684
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,900
Maybe they did a good job.

685
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,940
But on the flip side, you talk about us building the place.

686
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:36,820
According to this thing, buildings would get built like many feet taller than the facade

687
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,820
that they were stored in.

688
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,780
So that makes me feel like let us add it.

689
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,860
So yeah, I think we could build this thing.

690
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:49,060
Well, it seemed like they also too were kind of harkening back to the original Disney method

691
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,940
of like build it.

692
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,740
It doesn't work.

693
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,060
Okay.

694
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,700
Scrap it.

695
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,340
Rebuild it.

696
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,460
Like a little more finding it on your feet.

697
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:55,780
Yeah.

698
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,820
With construction, that's kind of a weird thing to say.

699
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,500
It's really weird because it seems like there are several buildings in this park that were

700
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,140
fully built.

701
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,580
They had complaints.

702
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,620
They had to tear it all down.

703
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,380
Still, Disney tries to repurpose a building instead of rebuilding it from scratch.

704
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,340
That's so weird.

705
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,740
Yeah.

706
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,180
How they have the money to just...

707
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,900
And there's a lot of the lawsuits that are going around are all like they're in the

708
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,180
billion dollar territory.

709
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,740
This is so much money we're talking about.

710
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,380
Uh-huh.

711
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,180
Next, don't make this mistake again.

712
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,380
Any other studio, call PTR Construction.

713
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,700
Us.

714
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:28,660
Yeah.

715
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,940
I mean, we've heard...

716
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,980
We get some rumblings.

717
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,460
We get some emails that some Imagineer types listen to the show.

718
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,100
But do any very rich, Saudi princes listen to the show?

719
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,180
Do any Mercurial leaders listen to the show?

720
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,460
If that's you and you want your own theme park and you want it to be designed by some

721
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,580
real experts, contact us at PodcastTheRide at gmail.com.

722
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,860
Our official email address.

723
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,740
Subject line.

724
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:05,220
I am a Nigerian billionaire prince interested in helping you with your endeavors.

725
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,020
I have 30 million dollars in a bank account for you.

726
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,140
PTR, come to Brazil.

727
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,060
Help us build Bolsonaro land.

728
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,780
Now, we'll let the offers slide in.

729
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,660
Let's open every email on all of our computers.

730
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,060
Viruses be damned.

731
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,420
Mike, that transition you were...

732
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:28,980
Take us to that transition.

733
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,020
That was 20 minutes ago.

734
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,380
DJ, run this back.

735
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,180
We were talking about how Star Wars wasn't going to be fun until it tanked.

736
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:42,180
The Hanna-Barbera characters are in this spot right now where they haven't been used in

737
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,980
interesting ways.

738
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,300
They just haven't been used in a while in any big media.

739
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,900
They've been used in interesting ways in the comics.

740
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,100
We talked a little bit about this before.

741
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,620
You had a copy of something that caught my eye on your table.

742
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:55,860
Yes.

743
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,300
It was a graphic novel where Snagglepuss is a gay playwright.

744
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,180
He's like a very like kind of...

745
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,980
Truman Capote type.

746
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,660
Truman Capote type.

747
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,340
Huckleberry Hound is gay in it and he's like his good friend.

748
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,180
It's like a very heavy...

749
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,380
It sounds like Snagglepuss.

750
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,740
You think it's going to be fun and silly, but it's a very heavy story.

751
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,140
It's good.

752
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,700
Wow.

753
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,500
There's a cool...

754
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,300
I haven't read it, but I suppose a cool Flintstones thing that I think Tom King wrote.

755
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,860
Yeah.

756
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,460
There's a Rough and Ready comic where it's like the Sunshine Boys.

757
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,820
Oh, that's great.

758
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,140
Really?

759
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,940
They were the stars of an old TV show and they're getting back together even though

760
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,820
they kind of hate each other, which I didn't realize Rough and Ready was the original Hanna-Barbera

761
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,460
TV show reading about this.

762
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:41,940
Oh, yeah.

763
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,660
Oh, interesting.

764
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,660
So Hanna-Barbera is in that spot right now where they haven't been...

765
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,220
There isn't like a big Hanna-Barbera movie in the last so many years.

766
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,020
No.

767
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,580
Yeah.

768
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,100
So let's have some fun with them.

769
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,740
Absolutely.

770
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,700
Why not?

771
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,740
Loosen those reins.

772
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,460
And I would love to take a crack at...

773
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,460
I was a big Hanna-Barbera kid because they made...

774
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,180
It's like 50 years this company making cartoons.

775
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:15,940
The rise of cable TV, I feel like the Hanna-Barbera stuff was just in syndication all the time.

776
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:24,980
Until it kind of all got vacuumed up by Turner and used as the backbone to start Cartoon Network

777
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:31,140
because the Hanna-Barbera cartoons were the main stuff on Cartoon Network and even,

778
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,380
I believe, helped Cartoon Network start to make their own original stuff like Johnny

779
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,340
Bravo and everything.

780
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,100
Let's just for...

781
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,020
In case there's kids listening that might not even know what Hanna-Barbera is,

782
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,500
let's list some of the main properties.

783
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,980
I mean, their first thing they created Tom and Jerry.

784
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,260
Is that right?

785
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,980
Is that right?

786
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,100
Yeah.

787
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,740
That's how they made their name, making the Tom and Jerry cartoons.

788
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,220
Oh my gosh.

789
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,620
So it wasn't their company, but there...

790
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:00,100
No, they were making them for one of the studios.

791
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,940
I forget whether it was MGM or Paramount.

792
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,020
So they were making it for one of the...

793
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,820
They were making all this stuff and then struck out on their own with a third guy.

794
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,220
Gotcha.

795
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,660
To start their own company.

796
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:17,620
Now, the interesting thing is there, the budget for the average Tom and Jerry short was about

797
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,660
$35,000, I was reading.

798
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,940
To make a five-minute rough and ready, maybe the Tom and Jerry shorts were like seven minutes,

799
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,140
five-minute rough and ready short, their budget was $3,000.

800
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,500
What?

801
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:38,980
They kind of got known for the limited animation style where it's like a cell,

802
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,940
you would only be animating like the top half of Top Cat or Snaggle Puss,

803
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,940
but the bottom half would be stationary.

804
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,340
Maybe people aren't walking if they don't have to walk.

805
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,180
I feel like I associate Hanna-Barbera with the chasing that repeats the hallway

806
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,180
or the Scooby-Doo thing.

807
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,420
What's rough and ready?

808
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,860
Rough and ready, when they...

809
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,940
It was a cat and a dog.

810
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,020
Yeah, they were like, I don't have a...

811
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,060
Oh, that's a tiny picture.

812
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,220
If you can see that.

813
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,420
I'm so far away from it.

814
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,700
It's comically small.

815
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,820
That's the one on Wikipedia.

816
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,500
What am I going to do here?

817
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,620
It's a cat and a dog.

818
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:24,500
Cat and a dog, I mean the big Warner Brothers things, Flintstones, the first prime time cartoon.

819
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,700
The Jetsons, another prime time.

820
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,300
Cartoon.

821
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,580
Huckleberry Hound.

822
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,540
Huckleberry Hound.

823
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,580
They did a lot of...

824
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,740
This didn't dawn on me until reading about it.

825
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:41,460
They had these longer length shows and then they had other shows where it was like

826
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,540
three shorts packaged together.

827
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,340
Because I don't always know.

828
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,220
Obviously there was the Flintstones and the Jetsons,

829
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,300
but a lot of these other characters, I don't know where they live and how they existed

830
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,580
where even the characters in the ride, Dick Dasterdly and Muttley,

831
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,860
I wasn't exactly sure how they factored in.

832
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,260
They were from...

833
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,540
So some of these things were...

834
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,020
Wacky racers?

835
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,900
Wacky racers.

836
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,300
Wacky racers.

837
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,660
They would just start churning out stuff.

838
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,620
Once the Saturday morning cartoon boom started,

839
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,380
Hannah Barbera was just churning out characters and shows.

840
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,260
It's crazy because if I just...

841
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,380
We've mentioned the big ones, but if these names...

842
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:26,820
McGilligorilla, Johnny Quest, they had a Laurel and Hardy show.

843
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,660
They were a space ghost.

844
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,020
They had Birdman.

845
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,420
They had Shazan, which is like a genie man who I think is the

846
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,380
model for Robert Smigel's Shazang cartoon.

847
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,420
Oh yes, that's my favorite.

848
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,620
The scene where he beats up...

849
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,380
They did a Fantastic Four cartoon.

850
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,580
They do wacky races.

851
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,620
They did the Smurfs.

852
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,700
The Smurfs, originally a Belgian comic adapted into a cartoon

853
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,780
by Hannah Barbera.

854
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,340
They did Laverne and Shirley in the Army.

855
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,540
What?

856
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,660
And the Fonzie and the Happy Days gang cartoon.

857
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,020
And they did Partridge Family 2200 AD.

858
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,540
Hold on.

859
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:03,780
What?

860
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,540
We should go...

861
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,340
A little familiar.

862
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,700
It was overwhelming reading everything Hannah Barbera made.

863
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,180
Like part of that...

864
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,780
Again, a tiny graphic I'm going to show you, Scott,

865
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,140
but it's obviously Jetsons with the Partridge Family cartoon.

866
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,180
Wow.

867
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,980
An insane...

868
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,220
Also possibly the impetus for another Smugle one that I love,

869
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,460
Lady Smith Black Mambazo and Hatter Smith.

870
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,580
In the top 10 of Smugle.

871
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,900
Even in the 90s, I didn't realize they did Swat Cats.

872
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,180
They did Swat Cats.

873
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:38,340
They would play Swat Cats commercials in the line for the

874
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,420
Fantastic World of Hannah Barbera ride.

875
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,580
And Swat Cats was just like a Ninja Turtle ripoff,

876
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,900
Biker Mice from Mars or just anthropomorphic animals,

877
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,980
but they were like tough guys, animals.

878
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,660
Also worth mentioning the studio if you're in the Los Angeles area.

879
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,340
I don't remember which building, if it is the literal LA Fitness

880
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:04,020
at the bottom of the hill on Barham, below Universal Studios,

881
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,540
but right under Universal Studios.

882
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,420
Either it's the LA Fitness or the adjacent buildings.

883
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,100
The buildings are there, but it's not Hannah Barbera and hasn't been for a long time.

884
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,940
But like, yeah, they were next door neighbors of Universal Studios.

885
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:23,300
And the buildings around there are very like 60s mod.

886
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,580
So you can't imagine this is where the Jetsons was made or whatever.

887
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,380
Okay. Yeah.

888
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:32,340
The Wikipedia page for Hannah Barbera had a picture of the studio building

889
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,020
in like 2007 and mentioned it was in the Cahuenga Pass.

890
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,820
It might have still been at that point.

891
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:44,500
Yeah. So I don't, it looks really neat and it's crazy that,

892
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:51,220
and they were there for a long time until they got absorbed into whatever Turner entity.

893
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,540
You're not even aware where they ended up.

894
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,140
Hannah Barbera owned for many years by Taft Communications.

895
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,660
They came up on the Kings Island episode.

896
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,900
That's right, which is why they were featured.

897
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,740
That was their first theme park featuring was in Kings Island.

898
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:15,860
And then Taft got bought by Turner and then Turner got bought by Time Warner.

899
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,780
It kind of gets murky in the 90s.

900
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:23,860
Yeah, they trade hands a lot and their theme park history changes a lot, which is why it's,

901
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:30,340
you know, the fantastic world of Hannah Barbera ends up being their like primary theme park entry.

902
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,980
They exist in all, there's a bunch of odd little rides, but this is probably the most concerted.

903
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,820
And there's a lot of bizarre, like Flintstones is all over the map and there's this Flintstones

904
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:45,380
park somewhere that just closed. But this one's, this is probably oddly the main way the Flintstones

905
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:51,620
exist in theme park worlds, even though they're only a third of the ride is the Flintstones.

906
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:56,260
I really, I wish it all's maybe account for that very possibly people do not know this ride and

907
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,260
I wouldn't blame them because it's been closed since 2000 or something.

908
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:06,180
2002, it was open a lot longer than I thought. It was an open day,

909
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:14,580
Universal Orlando attraction, the kids attraction in addition to E.T. and the Nickelodeon Studios.

910
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:23,300
And it closed in 2002, so it was there 1990 to 2002, it's like 12 years. And that's also about

911
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,980
how long the Jimmy Neutron ride that replaced it lasted about 11 years or so.

912
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:35,620
Gotcha. Yeah, it's, it's, I did not know existed. I never went to Universal when I was young.

913
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:43,460
So I'm not kidding. It was, wow. I love this ride. Yeah, it's pretty large to me. And I probably

914
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:48,100
wasn't willing to go on any on everything there. And I was probably scared of some of the things

915
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:53,940
I did. I'm not, I think the first time I went, I was not, I did not brave jaws or maybe it wasn't

916
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:59,780
open yet. It was in that period where it was closed. But yeah, this was a opening day attraction,

917
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:06,900
one that worked for kids. And as the defunct land episode about it really pushes one of the

918
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,500
only rides that had no problems opening day of Universal Studios, because all of their major

919
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,300
attractions were big old disasters because they were all attempting all these things mechanically

920
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,300
that were probably outside the realm of possibilities for the industry at the time.

921
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,740
And this thing was like, it kind of helped the park through the first,

922
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,940
the rough first couple of months because it was, it was fine. It was the one you didn't have to

923
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:35,380
worry about. Yeah. I read a little about this in that, that Disney versus Universal Sam Genovese

924
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:44,420
book. I here's a from it. He says, Peter Alexander came up with the idea of a motion theater in a

925
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:49,540
conversation with Barry Upson. Alexander said, you know, these theme park attractions don't make

926
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:55,460
any sense. It's like every time you want to change out and put a new television show on,

927
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:03,780
you have to buy a new television. Let's see. He continued, yeah, he changed out the,

928
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:10,500
some of the props and we would have something new. So like, this was like an early, if not the first

929
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:17,060
motion theater ride. And like, sure enough, when it was time to change out this for another ride,

930
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:23,460
it took them less than six months to swap out Jimmy Neutron for Hanna-Barbera. Oh, no kidding.

931
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:29,060
And then, yeah, so the full history of this space at Universal Studios started as Hanna-Barbera,

932
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:35,140
became Jimmy Neutron and today is Despicable Me, Minion Mayhem, which one day we will get to in

933
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:43,460
seven parts, nine parts. We'll, we'll determine that at a later time. But the, but if you go on

934
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:48,820
that, so this Hanna-Barbera ride we're talking about never made it to Hollywood. Yeah. But the

935
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,540
Despicable Me ride did. So if you've been on that, but not any of the rest of what we're talking

936
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:59,220
about, you may know that as opposed to Star Tours, where you're in a cabin of a, of a simulator,

937
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:04,260
this one is like a big theater with a lot of little cars, which is how, that's how the

938
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,700
Despicable Me ride is. And that's how this Hanna-Barbera one was. So instead of the whole

939
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:16,020
theater moves all at once, it's like benches and like two or four, I'm not sure the, the

940
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:20,900
how it works exactly, but like. Are the seats the same or have they changed? Like is it the same

941
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:25,060
basic configuration? Do we know? I think same basic configuration. I'm sure they've changed the

942
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:29,460
actual vehicles over the years and they certainly changed the aesthetic, but it seems like the

943
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:35,620
modular nature of it. Like if one of those benches goes down, if one of those ride vehicles goes

944
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,260
down, they just put a tarp over it. You just don't go in that one. Oh yeah. Good. Sure. So

945
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,980
I can see why this did work so well. You're saying opening day, cause it's like, well, it was built

946
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:52,340
to be modular. It was clearly built to be simple. Very like, yeah, very mechanically friendly and

947
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:58,500
also, and, and mom friendly because there was, if you didn't want to get shaken around, if you did,

948
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,900
if you have a problem with motion sickness, they have benches that don't move. So you could just sit

949
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,300
up on the front of the bed. I think it was in the front. You could just sit and watch the movie and

950
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,780
not get shaken around, which I remember my mom doing. My mom and little brother definitely sat on

951
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,660
some benches at some theme park rides. Sure. I was going to say it's mom friendly because my mom

952
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,300
goes on still to this day about how good the Hanna Barbera cartoons were. Those were like her favorite

953
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:27,940
cartoons. She loves Top Cat. She loves McGilligarilla. She's, she, she'll tell you about it. She'll tell

954
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:33,780
you about Top Cat. We got a big DVD set of Top Cat a couple of years ago. Loves it. Now I'm not

955
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:40,100
sure I've ever seen one second of Top Cat. Top Cat is fun. I like Top Cat. My mom was also,

956
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,420
she said she was physically, she attracted to one of the cats on Top Cat when she was young.

957
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:50,980
What is supporting cast members? Not Top Cat himself. But I forget which one it is. I can look

958
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:55,300
it up. He had a whole gang of cats because they were all like kind of cool cat. Like they were all

959
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:59,780
up to mischief. They wouldn't do anything like real dangerous, but they would mess with some cops.

960
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,460
I think Hanna Barbera has some attractive characters throughout because obviously

961
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:13,140
Daphne and Velma and Scooby-Doo. Sure. And I think, hey, you know what? I think those guys are lookers

962
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:25,140
as well. Fred. Hey, Fred's a classic all-American, Lunkhead, prom king. And I'll say this. I think

963
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:31,940
I'm not specifically super attracted to Judi Jetson, but I think Judi Jetson is a well-rendered

964
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:38,180
character. And I'm a big fan of the Jetsons movie. Oh yeah. I was going to say I like that too,

965
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:45,380
about the devastation of mining ore for sprockets. That's right. That's a dark movie. Oh yeah. And

966
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:50,340
it's sort of like dealing with the natives or what, like those little creatures who it's actually

967
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:55,460
robbed. I forget the mechanics of how it works, but. Yeah. Isn't the first thing that they move

968
00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:00,980
their house up from the pollution? Is that right? There is a shot. Yeah. It's not the start of the

969
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,020
movie. I haven't seen it in many, many years, but isn't that the first- It's not really commented

970
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:08,740
on that much. But isn't that what it is? Yeah. One of the first shots in the movie. They just rise

971
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:14,340
above any smog because they're on that weird house. Oh, okay. I don't know if I've ever put

972
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:21,060
that together before right now. Now that is, that movie was coming out around the time this ride

973
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:28,100
was opening. So there was what we would now call synergy that was happening. And I'm wondering if

974
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:33,620
they thought like, well, this is the start of a Hanna-Barbera film renaissance because like-

975
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:39,380
Maybe Flintstones was in the works. I mean, it was probably for sure in the works.

976
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,580
Yeah. At least, yeah. Though if maybe as a live action thing instead. The feature length Tom and

977
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:50,100
Jerry movie came a few years later, which I remember seeing in theaters and liking as a kid.

978
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,660
I have zero memory of that. Did I see that? Probably, but I'll be honest with you,

979
00:51:54,660 --> 00:52:01,140
never a big Tom and Jerry fan. Didn't care for it as a kid. I find them sort of unpleasant for some

980
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:06,180
reason. Yeah. And in the movie, I feel like they didn't really, they just, there was, and now here's

981
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,460
a big Tom and Jerry cartoon. It wasn't really like elevated. Yeah. And they talk, I mean,

982
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:14,260
they talked in the cartoon later or the newer cartoon as well. Yeah. I think that's right.

983
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,460
But it's like, it clearly we're like, well, what are we going to do? Like these were short

984
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,740
cartoons where they would just beat each other up. Uh huh. Uh huh. And then they're like, well,

985
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,660
I guess they talk now. And I think that nothing, nothing ever really grabbed me about it. I used

986
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:30,820
to, and here's why I was extra mad at it. It would air right before Ninja Turtles. Oh, God,

987
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:37,140
be done. Oh, so you're resenting anything that's not so extra. There's an extra level of frustration

988
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:42,580
I think of when I think of Tom and Jerry. Did you guys, I think I knew TV schedules. I think I could

989
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:51,940
tell what time it was, uh, uh, by what was on TV. Like before I could tell time on a watch face,

990
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:57,540
I could go like, well, it's about 10 30. Cause uh, the Muppet babies are on and that'll be on again

991
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:02,900
at two. Uh, I do. Yeah. I remember the patterns like that. And I definitely remember that run and

992
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,420
Stimpy was on at 11 on Saturdays and I have to go help my dad like sweep up outside. And I was

993
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:14,260
always eyeing that clock. Like I better be in by 11. Right. Um, and I think Rugrats, I think it was

994
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:21,540
Rugrats 10 Doug 10 30 or maybe, oh yeah. Yeah. Which again, what, like what a run those three in

995
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:32,580
a row. I would remember too, and I can't pinpoint exactly what, but I would remember the blocks of

996
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:38,340
commercials would air in the same order. And I'm like, I don't like this commercial, but there's a

997
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:46,020
toy commercial coming up. I'm very fond of. Oh, maybe I, I know what you're saying. I do know

998
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:51,380
I think there would be, yeah. I think they would like play stuff. Yeah. In a row. No,

999
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:56,340
that does seem familiar. Now that you say that for like X-Men toys or Batman or toxic Avenger

1000
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:01,140
too, I was really obsessed with the toxic Avenger toys based on the short-lived cartoon. Did you

1001
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:05,620
like the cartoon? I liked the cartoon too, but the toys were very, the toys still look good.

1002
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,740
Did you have the toys? Yeah. Okay. Do you remember any of the carrot? Cause I'm not,

1003
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:15,860
I had no nothing of the toxic. I don't remember any of their names, but I remember being

1004
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:22,580
a little grossed out by it. Little gross. Can I say, oh, and going back to a sort of like heart

1005
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:30,100
throb, Hannah Barbera, please, I would like to shout out the, the object of Judy Jetsons affection

1006
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:37,940
in the Jetsons movie, Apollo blue, the space rock star, which in general, I feel like I've caught

1007
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:44,740
the people who had like childhood crushes on Apollo blue. And in general, the, all the, like the

1008
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:50,420
songs from the Jetsons movie, I think are fantastic. It's these, there's this one, especially

1009
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:57,460
that I think, cause Tiffany, the pop star, the voice of Judy, they would have recorded the actual

1010
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:04,580
woman, Janet Waldo, who voiced Judy and then kicked her out of the movie cause they thought

1011
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:09,140
they could sell more tickets with Tiffany. So Tiffany did songs and that's good. So they got

1012
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:15,620
that. But Tiffany also then had to speak and her, I don't, I'm not sure puberty had finished

1013
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:20,980
because her voice is cracking the whole time. It's like her voice is really annoying in the movie.

1014
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:26,180
Wow. It's really strange. How old was Tiffany when she was putting out songs? Not sure. Very young.

1015
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:31,220
Yeah. Really? I don't think I ever realized that. Young enough to, for her to get a lot of

1016
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:36,100
horrifying stalkers and a documentary about those stalkers. I think we're alone now.

1017
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:40,340
That plot in the movie is based on an old episode of the Jetsons, I think.

1018
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,420
It's like my mom's favorite Jetsons episode, which I will, she'll tell you all about.

1019
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:53,540
Judy is obsessed with a singer named Jet Screamer. And it's a very similar kind of a thing where it

1020
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,620
like, and I think my mom liked it so much because like, I think she identified with Judy and being

1021
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:02,980
obsessed with like rock and roll men. So this was sort of a Bobby Sherman stand in. I don't know

1022
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:10,420
what style Jet Screamer was, but. He was, can we see this tiny graphic? I sure can't. And no,

1023
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:15,860
no one at home can see it at all. You can see it even worse than me. Tiny photos. Those Jet

1024
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:21,700
Screamer pinups you're after. I'm getting bad luck with the pictures. But I just, like this,

1025
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:27,300
this one music video that's like Judy and Apollo Blue falling in love is so fucking awesome. They

1026
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:36,260
like turn into like Cubist paintings and like, and like a like a like constellations form. And

1027
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:42,740
then it turns into their into their face. It's like, it's so rad. I name checked it when I was

1028
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:48,500
pitching Moonbeam City. Like I wanted to look like the Jetsons movie. I really like the Jetsons movie

1029
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:54,980
aesthetically and to bring it back to the ride. One thing that I like is that it's an early combo

1030
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:03,460
of 2D characters and 3D environments and it's pretty dated, but not horrifically. So you can

1031
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:10,740
just tell it's from an era from a bygone era, but it's like not, it's kind of cool. And I think the

1032
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:16,180
rides that way too. I like it. Yeah. Cause the 2D animation looks like classic Hanna-Barbera

1033
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:25,460
2D animation. And then the CGI environments are very basic and stylized and kind of caricatury,

1034
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:30,020
but it's not trying to be realistic. It's not trying to be photo realistic. It's just trying

1035
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:36,500
to be cartoony and like a sort of like the, it reminded me almost of that a little later,

1036
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:42,340
but that video game vector man, just a bunch of ball. You were a man, but he was just made up of

1037
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,660
different balls and you could change shapes. And it was just like very simplistic CGI.

1038
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,860
I was impressed because I was watching it and I was like, if somebody said this was made in 2000,

1039
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:56,340
I would have been like, oh yeah, of course. Like I wouldn't have like doubted the technology,

1040
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:02,020
but like 90 is pretty impressive. Like for it to look like that, which yeah, it's early.

1041
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:10,820
Work from Rhythm and Hughes, a major like a CGI studio. I'm confused on my history. I just know

1042
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,500
they became a major operation in the nineties. I don't know what they did.

1043
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,900
Or I wrote down Rhythm and Hughes too, because Rhythm and Hughes just a few years ago was kind

1044
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:24,420
of infamous because they did like award winning work on the life of pie movie. Oh, that was them.

1045
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:29,220
That was them. And as the movie was winning all these awards, Rhythm and Hughes went under.

1046
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:35,300
Wow. So like they're winning Oscars and like people are like getting severance checks and

1047
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:40,180
packing up boxes. Like, yeah. Horrible. Oh my God. That's terrible. Well, gee, well, hey,

1048
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:46,900
great. We're everything from life of pie to the Jetsons part of the ride. Good work.

1049
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:55,300
I also really like the, I like the Scooby Doo zone. And it reminds me of like when you go into the

1050
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:03,540
the castle part of the ride, it feels very much like Bowser's castle or like a Mario car level.

1051
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:11,380
It's really neat. And I also now while you can tell some things up, like the 2D characters don't

1052
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:16,660
blend perfectly with the 3D. Like it does feel like one thing laid on top of the other. However,

1053
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:23,860
you got a 3D ship spinning all around and your camera view is changing and bending and everything

1054
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:32,820
to animate the perspective of these characters and particularly Muttley and Dick Dastardly.

1055
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:38,100
Like that they're like you're tracking them flying around just like the perspective that

1056
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:43,060
these 2D animators had to keep in mind. Many of whom went on to work for Don Bluth.

1057
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:48,820
Not long after this, I don't know. I'm just like, I'm very impressed by the like people might look

1058
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,820
up this riot and go, this looks stupid. What are they talking about? But I think, but for the era,

1059
00:59:52,820 --> 01:00:02,180
for 1990, 1990 and Sylvan Bluth company working on this, oh, okay. Working on this. Some of them

1060
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:08,340
they were in Ireland at that point it was saying. And then some of the animators came to Burbank to

1061
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:16,980
work on this while the rest stayed in Ireland to work on the dreaded Rock-A-Doodle. And maybe that

1062
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:22,900
other thing, Dinosaur in Central Park. One of their other things. Troll in Central Park. I think I saw

1063
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:27,940
in their credits. There was a movie called the Troll in Central Park. They were making like two

1064
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:32,580
other movies at the time. But now we're back at Dinosaur story. Maybe it was we're back.

1065
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:37,780
These are weird. Yeah, these are, there's a whole genre. There's almost of these kids movies.

1066
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:43,060
Hanna Barbera was doing some of these kind of kids, lost kids movies too. And yeah, Don Bluth

1067
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:49,700
company. Yeah. Weird time. And you can't like, I feel like some of these things, like you knew that

1068
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:56,340
they were bombs. You know, people did not like these movies. Today, I feel like the PR machine

1069
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:03,220
for every, in my mind, there has not been a bombed kids cartoon in two decades because you're

1070
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:08,740
like getting screamed about. You're getting screamed at about them so much. I'm like, I don't know. How

1071
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:14,580
much, if you ask me, how much did Smallfoot make? I don't know. Probably a $1.2 billion. I have no

1072
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:21,060
idea. I don't know. What was a hit or what wasn't a hit? Was Rango a hit? No idea. Maybe that one

1073
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:26,580
wasn't. Let's assume it was. Yeah. If it was, if it's a cartoon from the last 20 years, it was a

1074
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:30,980
gigantic hit. Everything. And you also hear all these stats. Every, every movie that comes out is

1075
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:36,660
like, no, that's like seven times Jurassic park. Is it? What do you, how could that be? That can't,

1076
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:42,100
but they're not in, it's not $94. It's yeah. Maybe. I don't know. There's, there's, there's how they,

1077
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:47,380
there's cheats. I'm pining for those days back when movies could eat shit. Yeah. Back in my day,

1078
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:52,340
there were unpleasant movies that scared young Jason and young Scott and young Mike. And then

1079
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:57,060
they lost money and people got fired. Yeah. People should be fired. What am I nostalgic for?

1080
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:03,060
Okay. Yes. So it was a troll in central park. Some of the state in Dublin and some of them

1081
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:09,620
to work on rock a doodle and a troll in central park. So Don Bluth, he bopped around a lot. He

1082
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:14,180
was at Disney. He made his own company. That company went under. He made another company. And

1083
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:18,100
then I think he went to start the Fox animation. That word video game too.

1084
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:25,620
Oh, dragon, dragon's layer. Yeah. I think so. I could never figure out how to play that.

1085
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:31,060
I would put a quarter in and I was just like, what? It's a cartoon. I was confused too. Yeah.

1086
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:37,380
It was like one of those weird Sega CD games or something where, or like that Scotty Pippin

1087
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:42,900
basketball game where like it was so impossible to play. Like it was like a video. It was video of

1088
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:49,460
Scotty Pippin and it just obviously didn't work. Like it was just like a strategy based game or a

1089
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:55,060
turn based basketball game with Scotty. Every now and then my mom would order a Nintendo game off

1090
01:02:55,060 --> 01:03:01,220
QVC or the home shopping network and it would just be befuddling. Like I'd be like, what is this game?

1091
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:07,140
And it'd be like a puzzle thing or I feel like there was a matchbox one that we had to send back

1092
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:13,140
because it would stop working after the first level. Nothing frustrated me more because I always

1093
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:21,380
put the blame on myself. This is my fault. You're not smart, Scott. You're fucking up. Any better kid

1094
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:27,380
could outsmart this game. Maybe a lot of these games were impenetrable. Yeah. I think there was

1095
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:32,660
a lot of garbage back. I mean, there's still a lot of garbage games, but yeah, I think yeah, you would

1096
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:36,820
rent a game from the store and you would know nothing about it. Maybe Nintendo Power had a

1097
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:42,580
blurb, but it would be just the controls were horrible. Stuck in a corner on the James Bond

1098
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:48,420
Jr. video game. Like not even a 10th of the way through the first level and then you're just stuck

1099
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,700
with it all weekend. I feel like Nintendo 64 is the first system where we're self-aware enough to

1100
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:59,700
know that this game is bad. It's not your fault. It's because this game is poorly made. Like

1101
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:07,060
famous one, Superman 64, Mission Impossible at Nintendo 64. Famously bad games. Oh, that game

1102
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:11,940
was fun. Mission Impossible? Yeah. I beat that a bunch of times. Oh, Jason, Mission Impossible is

1103
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:18,740
horrible. Stop bragging. We were so excited for GoldenEye and Mission Impossible. GoldenEye came

1104
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:25,140
out first and then Mission Impossible kept getting delayed and Mission Impossible blew. It was so bad.

1105
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:32,580
It was like very close to the movie, which is like a terse pot boiler and not exactly

1106
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:40,500
filled with video game like ask scenes, you know. It's a noir game. It's just about mood and pacing.

1107
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:45,700
You could do nothing in that game. You change costumes a lot. GoldenEye could shoot a scientist

1108
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:49,860
in the head. You could go in different cool places. You could really like have a lot of freedom.

1109
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:56,980
You had one gun. Sometimes. You had one gun. You couldn't turn around and you could barely do

1110
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:02,100
anything. The whole idea was you're supposed to sneak places and you couldn't do. It wasn't fun.

1111
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:06,980
No, but you could do the break-ins. You did do the wire scene. It was fun.

1112
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:11,700
No, we're going to look up this game. I'm going to get this game and you're going to play it now.

1113
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,540
We're going to play GoldenEye and Mission Impossible. It's not even a contest. It's

1114
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:20,260
not even the same level. I just remember. That's the most unfair thing you just proposed.

1115
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:25,140
We're going to play what everyone agrees is the best of the era and then this thing.

1116
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,500
We'll just play Mission Impossible. It's garbage. It's horrible.

1117
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:36,900
GoldenEye might still be the gold standard for me because I had all the Bond games that came out

1118
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:43,940
after that too. The other GoldenEye game and the World is Not Enough video game. Very similar to

1119
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:50,180
GoldenEye, but it wasn't as good, but it was more detailed. It was like, oh look, you can see him

1120
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:57,700
reloading. I can get a dirty used copy of Nintendo 64's Mission Impossible for $470 with free shipping.

1121
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:05,780
Oh, we could Twitch that. Sure, we could. Is that theme park related? Maybe?

1122
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,460
Maybe. Tangentially.

1123
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:10,420
Tangentially. It talks about Mission Impossible 4.

1124
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,860
Paramount Park will have a Mission Impossible. There's going to be Mission Impossible rides soon,

1125
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:16,900
I think. Also. That would be cool.

1126
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:21,620
We've been waiting long enough. Well, I'll look into the cheapest way I can get.

1127
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:31,860
Let's get back to the fantastic world of Hanna-Barbera. I would like to start talking

1128
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:38,260
about this, my beloved pre-show. I don't think I knew how much I liked it until rewatching it.

1129
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:47,060
It's such a blast. You get into a line where you're watching Hanna-Barbera clips. What was that one?

1130
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:51,860
The Cats show? The Ready? No, the crazy.

1131
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:59,380
Swat Cats. You're watching Swat Cats clips and you're starting to wonder, well, how are these

1132
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:05,620
dazzling cartoons made? That's what I'm here to find out because my entire day at Universal Studios

1133
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:11,220
Florida is about finding out how movies are made. I'm trying to just do an educational museum trip

1134
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:17,700
and then the real things from the movies keep interrupting my knowledge. Very frustrating,

1135
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,220
obviously, but maybe this one will be different. I'm going to learn how cartoons are made.

1136
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:27,620
It's very on point with the early universal premise of ride the movie. Learn how this stuff

1137
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:34,820
is made. Learn, then ride. Learn some more. I don't remember what The Room was like,

1138
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:40,980
but it was sort of like, I feel like there was like a rocket. It was like a weird, odd cartoony

1139
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:50,900
room. You meet a yogi who wants to eat a sandwich. He's eyeing a sandwich.

1140
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:56,180
Boo Boo reminds him that these people aren't just here to see him eat a sandwich,

1141
01:07:56,180 --> 01:08:00,500
that they're here to learn about how cartoons are made. He's like, oh, really?

1142
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:07,300
Also, I was very, the yogi voice, not great. Not the classic, I think, what's his dog's butler

1143
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:12,020
did yogi and he had just died and was replaced. Some of the Jetsons people died. Mel Blank.

1144
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:16,420
Mel Blank had just died too. I was immediately listening to the video. I was like, that's not yogi.

1145
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:22,900
Yeah. Yeah. No, it was a latter day yogi, but you do, I was going to say,

1146
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:30,420
you do get a couple of original voices in this. You get Gene Vanderpil, who played Wilma and Rosie,

1147
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:36,260
the robot, and you get Casey Kasem. Who jetted up until a few years before he died.

1148
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:43,220
Wow. Really? Yeah. He was still, and it's him in taking Matthew Lillard to task in the commissary,

1149
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:48,660
in the famous scene in Looney Tunes back in action, which I say just because I only learned

1150
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:53,300
about it like a month ago. I find it very funny that- They did that.

1151
01:08:53,380 --> 01:09:02,900
Wow. Looney Tunes landed the Matthew Lillard cameo. Hell yeah. Also, not the original Dick

1152
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:08,100
Dastardly, sadly. It was like Michael Bell, who's like a prolific voice actor, but only was Dick

1153
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,420
Dastardly in this. I didn't know Dick Dastardly was Paul Winchell, the voice of Taylor.

1154
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:16,500
Oh, I missed that. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Great voice actor.

1155
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,100
Only on this podcast will somebody go, yeah, did you know he was, it was Paul Winchell?

1156
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,980
And I'd be like, whoa, that's awesome. Holy shit. Wow. Paul Winchell.

1157
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:33,300
I got one more in this area too. In this ride, it's an early performance of Jeff Bergman as

1158
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:38,740
Fred Flintstone. Jeff Bergman's a guy who does a ton of the voices. Nah, he's like one of those,

1159
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:47,860
like Cory Burton in the Disney world who does pitch perfect versions of the origin of the voices

1160
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:51,700
from the forties through the seventies and beyond. Yeah. Like Billy West with Looney Tunes.

1161
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:56,820
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. This guy also was Bugs. I don't know why it's Billy West sometimes and

1162
01:09:56,820 --> 01:10:00,660
Jeff Bergman sometimes. Yeah. I'm wondering. I don't know. I don't know the answer to that.

1163
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:07,140
But he's Fred Flintstone in this. And when he started taking over the beloved voices,

1164
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:12,900
maybe the first one that he jumped on was Jeff Bergman took over as the Pillsbury Doughboy

1165
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:21,780
for Paul Fries. Did you know that? The ghost host in the Haunted Mansion was the Pillsbury Doughboy.

1166
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:26,660
I think I went down the rabbit hole a couple of years ago and was like, oh yeah, wow, that's crazy.

1167
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:32,020
I don't hear that at all. Yeah, I don't. He does have a couple of voices that are way out there

1168
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:36,020
because he's Ludwig Von Drake too, which I would never have thought was the same as a ghost host.

1169
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:42,660
So like he does have some range there. Also, Thorol being Tony the Tiger blew my mind.

1170
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:48,020
Thorol Ravenscroft being Tony the Tiger. So like these guys would go back and forth between doing

1171
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:52,580
these Disney jobs and then just cereal. Yeah, I guess a lot of them are cereal.

1172
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:57,460
And I think Paul Fries was the Toucan. It was Toucan Sam maybe too. Oh, that sounds right.

1173
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:02,100
But that was, don't call me on that. I'm not totally sure. Can I try something real quick?

1174
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:06,180
Yeah. Oh, your carnivorous. Oh, now I fucked it up already.

1175
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,220
That was going to be that Pillsbury Doughboy doing the ghost host dialogue.

1176
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,100
Oh, try it again. Your carnivorous.

1177
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:17,380
Your carnivorous paler betrays an aura for moaning. Nothing says lovin'.

1178
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:23,540
I have been doing, this is a whole thing with Lindsay and I, for years I've been doing this voice,

1179
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:27,220
but he's very, she goes, he's very cloying. She sounds like.

1180
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:34,580
Nothing says lovin'. Well, we know what this sounds like. This is Olaf.

1181
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:37,700
Well, it does sound like Olaf. Yeah, it's basically, I have like four moves.

1182
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:46,100
Is this room actually stretching? I'm a bad snowman. Nothing says lovin'.

1183
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,580
Sorry. All right. I just had to do the owing and awing about these voice names.

1184
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:59,460
We had to get it out. But anyway, so Yogi realizes he needs, we need to get back. We need to get on

1185
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,540
track. We got to learn how cartoons are made. Because he doesn't know how

1186
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:07,300
ammunition is made. He like fucks it up so hard. It is pretty funny.

1187
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,660
I know, I like it. Absolutely.

1188
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:15,060
Yeah, it goes out of his way to say it wrong. Yeah, Yogi's funny. And so he turns it over

1189
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:19,780
to a different monitor where we're introduced to Hannah and Barbera themselves.

1190
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:26,980
This old man in sweaters and Oxford shirts. And this is like, I don't say this slightly,

1191
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:36,340
pretty neck and neck with Michael Eisner in terms of like wonderfully lovable, stilted acting from

1192
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:42,020
people who are not on camera very often. I love anything like this. And these theme parks obviously

1193
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:47,140
are full of this. They're close to Spielberg, you know what? You got the ET adventure right down the

1194
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:52,660
street. I've been underrating this Hannah Barbera video for a long time. Excellent pre-show.

1195
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:58,420
They're both like 80. I think one of them died at 95 and the other died at 92.

1196
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,580
No, one of them died in like 2001.

1197
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:07,860
I mean their ages. They died at 95. No kidding. Yeah, you're right. 2006 or 2002 as well.

1198
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:13,700
And they were connected to the company that shared their name pretty much I feel like until

1199
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:18,580
they died. Like some stuff, like the one who was still alive was given a creative consultant credit

1200
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:24,020
on that the Tom and Jerry movie. So I don't know that they were like hands on with everything,

1201
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:30,260
but for a company that was sold to like two or three different major communications concerns,

1202
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:37,060
like they never walked away. They never walked away. Yeah. Huh? Wow. Well, and they were hands

1203
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:44,100
on on this thing obviously and appearing in it. And so when it cuts to them, they are as heads of

1204
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:52,420
animation studio or want to do, they are surrounded by their characters of Fred and Barney and Scooby

1205
01:13:52,420 --> 01:14:00,500
Doo and George and George and wait, who's the Jane, George and Jane Jetson, Jane, his wife,

1206
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:06,020
Jane, his wife. And, and they are all, it's this weird angle because you're looking at Fred and

1207
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:13,860
Barney from behind and they're all waiting for orders from their creators and they're being told

1208
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:21,060
like, okay, Fred, you get it. They need you on stage four. All right, George and Jane,

1209
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:26,260
remember to take your scripts this time. As a precocious child, I thought that was very funny.

1210
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:30,500
Like this is not the first time, like I'm sure there's Looney Tunes stuff where they're sitting

1211
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:35,540
around in a break room waiting for something to do. But I always liked the joke of like

1212
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:40,500
the cartoon characters going to a soundstage to work like they were actors. Yeah. All sitting

1213
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:47,380
around a trailer, checking their phones, doing their taxes. And they don't speak. They just

1214
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:53,940
lovingly wait and listen and then just dopey Fred and Barney just turn around and walk away.

1215
01:14:53,940 --> 01:15:00,900
Okay. And then once the characters have been cleared out, they start talking to us and they're

1216
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:07,860
very warm and reminiscing about the wonderful times making cartoons and they're looking at

1217
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:15,940
storyboard. Well, they tell you how cartoons are made. Well, cartoons are a series of drawings all

1218
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:20,820
done in rapid order to make it look like it's moving. And then they show us first, it starts

1219
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:28,500
with the storyboards. Oh, remember that old villain Dick Dastardly? I sure do. I guess to

1220
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:35,300
remind you of who Dick Dastardly is, but his Wacky Racers was 20 years ago. I'm still not even sure.

1221
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:41,540
There was a new Wacky Racers. It's Wacky Races, right? Races. Isn't it Wacky Races? It might be

1222
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:46,180
Races, but I always called them the Wacky Racers because they were the racers. I don't know if I

1223
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:49,780
could be wrong. I remember there was a whole- There was a newer one a couple years ago.

1224
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,980
Not a couple years ago. Around the 90s time, might've been a couple years after. I remember

1225
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:59,620
there were 3D cartoons in the morning at like 7 a.m. And I remember because I had to set a

1226
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:04,100
tape for it. And I think there was a new Yogi Bear and it was 3D and you had to get your

1227
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:09,540
glasses off a cereal box. Now that was definitely a thing that Fox Kids or Wernher Brothers Kids

1228
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:15,700
would program 8 to noon, but then there would also be cartoons from 7 to 8. And I always like to try

1229
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:20,340
and- I would always miss them, but if I was up really early I would see them and it was always

1230
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:26,980
something weird. It was like, yeah, Wacky Racers 2.0 or some shit. So yeah, there was new- So kids

1231
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:31,620
should've kind of known who Dick Dastardly is. Dick Dastardly shows up. He wasn't the most

1232
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:36,420
popular character. I think he shows up in the one where they steal the spruce moose.

1233
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:43,620
What? Is that- they steal a plane and they meet a bunch of other cartoon characters. Am I crazy?

1234
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:49,220
Dick Dastardly kind of a go-to for like if there's a crossover he would be the bad guy. He's like

1235
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:54,260
Loki in the first Avengers or something. He crosses over. Oh, he straddles the worlds. Absolutely.

1236
01:16:56,020 --> 01:17:00,180
So yeah, they're reintroducing Dick Dastardly. But he had been around or he was going to be

1237
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:04,340
around soon. I don't know. It's interesting. They're taking no chances. I understand. People

1238
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:08,420
come from out of the country. They don't know Dick Dastardly like we do. He's clearly a villain,

1239
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:13,700
like just in his mustache and his look. He's got a Snidely whiplash quality. I was going to say,

1240
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:19,140
he is sort of looks- in my mind he just looks like Snidely whiplash. It's the same design.

1241
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:27,700
And he's kind of a pre-warrior. Like a real gangly- past a certain point, tall characters are fine,

1242
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:31,540
but the ganglier you get, you're probably a villain. If you're short and stout,

1243
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:35,380
you're a villain maybe like Mutley. Wario is short and stout.

1244
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:36,020
Mm-hmm.

1245
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:36,580
Boris.

1246
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:37,140
Waluigi.

1247
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,900
Oh yeah, Boris is bad enough.

1248
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,980
Waluigi is ganglier.

1249
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:44,900
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So these are the original Wario and Waluigi essentially.

1250
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:50,740
And then they're deciding how to demonstrate the process of animation, which is many drawings

1251
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:56,980
put together. And how do they do it? By drawing Elroy Jetson, which they do. And he comes to life

1252
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:02,900
on the piece of paper and is alive as Fred and Barney already were, thus negating the information

1253
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:09,540
that cartoons or many drawings put together. So they have overturned- well, either you do lots

1254
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:15,860
of drawings and you photograph them rapidly or you create a living being. And Fred and Barney

1255
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:24,420
are alive today and they were just in the room, but Elroy does not exist until we make him exist.

1256
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:25,940
Like I don't-

1257
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:30,980
But now he exists and now he can walk around. We have a living boy in the pages.

1258
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,540
Don't forget my anti-gravity backpack.

1259
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,980
Oh, look at him go. There he is.

1260
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:41,700
He's got the personality that we all know. But well, all right, once you draw a cartoon,

1261
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:47,060
they're only alive for seven months and then you got to shoot them and start anew.

1262
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:47,700
It's like the end of the-

1263
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:50,100
Seven months they start to feel pain.

1264
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,620
It's like the end of the prestige.

1265
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,260
You run them through the prestige machine.

1266
01:18:54,260 --> 01:19:01,700
You got a pile of Elroy Jetsons in tanks. You got to buy all these tanks to keep them in.

1267
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:07,300
The last Elroy has to murder the new Elroy has to murder the previous Elroy.

1268
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:11,060
All right, hop to it, Elroy. Blast him with your jetpack.

1269
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:14,020
Shoot your flames onto your clone.

1270
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:24,260
So to backtrack, they set out to draw Elroy Jetson. Let's draw Elroy Jetson. Great. It'll be easy.

1271
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:31,540
We've been animating the Jetson since 1962. I like them assessing that it will be easy to do it.

1272
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:37,060
What should we draw, Bill? A new character? No, that'll be hard.

1273
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,660
Draw the 28-year-old one.

1274
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:48,180
Well, remember back then when our friends Fred and Barney were still hocking cigarettes in between

1275
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:49,860
commercial breaks?

1276
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,140
Those were the days.

1277
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,020
Those were the days.

1278
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:57,460
Now we got to leave it to other characters to teach kids how to smoke.

1279
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:02,100
I kill to draw Joe Camel, my favorite cartoon character.

1280
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,500
It destroys me. We didn't make him up.

1281
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,820
We've been animating the Jetsons since 1962.

1282
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:12,580
Has it really been that long? It sure has.

1283
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:16,820
Yep, but it has all been fun. It sure has.

1284
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:24,820
They have now said three times within 30 seconds, I sure do. It sure has.

1285
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:31,620
It sure has. These delightful old timers, so much sure.

1286
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:35,860
They're so sure. That's the thing. When you get to be that age, you are so sure.

1287
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:43,220
We're all racked with doubt at all times, but these guys are so sure.

1288
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:47,140
They know. Is there ever a pre-show with two older guys in it?

1289
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,420
I don't think so. I think the oldest people at Theme Park anywhere.

1290
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,900
What if they're dead? Hitch was in his.

1291
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,780
But not custom, not original.

1292
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,540
Maybe Charlton Heston hosted the earthquake ride.

1293
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,540
I don't think he was older, though.

1294
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,380
I don't think he was older.

1295
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,260
It sure has been a fun ride.

1296
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:16,020
I sure did torture Janet Lee. I drove her to insanity.

1297
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:20,580
The sexual harassment fun? It sure was.

1298
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:24,500
I sure did harass many.

1299
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:30,180
So anyway, they draw Elroy. He's alive before he has a body.

1300
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:34,580
He requests his jet pack as Jason's or his anti-gravity backpack.

1301
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:36,100
Backpack, I think. Cool.

1302
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:38,500
Which he doesn't really use.

1303
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,940
I thought that was going to be a Chekhov's gun thing.

1304
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,380
It's like, that's how it'll get away.

1305
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,500
Yeah, they're setting up nothing there, huh?

1306
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,420
Nope. They sure are.

1307
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,900
They sure are. It sure doesn't pay off.

1308
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:58,020
Then they explain that animation is also done via computers these days.

1309
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:04,580
Which, once again, they present a fact and then illustrate the opposite of that fact,

1310
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:08,100
which is that, like, why computers do the animation today?

1311
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,220
Let me show you.

1312
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:14,740
Then one of them has magic in his finger, fires the magic into the corner,

1313
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,900
and creates a big weird space computer.

1314
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:19,460
In fact, Elroy says, it's the spaciest.

1315
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:24,500
And then the computer draws Dick Dastardly's ship.

1316
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,260
In 3D.

1317
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:28,820
In 3D, though they are in 2D.

1318
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:31,540
But then 2D Dick Dastardly pops out of it.

1319
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:36,660
Yes. Correct. But you get mix-ups like that when you shoot magic out of your finger.

1320
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,380
Well, sure.

1321
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:43,620
So he comes to life, he says that he's tired of being called old Dick Dastardly,

1322
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:48,740
and he requests to be the star of the next Hannah Barbera project.

1323
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,460
The next project.

1324
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:52,980
A ill-defined TV show, short subject, doesn't matter.

1325
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:54,500
Yeah, educational thing.

1326
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,940
Kind of a big ask.

1327
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:57,220
Yeah, absolutely.

1328
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:58,260
Not unreasonable.

1329
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:02,820
You don't just demand to be the star of things, especially if you're more of a character actor.

1330
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:03,320
Right.

1331
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:10,100
And they correct him right away, and they say, you can't, Elroy's next,

1332
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:14,260
followed by Fred Flintstone, and then the other one, then Scooby-Doo.

1333
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:16,420
And they kind of were right.

1334
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:20,580
Jetsons movie, then live action Flintstones, then eventually live action Scooby-Doo.

1335
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,220
They get a slate.

1336
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,740
It goes in the order.

1337
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:25,780
I don't know that that is how they intended it to make out.

1338
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,140
Might have been accidental, but it's right.

1339
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:32,020
I have a feeling that if the Jetsons movie was a huge, huge hit,

1340
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:36,500
we would have seen Hannah Barbera feature movies like that.

1341
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:40,740
The cartoon, the new updated version of their style?

1342
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:44,740
Updated version, theatrical, because it was a theatrical release, right?

1343
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:45,240
Yeah.

1344
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:49,940
I believe I saw it at the mall I talked about on a past episode with the waterfall.

1345
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:50,980
Oh, yeah.

1346
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:51,460
Nice.

1347
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,100
What a day.

1348
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:57,540
I think I saw that when I know I had that and the DuckTales movie on VHS.

1349
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:57,940
Oh, yeah.

1350
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:01,300
I have a lot of affection for those because I could just watch them over and over again.

1351
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,820
Those are good ones for sure.

1352
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:03,220
Wow.

1353
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:04,660
Well, let's make a video.

1354
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:08,660
Let's make like a weird YouTube conspiracy video where they point out how this predicts

1355
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:13,860
the order of all the movies coming out and that somehow something in the Hannah Barbera

1356
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:15,460
right also predicts 9-11.

1357
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,540
Predicts 9-11.

1358
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:25,780
So Scooby-Doo, we'd love to break rank, but Scooby-Doo is next and he is not satisfied

1359
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:32,420
with this answer so he kidnaps Elroy and takes him into a swirling vortex.

1360
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:36,820
Dick Dasterdly and Mutley come to life and abduct a child.

1361
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:40,980
They abduct a child who they don't know.

1362
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:43,940
They've never interacted before.

1363
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:46,820
There are some interactions in this ride.

1364
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:55,300
George Jetson knows Yogi, but Yogi and Boo-Boo don't seem to know Scooby and Shaggy.

1365
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,540
Well, it depends on if they've been summoned to the same

1366
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,700
taking of orders meeting by Hannah Barbera.

1367
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:07,140
So if Flintstones meets the Jetsons, which we have to briefly mention at least,

1368
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,060
was a couple of years before this.

1369
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:10,100
I think that's right.

1370
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:16,100
The Yogi Bear thing I was thinking of was called Yogi Bear and the magical flight of the Spruce

1371
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:16,500
Goose.

1372
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:22,500
The Spruce Moose was a big plane in Tailspin, another show I liked a lot.

1373
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,380
But the Spruce Goose is the real plane.

1374
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:34,340
This was a 1987 animated made-for-TV film produced for syndication as part of the

1375
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,140
Hannah Barbera Superstars 10 series.

1376
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:41,540
So again, they were just churning stuff out for syndication.

1377
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:47,540
This show featured Yogi Bear, the Flintstones, the Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, Huckleberry Hound,

1378
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:48,420
and Top Cat.

1379
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:52,580
But just A-listers in this ride.

1380
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:56,820
Just Scooby and the Flintstones and the Jetsons and Yogi and Boo-Boo.

1381
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,180
All right, Fred, you're next.

1382
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:04,820
Then Scooby-Doo, then the Partridge family from the year 2060.

1383
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:08,020
Then Secret Squirrel.

1384
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:10,340
Then Laverne and Shirley in the army.

1385
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,340
Then the Wonder Twins.

1386
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:17,220
Then Apollo Blue, Space Age rock star.

1387
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:22,820
Hannah Barbera also, I think we may have mentioned earlier, responsible for not just

1388
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:27,220
the backboat of Cartoon Network, the early backboat of Adult Swim, Space Ghost Coast

1389
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:34,740
Coast, The Brack Show, Sea Lab, and very limited animation on a lot of those shows.

1390
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:37,700
A lot of archival animation that they just redubbed.

1391
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:42,900
But it shows you how I feel like the original intent was let's design some characters who

1392
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:46,740
were cool and compelling to look at because we will not be animating them too much.

1393
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:51,700
And that ethos made it into obviously Space Ghost Coast to Coast and some of those other

1394
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:52,100
shows.

1395
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:55,940
And they are, it's a real credit to that the designs are good because that's all you're

1396
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:56,740
looking at.

1397
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:59,940
Yeah, well, and a lot of that credit goes to Alex Toth.

1398
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:03,380
Toth or Toath, the renowned.

1399
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:04,420
T-O-T-H.

1400
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:09,060
T-O-T-H, renowned comics artist and designer for Hannah Barbera.

1401
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:09,620
Really?

1402
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:15,860
Did a lot of work and widely regarded as like one of the best draftsmen in American comics.

1403
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:18,180
Yeah, it is funny because Space Ghost does look cool.

1404
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,380
Absolutely.

1405
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:25,140
Just him smiling when it just cuts back and forth between silent shots on Space Ghost.

1406
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:25,860
That's fantastic.

1407
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,620
Yeah, really funny.

1408
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,260
So anyway, look, there's a pecking order.

1409
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:36,420
Dastardly breaks it and kidnaps a child and they go into a vortex and then the computer

1410
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:38,180
machine explodes.

1411
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:43,780
A computer that was created by Hannah Barbera out of thin air five seconds ago.

1412
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:47,140
Then it's sparking and lighting the room on fire.

1413
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:50,820
They reacts to the explosion for so long because it has to cover.

1414
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:52,020
I love it.

1415
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,300
Yogi dialogue.

1416
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:59,460
I pause just of them like reacting to obviously like nothing and it's just so funny.

1417
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:01,300
Please look it up if you don't know this.

1418
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:08,180
The highlight is when is it Hannah is that the dark haired one?

1419
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,500
The way he trots out of the room.

1420
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,340
Yes, like cartoon character.

1421
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:15,860
This like cartoon like jaunts to get out of the room.

1422
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:21,300
If you know what that sounds imagine that sound but visualized.

1423
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,580
Yeah, really funny, but I think it's funny on purpose.

1424
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:25,140
I think that's him.

1425
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,140
Let me get out of here.

1426
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:28,500
He's having fun doing that.

1427
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:29,140
It's really fun.

1428
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:30,900
It looks like a prestigious thing.

1429
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:36,420
They invented a machine that caught on fire and then in their own office and then they say,

1430
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:37,700
let's get out of here.

1431
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,500
They just abandon them.

1432
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,420
They burn the place for insurance money.

1433
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:45,700
We spent so much time with them.

1434
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:48,580
I really wish they just went on the ride with us.

1435
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:50,100
That's the problem.

1436
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:54,820
The only problem I can see with it is setting them up so hard in the early part of it.

1437
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:56,740
Wow, we're going fast.

1438
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:57,940
We sure are.

1439
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:02,820
Wow, I feel like we've been traveling at 15 miles an hour.

1440
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:03,860
We sure are.

1441
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:05,860
But that'll be easy.

1442
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:09,540
There's much more difficult speeds than that.

1443
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:10,420
There sure are.

1444
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:15,140
If they were commenting like Statler and Waldorf.

1445
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:15,780
Oh, yeah.

1446
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:18,420
I also want suited characters.

1447
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:19,700
Walk around.

1448
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:20,820
Of them.

1449
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:25,300
And one to tell me like, boy, Scott, you're a handsome young lad.

1450
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,420
You sure are.

1451
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:28,820
Oh, they should have.

1452
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:30,420
Keep working on your drafting skills, kid.

1453
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:35,540
If Lucille Ball is still walking around, they should have Hannah and Barbera walking around.

1454
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:39,620
Yeah, we got to repopularize them as characters.

1455
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:45,380
Are there other instances of them doing this thing?

1456
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,340
I think they would introduce stuff every now and then.

1457
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:53,860
I don't have much of a memory of the two of them introing stuff on VHSs or DVDs.

1458
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:58,020
And I think the memory would have lingered because as we've established in many episodes

1459
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:01,860
of this podcast, I care about that stuff way more than the actual Louise.

1460
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:03,220
Much more.

1461
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:04,100
Much, much more.

1462
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:07,700
Yeah, so I would have thought I would have remembered these kindly old men.

1463
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,780
Just like Elroy's dads.

1464
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:10,980
Elroy's two dads.

1465
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:13,060
I think I would remember that.

1466
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:16,740
But I feel like there is not that much of them doing this, but I could totally be wrong.

1467
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:20,020
They introduced me to the concept that there could be two dads.

1468
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:21,060
This is how I learned.

1469
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:21,700
Oh, yeah.

1470
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,820
Yes, and they made me an open minded.

1471
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,900
Very progressive, Hannah and Barbera.

1472
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:30,820
So now you entered the ride.

1473
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:31,460
And you know what?

1474
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,060
You guys take it from here because who cares?

1475
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:38,740
The fun is kind of, the real fun is over.

1476
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:41,300
The real fun of watching two old men.

1477
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:41,860
Two sweater men.

1478
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:44,820
Explaining basic amination concepts.

1479
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,180
I always thought this was a funny, like, you know,

1480
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,980
Boo Boo says, like, what's our, how do we power this thing?

1481
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,740
Like, what's our source energy?

1482
01:30:56,740 --> 01:31:00,900
Like, and he makes up some, you know, anti-matter rocket fuelers.

1483
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:05,380
And then Yogi goes, a big old rubber band, Boo Boo, buddy.

1484
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:08,740
And it is like you are putting a slingshot and it's shot out.

1485
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:10,500
Like, I thought that was really funny.

1486
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,380
I like that.

1487
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:11,620
Yes.

1488
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:12,740
A big old rubber band.

1489
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:13,940
I have a question.

1490
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:17,140
Where is Yogi during this?

1491
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,100
You hear his voice.

1492
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:23,460
He's commenting and you're on one of 60 rockets inside a room.

1493
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:24,500
So where's Yogi?

1494
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,300
Well, I think the logic is you are in one rocket.

1495
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:33,220
You were specifically the rockets from the outside of the building.

1496
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:34,740
Oh, which Yogi is in.

1497
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:35,620
Which Yogi is in.

1498
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:38,020
So you were in the rocket with Yogi.

1499
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:39,140
Oh, interesting.

1500
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:45,060
This was really, I do not remember these giant children sitting in this horrifying marquee.

1501
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:46,500
Yeah, they're scary.

1502
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,140
Is that me?

1503
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:49,220
Is that what I look like?

1504
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:50,020
That's you.

1505
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:55,620
These mannequin dolls that were just on the outside of the universe.

1506
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:57,620
That's you in your childhood crush, Scott.

1507
01:31:58,660 --> 01:31:59,460
That girl.

1508
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:00,020
That girl.

1509
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,820
Yeah, she's kind of a looker.

1510
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:03,460
Yeah.

1511
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:06,500
And then these A-listers, the Hanna-Barbera A-listers.

1512
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:08,580
George.

1513
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:11,860
George, Scooby, Fred, Yogi, Boo Boo.

1514
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,260
And most of whom have ties.

1515
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:15,780
Most of whom have ties.

1516
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,340
Hanna-Barbera's characters were professional.

1517
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:19,780
That's what I like at the end of it.

1518
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:22,180
Yeah, George clocked in to a job.

1519
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:24,340
McGillicorilla had a tie too, didn't he?

1520
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:24,660
Yes.

1521
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:30,100
This was a period where people respected each other and dressed right.

1522
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:32,580
Did Top Cat have a tie as well?

1523
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:33,940
I think he had a collar.

1524
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:35,460
He had a collar?

1525
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:36,980
He certainly had a hat.

1526
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:38,340
Back when people wore hats.

1527
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:41,140
They had a collars only policy in their cartoons.

1528
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:44,260
You didn't get also a mark against Dick Dastardly.

1529
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,260
Sorry, Top Cat only in a vest.

1530
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:47,860
Still pretty sharp.

1531
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:50,260
A waistcoat, a purple waistcoat.

1532
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:51,620
Pants they don't care about.

1533
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:54,660
In fact, no Anna-Barbera characters wear pants.

1534
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:54,820
Right.

1535
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,420
But as long as your shirt is nice.

1536
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,820
One of his friends had it, like a kind of a makeshift tie.

1537
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:02,900
One of his gang.

1538
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:03,300
All right.

1539
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:06,500
Huckleberry Hound, respected lawman.

1540
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,060
Was he a policeman?

1541
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:10,820
He was a sheriff, wasn't he?

1542
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,500
Oh, Huckleberry Hound had a bow tie.

1543
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:13,380
Wow.

1544
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:14,500
He had a bow tie.

1545
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:20,500
But then sometimes he would wild out as El Cabong, right?

1546
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,700
That was his alter ego when he would hit people with his guitar.

1547
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,340
That is right.

1548
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:27,460
This is very interesting to me.

1549
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,980
Hanna-Barbera and ties.

1550
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,780
Yeah, I'm looking at a big picture.

1551
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,100
The average all I don't think had a tie.

1552
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:36,180
They also did the Banana Splits cartoon.

1553
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:40,260
They did so, I mean, yeah, a deep dive.

1554
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,340
Hanna-Barbera here, I'm looking.

1555
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:44,020
Smurfs.

1556
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:46,340
Oh, it looks like they did a Richie Rich cartoon as well.

1557
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:49,940
One of the Richie Rich revivals.

1558
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:53,700
El Cabong is just a, that is just a Zorro.

1559
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:55,220
Oh, okay.

1560
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:55,780
Oh, wait.

1561
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:56,180
Okay.

1562
01:33:56,180 --> 01:34:02,580
What I'm, I just went to a website called nowinnow.com having Googled Hanna-Barbera ties.

1563
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:08,020
And this is a time and money saving trick.

1564
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:14,260
Because as this says, think about how your torso, arms, legs change when your expression changes.

1565
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:16,900
When your face is smiling, the rest of your body reacts.

1566
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,060
Or if you're like turning to look at something

1567
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:23,700
and like a lot of the difficulty of animation is the boring like middle parts.

1568
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:28,260
So this was like a way around having to have their head do the same thing as their body.

1569
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:28,660
Oh, interesting.

1570
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:30,900
Like the tie is a reset point.

1571
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,860
Interesting.

1572
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:34,580
So it's, it helped with the limited animation.

1573
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:35,700
I guess so.

1574
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:36,420
Interesting.

1575
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:39,140
Because there's like, there's a dog on here with has like a neckerchief.

1576
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:41,460
Snaggle Puss has a little bow tie.

1577
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:44,900
Wally Gator has the collar.

1578
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,340
That's what you were thinking.

1579
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:48,340
And let's talk females.

1580
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:49,860
Wilma has pearls.

1581
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,660
Jane has a big triangle on her neck.

1582
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:55,380
Everyone has something on their neck.

1583
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:55,860
Yes.

1584
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:59,700
And doesn't Daphne have a little neckerchief as well?

1585
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,140
I think so.

1586
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:02,260
Maybe Velma as well.

1587
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,980
Sorry, El Cabong was not Huckleberry Hound's alter ego.

1588
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:06,260
I think it was a horse.

1589
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:09,460
Oh, but no, what was the horse's real name?

1590
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:10,900
The horse was also a cowboy.

1591
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:11,460
Oh man.

1592
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:13,860
There's so many Hanna-barbera characters.

1593
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:16,100
People are going to be pissed.

1594
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:17,940
People have probably been so mad this whole time.

1595
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:24,260
But I'm correcting myself in real time about the thousands of Hanna-barbera characters

1596
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:24,660
that are out there.

1597
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:26,100
There's a lot to keep straight.

1598
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:31,700
I think it was smart of them though to just stick to the big ones for the ride.

1599
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:37,220
Because I think kids now in King's Dominion and in the Virginia Paramount Park,

1600
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:44,100
you could meet I think Top Cat was Pink Panther.

1601
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:45,380
Yeah, Pink Panther?

1602
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:46,420
Is he Hanna-barbera?

1603
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:47,380
Is he Hanna-barbera?

1604
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:48,100
I don't know about that.

1605
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:51,060
If you were mad before, you're really mad now.

1606
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,980
But Huckleberry Hound was definitely welcome.

1607
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:55,700
Oh, and Kong Fu Louie, right?

1608
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:57,940
No, no, no, no, no, Kong Kong Fuie.

1609
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:01,300
What did you just call him?

1610
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,140
Kong Fong Louie.

1611
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:04,420
It was Kong first of all.

1612
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:05,780
Kong Fong Louie.

1613
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:07,300
Kong Fu Louie.

1614
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:07,620
Oh, okay.

1615
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:08,260
That's what you said.

1616
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:08,740
Oh, okay.

1617
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:13,300
Which is a thing too where you say instead of Kong Fu, you always say Kong Fu for some reason.

1618
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:14,900
I don't know where I got that.

1619
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:18,260
Kong Kong Fuie, I liked watching as a kid,

1620
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:21,220
but now I'm realizing there's got to be something problematic about it.

1621
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:22,340
Oh, yeah.

1622
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:25,220
But it was like Scamming Carruthers I think doing his voice.

1623
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:35,060
I think all representations of Asians and Asian Americans in all media of the 20th century is fine.

1624
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:37,540
Let's say there's no need to re-litigate anything.

1625
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:42,340
I'm sure if you go back, there's not a bunch of bizarre wardrobe and teeth.

1626
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:43,220
It's all fine.

1627
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:47,220
Marvel Comics famously, I just learned this recently because Marvel Comics announced

1628
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:49,860
they're doing a Shang-Chi, the master of Kong Fu movie.

1629
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:51,860
You said Kong Fu again.

1630
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:52,340
I think.

1631
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:52,980
It's fine.

1632
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:55,540
If we stop every time I say it.

1633
01:36:57,060 --> 01:37:03,060
But what they wanted to make was they wanted the comic rights to the Carradine TV show

1634
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:05,860
that was very popular in the 70s.

1635
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,740
Kong Fu.

1636
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:08,020
Kong Fu, yeah.

1637
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:14,820
They could not attain those rights, but what was affordable was the rights to the character Fu Man Chu.

1638
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:22,100
They created a new character named Shang-Chi who was the hero son of Fu Man Chu and often

1639
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:23,620
feuded with his father.

1640
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:31,540
Shang-Chi has stuck around and has been on the Avengers and the comics and stuff.

1641
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:36,180
Marvel is making a movie out of a character that dates back to like,

1642
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:40,260
I don't know, let's make the Carradine people don't want to do it.

1643
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:45,620
See, we can get Fu Man Chu and then it's his kid and he's good at karate.

1644
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:49,380
He was a copyright work around character.

1645
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:52,900
As we have learned, the ties are neck work arounds.

1646
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:56,180
One of the hardest things to draw is a neck.

1647
01:37:57,380 --> 01:38:01,300
I guess, yeah, if you're like an aspiring animator of hand-drawn animation,

1648
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:02,660
just put a tie on the character.

1649
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,580
Make it easier on you and the people overseas that will be animating it.

1650
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:13,060
Or a pearl necklace or like some prince art in your apartment, a big prince ruffle collar.

1651
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:14,340
Oh yeah, that would be great.

1652
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:17,620
It doesn't have to be a tie, but just something on the neck, an ascot.

1653
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:22,260
And yeah, also if you want to look sharp when you go out, wear any of these things.

1654
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:24,740
Quick drama growl was the horse cowboy.

1655
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:25,540
Oh yeah, yeah.

1656
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:27,220
So many characters, unbelievable.

1657
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:28,900
It is crazy how many characters they have.

1658
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:29,300
Yeah.

1659
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:31,220
Like the library is pretty insane.

1660
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:36,260
But some of them like, writing about Hanna-Barbera pretty open of like,

1661
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:39,540
all the animation studios were just stealing from each other at the time.

1662
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:42,180
And everything's based on old movies.

1663
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:43,300
Yeah, and everything's based on old.

1664
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:49,220
Okay, the rubber band launches you into the world of the flat stones.

1665
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:49,700
Bedrock.

1666
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:53,860
You avoid it, the elephant slips around.

1667
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:56,580
Let me say this, as soon as we got into like this area,

1668
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:00,260
and this will be like in the first couple seconds of the ride,

1669
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:05,140
I really got a podracer vibe, an episode one podracer vibe from this thing.

1670
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:08,180
Because it's sort of like, it's sort of dirt and canyon.

1671
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:11,300
Like a Tatooine, before you get to full bedrock,

1672
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:15,140
it's like a little Tatooine-ish and you're in kind of a little podracer.

1673
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:19,380
I think that this ride in general has some

1674
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:26,900
pre- qualities of the Simpsons ride before the Simpsons ride.

1675
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:27,380
Yes.

1676
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:29,940
That there is, that it's a chase of a villain,

1677
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:32,580
I guess as is the Back to the Future ride.

1678
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:37,940
And that there's weird, it's a world that you know as 2D, but rendered as 3D.

1679
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:43,860
And I find it equally exciting, just on some base level,

1680
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:47,300
that you're on a ride and getting a grand vista.

1681
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:51,620
And as in the Simpsons ride, when you're hearing the real theme,

1682
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:54,100
or the kind of the glow of the Simpsons,

1683
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:56,420
and you're going to fly into Springfield,

1684
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:01,060
hearing the big Flintstones theme, which is a wonderful theme,

1685
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:05,300
and you're entering bedrock, I think that's actually an exciting moment.

1686
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:09,060
Also, you're kind of doing, it's similar to what you're saying the Simpsons is,

1687
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,900
you get to go up the dinosaur.

1688
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:12,340
I hope everyone knows what we're talking about.

1689
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:17,140
Our listeners are young, but maybe know this weird stuff.

1690
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:20,500
The opening of the Flintstones is like Fred's leaving work.

1691
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:24,020
If we're now going to start explaining shit.

1692
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:24,180
I know.

1693
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:27,380
I'm just trying to think of what we're making people out.

1694
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:29,620
You can find most of this shit on YouTube uploaded.

1695
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:32,660
You guys know the Flintstones, I don't want to be like, I'm not talking down to you.

1696
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:35,060
Let me throw this out there, because I'm sure Disney Plus

1697
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:39,620
will pay the way for the Disney short back catalog of all the Mickey cartoons

1698
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:40,660
and Silly Symphony stuff.

1699
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:44,580
Do any of the streaming services have the Hanna-Barbera library up?

1700
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:46,980
It's a good question.

1701
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:47,620
I don't know.

1702
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:53,140
Does Warner Brothers have, I mean Cartoon Network has some version of it,

1703
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,660
but I don't think there's a big one.

1704
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:57,540
In the night, there was Cartoon Network and there was Boomerang,

1705
01:40:57,540 --> 01:41:01,700
and that's where they later put a lot of the older cartoons on the Boomerang channel.

1706
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:05,460
I think Boomerang is now an app with some archive stuff.

1707
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:08,340
There's something called VRV now, I think.

1708
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:09,780
That's where the Flintstones live.

1709
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:12,340
We're going to start a VRV ride to bring them back.

1710
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:14,500
Isn't that where some See-So stuff landed?

1711
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:16,740
And some anime stuff.

1712
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:20,100
There's anime on there, but there's Cartoon Network stuff on there.

1713
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:21,300
It's very confusing.

1714
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:24,180
I don't know where the hell you watch anything anymore,

1715
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:25,780
and that's why nobody sees anything anymore,

1716
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:28,820
as opposed to all these shows that were just on all the time.

1717
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:32,900
If you didn't grow up with Flintstones and Yogi Bear just on,

1718
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:34,020
you might not know about them.

1719
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:35,540
I don't disagree, Mike, with your premise.

1720
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,060
You might have to explain the Flintstones,

1721
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:41,300
but we also operate from a world where we assume our listeners know

1722
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:43,060
the names of every bear in the country.

1723
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:47,380
Sometimes I get out and I start to think,

1724
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:50,740
like, what if just a random person walked by the apartment right now

1725
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:51,940
and listened to what we were saying?

1726
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,060
Would they know what we're speaking?

1727
01:41:53,060 --> 01:41:55,060
And then I start to go, oh, we should fill them in.

1728
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:56,900
But it's like, why would I even bother?

1729
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:59,460
What did Griffin Newman say to us that his girlfriend said that

1730
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:04,980
she listened to the podcast and that it was as if this is like listening

1731
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:08,580
to a movie podcast where you have no idea what movies are?

1732
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:09,080
Right.

1733
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:12,660
You have to be acquainted to movies in general.

1734
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,380
It looks like you can watch 24 seasons,

1735
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:18,500
332 episodes of the Flintstones on Boomerang.

1736
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:21,140
So Boomerang might be the way to do it.

1737
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:22,180
So Boomerang is the way to go.

1738
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:23,700
So if you're so inclined.

1739
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:26,740
Boomerang is yabba dabba doomerang.

1740
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:34,020
Yabba dabba do is a phrase that is yelled when the clock goes off

1741
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:36,900
and Fred has to, Fred is leaving work.

1742
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,580
He's a construction worker.

1743
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:39,940
But the clock is a bird.

1744
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:42,580
Just to catch everybody up.

1745
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:44,260
The animals also have jobs.

1746
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:49,380
The animals have jobs and you run into some of the animals with jobs.

1747
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:51,780
And they're resigned that it is a living.

1748
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:52,920
Yes.

1749
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,420
But yeah, they don't leave though.

1750
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:57,620
They don't leave.

1751
01:42:57,620 --> 01:42:59,940
And actually this brings me to something I was going to say about the,

1752
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:02,660
not to jump around too much, but at the end of this ride,

1753
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:05,940
you go into this little room of interactive games

1754
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:11,220
that's themed to some of the places that you've been like Bedrock and Space City.

1755
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:11,860
Where do they live?

1756
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:15,220
I don't know the name of the jetty.

1757
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,140
It's not as memorable as space rock.

1758
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:20,740
Scooby-Doo just was like an itinerant wanderer.

1759
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:23,940
So you were just in a spooky graveyard and then a spooky castle.

1760
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:24,340
Yeah.

1761
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:24,580
Yeah.

1762
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:25,080
Yeah.

1763
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:29,300
A haunted amusement park, which we're already in an amusement park.

1764
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:30,500
So that's what it's supposed to be.

1765
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:31,540
A haunted amusement park.

1766
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:32,180
Not that one.

1767
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:35,700
Not the one in the ride, but that's just common where they are.

1768
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:40,660
And hanging out with Dick Van Dyke and the castle, that big castle that you go into

1769
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:42,100
looks a little like Cinderella.

1770
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,420
Oh, you think it's maybe a little dig?

1771
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:45,140
Maybe it's a little.

1772
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:46,420
I think it might be.

1773
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:46,900
Yeah.

1774
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:47,780
The stones are black.

1775
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:48,920
Yes.

1776
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,440
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1777
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:51,400
I can see that.

1778
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:57,720
Now, I look, I'm entering into 90s standup territory if I break down too much logic of

1779
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:00,600
the Flintstones animals and their jobs.

1780
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:05,800
However, I would like to point out specifically that in the thing after this,

1781
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,640
there's a keyboard that you jump around on like big.

1782
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:15,080
And when you step on the keys, a different bird squawks a note.

1783
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:19,720
And there's a video where they squawk the Flintstones theme.

1784
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:25,960
It's awful.

1785
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,640
It is awful to listen to.

1786
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:31,880
And that's like a coordinated song being played by this bird organ,

1787
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:35,320
let alone just the claptrap, a bunch of kids stepping on it.

1788
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:39,320
I'm going to go ahead and say I think maybe the worst place to work in 1990s.

1789
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,040
Oh, yeah.

1790
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:43,560
Studios must have been anywhere near this fucking bird organ.

1791
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:48,200
But all right, all the Flintstone animal jobs don't make sense.

1792
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:54,760
But in this case, there's nine birds and they all have to wait for a key to be stepped on.

1793
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:58,360
And they have to hit a note and they can't do any other note

1794
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:00,360
because or else the thing won't work.

1795
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:07,400
And this is how music was made in Flintstone times and then recorded onto a different stone,

1796
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:11,320
which was put on a turntable and played by a different bird by a bird's beak.

1797
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,120
Which I think they did once an episode.

1798
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:16,280
They got a lot of mileage out of that gag.

1799
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:18,360
The bird beak on the record?

1800
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:19,080
On the record, yeah.

1801
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,600
Yeah, I believe so.

1802
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,200
Maybe seven times.

1803
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:28,920
Yeah, and what always disturbed me is that the animals were always aware of this horrible

1804
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:29,640
existence.

1805
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:34,040
It's a living joke when they would dump garbage in the bird's mouth.

1806
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,560
Wasn't that what they would do?

1807
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:39,240
They'd dump their garbage in their bird's mouth and go, it's a living.

1808
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,680
And he'd look over at you.

1809
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:46,600
Or like the one, isn't it like a is it a hippo or a dinosaur where Fred punches his time card

1810
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:47,800
at when he's leaving?

1811
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:48,280
I forget.

1812
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,520
I think in the movie it's a hippo.

1813
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:51,160
Yeah.

1814
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,120
Chonk.

1815
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:55,400
And it's like they're all like they're all self-aware and they can talk,

1816
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:58,200
but they're like just my job is to buy time cards.

1817
01:45:58,760 --> 01:45:59,560
Eat garbage.

1818
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,680
And eat garbage.

1819
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:05,000
Which to be fair, what the cavemen are eating at that time is probably close to garbage.

1820
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:05,960
Yeah, that's true.

1821
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,320
So it's probably OK.

1822
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,760
It's not like highly concentrated sugars or anything.

1823
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:12,920
It's probably stuff from the land at the very least.

1824
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:19,160
And once again, like with the paradox of Goofy and Pluto, where Goofy is their friend and

1825
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:22,920
speaks, but Pluto also a dog is that they own.

1826
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:28,520
It's similar where Dino can't speak.

1827
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,800
So he's like a dog.

1828
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:34,680
However, probably has a better situation because he doesn't have to work.

1829
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,640
Oh, yeah.

1830
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:39,880
Yeah, as opposed to Fred's bulldozer, he operates that is a brontosaurus.

1831
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:42,600
But his car is just a car.

1832
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,160
His car.

1833
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:43,720
Yeah, yeah.

1834
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:44,600
I mean, they have to run.

1835
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:50,600
That's where they get a taste of their own medicine and have to make it function themselves.

1836
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:55,960
If you were a dinosaur who could speak and move things and build objects,

1837
01:46:55,960 --> 01:47:00,760
why wouldn't you just build a better big world for dinosaurs to live in?

1838
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:01,080
Yeah.

1839
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:02,360
Keep humans out.

1840
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:03,640
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

1841
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:06,680
Also, it doesn't make sense why their car is into dinosaur.

1842
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,040
Yeah, that's true.

1843
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:12,040
Because like a bus is an elephant, probably.

1844
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:15,080
I think I think there's a bus elephant in this ride.

1845
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:20,440
Can we agree the settings of the Jetsons and Scooby-Doo do not have the level of detail

1846
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,600
that bedrock does like bedrock?

1847
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:25,160
I feel like a living, breathing place.

1848
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:29,240
The Jetsons living situation interesting.

1849
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:29,480
Yeah.

1850
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:30,520
But I don't remember.

1851
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:35,320
I always remember they always had lots of gadgets that would serve their needs.

1852
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:37,640
But George was always fucking up.

1853
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:42,280
He would try to do a treadmill and it would go too fast and he would eat shit.

1854
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:42,920
Yeah.

1855
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:43,160
Yeah.

1856
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:46,520
He's like any of our parents dealing with tech.

1857
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:46,680
Yeah.

1858
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:48,520
Except Rosie.

1859
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:51,240
Rosie was good at her job.

1860
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,920
Rosie is tech.

1861
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:55,880
She is tech, but she's also an employee, technically.

1862
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:57,080
That is true.

1863
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:59,320
And kind of one of the family like Alice.

1864
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:02,200
Rosie is Alice for sure.

1865
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:02,440
Yeah.

1866
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:03,960
It's a very similar dynamic.

1867
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:08,120
And she's kind of like the to go in further back the character Hazel.

1868
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:10,920
Sort of like a maid with attitude.

1869
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,920
She almost she kind of sounds like Hazel.

1870
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,080
They were just stealing from each other.

1871
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:18,040
This is what we did in the old days.

1872
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,040
We stole from each other.

1873
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:21,880
Yeah.

1874
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:22,600
But you get up.

1875
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:27,000
The ride ends in space rock.

1876
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,120
They were in the space rock.

1877
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:30,040
I mean, the Scooby Doo segment is fun.

1878
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:35,480
There's not as like I said, not as much of a living breathing world like bedrock.

1879
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:37,720
And also it's just Scooby and Shaggy.

1880
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:38,600
Yeah.

1881
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:39,240
None of the other.

1882
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:41,400
No Fred, Velma or Daphne.

1883
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:41,880
Yeah.

1884
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:42,520
Yeah.

1885
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,760
Disappointment if you like eye candy.

1886
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:45,720
Or Scrappy Doo.

1887
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:48,600
Yeah.

1888
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:49,240
Sadly.

1889
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:50,280
And no great Gazoo.

1890
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:51,400
No great.

1891
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,280
Certainly no great.

1892
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:53,800
Character from the Flintstones.

1893
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:54,600
Yeah.

1894
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:58,680
Also, all alternate people who could have been mad like Dick Dastardly that

1895
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:01,000
that's maybe a plus up.

1896
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,240
Yeah.

1897
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:09,160
All of the left out characters and all of the fan disliked characters all team up together

1898
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,640
and kidnap a different child.

1899
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:13,800
That's fantastic world.

1900
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:17,000
What was Dick Dastardly's end game abducting that child?

1901
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:20,680
Holding him hostage to be the star of the next project.

1902
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:21,800
Until he got a contract?

1903
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,960
Until he got like a sag contract?

1904
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:26,680
Yeah. He was holding out for sag minimum.

1905
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:26,920
Yeah.

1906
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,520
Once like $920.

1907
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:29,560
Yeah, sure.

1908
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:31,160
It is crazy.

1909
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:35,240
Gazoo would have been perfect for this ride because he can make any he's like Q on Star

1910
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,760
Trek. He can like make anything happen.

1911
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:41,640
So like you could really like because this is as fine as this ride is.

1912
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:43,320
It's pretty by the numbers.

1913
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:47,160
Maybe it's because we've sort of seen versions better now after 25 years.

1914
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,040
That's maybe true.

1915
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:48,360
Yeah.

1916
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:49,960
Like at the time it might have been all cool.

1917
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,960
We're now in this land and we're in this.

1918
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:56,440
But like it's very like, OK, now we're in a very sort of boring version of bedrock.

1919
01:49:56,440 --> 01:50:00,040
And OK, now we're here and there's nothing like no surprises, no fun.

1920
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:05,560
Story wise, yeah, you go through like this haunted house and graveyard and Scooby and

1921
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:10,840
Shag. You're there and then you get transported to the future somehow or to space, whatever it is.

1922
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:16,040
And because the whole time, the zoo quippin and transportin you to places and like changing

1923
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:17,480
you into different things.

1924
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:20,440
The real hero of this ride, though, is Rosie.

1925
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:25,800
Rosie has an extendable arm and she plucks Dick Dasterly and Muntley out of the car.

1926
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:26,120
Oh, yeah.

1927
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:30,040
And that lets George catch Elroy and then she puts him back in the car.

1928
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:36,360
And then they plow into an amusement park ride vehicle and that are surrounded by police.

1929
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:44,520
Boy, we got to just synopsize the basics of the ride more often because, man, what a story.

1930
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:47,480
And Dick Dasterly ends up with a wig on his head.

1931
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:50,280
Boy, what a rough run for him.

1932
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:50,760
Yeah.

1933
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:51,880
He looks silly at the end.

1934
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:53,400
Looks so silly with that wig.

1935
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:57,960
The Jetson scene, I think visually is very like there's a lot of moving pieces in the

1936
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:58,840
Jetson scene.

1937
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:01,320
Yeah. And that future amusement park is cool, though.

1938
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,160
Is that a thing from the Jetsons?

1939
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:03,880
I don't know.

1940
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:06,280
Or do they have to kind of manufacture a new place?

1941
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:12,840
They would go to anything in like it's a gym, but the future it's a restaurant, but the future.

1942
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:16,360
So I'm sure there was like the state fair, but the future.

1943
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:19,160
Judy went to an amusement park with Jet Screamer.

1944
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:21,080
Like that has to have happened in that episode.

1945
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:21,480
I don't know.

1946
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:21,800
I'll call my mother.

1947
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,720
Judy was constantly going on dates.

1948
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:25,000
That's fine.

1949
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:25,480
What's wrong with that?

1950
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:28,360
Jet Screamer one day, Apollo Blue another.

1951
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,120
You sound like her dad or something.

1952
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:32,840
Well, I just when is she getting her schoolwork done?

1953
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:33,640
She's fine.

1954
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:34,920
She's got straight A's.

1955
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:37,720
I thought Elroy was the smart one.

1956
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:38,680
Who said Judy wasn't?

1957
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:39,480
Judy was smart, too.

1958
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:40,440
I mean, I guess they're both.

1959
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:41,240
I mean, they.

1960
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:46,280
She's like, hey, let's hope they got Jane's jeans and not too many of George.

1961
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:47,640
She was George.

1962
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:48,760
George had a good heart.

1963
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,960
It wasn't the brightest one.

1964
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,000
Yeah, that's true.

1965
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,920
Always making Spacely, Mr. Spacely mad.

1966
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:58,840
Well, Spacely was he was a tyrant.

1967
01:51:59,400 --> 01:51:59,880
Yeah, that's true.

1968
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:00,360
He was.

1969
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:00,840
He was.

1970
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:09,000
Yeah, he was like, uh, uh, the Elon Musk or Bezos or like a Howard Schultz kind of dumbass.

1971
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:09,800
Howard Schultz.

1972
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:10,040
Sure.

1973
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:11,960
Michael Bloomberg.

1974
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:14,200
Spacely was there ever a Spacely for president?

1975
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:15,400
Hmm.

1976
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:16,440
That would have been a good movie.

1977
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:17,400
Oh, I wonder.

1978
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:17,720
Yeah.

1979
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,080
Yeah.

1980
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:21,080
And like a predictive like that.

1981
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:25,240
Would like this move, this thing that was going around of this old TV show that predicted

1982
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:29,080
Trump and the character's name was Trump and he swindled a town.

1983
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:34,280
Like if there was a Spacely episode that predicted everything beat by beat.

1984
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,280
I'm just going to Google Mr. Spacely for president.

1985
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:36,920
What is that called?

1986
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:38,680
There's a dark Andy Griffith movie.

1987
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:39,640
Oh, yeah, it's like that, too.

1988
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:40,600
Face in the Crowd.

1989
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,160
Is that right?

1990
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,360
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1991
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:43,240
Yeah, yeah, I've seen that.

1992
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:45,080
Did you do?

1993
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:46,040
I didn't know this.

1994
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,720
Do you know Mr. Spacely's full name?

1995
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,120
No, I don't.

1996
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:51,880
Cosmo G. Spacely.

1997
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:53,000
Oh, I feel like I did.

1998
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:53,960
Now I'm mad.

1999
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:54,920
Yeah, Cosmo.

2000
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:55,400
Of course.

2001
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:57,080
God damn it.

2002
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:02,040
And then the other character was Mr. Cogswell, who owned the other company,

2003
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:03,880
who I think was nicer.

2004
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:05,320
Remember this guy?

2005
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:08,600
There's a tiny graphic for you guys to look at.

2006
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:09,160
Remember this guy?

2007
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,280
I do remember Cogswell.

2008
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:10,840
He was not.

2009
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,200
Yeah, he was always smiling.

2010
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,880
Yeah, he was not like Mr. Spacely.

2011
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:17,160
Spacely and Slater, like the same guys.

2012
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:19,000
Yes, the 100% the same guy.

2013
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,680
Yeah, Mr. Slater was Fred's boss.

2014
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:23,560
What an interesting construct that was.

2015
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:27,640
And it is still in entertainment where it's like, well, if you work in this industry,

2016
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:30,760
there's your boss, and then there's the rival company.

2017
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:34,200
Like there was always a Pepsi Coke situation.

2018
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:40,120
This implied that anyone works for a company or has the luxury of working for a company

2019
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:43,240
and staying there for more than nine months.

2020
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:46,040
We're recording this amidst massive layoffs.

2021
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:46,760
Massive media layoffs.

2022
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:52,200
You wish any of these BuzzFeeds had just the clean, simple, there's a mean man like Slate.

2023
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:55,000
But hey, I've been here for 25 years.

2024
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:59,000
Not bad work if you can get it.

2025
01:53:59,000 --> 01:53:59,640
Yeah, yeah.

2026
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:02,520
Boy, everybody should be jealous of Fred.

2027
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:03,400
Fred and George.

2028
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:04,440
Good, honest living.

2029
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,160
It's a living.

2030
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,680
That's what's going to happen to our generation.

2031
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:12,920
We're all going to have to start working as record players for richer people.

2032
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:16,280
We're going to have to bite records with our teeth.

2033
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:20,680
Someone's going to put garbage in my mouth for $8 an hour.

2034
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:23,560
You're going to be working for Howard Schultz.

2035
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:26,200
My mouth full of Howard Schultz's garbage.

2036
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:29,800
I'm going to be drawn in and out of being for a rich man's amusement.

2037
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:31,880
That sounds fun.

2038
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:32,920
Yeah, you got a good job.

2039
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:36,600
No, because I start to learn pain in seven months and then I'm erased.

2040
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:38,280
And you have to kill the other one.

2041
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:38,920
And then I come back.

2042
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:39,320
That's right.

2043
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:43,160
So will you really be you because you're a copy of a copy of a copy of you.

2044
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:48,840
And Mike, when you you'll eat garbage and say it's a living,

2045
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:52,200
but it won't be as fun as in the cartoon, like you'll try to say it.

2046
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:57,160
It's just cough blood because a tin can scrapes up your throat.

2047
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:00,520
It's not as fun as in the cartoon.

2048
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:01,800
Can I say a thing?

2049
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:07,480
I'd like to the ending in this ride when like Yogi lands on like a big cushion that says the end,

2050
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:09,960
he seems like visibly winded.

2051
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:13,640
I'm happy for him.

2052
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:14,520
He can get comfy.

2053
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,200
Thanks for joining me here.

2054
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:19,480
Like he's just like so he's kind of out of it.

2055
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:20,840
Like it's like, oh, I like that.

2056
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:23,240
It's this took this did a number on it.

2057
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:24,280
He's going to go rest.

2058
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:29,240
Are you upset that it's a thread left hanging that you don't know whether or not he got the sandwich?

2059
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:34,920
Well, I'm just happy he's freed from the the tyrant, Ranger Smith, like Ranger Smith.

2060
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:39,720
Was his space like kind of kind of the same dynamic because he was always trying

2061
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:41,800
to chase him out of the Jellystone National Park.

2062
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:48,280
Yeah, I mean, I guess Yogi wasn't supposed to be eating those pick a neck baskets.

2063
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:48,520
Right.

2064
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:52,280
No, he was that Ranger was just like a joyless man.

2065
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,760
If they were I don't I didn't see the new Yogi bear, which is a couple of years old.

2066
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:57,880
Did anyone see that?

2067
01:55:57,880 --> 01:55:58,680
The movie?

2068
01:55:58,680 --> 01:55:58,920
Yeah.

2069
01:55:58,920 --> 01:55:59,480
Oh, it's good.

2070
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:03,320
The voices of Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake.

2071
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:03,880
Yes.

2072
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:04,840
It's so good.

2073
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:09,880
It's really good.

2074
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:13,080
I'm going to be sick, man.

2075
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,760
Could it be that he still steal picnic baskets?

2076
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:19,160
Because I feel like that would be a modern studio note of like,

2077
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:22,840
he can't steal the baskets because that makes Yogi a thief,

2078
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:27,400
but he could steal the baskets and give to the poor or if you have to root for.

2079
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:29,960
Why are we rooting for Yogi?

2080
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:31,000
He's that it's theft.

2081
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,600
What he's committing is theft.

2082
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:33,960
Yogi is committing theft.

2083
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:36,120
The Ranger is Ed, right?

2084
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:37,160
Isn't the guy who played Ed?

2085
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:38,840
He's the character Ed.

2086
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:39,640
Yes, from the show.

2087
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:40,600
From the show Ed.

2088
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:43,800
And then of course, noted psychopath TJ Miller.

2089
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:44,920
Oh, yeah.

2090
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:51,000
This podcast goes there.

2091
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:53,560
Why not?

2092
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:56,440
I don't know that that is so big of a swig.

2093
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:57,640
No, I don't.

2094
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:57,960
Yeah.

2095
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:02,600
Look, he might admit to such himself.

2096
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:03,080
Sure.

2097
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:03,320
Yeah.

2098
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:05,160
Yeah.

2099
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:09,240
And while the studio, the note that they did have to take about the picnic baskets

2100
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,800
is that they had to contain crystal head vodka.

2101
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:13,160
Well, sure.

2102
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:16,840
Did he sound like Dan Aykroyd?

2103
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:17,960
Was that guy Milky Bear?

2104
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:21,560
He kind of did a boo boo boo.

2105
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:22,920
He did do a voice.

2106
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,200
He sort of did.

2107
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:27,480
Do you think he and Murray ever get together and go,

2108
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:31,480
man, we were just a couple of dreamers once just

2109
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:34,920
running around the streets of New York, high as shit.

2110
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:39,880
And now I'm Yogi and you're Garfield.

2111
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:41,240
Can you believe it?

2112
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:42,680
We really made it.

2113
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:46,280
I mean, those characters have brought joy to generations of people.

2114
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:49,880
So I hope they're respectful to those intellectual properties.

2115
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:50,840
And hope they are aware.

2116
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:54,760
And if they get together, then maybe they're having this whistle moment

2117
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:57,400
and then they bump into Amy Poehler, who is, of course,

2118
01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:00,680
a Chippette.

2119
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,040
One of the Chippettes.

2120
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:03,880
Yeah, I couldn't come up with it.

2121
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:04,840
Is she Brittany?

2122
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:07,400
Is she Althea?

2123
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:08,360
What are their names?

2124
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:10,440
I'm falling out of my cartoon facts.

2125
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:11,160
I can't remember.

2126
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:15,000
I think as a kid, I was like, this is preposterous.

2127
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,240
There are the Chipmunks and the Chippettes.

2128
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:18,360
You weren't into the Chippettes?

2129
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:23,800
I know I liked the Chippettes, just the conceit bothered me as a kid.

2130
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:27,320
I was like, so there's three perfect female doppelganger.

2131
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:29,240
This is were it only that simple.

2132
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:31,160
Were it only that simple?

2133
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:31,660
Yeah.

2134
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:34,120
Jeanette, Brittany and Eleanor.

2135
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:40,200
OK, I like them as characters, but thinking I like the Chipmunks and the Chippettes.

2136
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:48,680
And Dave had a lot on his hands raising three Chipmunk boys with no other as a single parent.

2137
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:51,640
Did we ever meet like the Chipettes version of Dave?

2138
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:55,640
Did they have like a female Dave or were they part of Dave?

2139
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:56,040
I don't know.

2140
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:58,200
Was she in love with Dave?

2141
01:58:58,200 --> 01:58:59,560
Well, no one was in love with Dave.

2142
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:01,000
That was probably the problem.

2143
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,200
He's in love with his work.

2144
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:03,880
Who was sadder, Dave or John?

2145
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:04,680
John Arbuckle.

2146
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:05,480
John Arbuckle.

2147
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:13,560
I think Dave's more aware of being sad, which is sad in its own right, but John is not self-aware.

2148
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:17,320
He doesn't realize what a cruddy life he has, but also he gets like a girlfriend, right?

2149
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:19,560
Yeah, Dave's got a girlfriend.

2150
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:20,360
He's got a steady thing going on.

2151
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:21,160
John or Dave?

2152
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:22,440
Not John.

2153
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I think John had flames on and off.

2154
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,040
Yeah, John's got it.

2155
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:26,360
John's got curls.

2156
01:59:26,360 --> 01:59:30,920
Dave had to manage those Chipmunks' career too, and that's another headache.

2157
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:33,560
Yeah, and that's the scene I'd like to see in the movie is like,

2158
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:36,760
do you have any idea the sacrifice I've made for you?

2159
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:38,440
I've given up everything.

2160
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:41,080
I haven't had sex in 20 years.

2161
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:44,920
Every day, contracts, booking stadiums,

2162
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:50,520
getting the rights to cover songs for you to sing because you don't ever write original songs.

2163
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,600
Driving all night to get to state fairs.

2164
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:57,800
Chef or owning dates with your exact equivalents.

2165
01:59:57,800 --> 02:00:00,040
And then there's a scene with the Chipmunks are in the room with,

2166
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:04,200
and I can't think of the Mike Myers character from the Ray Foster.

2167
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,160
Ray Foster.

2168
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:08,120
A bunch of Chipmunks in a hit band.

2169
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:12,600
Teenagers will never bang their heads to a bunch of Chipmunks.

2170
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:15,640
Christmas time is here is how many minutes long?

2171
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:21,000
It's a musical opera.

2172
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:23,560
I couldn't go as high as the Chipmunks.

2173
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:29,160
Well, we ended up on another the wrong cartoon characters.

2174
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:30,280
We ended up with the wrong.

2175
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:32,680
And we also look, there's probably a lot more we could say,

2176
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:35,480
but I'll be damned if this is the longest episode of I guess.

2177
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:36,920
Or that doesn't make any sense.

2178
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:38,120
We're about two hours.

2179
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:40,040
Boy, well, I guess now's the time any.

2180
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:45,400
Well, I boy, I gotta say, guys, I had a fun time.

2181
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:46,040
I had a fun time.

2182
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:47,000
I sure did.

2183
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,760
I sure did.

2184
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:49,960
Did I have a good time?

2185
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:51,560
Yes, I sure did.

2186
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:52,920
Well, two things I want to say.

2187
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:56,760
Well, one, in terms of a plus up, a plus up for a different ride.

2188
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:00,120
I think they should have done the Simpsons like this.

2189
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:03,320
It should have been CGI Springfield and 2D Simpsons.

2190
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:03,960
Yes.

2191
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:09,320
I think that would have been very interesting to see with 2007, 2008 era technology.

2192
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:09,640
Great.

2193
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:13,080
I think it's a little weird that there's I get why they did it,

2194
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:15,640
but isn't it surprising the first time you went on it

2195
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:18,520
when you get up to the top of that hill and like, whoa, what?

2196
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:19,240
Yeah, I think.

2197
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:19,960
I think CGI.

2198
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:24,040
I think I don't remember if I thought that it looks like the

2199
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:30,520
Treehouse of Horror episode where their computer or comers, at least computer animated.

2200
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:30,920
All right.

2201
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:31,480
Yeah.

2202
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:35,400
So I thought about that, but then it's like, yeah, seeing them that way the whole time.

2203
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:39,880
I get that they're thinking like, oh, three dimensions makes you feel more like you're in it,

2204
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:41,160
but it doesn't really.

2205
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:41,960
It doesn't.

2206
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:44,840
As long as the background kind of has some dimension to it, I feel like.

2207
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:50,040
Here's my other thing that makes Fantastic World of Hanna-Barbera stand out from

2208
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,040
all other theme park rides.

2209
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:59,080
When this ride closed, Paramount Parks got the license to run it in their parks.

2210
02:01:59,080 --> 02:01:59,720
Oh, right.

2211
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:02,200
So this showed up in other parks.

2212
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:04,600
Canada's Wonderland.

2213
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:07,480
Canada's Wonderland and the other Paramount Parks.

2214
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:11,640
And then when that license expired, it was replaced with SpongeBob SquarePants 4D.

2215
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:17,640
The film also showed at Kentucky Kingdom with its original name, the park at Moa

2216
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:20,680
under the name Yogi's Big Rescue.

2217
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:21,880
And for one.

2218
02:02:21,880 --> 02:02:23,560
What a diss to the other characters.

2219
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:23,880
Yeah.

2220
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:25,240
Make it Yogi's thing.

2221
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:28,600
And then it showed up Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, baby.

2222
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:32,200
Dollywood under the name Yogi's Wild Ride.

2223
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:32,680
Hey.

2224
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:34,200
2007.

2225
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:35,160
2007.

2226
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:36,200
2007.

2227
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,960
That's a late arrival.

2228
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:39,080
For a while.

2229
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:39,400
Wow.

2230
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:44,520
2009 was when the Paramount Parks kind of got stripped of all the Paramount and other

2231
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:45,240
licensed stuff.

2232
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:45,720
Huh.

2233
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:48,360
Universal's trash is Dollywood's treasure.

2234
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:49,000
Treasure.

2235
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:49,320
Hey.

2236
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:56,440
All I would say is I want to underline how much I love the Great Gazoo and I want him

2237
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:57,400
in more media.

2238
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:58,760
Get him in there.

2239
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:00,280
OK.

2240
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:05,000
My plus up is just that you get to the next land or you get to the next room.

2241
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:09,960
You get into the vehicle and the screen comes on and it's Hannah and Barbara again.

2242
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:11,960
And they say, just kidding.

2243
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:13,960
You're just going to watch us eat our lunch.

2244
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:18,600
And then they're silent for a minute and a half.

2245
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:22,280
And then finally like, boy, this horseradish tastes good.

2246
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:24,920
It sure does.

2247
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:28,840
We've been eating horseradish since 1962.

2248
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:32,440
Horseradish and sardines on rye.

2249
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,040
Is there a better lunch?

2250
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,120
I ain't found it yet.

2251
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:38,280
They, I sure ain't.

2252
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:41,560
And then I'll make you happy, Mike, and the Great Gazoo can show up.

2253
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:41,880
All right.

2254
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:42,360
Thank you.

2255
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:45,320
And they're like, no, hey, can't you see we're eating?

2256
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:46,760
We sure are.

2257
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:47,720
And then he goes away.

2258
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:48,120
Oh, sorry.

2259
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:51,640
Keep eating your slop, dumb-dumbs.

2260
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:55,080
All right.

2261
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,920
You survived Podcast the Ride.

2262
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:58,280
That was a blast.

2263
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:01,880
Thanks for joining us on this fantastic episode.

2264
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:06,200
And there's a whole new world of fantastic content over on the second gate,

2265
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:12,360
patreon.com slash podcast, the ride and check us out on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.

2266
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:13,720
Hey, Reddit.

2267
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:15,560
We got the somebody set up the Reddit for us.

2268
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:20,360
Yeah, reddit.com slash slash r slash podcast, the ride.

2269
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:22,440
And our Reddit is still nice and it's fun.

2270
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:24,680
I think I think no one's being a monster on there yet.

2271
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:25,800
No division.

2272
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:26,920
Facebook group too.

2273
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,200
Also very nice.

2274
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:29,640
I would say let's do this fun thing.

2275
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:30,600
We were talking about this.

2276
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:36,360
Rate and review us on the Apple Podcasts, but let's do a little fun thing.

2277
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:39,480
Once you obviously give us five stars because that's the quality of this.

2278
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:46,680
If you were making a character, what kind of neck wear would you put on them

2279
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:49,320
to make it easier on the animators?

2280
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:51,080
Make the old man draw you better.

2281
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:52,120
Would it be a scarf?

2282
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:53,560
Would it be a stethoscope?

2283
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:55,560
Maybe it's a doctor character of some kind.

2284
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:59,080
You tell us in the Apple Podcasts in the comments section.

2285
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:00,120
So say five stars.

2286
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:01,320
Great podcast.

2287
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:06,520
I would add a dickie like Big Bird wears when he's dressed up.

2288
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:07,320
Five stars.

2289
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:08,120
Oh, yeah.

2290
02:05:08,120 --> 02:05:09,640
Info always accurate.

2291
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:12,360
They remember their cartoon character names perfectly.

2292
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,720
And I'm a boa man.

2293
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:20,600
And if we didn't touch on any Hanna Barbera characters, obscure ones or popular ones

2294
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:26,440
that are your favorites, I'm going to say this tweet them at us because I am so cute.

2295
02:05:26,440 --> 02:05:31,960
Now I'm worried I'm going to spend the next seven days just going down Hanna Barbera

2296
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:32,840
wormholes.

2297
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:36,520
And I would like some assistance of finding oddball Hanna Barbera.

2298
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,720
I am worried there's a big one that we missed, but we'll find it.

2299
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:40,840
We'll talk about it later.

2300
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:43,080
Maybe we haven't done one lost and found episode.

2301
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:45,320
Maybe we'll cover some of your favorites.

2302
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:48,360
There's a lot more Hanna Barbera theme park stuff.

2303
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:51,480
Like once just crawling around, like you'd find little things.

2304
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:54,920
And I don't know if I were to go down that rabbit hole, how much there is, but just

2305
02:05:55,560 --> 02:06:00,360
the Flintstone thing that closed like in the last couple days is this weird roadside attraction

2306
02:06:00,360 --> 02:06:01,720
thing that was around for 50 years.

2307
02:06:01,720 --> 02:06:03,240
And there's got to be something in there.

2308
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:05,000
Like we'll touch up on this.

2309
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,560
Probably rats and raccoons in there.

2310
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:11,240
That's all that'll be there soon enough.

2311
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:12,520
They love to eat that trash.

2312
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,520
It is a living for them.

2313
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:17,240
It's a pleasure.

2314
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:19,000
It's a pleasure.

2315
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,280
It sure is.

2316
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:22,200
Thanks for listening, folks.

2317
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:25,560
