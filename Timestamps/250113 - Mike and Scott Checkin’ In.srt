00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Welcome to what I promise you will be the shittiest podcast,

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,000
the ride you've ever heard.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,320
I'm Scott Gardner and I'm sorry in advance,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,440
joined by Mike Carlson, who I assume is similarly contrite.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,920
Oh yeah, I am contrite and I'm thinking about

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,760
what you just said and I guess that's true,

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,320
but I also, that gives me a freedom, you know?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,060
When you say this is gonna be so bad,

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,280
I kind of actually relaxed for the first time ever

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,040
when I started doing like a recording.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,640
So I go, wow, that's great.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,760
Cause you've had the pressure of this could be the best one

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,600
or it could be the shittiest one if we aren't careful,

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,560
but no, this I feel, I think this is good

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,960
when we're looking for good news here

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,720
and I think this kind of like takes the pressure off

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,800
because there'll be that discussion as time goes on.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,720
What was the worst episode of the show?

19
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,820
Let's just say it, it's this, it's gonna be this.

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,720
It's this one, we're doing it because it's gonna be,

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,960
there's a couple of things, it's gonna be short,

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,480
we are missing a host, it's on Zoom,

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,080
we've got bummer stuff to talk about

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,600
and I'm really confident a baby

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,440
is gonna start screaming soon.

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,400
And then, you know, there's a door here,

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,600
but I think that baby's gonna power over that door.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,820
I think you are gonna hear the baby,

29
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,280
so I think it's good that I weren't.

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,960
Okay, yeah, well, let's see if the baby comes in on the mic.

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,920
It'll be interesting to know

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,720
cause that'll be baby's first podcast recording as well.

33
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,440
So it'll be something that'll be important

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,080
to capture as well, I think.

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,920
Yes, I think it'll be treasured by me and the listeners

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,280
when you hear just a faint, aah, aah.

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,080
But you'll bring that, yeah, you'll bring it up,

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,840
I'm saying like when the baby is older

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,660
and you'll say, look it,

40
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,840
this is the first time you ever podcast it.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
That'll be nice.

42
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,200
I hope to God the last.

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
If I have anything to do, if I raise this kid right,

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,860
it's gonna be the last.

45
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,000
The only jobs left.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,120
I can't control the tides of the business.

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
Yeah, 30 years from now,

48
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,280
that's the only job that's gonna be left as podcasters,

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,200
so I think we should just accept it right now.

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,360
Yeah, and everyone will need seven of them

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,200
to make ends meet as opposed to the mere six of currently.

52
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,520
Yeah, look, hey, I'm happy to be talking to you, Mike,

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,360
and we're just doing this as kind of a little check-in

54
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,920
to explain where we're at.

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,020
So, you know, we usually,

56
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,080
I specifically look forward to the first episode of the year

57
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,360
being like full of energy and well rested

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,880
and maybe like a big ride or a new ride, you know,

59
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,640
to come back guns blazing.

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,880
And right now I feel like, if I could talk about,

61
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,880
I believe this ride closed, Kingda Ka,

62
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,600
I think Kingda Ka is down,

63
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,200
the one that's just kind of, it's a launch in New Jersey,

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,000
and it's where you just go way up a big hump

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,240
and then down the other side.

66
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,740
You know how sometimes they'll launch that ride

67
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,080
and it won't make it,

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,200
and it just goes all the way back down to the station

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,840
and like, whoops, didn't, that's how I feel about,

70
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,920
the 2025 launch is a real Kingda Ka fail

71
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,280
on multiple levels to put it in,

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,920
I think we have to put it in roller coaster terms

73
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,080
so people understand.

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,560
Yeah, that's how our audience understands that kind of talk.

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,860
So that, thank you for doing that.

76
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,160
That's all they understand.

77
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,720
There's no other metaphor that would make sense

78
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,360
other than the very relatable Kingda Ka.

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
Right, right, of course.

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,840
Which RIP, Kingda Ka.

81
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,320
Anyway, that's a complicated and stupid way to say

82
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,080
that things are crazy, our city is on fire,

83
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,760
and that has kind of prevented us from doing things

84
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,840
the way that we'd like to be doing things.

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,800
Now the big headline is that the three of us

86
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,960
are all safe with all that.

87
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,120
Mike, you went down to San Diego,

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,960
not due to any particularly strong danger,

89
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,160
but just a precaution and a more comfortable place to be.

90
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,760
Is that a correct assessment?

91
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,240
That is a correct assessment.

92
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,440
We certainly live by a big bunch of mountains

93
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,280
and the air was bad, so we said, let's get out of here.

94
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
And we're very lucky.

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,360
Yeah, yeah, you've got a place to go, absolutely,

96
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
and yeah, because not everybody does

97
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,200
and to have family close, it's been really key.

98
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,600
So we're happy to say the three of us are safe.

99
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,760
When we just posted something, maybe on X,

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,520
it makes me nauseous still to say X.

101
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,880
We said something that maybe alluded

102
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,120
to how the week is going, and I just wanted to read this.

103
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,640
This is from the user Diddy Thump,

104
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,720
and I thought this was a pretty good little burn of us.

105
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,560
Looking forward to the presumably entirely normal

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,280
and uneventful evacuation process

107
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,760
that all three of you had.

108
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,840
Now, we did not really all evacuate,

109
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,280
so it's not necessarily accurate,

110
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,320
but this is a listener who's worried about us going to lunch

111
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,920
and I think correctly so.

112
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,520
He's heard the tales of woe just to go from a hotel

113
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,880
to a mall and what happens, but can we prove

114
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,200
Diddy Thump wrong though, or was it fairly orderly?

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,880
I mean, look, again, we were lucky.

116
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,960
We just sort of were getting out, so it wasn't anything.

117
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,360
There was people that had to leave at the drop of a hat,

118
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,080
so everything was fine.

119
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,600
I will say I stopped in Buena Park on the way down here,

120
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,440
which I think is actually smooth.

121
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,840
It's like, that's, again, that's a nice,

122
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
that's a luxury to be in Buena Park,

123
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,720
the greatest city in the world, and I ate a Portillo's.

124
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,920
Well, it's all under any circumstances, it's a luxury,

125
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,840
but especially now, now more than ever.

126
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,480
But I did eat a Portillo's,

127
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,280
and yes, I took all the essential stuff with me,

128
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,120
but I also did take belly bomb off of the shelf,

129
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,080
my prized NECA toy that I believe looks a little phallic.

130
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,000
Some people don't, but I do,

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,040
but he's one of the greatest figure.

132
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,520
That was like a,

133
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,640
that was a prized possession that you took was belly bomb?

134
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,040
I looked around the office and I said,

135
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,800
let me just take a couple things and throw it in the bag.

136
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,240
I didn't pack everything up, but I said, you know what?

137
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,320
I took the basics and I took the belly bomb

138
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,880
and I was right to do it.

139
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
Well, what are the, I think we've been seeing some stuff

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,600
about the six P's of evacuation.

141
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,840
There's passports and there's pets

142
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,000
and there's personal belongings,

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,600
but I think the seventh P is penis resembling toys.

144
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,280
I think that's right, yes.

145
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,760
I think that is correct, and I should make my own list.

146
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,800
To say, yeah, get a penis resembling toy

147
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,680
and then get a beef and cheddar croissant

148
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,680
if you can manage it in Buena Park.

149
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,200
Well, wait a minute, Portillo's.

150
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,240
Portillo's is the AC.

151
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,040
Damn, you're right. Wow, wow.

152
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,720
And ninth points, make sure that all of,

153
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,080
make sure that your points are safe.

154
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,480
Yes, yes.

155
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,400
Which I guess means bring any credit cards that contain,

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I mean, the points really aren't on the card,

157
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,200
but just make sure that your points are in order,

158
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,000
because you might need them more than ever.

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
Right, now, and yeah, this digital age,

160
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,360
you don't necessarily need a card

161
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
that contains all your Landry's points

162
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,520
or your Jersey Shore points.

163
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,080
That's all on your phone usually,

164
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,440
but just make sure you have that in order.

165
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,640
Yes, that's important.

166
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,400
Yeah, oh, and if you don't, oh my God,

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,360
well, and again, a couple episodes ago,

168
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,680
I gave you guys Jersey Mike's gift cards,

169
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,400
which are physical items,

170
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
and now the fire has taught me,

171
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,080
don't ever do that again.

172
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,800
Make sure that it's only digital,

173
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,160
because what if those went?

174
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,200
What if the Jersey Mike's,

175
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,920
what if those are Shore points that are no more points?

176
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,120
That's very, yes, you're right.

177
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,520
I think I left the unused gift card at home,

178
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,800
now that I'm thinking about it.

179
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,720
You were mentioning your baby was gonna

180
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,080
make its presence known on your end.

181
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,800
My daughter is just trying to open the door

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,360
as if it's like a serial killer trying to get in the room,

183
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
like fighting for her.

184
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,000
It's a forensic raptor.

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

186
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,680
I think she was.

187
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,000
If it needs to happen, again,

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,560
that's why I wanted to take the pressure off.

189
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,360
If suddenly there is some Mike fumbling,

190
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,240
if she wants to come in and actually,

191
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,640
hey, look, everybody could use a cheer up.

192
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,280
If she wants to give her thoughts about belly bomb on Mike,

193
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,360
I think that would be a cheer up for everybody.

194
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,600
I think I made it through mine.

195
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,040
I believe the crying was distant enough,

196
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,600
and maybe he's gone.

197
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Yeah, so that threat has passed, if not all have.

198
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, so keep your eyes on the door.

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,600
Here's the other theme parky thing I wanted to mention

200
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,160
as this is all going down,

201
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,440
is that again, I think probably we wanted,

202
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,720
the plan was like, well, you know what?

203
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,320
New year, new ride, we can come out with Tiana.

204
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,800
We could finally do Tiana,

205
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,160
and I had this cursed pass

206
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,080
that I've been blacked out on for a month,

207
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,240
but I'm like, okay, so the first,

208
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,800
you know what, I'm gonna schedule this for early January

209
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,400
when everything should be safe and fine and normal,

210
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,240
and I'll get down and do Tiana,

211
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,360
and then we could talk about Tiana,

212
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,520
and then the day that I had planned for months, of course,

213
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,160
is when all the shit went down.

214
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,760
So that blows that season premiere.

215
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,320
But Brightside, in the midst of darkness,

216
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,560
as we all know, Disneyland has the no-show policy.

217
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,440
You only get three no-shows,

218
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,480
and I wasn't sure enough if I was gonna do it

219
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,880
to cancel the night before,

220
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,120
because as far as we knew, it was like,

221
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,720
it's gonna be windy, get ready for some wind,

222
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,280
and nobody knew how crazy this was gonna get,

223
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,640
including apparently the mayor

224
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,040
and a lot of other important people

225
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,800
didn't seem to know or do anything.

226
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,160
So anyway, I was getting worried.

227
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,600
Obviously, my biggest fear in all this

228
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
was getting one of three no-shows,

229
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,120
which do you know the brackets on that?

230
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,880
How long is the no-show period?

231
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,960
Is it a month, or is it 90?

232
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,840
Well, you're saying between no-shows?

233
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,080
Because I understand it, and I may be wrong,

234
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,960
so somebody correct me.

235
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,080
My understanding is that you still just keep your no-shows,

236
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,520
and once you get three, then you're banned for 30 days.

237
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,680
Now, that could be wrong,

238
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,200
but this is off the top of my head.

239
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,040
I think that-

240
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,200
I got 90 in my head.

241
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,160
I think there's a 90 in there.

242
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,920
Maybe it's that you can't do it in 90 days,

243
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
and then you're banned for 30,

244
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,120
or is it you can't do it within 30,

245
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,400
and then you're banned for 90?

246
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,520
I don't think you're banned for 90,

247
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,320
but I could be wrong.

248
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,160
I should look that up.

249
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,000
That's tough.

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,440
That's a reasonable prison sentence.

251
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,280
It really is, yeah.

252
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,400
Yeah.

253
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,840
I guess I'll look, because I accidentally,

254
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,040
I even mentioned this in the show,

255
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,920
I've accidentally given my sister a second no-show.

256
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,920
I was supposed to cancel a reservation on a family trip,

257
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,400
and I forgot, or it didn't go through or something,

258
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,240
and she was like,

259
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,200
I don't want another no-show on my record,

260
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,280
and I remember looking in the morning,

261
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,840
and I still had her on there, and I went,

262
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,920
I fucked up, I screwed this up.

263
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,640
So now she has two, so she's close.

264
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,800
You inflicted a no-show onto your own family?

265
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,640
Yes.

266
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,720
This is, oh boy, how are you living with yourself?

267
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,760
I don't know, it's not easy, it's not easy,

268
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,360
but I'm doing my best.

269
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,760
I'm in a lot of therapy.

270
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,720
You'll reconcile with this in your autumn years.

271
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,080
This is gonna be more of an article search, I think,

272
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,600
to find out exactly the details on this.

273
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,400
Well, I'll say this while you're looking.

274
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,840
Here's the good news, is that for that stretch of time,

275
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,160
because so much of the city was on fire,

276
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,560
the Disney corporation was exceedingly generous,

277
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,760
and they overturned all of the no-shows

278
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,400
for at least a day or two.

279
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,480
So I do not, unlike your sister who is less fortunate,

280
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,720
I have zero of three right now,

281
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,440
and I just wanna say to the Disney company,

282
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,240
it's been a tough time, and I see you,

283
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,400
and I recognize what you did for me,

284
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,520
and there's that quote, Mr. Rogers, look for the helpers,

285
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,880
and I'm thinking about that more than ever.

286
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,520
Nothing helps me more than having a blemish removed

287
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,320
from my Disney permanent record, so thanks for the help.

288
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,720
Walt would be proud.

289
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,600
You have a clean record.

290
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,040
This is so hard to find.

291
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,840
I mean, I surely got it in an email,

292
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,320
because now you get it.

293
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,080
Like, okay, hey, welcome to your Disneyland trip awaits.

294
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,960
All your friends are gonna be there, Mickey and Minnie,

295
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,240
but do be aware that if you are a no-show,

296
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,120
Mickey will remember it, and he will mention it the next day.

297
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,680
If and when you were allowed to come back into the park,

298
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,000
Mickey will bring it up, he will whisper it into your ear,

299
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
it's like, hey, happy to have you,

300
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,800
but just so you know, we know.

301
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,920
Just so you know, we know, we remember.

302
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,200
You know what, I'm finding some interesting details here,

303
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,040
like adults must replace the photo

304
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,120
that's attached to their pass every 10 years.

305
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,960
So to make sure you have, yeah, so you have to-

306
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,600
Is it DMV aspect to it?

307
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,240
Yes, apparently, and you must replace

308
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,680
your child's photo every three years.

309
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,880
That's interesting.

310
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,720
I didn't know that before.

311
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,320
Kids grow, you know?

312
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,400
A three-year-old is not a six-year-old,

313
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,720
and they gotta keep tabs on them.

314
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,760
Right, interesting.

315
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,080
So 10 years, I think I've, yeah, I had a new,

316
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,880
I guess I got a new one in 2021, probably.

317
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,080
So 2031 is when I'm gonna have to,

318
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,200
I'm gonna really have to make sure, like,

319
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
I take care of myself so I look good

320
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,360
in my 2031 Disneyland annual pass.

321
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,680
Finally a motivator, oh my God.

322
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,480
I mean, now the thing is, I mean,

323
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,560
general fitness is gonna help you with that,

324
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,600
but really, you're kinda only dealing with it

325
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,520
in most shoulders and above.

326
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,520
So if you want your calves to get real flabby,

327
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,440
that's fine, you could gain 100 pounds if it's all leg,

328
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,200
but you're gonna wanna keep the shoulders and up look,

329
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,200
which means, like, which is also skincare,

330
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,880
it's exfoliating, it's trimming that beard.

331
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,720
Right.

332
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,160
It's really, it's all upper stuff.

333
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,440
Yeah, so maybe even if, maybe I could just wear, like,

334
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,840
a Mission Impossible mask in 2031, too,

335
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,400
if I'm not happy with how I look,

336
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
and it'll, like, a handsomer,

337
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,240
I guess I have to wear that then every time I go to the park,

338
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,200
so that wouldn't be a very smart thing to do,

339
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,520
but maybe I'll really-

340
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,960
Oh, to match every time they scan, yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,400
I'll get, like, a makeup artist, though,

342
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,080
to do something to my face before I get that photo taken,

343
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,280
just so I can look good in that photo,

344
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,440
because that's something I care about.

345
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,600
I cannot find the answer to this question.

346
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,360
I'm looking through these GD details,

347
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,960
and it's really hard to find.

348
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,880
I don't feel like doing it.

349
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,440
I don't feel like opening a tab, clicking around.

350
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,280
I don't feel like doing it either.

351
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,160
I wanna put it down.

352
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,880
Not having a third person, it's harder.

353
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,400
I'm happy, thank you for going for it.

354
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,720
Again, I look to the helpers,

355
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,840
thank you for helping trying to decipher the no-show policy,

356
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,520
but I don't think I'm gonna do it.

357
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,880
Although, as I said, shittiest episode ever.

358
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,280
If there was ever one to just go blank for four minutes,

359
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,200
it's just silence and then, like, click, click, click.

360
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I don't know if you're getting that click on, Mike.

361
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,760
No, I don't think so.

362
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,840
No, okay, well, just like the baby.

363
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,720
Okay, well, maybe it's not the shittiest episode.

364
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,560
We're only recording what we need to be recording.

365
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,400
Yeah.

366
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,680
But here's the thing, though.

367
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,080
We wanted to have a little fun and goof around a little bit,

368
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,960
but there is, of course, like, you know, stuff is terrible.

369
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,640
It is tough in the city.

370
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,680
Everyone, we were saying before we started recording,

371
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,960
everyone at least is a friend of a friend of somebody

372
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,200
who has lost their home or evacuated.

373
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,360
Yeah, lost everything.

374
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,560
And everyone's just going through, yeah, yeah.

375
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,400
It's crazy.

376
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,800
Everybody's going through it.

377
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,440
It's all palpable and it's just, you know,

378
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,560
like the mood ain't great regardless of your situation.

379
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,680
If you are a person who has been struggling through this

380
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,880
or something terrible happened or you know somebody,

381
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,920
our hearts go out to you.

382
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,560
And if there's any way we can help or signal boost anything

383
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,200
anybody needs, please let us know.

384
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,840
I don't know what we can do.

385
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,680
I mean, we look forward to making you laugh in the near future,

386
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,040
but God knows if we can, like, use the socials to, you know,

387
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,160
to do any good or spread the word.

388
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,480
I want to put that out there if we could.

389
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,320
Here's the other thing.

390
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,080
And there is there's no easy way to transition into this.

391
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,000
But as all of this was going on unexpectedly,

392
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,400
and unfortunately, Jason's dad, Michael Sheridan, passed away.

393
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,000
And we don't want to say too much about that.

394
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,720
We'll leave it to Jason if he wants to address that any further

395
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,880
on the show at some point.

396
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,240
But mainly for now, we're heartbroken for him

397
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
and for the Sheridans and for Jane.

398
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,120
He's joined in the family and our hearts go out to them

399
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,280
and thoughts and condolences.

400
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,560
Anything you want to add to that, Mike?

401
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,880
You don't have to, but we're thinking about her, buddy.

402
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,920
That's exactly what you said.

403
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,880
And it's, as you said, heartbreaking.

404
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,440
And in the middle of all this chaos and sadness

405
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
that was happening already.

406
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,720
So, yeah, needless to say, Jason could take some time away

407
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,720
from the show and he will be back.

408
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,240
But, yeah, whenever he feels like he's ready to come back

409
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,320
and goof around, obviously he takes as much time as he wants

410
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,880
and we'll hopefully see him soon.

411
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,720
But, yeah.

412
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,600
Yeah, that's the point.

413
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,040
And hopefully, the thing we can offer

414
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,640
is goofing around with him again

415
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,400
because we'll miss it while we're not doing that with him.

416
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,120
And, I mean, all that being said,

417
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,480
let me just shift to here's the plan.

418
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,240
Here's what's going on in general.

419
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,600
You're right about Jason.

420
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,560
And with all this, I think we've conveyed

421
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,960
through all of this how nuts everything is.

422
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,640
And thus, here's what we've decided

423
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,880
and why we're checking in.

424
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,560
We are going to take the rest of January off

425
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,440
on the main feed.

426
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,520
Just collect ourselves, get back in the same place,

427
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,640
focus on our families, give Jason the space he needs.

428
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,880
We feel like we are not currently in a place

429
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,760
to do the quality of show that we want to be doing

430
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,320
and the quality of what the eight episodes a month

431
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,080
we end up doing that we want.

432
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,760
So we figure if we take a little time, we'll get there.

433
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,720
So that's the plan.

434
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,480
It is our hope and our goal to be back

435
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,440
on the main feed in February.

436
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,360
Things could change, but that's the hope

437
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,800
and this is what we're gonna try here.

438
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,360
So I guess we're asking for your patience

439
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,160
and your understanding as we navigate these choppy waters.

440
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,440
And it's unfortunate, we're sorry that it is this way

441
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,920
because we were just off for three weeks

442
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,800
and that we're extending it out.

443
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,920
But hey, we didn't expect any of this

444
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,920
and I don't know, hopefully you understand.

445
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,640
Yeah, and then we're still doing

446
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,720
the other Patreon episodes that are coming out.

447
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,200
There's an episode that we've already recorded

448
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
with Jason that's coming out.

449
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,920
Oh yes, the Club 3, yes, there's a very fun Club 3 episode

450
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,840
about the Space Mountain opening,

451
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,160
so that happened already.

452
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,160
And then you and I, yes, as far as Second Gate and Club 3,

453
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,000
we wanna make good on those commitments

454
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
to everybody who so kindly supports the show over there.

455
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,680
So you and I will figure out some stuff to do.

456
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,760
We'll screw around and do some low pressure fun.

457
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,120
Yeah, there's some fun ideas.

458
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,880
Keep the hits coming.

459
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,200
Yeah, there's some fun ideas happening.

460
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,440
We just have to reorganize and get it together

461
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,000
and then those will be out in January.

462
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,280
Yeah, yeah, right on.

463
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,680
So that's the thing, sorry.

464
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,680
So if you are missing us and you need a good boy fix,

465
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,520
things will still be happening on Second Gate and Club 3,

466
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,080
which is at patreon.com slash podcast the right.

467
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,160
As we said, Jason, probably out for a little bit.

468
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,160
We'll just, yeah, the door's open whenever he wishes.

469
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,440
We'll be looking forward to his return.

470
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,560
And just, also, I just thank you again,

471
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,320
anyone who's supported the show over the years.

472
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,160
That's just, and especially in times of crisis,

473
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,880
that is meaning very, really means a lot to us, I think.

474
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,720
More than one way.

475
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,200
No, I'm kidding.

476
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,200
I know, this is making me flash to the addressing.

477
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,160
So there's this pandemic that you might've heard.

478
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,000
There's a whole other thing that was probably us going,

479
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,120
so I guess we'll be on this Zoom thing for a few weeks

480
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,840
and then it ended up being a year and a half.

481
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,080
And many of the people listening right now

482
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,440
were with us through all of that

483
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,480
and were like a reason for us to goof around,

484
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,360
be creative, and have fun together,

485
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,280
even when things are crazy.

486
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,120
So I'm flashing all that.

487
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,960
I'm thankful for that.

488
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,920
I'm thankful for everybody now.

489
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,880
And that's a good opportunity to say that, absolutely.

490
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,960
Yeah, yeah.

491
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,960
So yeah, we'll be having some fun there and we'll be back.

492
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,800
Fingers crossed we'll be back in the same city fairly soon.

493
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,800
And I don't know, I always thank the people working in LA

494
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,880
that are doing good work.

495
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,040
Thank you to those people.

496
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,240
I don't know, I just wanna, it's crazy watching it.

497
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,760
I'm sure everybody's watching videos of stuff.

498
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,080
People flying these helicopters,

499
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,400
I don't know if you've been watching this shit.

500
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,680
I'm obsessed with this,

501
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,800
the people doing drops with the water.

502
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,640
Have you seen this?

503
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,480
Have you seen this?

504
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,000
Well, yeah, there's these ones that are going around

505
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,960
that are like so ace-nailed and it feels incredible

506
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,040
to watch a raging fire just be done in two seconds,

507
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,120
because that's what we wanna see more of.

508
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,440
And boy, yeah, it's exciting to get a great feed of one.

509
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,280
It is crazy, these people are awesome doing this stuff.

510
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,320
So yeah, all of that is thank you to those people

511
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
and everyone else helping.

512
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,520
Does it qualify as a ride?

513
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,880
Do we, can we, does it qualify as a ride

514
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,400
if you're flying those helicopters

515
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,840
or just in the helicopters helping in some way

516
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,360
or is that too exciting and interesting?

517
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,680
Mm, it might be too exciting and interesting.

518
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,880
I guess I'm warning for future

519
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,280
if we were to have a helicopter flight,

520
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,760
like a firefighter, a helicopter firefighter

521
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,200
on the show at some point.

522
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,440
I think it's like in the same way that like,

523
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,440
if you go, man, I love the Mexico Pavilion at Epcot

524
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,120
and then somebody goes, yeah, but you go to Mexico

525
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,320
and you go, yeah, but that's too real.

526
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,960
I think maybe these are helicopter and plane flights

527
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,800
that put out fires.

528
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,480
They're too real, you know,

529
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,080
that's too legit to be a ride, I think.

530
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,320
But I'm thinking this all the time,

531
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,040
so somebody could prove me wrong.

532
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,760
Yeah, all right, yeah, so temper the excitement a little bit.

533
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,960
Yes, yeah, for sure.

534
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,480
Yeah, no, absolutely, though.

535
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,160
Thanks to everybody and hey, you know,

536
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,320
just thanks for the understanding.

537
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,360
Also thanks for the understanding of us

538
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,240
awkwardly poking around very special episodes.

539
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,920
I think this is a thing we are not good at doing.

540
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,000
I'll speak for myself.

541
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's something I don't feel good at doing.

542
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,040
We even had to do, like, I'm like,

543
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,720
we better try to say a bunch of funny things

544
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,240
in the beginning or I'm gonna be in trouble here.

545
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,960
That's all I know how to do.

546
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,080
My brain is broken.

547
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,160
How do you deal with serious things?

548
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,600
I know, anytime I ever do anything serious,

549
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,920
I like, I go, oh, I didn't say that right.

550
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,120
And then I, I told you, I said a couple weeks ago

551
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,400
how much I like, I stress out about just normal sentences

552
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,680
that I say week to week on the show.

553
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,280
But then when I have to say a serious sentence,

554
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,760
oh boy, does my anxiety shoot up.

555
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,280
I go, did I say that right?

556
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,000
People can understand what I meant.

557
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,360
So I hear you, I'm with you.

558
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,120
I would rather, I would be rather making jokes

559
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,560
about inflatable stuff, for sure.

560
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,320
That's my comfort zone.

561
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,080
That is the biggest thing that is gonna be off the table

562
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,920
for a little bit.

563
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,740
It's disgusting.

564
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,320
What has been my greatest joy?

565
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,040
It's really, you know, I think I have like a podcast

566
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,520
favorite toy for a while, like the dog chewed toy

567
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,000
that he just wants to attack and ruin.

568
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,320
And you're lucky that inflatable stuff came up

569
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,200
because that's my new favorite toy

570
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,680
that we're gonna have to set it aside for a while.

571
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,200
Because in the lead up to that,

572
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,600
it was definitely only listening to half

573
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,440
of Olivia Rodrigo's guts.

574
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,080
That was my, oh my God.

575
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,160
I was, the best toy I've had in a long time.

576
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,080
So you're very lucky.

577
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,440
So Olivia, half Olivia is getting eased off on

578
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,960
and maybe inflatable stuff too.

579
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,800
Okay, great.

580
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,640
Yeah, I hear you.

581
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,920
Well, we'll have to find new stuff,

582
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,520
which is I think is like, I was just,

583
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,560
I just discovered a couple of another Michael Eisner

584
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,320
like ideas the other day that I don't,

585
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,680
I forget if we've talked about like the wedding

586
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,480
of Mickey and Minnie, have we talked about that?

587
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,600
No, let's give people some hope into what we can talk

588
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,500
about soon, please.

589
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,240
Let's just, you know, let's open the doors

590
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
to the brainstorming process now.

591
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,040
For some better episodes to come.

592
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,920
Yeah, there was an idea that Michael Eisner

593
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,960
had of a year long celebration leading up

594
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,560
to the wedding of Mickey and Minnie.

595
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,080
I've never heard this, really?

596
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,000
Never heard it before, yeah.

597
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,720
So I was like, oh man, okay.

598
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,680
So that honestly, that was like a day or two ago.

599
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,280
Oh shoot, I forgot that guy.

600
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,680
I forget his channel.

601
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,320
This guy mentioned it on his channel.

602
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,200
I really should shout him out,

603
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
but I'll shout it out when we do the episode.

604
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,040
Here in LA, we've been in this realm

605
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,880
of the loud emergency alerts going off.

606
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,400
And I was watching the news when all the anchors got loud,

607
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,280
like somebody was on screen talking and then,

608
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,280
and then everybody off screen in waves.

609
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,440
Like there's the other anchors

610
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,480
and there's the camera people

611
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,640
and there's the people in the booth

612
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,000
and all the phones are going off.

613
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,600
It was wild to watch that happen on live TV,

614
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,920
especially because that's the one that was wrong

615
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,880
where they told, it was like everyone evacuate

616
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,120
and that was meant for only a specific area.

617
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,240
The people, everybody has some complaints

618
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,400
about how everything's going in LA right now.

619
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,440
In terms of the people who supposedly run the city.

620
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,520
But anyway, I say all that to say,

621
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,760
I wish to God that in a crazy emergency alert like that

622
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,800
would pop up on my phone.

623
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,600
And then I checked it and it said,

624
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,360
Michael Eisner once planned a year long ceremony

625
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,600
celebrating Mickey and Minnie's wedding.

626
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,440
That's the only thing.

627
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,000
And I would, if I got that alert at 4 a.m.,

628
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,240
I'd be happy I got it.

629
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,960
I wouldn't be mad that my sleep was interrupted.

630
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,400
If anything that crazy, call me about,

631
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,880
text me about, there's no time,

632
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,240
that's a bad time to hear about Mickey and Minnie's wedding.

633
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,520
I had a similar dopamine hit when I heard about this.

634
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,720
So yeah, it was very, very exciting.

635
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,560
That's right.

636
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,680
You know, I think we've talked about before,

637
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,160
but it just seems like a cousin of the,

638
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,640
and there's maybe not enough meat on the bone

639
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,600
for a full episode, but that whole,

640
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,120
the thing where he wanted to,

641
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,200
here in our neck of the woods, Burbank,

642
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,600
God bless Burbank, lately it's been nice and safe for us,

643
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,600
but that straddling riverside drive,

644
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,280
which currently, if you've ever been around the Disney lot,

645
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,160
there is like, there's ABCs on one side of the street

646
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,640
and then the main lot is on the other side.

647
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,680
And now there's a bridge that connects the two

648
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,160
and the animation's over there too.

649
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,160
But the idea was that for that, where that bridge is,

650
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,040
straddling the two sides of the lot

651
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,640
was gonna be a big hotel shaped like Mickey.

652
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,200
There's gonna be a big Mickey

653
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,640
in what very quickly leads to just an equestrian neighborhood.

654
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,840
It's just ranch style houses where people have,

655
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,000
you know, barn stables and stuff.

656
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,320
And that, so you would drive into your beautiful like ranch,

657
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,760
your 1940s ranch home under Mickey Mouse's legs.

658
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,160
And this was an Eisner plant.

659
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,600
This was Eisner trying to be bold and like,

660
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm here, I'm new, this is the kind of shit I want.

661
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,480
I don't even know if I like it,

662
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,640
but I'm putting it on the table.

663
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,120
I mean, that would change the city for,

664
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,000
like if that was there,

665
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,280
if you were always driving under Mickey's crotch every day

666
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,440
to your home, to your horse.

667
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,000
I found, there's the video, I saw that information

668
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,960
which is from the YouTube channel Midway to Main Street.

669
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,960
And it's five abandoned Eisner era ideas.

670
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,360
And that is the Mickey hotel is in there.

671
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,600
Oh, okay.

672
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,440
Oh, so it's very related.

673
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,240
And it was like, I don't,

674
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,840
maybe we talked about this detail and I forgot,

675
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,640
but his idea was that the rooms would be in the legs.

676
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,720
We must have, we must,

677
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,600
because there's no way we haven't discussed it.

678
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,280
Like some room ultimately,

679
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,520
unless you like floor 13 it and just block the space up,

680
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,960
but some room is going to have to be Mickey's balls.

681
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,360
Yeah, of course.

682
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,680
That would be, I hope a suite at least.

683
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,040
That would be a bigger area to live in.

684
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,560
But yes, you would,

685
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,400
well, in the short-

686
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,880
What if also, what if also just kind of like

687
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,000
the rain gutter for the entire thing,

688
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,840
just like whatever, like the plumbing,

689
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,200
whatever like the vents,

690
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,760
that it does all lead ultimately to Mickey's asshole.

691
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,120
If you ever see like liquids or steam

692
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,160
coming out of the Mickey hotel,

693
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,640
it hills all right out of the boat.

694
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,560
Look, if I was planning it,

695
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,240
I would argue that the steam should be vented from the ears

696
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,400
to at least make him seem like he's mad sometimes,

697
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,000
but it might make more sense to vent it from his asshole.

698
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,280
So an engineer is somebody who would have to come up

699
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,600
with that, explain it to me why it has to be vented

700
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,440
from there, but I would try to get it out of his ears

701
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,400
to at least make it a fun thing

702
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,120
that like Mickey's upset today.

703
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,840
Like if the, you know, everybody's-

704
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,440
Well, you'd have to pitch it to Eisner.

705
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,280
Where's the steam?

706
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,200
We all know that hotels have to release steam

707
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,880
frequently, but what part of Mickey's body

708
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,560
is the steam gonna come out of?

709
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,160
Well, it could come out of his mouth

710
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,360
and people would think he's like blazing up.

711
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,760
Like you could like, like all of a sudden Mickey like

712
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,920
blows a big plume.

713
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,040
That's cool, man.

714
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,360
And a nice tribute to, you know,

715
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,520
Michael Eisner who must have been blazing up

716
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,320
to think of an idea like that.

717
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,520
He's so, yeah, he's so out there with his ideas.

718
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,120
Somebody commented on it.

719
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,080
We were talking about Eisner stuff

720
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,920
and I saw the comment like,

721
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,680
so he was doing buckets of cocaine, right?

722
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,280
And I'm like, that's a funny thing to say

723
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,280
about 80s executives and you know, maybe,

724
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,560
but like, is that his vibe?

725
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,400
Is this- No, I don't think so.

726
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,760
Because on TV, is the vibe of somebody

727
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,880
who does buckets of cocaine, hello?

728
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,400
I don't- I don't think so.

729
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,240
Yeah, yeah.

730
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,080
I think- You see, you can watch 80s footage.

731
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,480
You can watch people on talk shows and go,

732
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,080
there you go, there's one.

733
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,240
But I don't know if- Yeah.

734
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,640
Eisner strikes me and I don't know,

735
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,080
maybe he says this in any of his books,

736
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,400
but he strikes me as like a big coffee guy.

737
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,920
Like a guy who drinks like multiple pots

738
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,120
of coffee a day or something.

739
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,760
Like he does have that energy sometimes

740
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,520
when you see old clips of him,

741
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,440
but it doesn't feel like that druggy to me.

742
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,400
But I don't know. No.

743
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240
I don't think so.

744
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,160
But it feels like he has an exuberance and an energy

745
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,320
and it feels like it would be just like,

746
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,400
like how Trump drinks 12 Diet Cokes a day or something.

747
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,080
Like it feels like it might be something like that.

748
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,440
Like a legal drink that has caffeine in it.

749
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,600
And just a terrible unending supply of it

750
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,520
that's terrible for you.

751
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,920
And yet you maintain well into your later life.

752
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,440
I don't know. There's no telling

753
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,800
what could happen, yeah.

754
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,160
Well, something we could explore in the near future

755
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,280
is what was Eisner on?

756
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,520
It's a great question.

757
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,320
We could- Was it drugs?

758
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,080
Was it just natural highs?

759
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,440
Was it just the magic of Disney?

760
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,760
At least that, that we know.

761
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,720
All I know is whatever he was on in the early 90s,

762
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,680
I'll have what he's having.

763
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,000
That's what I say. Oh boy.

764
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,160
We could use some of it right now.

765
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
I'll tell you that much.

766
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,120
Well, there's a little taste of A,

767
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,040
how we deal with serious things.

768
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,160
And B, what we'll try to do

769
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,120
while things are a little wonky here.

770
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,440
But boy, we'll miss Jason participating in that.

771
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,680
And hopefully he's back and hopefully

772
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,960
we're all back to normal as soon as we can.

773
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,400
So I guess for now, you survive podcast the ride.

774
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,520
And yeah, you know, it's just good to know.

775
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,720
Door closed on shittiest episode.

776
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,120
We never need to revisit this again.

777
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,720
Yeah, we have our answer.

778
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,520
No need to get into the debate.

779
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,560
I'm gonna cause the debate by saying that, ugh.

780
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,360
Well don't- Oh yeah, that's true.

781
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,520
Keep that amongst yourselves.

782
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,600
I don't wanna see a thing about it.

783
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,680
This is the worst episode.

784
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,200
You just heard it, we did it.

785
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Yeah, text your friends if you wanna talk about

786
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,280
bad stuff, bad episodes we've done.

787
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,560
Because yeah, we don't need to read that.

788
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,160
We do not need to be, so look.

789
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,440
Not right now, please.

790
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,280
Not right now.

791
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,720
Everybody's dealing with a lot.

792
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,760
Sincerely, really hope everybody's safe.

793
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,280
And if you haven't been, that you're getting

794
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,720
the relief and the help you need,

795
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,560
let us know what you need.

796
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,480
And even if it's just making you laugh,

797
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,680
we'll certainly try to be doing that.

798
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,040
Thanks for your patience, everybody.

799
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,880
Appreciate it and have a good one.
