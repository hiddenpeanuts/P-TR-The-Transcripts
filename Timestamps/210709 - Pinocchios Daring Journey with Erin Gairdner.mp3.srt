1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,480
Warning, the following podcast contains abusive wood, a sad man's clock room, a father and

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,260
son reunion, and the real life fairy tale of competing on the magical game show, The Price

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,260
is Right.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,360
Aaron Garner returns to tell us the tale and talk Pinocchio's daring journey on today's

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,680
podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,040
Hi, diddle-dee-dee, a podcaster's life for we.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,520
This is Podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
I'm Scott Garner joined by Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
Hi.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
Joined by Mike Carlson.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,440
When I thought about what joke we might make, it was exactly that joke.

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,320
Hey, all right.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,160
Great minds think averagely.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,520
I said, yeah, Scott doesn't have anything.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,720
I got something in the chamber, something real original.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,160
You know, it felt nice and jaunty to say it.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,360
Gave me the boost I needed.

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
Jason Sheridan.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
How are you?

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,440
And if you'll take a look at my notes, I also have hi-deedle-deedee, a podcaster's life.

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,040
I written down.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,280
This is across the board the same?

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,240
Yeah, completing the Patrick.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,160
I wasn't smart enough to land on we.

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
I said me.

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,880
Oh, that I think was the key change.

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,400
I think that's the little bit of magic.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,960
If we were on match game, we would have all matched.

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
That's right.

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,880
If Gene Rayburn were asking us to fill that in.

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:45,040
You know, it's funny you mention that because we are joined by a game show luminary today.

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,920
Long running game show luminary.

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,380
Besides that, well, there's a list of superlatives that I wanted to say that are new since the

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,360
time our guest was here, which was way back in the City Walk saga.

37
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,240
Which was I think it was that like nine years ago now.

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
That's how it feels.

39
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
That's right.

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,280
But since she was here last, she's the designer, not just of our main logo, but of the second

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,040
gate logo and our best piece of T public merch, Potana Kush, our beloved Potana Kush.

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,620
She and I also since last time she was here, we collaborated on a human being.

43
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,440
That's an ongoing project.

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,680
It's going well.

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,880
And but most importantly, she's a recent winner on the price is right.

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,600
Erin Gardner, come on down.

47
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,200
Happy to be here.

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:37,640
Oddly enough, I also had hi diddley dee podcasters life for we so we've got the full match.

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,840
You guys match the couples match the couples match.

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,920
Written on your hand.

51
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,560
Thank you for bringing it in.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Thanks for being here.

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Good to have you.

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Thank you for having me.

55
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,480
We were going to do this back in what was it?

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
February of 2020.

57
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Yeah.

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,560
And then I got bronchitis and then COVID happened.

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,120
So we were going to do this episode a very long time ago and I thought it was going to

60
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,200
be second gate bronchitis to.

61
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Yeah.

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,160
Remember I was super, super sick in February when I was pregnant.

63
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,080
I don't remember that because so many things that one's completely left my head.

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,920
And also it was that I think there was a date set and then we found out fries was closing

65
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,800
on the day like that all happened.

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,520
So so many things conspired to make this episode not happen, which was potentially going to

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,320
be the announcement of our son of you expecting.

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,040
It was almost going to happen.

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,240
Of your little wooden boy.

70
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,680
We're still waiting for him to become a real boy, but he hasn't found the courage yet.

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,720
Yeah, he's got to prove himself.

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Yeah.

73
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Pure of heart and truthful.

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
Well, he's a little dick right now.

75
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,720
So I'm just kidding.

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,360
He's John and Gideon smoking American spirits in the back.

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,440
He's on Pleasure Island right now while you guys are here.

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Because he's not with you.

79
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,560
No, I mean, I don't know where he is, honestly.

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,840
No, he's offending for himself.

81
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Yeah, he's learning.

82
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
He's getting his virtue.

83
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,560
His first word is tobacco.

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,280
That's why it's like almost difficult to talk about this topic today.

85
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,840
It feels like a preview of what years of parenting are going to be like.

86
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Yeah.

87
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Extremely harrowing cigars.

88
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
A lot of cigars.

89
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Tons and tons of cigars.

90
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,840
Snatching cigars out of a child's mouth constantly.

91
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,720
That's what Jason's childhood was like.

92
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,360
You know, if it's what the 1930s were like, then thank God we live today.

93
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,680
This is such a grim, the film really.

94
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
Way back when we were going to do that, I think we watched the movie in preparation.

95
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,280
If you have a faint memory of that.

96
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,400
We did.

97
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
And it's horrifying.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,080
I loved Pinocchio when I was a kid.

99
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,240
It was one of my favorites.

100
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
It was like Cinderella, Pinocchio.

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
Those were probably one and two.

102
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,560
And it is horrible to watch now.

103
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,880
I don't know if you've watched the film recently.

104
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,160
I have not watched it.

105
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
I was actually in preparation.

106
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,480
I read what the original story was, which I will read a piece of it at a certain point

107
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,400
today because it's very funny to me.

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,840
But I was watching some clips of it.

109
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
I loved it as a kid.

110
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,000
But yeah, it's the nightmare inducing.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,440
Yes, it's it's it cracks me up that it's like family like film because to me it's horror.

112
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
This is a horror film.

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
I might as well be watching Saw.

114
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Yes.

115
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,240
I mean, there's definitely like it starts with like kind of a Cronenberg style, like

116
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,160
come to like something that shouldn't be turning into a human turns into a human.

117
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Hundred percent.

118
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
There's so much body horror.

119
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,480
So much body horror and Pinocchio.

120
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,040
Between the nose and the and the donkey stuff.

121
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, the donkey stuff is very disturbing.

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,400
I get like hot thinking about it.

123
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,440
Like when I watch things that make me like just psychologically uncomfortable, I start

124
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,600
to shake and get like hot like hot flesh.

125
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Not hot.

126
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,440
You don't get it's not a it's not a turn on.

127
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,240
OK, no, let's be clear.

128
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,400
I get like like somebody get me a cold towel because I feel like I'm going to faint.

129
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Yeah.

130
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,160
Pinocchio's hero's journey is not dissimilar from like one of the Indiana Joneses where

131
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,400
he's just constantly getting his ass kicked.

132
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,480
But he doesn't get to do any ass kick.

133
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Like Pinocchio doesn't kick anyone's ass.

134
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,520
No, he just constantly gets manipulated and fooled and tricked.

135
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
He's a child.

136
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,800
He's a freshly born child.

137
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,440
He's like an impossibility like like like doesn't shouldn't exist.

138
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,000
He's a child like.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

140
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
You mean saying he's godless like a monster.

141
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Yeah.

142
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,560
Does he get does he have the soul?

143
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,880
Does he prove he has a soul or does the blue fairy when she grants him boyhood give him

144
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
a soul?

145
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
That's it.

146
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,640
Does his daring journey is what gets him the soul?

147
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Yeah, I guess.

148
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,160
Yeah, but even but it is a journey in which he has no agency.

149
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,480
He's just shoved from bad room to bad room.

150
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Yeah.

151
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
It's worse than the last.

152
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,760
Then the last bad room is the sea.

153
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,640
And yes, the room is a whale.

154
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,240
The room is inside a whale.

155
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,680
Why is and Geppetto is that disgusting that like he is an old man and he like he never

156
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,440
found love like you know his backstory.

157
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
And that's really presumptuous.

158
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
I don't know.

159
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Maybe you might.

160
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Maybe he had a barren wife.

161
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Well, now that we're not.

162
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
I thought we were to start with.

163
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,080
She was made of what was all splinters inside.

164
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
We're going to have to start with Pinocchio here and then we'll get back to Price is Right

165
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,600
because I was looking through the original story Pinocchio.

166
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
This is just the Wikipedia.

167
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
I did not get the book.

168
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
I'm a very terrible reader.

169
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
I'm an idiot.

170
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm terrified of this because every it's always like the Little Mermaid is so nice.

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,120
Well, you know, the origin, the original.

172
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,600
Well, she was nine and got gutted by a hook and like they're always so horrible.

173
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,960
But after America sings, all rides are now a mercy.

174
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
All rides are a blessing.

175
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Oh, yeah.

176
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,920
This is a this is a great attraction.

177
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,520
I will say this, even though some of the stuff is depressing, I laugh out loud at least two

178
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,840
times per paragraph of the original Pinocchio.

179
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Right.

180
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
Settle in.

181
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,920
So so so bear with me here.

182
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,040
There's a lot of this and you cut me off of this doesn't become interesting anymore.

183
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,880
A carpenter named Master Antonio, but whom everyone calls Master Cherry has found a block

184
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,920
of wood which he plans to carve into a leg for his table.

185
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,600
Sorry, Antonio and Cherry.

186
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Who are these?

187
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
I don't know.

188
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
These are new.

189
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,280
These characters, I believe, were cut out of the original Disney movie.

190
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,960
When he begins, however, the log shouts out, frightened by the talking log.

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,560
Master Cherry gives it to his neighbor, Geppetto, an extremely poor man who plans to make a

192
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,640
living as a puppeteer in hopes of earning a crust of bread and a glass of wine.

193
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,960
Isn't that what we're all looking for, though?

194
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Accurate expectations, I think.

195
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Yes.

196
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,960
He's a DIY content maker, just like us.

197
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Exactly.

198
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Press some bread, please.

199
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,960
I am but a poor streamer, good eye.

200
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,960
But a poor podcaster, may I trouble you for a food box subscription sponsorship?

201
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Jason holding the old Dickens cup.

202
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Like the poo.

203
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
The tin cup.

204
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Robin Hood.

205
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Almost for the porn.

206
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
He's got the glasses on.

207
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Pinocchio already has a mischievous attitude.

208
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,960
No sooner than Geppetto is finished carving Pinocchio's feet does the puppet proceed to

209
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,960
kick him.

210
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Once the puppet has been finished and Geppetto teaches him to walk, Pinocchio runs out the

211
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
door and away into the town.

212
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,960
He is caught by Kara Beener, I think, who assumes Pinocchio has been mistreated and

213
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
imprisons Geppetto.

214
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Well, that's awfully different.

215
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Don't recall an imprisoning scene, no.

216
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Okay, so left alone Pinocchio heads back to Geppetto's house to get something to eat

217
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
once he arrives at home.

218
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,960
A talking cricket who has lived in the house for over a century warns him of the perils

219
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
of disobedience and hedonism.

220
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Him being very elderly is a strange detail.

221
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Yes.

222
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,960
In retaliation, Pinocchio throws a hammer at the cricket more accurately than intended

223
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
to and accidentally kills it.

224
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
No!

225
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Now, I don't know the page count of this, but within your synopsis it seems like this

226
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
happens within two minutes.

227
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Immediately.

228
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
I think this is page seven.

229
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
This is first act.

230
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,960
A 120-year-old cricket is felled as soon as he meets this screeching block of wood.

231
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Where is the cricket?

232
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
The cricket didn't consult.

233
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Does Geppetto know about the cricket?

234
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Are they friends?

235
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,960
I feel like the cricket would be like, I don't know about that block of wood, man.

236
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
I feel like avoid this guy.

237
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,960
It's not very well-created, like a sitcom or there's a common place where they all know

238
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
each other and there's a connection.

239
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,960
These are all disparate characters and species that have no central hub.

240
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,960
No right being in a story together, that's for sure.

241
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
No, they're all different tales.

242
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
It's like a big car crash is why they're all meeting.

243
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
It is like the movie Crash.

244
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,960
But it was puppets and the movie Crash.

245
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,960
They modernized and changed all the names based on original Carlos Colodi.

246
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Is that the name?

247
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Crash?

248
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
No, no, no, no.

249
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
They made the writer of Pinocchio.

250
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,960
I don't believe that's Brendan Fraser's character's name.

251
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Does Brendan play the author of Pinocchio in the movie Crash?

252
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Wow, I guess that's crazy.

253
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
I didn't realize that.

254
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
He's 120 years old.

255
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:19,960
He has an unpleasant Pelebird monologue about different woods have different shades.

256
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,960
And you're like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, you can't.

257
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
You cannot do this.

258
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
This beat broke back mountain.

259
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Jesus.

260
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
One more and I'll be done.

261
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
I swear.

262
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Pinocchio gets hungry and tries to fry an egg.

263
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,960
But what comes out of it is a little bird that flies out the window, forcing Pinocchio

264
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,960
to leave the house to ask for food.

265
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Then he knocks on an old man's door to ask for food.

266
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,960
The man thinking that Pinocchio is one of the hooligans who ring the bell for fun.

267
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,960
And instead of giving him a good piece of bread, all he gets is a bucket of cold water

268
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
on his head.

269
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,960
Wet Pinocchio comes home and lies down on a stove.

270
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
But the next day he wakes up, he falls to the ground with burned feet.

271
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Luckily, Gepetto is released from prison and makes Pinocchio a new pair of feet.

272
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,960
In gratitude, he promises to attend school.

273
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Gepetto sells his only coat to buy him a school book.

274
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,960
The end.

275
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,960
That's four paragraphs into like 25 paragraphs on Wikipedia recapping original Pinocchio.

276
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I love it.

277
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,960
The rest of it's not going to be nice.

278
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,960
If that's some of his little journey.

279
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,960
But then these people did not live happily ever after.

280
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,960
If that's just a slice of their life, it's just horrors every day.

281
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Burning your feet, Pinocchio is going to need new feet daily.

282
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Honestly, he's lucky if he laid down on a stove and the only thing he burned was his feet.

283
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Oh, yes. If he was all the way reclined, yes, that's half of his body.

284
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Hasclap. Hasclapful.

285
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Hasclapful.

286
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Is exactly what I meant to say.

287
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Nice lesson.

288
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,960
So bizarre.

289
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,960
How could Walt Disney have known about this and thought, now this is the tale?

290
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,960
All of those things they made nicer.

291
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,960
All of those awful, I mean, not awful, but just scary.

292
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Now some of them are awful, but scary children's stories.

293
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
He probably liked them as kids.

294
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:23,960
I read for this one that an animator had gotten a hold of a newer translation of Pinocchio and pitched it to Walt.

295
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,960
And Walt was like, you know, into it, delighted by it.

296
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Or what have you.

297
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
There's a more pleasant version.

298
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Oh, I'm sure it was way more pleasant.

299
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
I'm sure.

300
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
And I have to say, I agree.

301
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:48,960
When I watched the movie as a kid, I found it very unnerving, but I made sure to ride this when I went back to Disneyland and stuff was reopening.

302
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,960
And riding around, I was like, I like this ride.

303
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I feel like I didn't have this ride as a kid because it was Disneyland exclusive in America.

304
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,960
So I was like, oh, this is this has a lot in common with Mr. Toad.

305
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
It's like the level of weird and scary.

306
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
This is about what I could handle as a kid.

307
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I feel like these kinds of rides.

308
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Yeah. Well, let me let me tee up, Aaron, because you're here to talk about Pinocchio, because if there's somebody more enthusiastic about this ride, I haven't met them.

309
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,960
We've been to Disneyland so many times and you just like you're magnetized to it.

310
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
You sprint up to it.

311
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
It is such a joy.

312
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
My favorite ride at Disneyland.

313
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Wow.

314
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Ride at Disneyland.

315
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
Yeah, you will.

316
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,960
I might be the only person in the world who can say that.

317
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,960
I can't imagine this being anyone else's favorite ride.

318
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Maybe somebody somebody related to Carlos Colodi, maybe somebody, a great, great grandson or something.

319
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Yeah.

320
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:54,960
How can how how to begin to explain why this ride is of all the rides of all the wonderful attractions?

321
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,960
I feel like I'm going to backtrack immediately, though, because this doesn't sound like a reason to like.

322
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,960
But I think that it is neglected shitty.

323
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,960
You know, that's a reason to like, it has no right being at Disneyland.

324
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
It just confounds me.

325
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,960
And that's why I love it so much.

326
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Would you say it's like you mean like lo fi when you say shitty, like in the sense that like it's those flats like as opposed to a lot of shitty.

327
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
It's OK.

328
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,960
So if you look at all of the other fantasy land rides, it doesn't get any attention.

329
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Like it just I feel like it needs a couple of 60 watt light bulbs and that would help it out.

330
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,960
And they're not going to give it to them.

331
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
It's just it's dark.

332
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,960
There's no need to be a reinvest in Pinocchio.

333
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,960
That was a big takeaway last time we went that Chippetto is calling to him after Monstro and he doesn't have a light on him anymore.

334
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,960
It's just like worst.

335
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,960
This attraction is crumbling and I love it.

336
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,960
It's been crumbling for decades and every time I go, it just tickles me.

337
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,960
It's a good point because it is definitely the least popular of the four Disneyland Dark Rides.

338
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,960
100% and now with Snow White getting a redo, which I think makes it so much better.

339
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Even this thing is way distant last place at this point.

340
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Yeah, if you did a poll, yeah, that would have to show up around five percent or something.

341
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
I was going to say zero.

342
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,960
Like I can't imagine anybody who runs to this ride the way I do.

343
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,960
But I also like it because like I think people are going to tear me apart for this.

344
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,960
But I feel you stay away.

345
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
I read it. People I feel like Mr.

346
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Toad gets too much credit for being the fucked up ride.

347
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
You know what I mean?

348
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Because Mr.

349
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Toad, everyone's like, oh, you go to hell at the end.

350
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
That one's like crazy.

351
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
And like, can you believe that this is a Disneyland?

352
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Go on Pinocchio's daring journey because it is ten times scarier, way darker.

353
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
They swear in it.

354
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,960
They do a cuss.

355
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Yes.

356
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,960
It's just it's it's terrifying.

357
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
They live.

358
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
OK, there's in the end of Mr.

359
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Toad's wild ride, you go to hell.

360
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,960
But Pinocchio lives in hell.

361
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Yes.

362
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Every moment of his life is a living hell.

363
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:22,960
But yeah, I just feel like every time I get off Pinocchio's daring journey, I step off the ride vehicle and go, oh, my God.

364
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Like, it's it's still the same.

365
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,960
It's still it's still as crazy as it is.

366
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Yeah, I found one or two tweaks.

367
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Well, one I was very surprised by.

368
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:39,960
There's one thing in this ride where I was like, you had to close for 16 months and you didn't pull that, which is the bird cages in the bird cages.

369
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,960
There is a very peculiar Asian caricature.

370
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,960
And it's like that could just be an empty bird cage.

371
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,960
Like, how did you not swap that out during the closure?

372
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,960
There's a lot of things that are problematic in the ride.

373
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Yeah, from a cultural sensitivity point.

374
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Probably the last mention of tobacco on Disney property, Disneyland property.

375
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Yes.

376
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,960
And that has its problems, too, with the cigar store Indians.

377
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Oh, sure.

378
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Wait, are there are those in the ride?

379
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Yeah.

380
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Oh, my God.

381
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Yes.

382
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
There's so much going on.

383
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
There's a lot.

384
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Hard to remember.

385
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Yeah. Like half of this.

386
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,960
I was watching the video because I haven't been on it in a little while because I neglected it last time.

387
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
We were the last two times were Disneyland.

388
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I was like, well, we went on the other three.

389
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
But we I think we always do it.

390
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,960
But I think it really scratches that itch of, well, we're going to we will get on this.

391
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
There will not be much of a line.

392
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
We will.

393
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,960
It's like a tick a ride tally.

394
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,960
It could be Labor Day and everything in the park could have a three hour wait and nobody will want to go on Pinocchio's journey.

395
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
So that's another reason that I love it.

396
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Yes. Another reason for it to be a favor because you will guaranteed get on it no matter what.

397
00:18:51,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Yeah. And the Pinocchio like the Pinocchio presence in this area even because they changed Pinocchio Village House to do they permanently change it to Red Rose Tavern?

398
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
Let me look that up because it lasted a lot longer.

399
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
I think that's supposed to be a temporary thing.

400
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
Yeah, I believe it was.

401
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,960
So yeah, I think they were like, no one likes Pinocchio anymore.

402
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Get him out of here.

403
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Pinocchio Merchants selling.

404
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Yeah, yeah, I did kind of like that restaurant.

405
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:27,960
I mean, I like let me say I like the vibe of the love the exterior of the of the carts and the restaurant ties in.

406
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Yeah.

407
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:36,960
It's very nicely like it all it all feels it's a pretty core component of that fantasy land redo from 83, which I think is so great.

408
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
It's very to me.

409
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,960
I don't know how to I don't know why that I feel that it is 80s wood.

410
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Everything is made of 80s wood.

411
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,960
It's just like a comforting reddish brown to the whole thing.

412
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
There's something. Yeah, it's it's darker.

413
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Yeah.

414
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Kind of like more knots.

415
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Yeah, you're right.

416
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,960
There's a lot of 80s wood at knots as well.

417
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Oh, no, I meant knots in the wood.

418
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Oh, I thought you meant.

419
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,960
Oh, not very much.

420
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Plenty of beautiful knotted wood as well.

421
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
You're OK. OK.

422
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
You're talking about the knots.

423
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Yeah.

424
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Yeah, sure.

425
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Detailed knots.

426
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Yeah.

427
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Appreciate those knots.

428
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,960
It's an interesting thing about this ride is it only dates to 1983, although it does seem like it's been there forever.

429
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Yeah, people think it's an original fantasy land, like after they yanked out the pirate ship and skull rock and move some stuff around and expanded some of the existing dark rides and gave them facades that look nice and not like little pop up tents.

430
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,960
It was all kind of it was it felt like a temporary land for a long time.

431
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Yeah. And I think they had a story explanation for that, that it was like a traveling circus that came to town and set up by the castle.

432
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,960
But like it was also like, well, what was running out of money?

433
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
And we just had to get some stuff there.

434
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,960
That's why that was their idea that a travel, a bunch of like hooligans in a cart.

435
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,960
What's the idea to put up the thing that he was trying to make a place to get away from?

436
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Oh, yes. Yeah, he doesn't like shady carnivals.

437
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Yeah.

438
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
So let me make a shady carnival.

439
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Yeah, which is an interesting like conflict in Pinocchio, too, because they go to like a shady carnival island and then like Walt is clearly roasting it.

440
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:30,960
But it's like and then you built 20 years later, you built your own shady carnival island in the sea of Orange County, Orange Grove.

441
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

442
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Yeah, it replaced something called Mickey Mouse Theater, which was just a room where they played Mickey cartoons.

443
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Was it Mickey Mouse Club Theater?

444
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
It was Mickey Mouse Club Theater.

445
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Yeah.

446
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Gotcha. So it was.

447
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Oh, for the TV show?

448
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Yeah, Mickey Mouse Club Theater. Yeah.

449
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:59,960
An outpour, I guess, if you were, if you considered yourself a member, as a way to, if you like showed up there a lot, maybe you'd get some face time with Jimmy.

450
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,960
I don't know if Cubby was hanging out there a lot, but it was, yeah, it was just like on a loop.

451
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,960
I don't know. No bands played.

452
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
Yeah.

453
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
I think that.

454
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,960
One block away from the Main Street cinema where you could also see old Mickey cartoons.

455
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,960
You can watch Mickey cartoons in Fantasyland.

456
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
This thing literally had a sign.

457
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,960
I saw a photo where it's like, you know, dazzling cartoons, air conditioned inside.

458
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Like that subtle thing that makes us like, you know, not so great attractions.

459
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
They were just advertising.

460
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,960
But so three decades of that and then we got to do something less chintzy.

461
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,960
So they they do this.

462
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Let me here's something I like about the premise.

463
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,960
When you just look at the sign saying what the ride is, you were told that here's the synopsis.

464
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Board a woodcarver's cart to travel through the adventures of Pinocchio.

465
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
A woodcarver's cart.

466
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
That's what you're on.

467
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Is that implying that Geppetto made the carts?

468
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Or if it's his, then maybe he made it.

469
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,960
And it is wood with nice knots.

470
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
So maybe.

471
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Or is it like, are you on a cart that he would use to transport lumber around?

472
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,960
But it is made out of wood, too.

473
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
It looks hand carved.

474
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Although they're pretty ornate.

475
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Those are really nice vehicles.

476
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
It doesn't seem utilitarian.

477
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,960
I wouldn't say that's.

478
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,960
But Geppetto is so Geppetto didn't have time to get around to making 25 of these.

479
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
This guy can barely get out of bed in the morning.

480
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Let's be honest.

481
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,960
He filled his house with cuckoo clocks.

482
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
I can't wait to get to that part.

483
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,960
The clock.

484
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
The grand finale.

485
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Just to confirm, it is still Red Rose Tavern, the restaurant.

486
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Yeah, that's what it is.

487
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
It's open and you can still get the grace.

488
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
But they got rid of Pinocchio.

489
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
It was Pinocchio Village House, which is AUS.

490
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
And they were like, get out of here.

491
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,960
Can I say one of the driest facts that has ever gone in and out of my brain?

492
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,960
There was, I had subscribed to this thing, Disney News.

493
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Once quarterly, get a bunch of advertisements for Disney parks to make your parents take you.

494
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,960
I mean, I got the annual report too, but it was like getting four more annual reports.

495
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
My brain was very warped by all this.

496
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:33,960
But there was some trivia article where they said that at the village house, when you're leaving, there's an exit sign.

497
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,960
But the exit sign, they messed up the dimensions of it and it is not directly over the door.

498
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
It's way over to the right.

499
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,960
So they made this right.

500
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,960
They justified it by drawing Figaro the cat with a rope, pulling the exit sign to where it should be.

501
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Wow, that's cute.

502
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
That's nice and cute.

503
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,960
And then I heard that in the same article, they say that in Paris, they did another village house restaurant.

504
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:08,960
And this time the exit sign is in the right place and Figaro is given a thumbs up and leaning up against it as if to say, I got it.

505
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,960
It's the one thing we got right in France.

506
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
The only thing you corrected.

507
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,960
It's such an odd little like for no one.

508
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,960
I liked this so much and I really wanted to remember reading that and think, well, I'll never go to Disneyland Paris.

509
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
There's no way that I will see that.

510
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,960
And I don't know if you remember that I wanted to say, oh, so we got to go into the, can we go to the village house so I could see this thing?

511
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,960
There's this thing where Figaro is dragging the sign over, but then here they fixed it.

512
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,960
And here is a handkerchief.

513
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Breathe into this as they cook the fetid Disney theme park French food.

514
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
This is our honeymoon.

515
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
That's OK, right?

516
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
This is how we're ending our honeymoon.

517
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,960
And we tried to do that and I tried to go into the village house, but it was closed.

518
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
Fair may.

519
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Fair may.

520
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Oh, yeah, that's right.

521
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
We saw so much fair may.

522
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Everything was closed.

523
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
The word of the day.

524
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Closed, closed, closed, closed.

525
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Oh, that's closed too?

526
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
OK, that's closed.

527
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
There was nothing.

529
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
That was a foreclosed park.

530
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Depressing.

531
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Really?

532
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,960
I'm so, one of you guys have to go one day and see if we're.

533
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
Don't go in winter.

534
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Just don't.

535
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
That's what it feels like.

536
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
You may have gone at the worst possible time.

537
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Like it's like all of a sudden the park, I feel like started getting a little bit more money and they started making stuff a little fresher.

538
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
That's what it feels like.

539
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,960
But it feels like you went in like the worst, like was bad weather, right?

540
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
As well or no?

541
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Yes.

542
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
Yeah, just freezing.

543
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Like, yeah, bad weather.

544
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Everything was closed.

545
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,960
It was like the complete like lowest point of the decade for the for the park.

546
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,960
So yeah, so much is closed and then employees are like mad.

547
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
They're mad that you're there.

548
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
That implies that they had any employees.

549
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Yeah, that's true.

550
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,960
It was like a six flag when Gionno had six flags and that we could barely find an employee on the justice list.

551
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Yeah, that park wide and that we like checked ourselves in.

552
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
You scan your own tickets.

553
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
Really?

554
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
They didn't have any employees at the gate.

555
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,960
You caught them during their traditional four hour break.

556
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
Yes.

557
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
It was 8 to noon.

558
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
We are on break.

559
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Yeah, the French siesta.

560
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,960
Ride their self service like kiosks for those four hours like at a CVS self check out.

561
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,960
You have to hit how many people are in the car and then you hit OK and then you get in the vehicle yourself.

562
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Disneyland Paris extra bucks.

563
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Yeah.

564
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Now, what's your thought?

565
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Village house.

566
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
A village house.

567
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
That was a.

568
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Yeah.

569
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
How long have you had?

570
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Did you have that fact in your head?

571
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Thirty years?

572
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Scott.

573
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Something like that.

574
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Yeah, I probably read around seven.

575
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,960
This has been my dream has been to go to France and see what the Eiffel Tower, the great art.

576
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
No, no, no.

577
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,960
The Figaro squaring the circle.

578
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Right.

579
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Getting his job is a job.

580
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Of exit sign installation.

581
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
That's your sister.

582
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Right.

583
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
This time.

584
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
That's Figaro's back story.

585
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,960
That's probably in the Wikipedia to you had up.

586
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Yeah.

587
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Do we see the literal Sistine Chapel on that trip?

588
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Yes.

589
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
OK.

590
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,960
I remember that less than not see not achieving.

591
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,960
You had to ask if we saw that.

592
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
But you do remember that.

593
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
What you didn't see.

594
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Oh, man.

595
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
That's great.

596
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
On the plane.

597
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
In the airport on the plane.

598
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
I'm going to see the sign.

599
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
I'm going to see the sign.

600
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Making a list of things to do crossing things off.

601
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Yeah.

602
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
I don't need to ever sign.

603
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Here's that sign.

604
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,960
I'm going to say I'm a circle sign again.

605
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
I can feel my brain working.

606
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,960
I can feel like an extended family member's name and face or like a beloved family member's

607
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
name and face.

608
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
I can feel that.

609
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
I can feel that.

610
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,960
I can feel like an extended family member's name and face or like a beloved childhood

611
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,960
friend leaving my brain to have these Figaro facts.

612
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Make room.

613
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Figaro nuzzling in backwards like a cat getting comfy.

614
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
Great at Betsy out.

615
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Bye bye.

616
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,960
What don't we need?

617
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
What don't we need in here?

618
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Sure to make your acquaintance, Jason.

619
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Figaro then pulls on a rope to get more family members out.

620
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Lamp with your being the giant billboard that's lamp with the coachman.

621
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Yes.

622
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
That character's name being the coachman.

623
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,960
You're in something your parents worked really hard to make really nice for you when you

624
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
were eight years old.

625
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
Out.

626
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,960
And then the phrase wet Pinocchio is now living.

627
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,960
Pinocchio does feel like an intrusive thought.

628
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,960
I will be lying in bed before I am trying to count breaths to fall asleep.

629
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
And then I just keep going wet Pinocchio.

630
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,960
It'll be like in a clown's wet Pinocchio.

631
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Erin, if you ever been when we've been taking care of our son and we put him in the bathtub,

632
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
has the fact ever occurred?

633
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
Has the phrase ever occurred to you?

634
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Oh, we drop him in the tub and he warp.

635
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Yep.

636
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Every time.

637
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Please don't warp.

638
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Please don't warp.

639
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Oh, what a funny little wooden puppet.

640
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,960
I mean, that would be I would just pretend my son was Pinocchio.

641
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,960
If you're a newer listener, we're referring just consult the Christmas episodes for this

642
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Geppetto nonsense that we talk about.

643
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,960
I also never hit my son for fear of splinters.

644
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Very good.

645
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
Only that reason.

646
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,960
Morally, whatever, you know, got to keep him in line.

647
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
But, oh, ouch.

648
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
What's his name?

649
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Avery Schreiber.

650
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
Yeah.

651
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Classic Pinocchio performance.

652
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Another name that's in all of our heads.

653
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
Yeah.

654
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
And is pushed out like.

655
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
Your beloved tree house.

656
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
Yeah.

657
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Gone.

658
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Avery Schreiber in.

659
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Did I have one?

660
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
I don't remember.

661
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
Was my dad around?

662
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Not sure.

663
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
Probably not.

664
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Avery Schreiber.

665
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Avery Schreiber.

666
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,960
I wake up every morning thinking of his face.

667
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,960
I should call Avery Schreiber.

668
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Tell him I love him.

669
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Make sure he knows.

670
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Let me just quick reunite Jason with his son.

671
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
All right.

672
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Here he is.

673
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Little puppet boy.

674
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
What?

675
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
What's happening?

676
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Is this the surprise?

677
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
This is the surprise, yeah.

678
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Jason, this is Jason's son, little puppet boy.

679
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,960
You're going to notice that I had to cut the strings on him because he was too tangled up.

680
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
So I apologize.

681
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
There are no strings on him.

682
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
You're going to have to restring him.

683
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
What's happening?

684
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
What is this?

685
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,960
We're looking at a little marionette of Pinocchio.

686
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,960
Well, it's a not specific puppet.

687
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
It's got a long nose.

688
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,960
He's a liar.

689
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,960
Pinocchio's in, I feel like that's public domain.

690
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
He's all over Italy.

691
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Yeah, he's just kind of a puppet.

692
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,960
And yeah, we bought this for a show at UCB years ago and then ended up using it in like a dozen other shows.

693
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,960
But it's been in my drawer upstairs and I realized I saw it last night just by happenstance.

694
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,960
I went, oh, yeah, little puppet boy.

695
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
We pass it back and forth.

696
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Jason hasn't been with his son, little puppet boy.

697
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
He's been falling over the years.

698
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,960
He's not in the best shape.

699
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,960
So we'll put the photo, but I want Jason just to be able to work the puppet during the show.

700
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,960
If he feels like inspired or anything.

701
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,960
You can't, though, because I'm not then you can really work.

702
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
You could kind of work the.

703
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Yeah, there you go.

704
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,960
That's a little bit of a dance.

705
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Yeah.

706
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
The posture isn't great.

707
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Stromboli would whip him.

708
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,960
So we'll post a photo of father and son here as well.

709
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
I just wanted to do that on.

710
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,960
Can you sing as much of that song as you remember?

711
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Or could you sing?

712
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,960
Cat Stevens, father and son.

713
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Either way, your choice or a medley.

714
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
Old man, take a look at my.

715
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
That's the way.

716
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
And three.

717
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:46,960
The other the other prop we bought that then used like two dozen times was a Teddy, a child's extra large Teddy bear costume that fit me pretty well.

718
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
And I feel like I can get in it.

719
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,960
I Mark Rennie has borrowed it like many past guests have used it or gotten in it.

720
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
Mike can get in it.

721
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
That stretches.

722
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Yeah, you see, I'm sorry.

723
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,960
You have a little bear costume that you're passing around from guest to guest.

724
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
You don't have to wear the bear costume.

725
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
All right.

726
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
I'll put on the bear costume.

727
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
That may be downstairs.

728
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,960
That might be downstairs by the car in the storage.

729
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
We'll wait.

730
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Leave a recording.

731
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
We'll talk about something.

732
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Next time you're on the show, I will bring the bear costume out.

733
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Great.

734
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,960
If we do get to wear an old bear costume from a garage in about four and a half years.

735
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,960
If it's really we're still doing it.

736
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
We got more on a mansion to get through.

737
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Yeah.

738
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Grizzly Peak.

739
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,960
If we do Grizzly Peak or something, we really should have done it for that.

740
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Or when we did what we did though.

741
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
Ride, right?

742
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Marry.

743
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Grizzly, Grizzly.

744
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
We're not.

745
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,960
We're not ready to Country Bear Jamber Week is going to be too packed.

746
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Yeah.

747
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Grizzly Peak Week.

748
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,960
We'll have more time.

749
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Exactly.

750
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Show and tell that area where you get to chill out is just lovely.

751
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
And we don't talk about it enough.

752
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
And the little paths.

753
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
And the little paths in Grizzly Peak.

754
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Forget about it.

755
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
It's so good.

756
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
My best friend, Kia's favorite part of the park.

757
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Yeah.

758
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
She listens.

759
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Hi, Kia.

760
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Hi, Kia.

761
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
That's the tree.

762
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Count the rings of the tree.

763
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Yeah.

764
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Kia would only have one, I guess.

765
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
I guess, yeah.

766
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
That's how it works.

767
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
From fresh wood.

768
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
So fresh you can hear it scream.

769
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,960
The wood, it screams.

770
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,960
You want to dive into the ride a little bit?

771
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Yeah.

772
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Yeah.

773
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,960
I feel like I need, because I'm so excited to talk about the ride.

774
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
I feel like it's not coming off.

775
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
Yeah.

776
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,960
The joy.

777
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,960
I am so joyous when I go see it.

778
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,960
And when I say it's dilapidated and not cared for, those are all positives in my book.

779
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,960
It's like you call things that need a little more love duds.

780
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Yes.

781
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Like our dear departed cat.

782
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Yes.

783
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
It was a dud, but a dud needs the most love.

784
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Or a lemon.

785
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Or a lemon.

786
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,960
A dud or a lemon.

787
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
That is my highest praise.

788
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
The things that I love the most in life.

789
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I feel like I'm opening the door for a slam for you right now, Scott.

790
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
Oh.

791
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
What a dud.

792
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
I love them.

793
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Oh, geez.

794
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Hey, okay.

795
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Well, I shanked the first word and I rose again.

796
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
Is that a mystery date?

797
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,960
Scott's a mystery date?

798
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
Yes.

799
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
You got the dud.

800
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
You got the dud.

801
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,960
But no, it's the highest compliment that I love things that need it the most.

802
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Yeah.

803
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,960
And if somebody doesn't go to this, because Peter Pan is going to be full day and day.

804
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,960
There is plenty of love to go around for every other Fantasyland attraction.

805
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,960
Everybody loves the other ones.

806
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Nobody loves Pinocchio and I'm going to love it.

807
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
That's a good point.

808
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Yeah, because Snow White just got a big refresh.

809
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Peter Pan, it may as well be in another park.

810
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
The lines get so long.

811
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
And then Toad is like the cult favorite.

812
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Exactly.

813
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
So then you're left with Pinocchio.

814
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Yeah, Toad is like, here come the warm jets.

815
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Brian Eno, like that's the hip of the four.

816
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
It's big star.

817
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
I'm still confused by the notion that...

818
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
It's a big star.

819
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
I agree with the cool.

820
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,960
I remain confused by the notion that Mr. Toad is obscure or off the beaten.

821
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,960
I think it is one of those famous things on Earth.

822
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:14,960
I think the thing that maybe makes people think it's obscure is that it's not a beloved like Diamond Classic film.

823
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Oh, the Diamond Classics.

824
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
Yes.

825
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
And the clamshells.

826
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
I haven't thought about that phrase in a long time.

827
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
Yes.

828
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
Yeah, because who even...

829
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
It's hard to even remember.

830
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,960
Like you almost think that the thing is called...

831
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Yeah, but then the movie isn't...

832
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,960
That's the part of Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad.

833
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Right.

834
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,960
It's from that weird murky era and you don't know which one had Casey at the bat.

835
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
It's so confusing.

836
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,960
I declared a while that I was going to read The Wind and the Willows.

837
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Do you remember that?

838
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,960
I never made good on that because we were watching a Mr. Toad cartoon and I was really tickled by...

839
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Is it the one, the thing where he is...

840
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,960
It's the claymation thing where he's driving and yells, poop?

841
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Poop, poop, poop, poop.

842
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,960
Poop, poop, poop, poop.

843
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Yeah, there's something really juvenile and I was like, I'm going to read those books.

844
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
He's funny.

845
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
I haven't read a book in 12 years.

846
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
You're going to start with a book in 12 years.

847
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
I'm going to read this one because it has poop in it.

848
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Mr. Toad is funny.

849
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,960
We watched some old Toad stuff a couple years ago and we were like, Mr. Toad is funny.

850
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Driving like a maniac and then the ride is funny.

851
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
That's really how it sets itself apart.

852
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:23,960
I guess, originally Snow White was scary and Peter Pan is magical to some people.

853
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Mr. Toad is kind of the funny madcap one.

854
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,960
What is Pinocchio?

855
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
Depressing?

856
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
Sad?

857
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Moralistic.

858
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Very moralist.

859
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Heavy-handed morals.

860
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
Heavy, heavy-handed morals.

861
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Heavy-handed morals but makes the immoral stuff look awesome.

862
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,960
There is some element of Pleasure Island that you go, this is cool as shit.

863
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,960
It's scary but also it's stylized in a way that you'd go, yeah, I see why you'd go over there.

864
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
I think it's so grimy though.

865
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Maybe it's because I know what's coming.

866
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,960
It is, but I could see why you would be like, this is such a...

867
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,960
I know what a real rundown, scary...

868
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
I'm trying to think of something.

869
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
Yeah, it's Pleasure Island.

870
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Although rundown isn't the word.

871
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
It's not rundown.

872
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Yes, I think it is imagineered.

873
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,960
There's massive heads and mechanisms.

874
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
No, that's fair.

875
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
It's a terrifying...

876
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,960
If the Imagineers were evil, that's what Pleasure Island is.

877
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,960
It's an immaculate Batman villain's lair which is enticing to go to.

878
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Depending on your Batman media, if you're in the Joker and he's got a cool carnival fun house or something that is his lair,

879
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,960
you do want to go there even though you know you're going to get killed.

880
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,960
I think if a drawbridge didn't come up, if you didn't know you couldn't leave Pleasure Island...

881
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Well, you can leave.

882
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
Oh, yes.

883
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
But as a slave donkey.

884
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,960
In a crate.

885
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
To the salt mines.

886
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,960
You can get a park hopper between Pleasure Island and the salt mines and you can go back kind of freely.

887
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,960
I mean, clearly Imagineers were like, yeah, this should be fun.

888
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,960
Let's name our nightlife district, our brand new nightlife district after this 40-year-old hellscape.

889
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
That is a really funny thing.

890
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Was that a way to curb drinking, like public drunkenness?

891
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Now, remember, have fun but don't go too nuts here at Pleasure Island.

892
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,960
I've had signs up everywhere saying don't make a jackass out of yourself.

893
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,960
If they do, I mean, I was about to say if they do a Pinocchio.

894
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Everyone's doing a Pinocchio.

895
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Every studio has two different Pinocchios in production.

896
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Always, always somewhere in the world there's a Pinocchio being made.

897
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,960
Every older actor is obsessed with doing Pinocchio.

898
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,960
Robert Downey Jr. has been trying to do it for 20 years.

899
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
He's like roped everybody in.

900
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,960
Always let him do any 19th century story that is his heart's desire.

901
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
It's always going to work out.

902
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Tom Hanks is in the Zemeckis Pinocchio that's coming out soon.

903
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
But they should add.

904
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Is Pinocchio like an unknown child or do they do some horrible that it's like in a dog?

905
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Oh, we can mocap Martin Short.

906
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Yeah, Martin Short is Pinocchio.

907
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
No.

908
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
Mocap.

909
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
We must have.

910
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Have we brought up the Drew Carey made for TV Pinocchio?

911
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
We have not.

912
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
We have not.

913
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
We brought up the Drew Carey TV movie.

914
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Drew Carey, Aaron's pal.

915
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
My good friend.

916
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Your good friend.

917
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Good, good friend.

918
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
Yeah.

919
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,960
Have you seen it?

920
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Like did we watch any of it in the?

921
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,960
I feel like I must have seen it at some point.

922
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Not recently.

923
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,960
And it didn't come up when you were at the show.

924
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
No, I did not talk to him about Pinocchio.

925
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,960
And he did not say, hey, you know, if you like this, you might like my movie.

926
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,960
He doesn't plug his made for TV movie to the guests.

927
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:55,960
There was an article going around a few weeks ago on Collider or some film website about like everyone is memory hold this made for TV Drew Carey Pinocchio.

928
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,960
It's nowhere to be found.

929
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,960
And Cinderella just came back with a little bit of fanfare because it's got Whitney and Brandy.

930
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Very talented cast and not so with with Jepetto specifically with Julie Louis Dreyfus, the Blue Fairy.

931
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Oh, boy.

932
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
It's really strange.

933
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:19,960
He has like a this like show stopping number that is like, do you guys know the song?

934
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:28,960
It's about like if when I when you took my love away from me, it's about all the things you could take from Jepetto before you take his son.

935
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
I do not know this.

936
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,960
And he's singing to like a mean banker played by Brent Spiner.

937
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Well, he does have a house full of garbage, so it could be a long song.

938
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,960
I will say expendable.

939
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,960
You saying mean banker played by Brent Spiner makes me ashamed to not have because that's right.

940
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
It's really cute.

941
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:57,960
I know that's sorry, but if I had a bank account, you could take the whole amount.

942
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
That's the one that's in my head.

943
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,960
If I had does not have a bank account.

944
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
It's beyond that.

945
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
It's negative.

946
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,960
He just never had one.

947
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
I don't know.

948
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
I go in the bank.

949
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I get confused.

950
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
Our simple.

951
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960
So sad.

952
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
I know.

953
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,960
I don't know amounts and ledgers.

954
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,960
I just instinctively knew you would be able to pull facts about this movie.

955
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,960
I don't think we've ever talked about this, but I was like, someone in this room will know this movie.

956
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,960
I feel like it's one of the ones where I just watch so much TV.

957
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,960
I knew the commercials by heart and it just it felt like I had seen the movie and then never, never got around to it.

958
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,960
Never done the whole thing.

959
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,960
There's just been so much Drew Carey.

960
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Yeah.

961
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,960
So much care in there that YouTube is now algorithm algorithm me.

962
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,960
That was tough to get through.

963
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,960
Yeah.

964
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Whose line Montauk like clips like 10 times that Ryan Stiles owned Drew in the hoedown.

965
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Are now clips that are like that's every time.

966
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,960
That's what he always what he always did.

967
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960
We'll get better.

968
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
We will.

969
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
You know, there's altiz.

970
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
There's a little bit.

971
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
There's maybe a little game coming at the end of the episode.

972
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
We'll get back to Drew.

973
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Drew will have his time to shine.

974
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,960
But we got to talk about the Gepetto.

975
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,960
We know the Pinocchio that we know and dear God, not about Joseph Gordon, let it Jiminy Cricket.

976
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,960
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

977
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,960
It's going to be we're going to have we're going to be seeing him on street corners and billboards everywhere for a long time.

978
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
We'll deal with that later.

979
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,960
Yeah.

980
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,960
There goes my first crush's name.

981
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
And here comes a new friend.

982
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,960
Here comes Figaro.

983
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,960
Pull it in.

984
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,960
OK, the right.

985
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:50,960
This is like when I think about sitting down in boarding a woodcarver's cart with you and the anticipation and that you're just like bouncing bouncing.

986
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,960
Yes.

987
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,960
I just like physically bounce in my seat like a little king.

988
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
Baby in a high chair.

989
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,960
Yes.

990
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,960
But and which which the tonally fits so great with the first scene.

991
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,960
No, I wouldn't call it a scene.

992
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,960
The first half scene, you get half of a room.

993
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,960
Hi, diddley dee slam.

994
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,960
And then it's just horrible from there.

995
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:20,960
It is so quick to gloom as all like even faster than it's kind of the same format as Snow White.

996
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,960
But at least there's like that cottage is sort of big.

997
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,960
You got to get to the other side.

998
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

999
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,960
And seven dancing carry eight now that they've added snow white.

1000
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,960
But here it's just Pinocchio and then like the Dutch girl and the Russian girl, the puppets who he barely meets.

1001
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,960
And then you're just two and a half seconds.

1002
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,960
And then it's interrupted by just haha.

1003
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,960
A big slam sound.

1004
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,960
There's just a divide where did you think this is a fun ride?

1005
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,960
No, it is not a fun ride.

1006
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,960
It's so fat.

1007
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
And now it just like it's so fast.

1008
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,960
It's so fat and now it just like it's still surprises me how fast every time I love it.

1009
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,960
Yeah, darkness.

1010
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,960
Heidi, you know, the day that's also my theory for a long time has been like that.

1011
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Walt probably loved that song and he's like that was his real what he really thought of actors.

1012
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,960
He's like these foolish little puppet like they're a necessary evil.

1013
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,960
These these foolish, ignorant little puppets.

1014
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,960
100 percent.

1015
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,960
I was thinking that with the three of you actually, because this is something I have not had the pleasure.

1016
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,960
But like when I hear this the line, hi, Dilly, dumb and actor's life is fun.

1017
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,960
And then I think about you guys driving to Santa Monica for commercial auditions.

1018
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,960
I did do commercial auditions for about a year and a half.

1019
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
It's awful.

1020
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
Not fun, you're saying.

1021
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,960
Then actor's life in that case.

1022
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
Not fun.

1023
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
Yeah, I walked.

1024
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Well, I went to the funniest one I ever did was I did drive.

1025
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,960
I drove like maybe three hours round trip to walk into a piece of plexiglass and then leave.

1026
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,960
And that was the entire audition.

1027
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,960
I didn't even have to say a line or anything.

1028
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,960
So there's yeah.

1029
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,960
Yes, there's a lot of unglamorous parts of it.

1030
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,960
Now, if you're lucky enough to get on set and you get a breakfast quesadilla in the morning.

1031
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
Now, that is fantastic.

1032
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,960
See, I was never lucky enough to get on set.

1033
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,960
I was not very good.

1034
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:29,960
But again, my theory is that like because what you wanted to be you wanted to be doing the kinds of ads that air during your favorite show, The Price is Right.

1035
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,960
I wanted to be doing a consumer cellular ad.

1036
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,960
Oh, my mom just signed up for that.

1037
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,960
Did she really?

1038
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,960
Yeah.

1039
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,960
Rated number one for customer experience.

1040
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,960
You want to be a nice lady telling older folks.

1041
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:51,960
What I'm excellent for is is game show auditions because I'm a big jackass if you want to tie it back into the right at hand.

1042
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,960
Like I'm good at being like big.

1043
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,960
They want they want big.

1044
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,960
They want braying.

1045
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,960
I can pray among the best of them.

1046
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,960
Now, let's see you break.

1047
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,960
No, I know what you mean.

1048
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,960
I think just like weaving in the Price is Right story through it.

1049
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:20,960
That is what I recall is that like, yeah, there's certain like you guys can attest like some things that commercials want now are just like the driest, most subtle, just kind of like look at the camera.

1050
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,960
John Krasinski take.

1051
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:29,960
Yeah, yeah, it's a lot of like, yeah, like a little bit of like, oh, like you make the eyes and you go get a little this guy with but say it with your face.

1052
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,960
Throw it away is said a lot like don't even think about the line.

1053
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:41,960
Basically, they're telling you, hey, we know we told you to do improvise a full half hour for us for 10 years.

1054
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,960
Stop doing that shit.

1055
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,960
Just say this and leave, please.

1056
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,960
And it's like, all right, man, whatever you want, hit you with a big board.

1057
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,960
Yeah, see what happens to your face.

1058
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,960
And then you go.

1059
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,960
But that's what like when because just the way the Price is Right thing worked out.

1060
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,960
You did a zoom audition that I heard happening in the other room and small dry.

1061
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,960
Not part of it at all.

1062
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,960
I heard you doing it and I was like, she got it.

1063
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,960
She got it for sure.

1064
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,960
She's going to be on the show.

1065
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,960
I just knew it just propelled.

1066
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,960
They want loud idiots and I can do that.

1067
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,960
Glad you got your shot.

1068
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,960
Yeah, your idiotic shot.

1069
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,960
I anyways.

1070
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,960
So yeah, in the in the pleasant scene, you hear about the life of an actor.

1071
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:32,960
And then here's something I noticed in the so immediately from that you are backstage at Stromboli's puppet theater,

1072
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,960
which is just like this will be face looks like a fun show with a nice smiling guy.

1073
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,960
And there's a bunch of Stromboli posters in the beginning of the rat, like four or five.

1074
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,960
If you look at them and they sort of like cascade down in terms of his friendliness,

1075
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,960
like he does look like kind of a warm guy initially.

1076
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,960
But by the last one you see, which I think is black light, those eyebrows have gotten much thicker and much more pointed down.

1077
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,960
He's just so much more frightening and frothing at the mouth.

1078
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,960
It's funny. I've never noticed that.

1079
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe I don't know if that was on purpose or they just didn't like copy the paintings correctly.

1080
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:16,960
But I don't know the idea that Stromboli like that you'd want if you live in the town,

1081
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,960
which is apparently called Pinocchio Village, using the canon of the ride, you might think that that's a fun.

1082
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,960
This will be a fun afternoon.

1083
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,960
Let's go see this like glaring laughing man in this tiny decrepit theater.

1084
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,960
He's worth the patronizing, given money to.

1085
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:42,960
Well, and as you discover later on in the town, there might be not a lot else to do around there because the the signs,

1086
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:51,960
the directional signs in the town point Pinocchio Village and then another one that says to the sea.

1087
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,960
That's your option for local sites.

1088
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,960
I mean, no wonder Pleasure Island is so desirable.

1089
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,960
Yeah, yeah, it's something. Something's happening.

1090
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:12,960
Jimmy Cricket, not a great helpful guy, though, if he's telling Pinocchio like, um, I guess follow the one that says to the sea.

1091
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,960
Yeah, wait. Yeah, it's kind of on his guidance. He ends up there.

1092
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Yeah, really weird to safety.

1093
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,960
He does eventually in a long winded way.

1094
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,960
Yeah, you get the phrase, the huge star rally phrase.

1095
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,960
This will be your home.

1096
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,960
Right away.

1097
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,960
This is scene two.

1098
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,960
This is like setting the seeds of the ride.

1099
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,960
1.5.

1100
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:45,960
Yeah, and then you yourself are in a cage.

1101
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,960
Right. Right.

1102
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,960
That's creepy.

1103
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Then you're choosing between Pinocchio Village or Pleasure Island.

1104
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,960
Jimmy Cricket says over here, not Pleasure Island.

1105
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,960
He's popping up throughout the ride telling you don't go this way.

1106
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
Don't go that way.

1107
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:08,960
But pretty quickly, you're at Pleasure Island, which again, like I mean, as we're saying, this sort of mixed messages in a way because like it is.

1108
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Yeah, it's a it's a fun themed environment.

1109
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,960
Yeah.

1110
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:21,960
Some of the problem, I guess, is that people are drinking a lot, but usually we have been drinking a lot when we've gone on this attraction.

1111
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
Like, what are you mad?

1112
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:30,960
What did I it seems like I'm doing what you're going on rides, eating junk food and sweets.

1113
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,960
I mean, we get in brawls all the time when we're at Disneyland.

1114
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Like it's just constant roughhousing.

1115
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,960
You're always in those Tic Tocs where you're fighting a family reunion.

1116
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,960
Yeah, no, we look like that Andy Cap, who got in like big fights.

1117
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,960
Well, yeah, any cap.

1118
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,960
Look at Jason when you ask that question.

1119
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,960
100% of the cap's wife was like hitting it with a frying pan.

1120
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:00,960
Right. Did they get in like like pig pen style cloud fights though with like commotion like commotion clouds, motion fights?

1121
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
I think so.

1122
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,960
Yeah, I have come across lately.

1123
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:20,960
The sizes were all very odd, but there are opening Islands of Adventure like first couple years shirts that just say that kind of very cheap Islands of Adventure logo at the bottom and then have Andy Cap thinking about a beer and his wife just looking mad at it.

1124
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,960
Rolling pin.

1125
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,960
Yeah.

1126
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,960
How much are these shirts going for?

1127
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,960
Like 50 bucks.

1128
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,960
So in a good shape, I would encourage you to buy.

1129
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,960
I got to find one at least like in the realm of my size.

1130
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,960
So I think there were kids was one of them a kid's one.

1131
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,960
Maybe it was bizarre.

1132
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,960
With any cap wanting a beer.

1133
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,960
I loved Andy Cap as a kid.

1134
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,960
Yeah, I did too.

1135
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,960
I loved his hot fries and his cheese fries.

1136
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,960
And I like the comic strips.

1137
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,960
I mean, they were the like the Lockhorns were the bummer couple that hated each other.

1138
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,960
But Andy Cap and his wife at least gotten some antics.

1139
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,960
Yeah, they had like high highs and low lows.

1140
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,960
The kind of relationship you really want.

1141
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:11,960
Wait, does Andy Cap is he just the like spokesman for the hot fries or does King Features Syndicate own hot fries?

1142
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,960
No, I think it's a licensing thing.

1143
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,960
What's hot fries?

1144
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,960
What are you talking about?

1145
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,960
I don't know.

1146
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,960
I've never had them actually.

1147
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,960
I actually don't.

1148
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:25,960
I know that Andy Cap is posted like plastered all over their little fried like potato sticks.

1149
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,960
Like kind of like Cheetos or Takis.

1150
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,960
Figaro's pulling a new fact.

1151
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,960
I'll remember.

1152
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,960
First kiss gone.

1153
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:42,960
Like it just auto complete Andy Caps taste the oven baked crunch like flavor punch in every crunch.

1154
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,960
Yep, there he is.

1155
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,960
But it is even called Andy Caps.

1156
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,960
Like it's his name first.

1157
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Yeah.

1158
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,960
So I got to figure out if King Features Syndicate owns hot fries.

1159
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,960
I don't think so.

1160
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,960
Oh, no, I'm getting con con Connagra brand.

1161
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
Connagra brand.

1162
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,960
I think they are a big.

1163
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,960
So they are licensing from King Features Syndicate.

1164
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,960
They own Healthy Choice and Bird's Eye and Banquet.

1165
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,960
So it's some like sinister food concern.

1166
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,960
OK.

1167
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,960
Andy Cap had his own food empire.

1168
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,960
That would imply that he's industrious and that's the opposite of Andy Cap.

1169
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,960
He's a lazy drunk who sleeps on the couch.

1170
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,960
Yeah, it's a laugh.

1171
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,960
I can't imagine him being a potato.

1172
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,960
One of these one of these companies stole his recipe.

1173
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,960
He stumbled upon made some fries once then it got taken out.

1174
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,960
Before alcohol showed up.

1175
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,960
He was a real go getter before.

1176
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,960
Zere, you take this.

1177
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,960
Here's your payment.

1178
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,960
Bunch of beers.

1179
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,960
It's nice that he's making some passive income.

1180
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,960
Yeah.

1181
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,960
Andy Cap notable for being the only person ever fired from working on Pleasure Island.

1182
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,960
You're too.

1183
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,960
You're too much of a loud.

1184
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,960
Get out of here.

1185
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,960
Shady even for us.

1186
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,960
OK.

1187
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,960
So also one more thing.

1188
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,960
Are you like Mike?

1189
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,960
Are you at this point like angling for a job at King Features Syndicate?

1190
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,960
Yes.

1191
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,960
At some point like the full use of the full phrase.

1192
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,960
I'm like, what is the end game of saying King Features?

1193
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,960
Yeah, it's a good question.

1194
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,960
I was actually as you guys were talking, I zoned out just now and I was imagining like,

1195
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,960
could we license a King Features Syndicate character?

1196
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,960
Could we have like Andy Caps podcast, The Ride?

1197
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,960
Could we call it that for a while?

1198
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,960
Andy Cap proudly presents.

1199
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,960
Yeah.

1200
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,960
Or any of his hot fries.

1201
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,960
You'll love his podcast.

1202
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,960
Yeah.

1203
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:34,960
The Phantom presents the Billy Zane Phantom presents podcast, The Ride or, you know, I don't know.

1204
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,960
Is this going to cost us money to have to engage in this partnership?

1205
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,960
I assume it might.

1206
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,960
I don't think I'm going to chip in just to have King Features Syndicates involved.

1207
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,960
But maybe I email.

1208
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,960
I don't know quite the boost it's going to get us.

1209
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:52,960
Maybe I email King Features Syndicate and I say like, do you have a list, a sheet of how much it costs for each character to endorse your podcast?

1210
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,960
It's like those bands.

1211
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,960
You see like a list of the bands like and how much they cost to like play a state fair that came out a couple of years ago.

1212
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,960
I don't want to burst your bubble, but the founder of King Features is listed as William Randolph Hearst.

1213
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,960
So I think they're going to take you for a ride.

1214
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,960
This might be difficult.

1215
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,960
It might be difficult, but maybe there's like a don't bring up Sergeant Kane.

1216
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,960
That's the only thing that can blow the meeting.

1217
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,960
Do not say that's my signature, though, and my emails.

1218
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,960
I've got this. I come to you today with the citizen Kane of ideas.

1219
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,960
They press a button and the chair falls back.

1220
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,960
Thanks for the water, at least.

1221
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,960
Hey, enough of this nonsense.

1222
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,960
We have donkey Ferris wheels to talk about.

1223
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,960
Everything is donkeys in Pleasure Island.

1224
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
Yeah.

1225
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,960
In our rewatch, like the carousel is all donkeys that you ride donkey gingerbread donkeys.

1226
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:55,960
There's a lot of like pre-luting to to what occurs in the in the gate when you come in as a big donkey head.

1227
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,960
You like donkeys, kids.

1228
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,960
Hey, it's the international symbol for fun.

1229
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,960
Seeing a lot of donkeys in one place who had to be there.

1230
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,960
You know you're having a good time.

1231
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,960
A working farm animal.

1232
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:13,960
I and then a lot of cigars.

1233
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,960
That's continues to be a strange thing about this attraction.

1234
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,960
The preponderance of cigars and tobacco row.

1235
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,960
I liked watching the Paris version where tobacco row was a thing.

1236
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,960
That was fun to see tobacco street tobacco street.

1237
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,960
Right.

1238
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,960
A little more clear.

1239
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,960
You got the I had to remember the name.

1240
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,960
OK, the Fox.

1241
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,960
Honest John is the Fox.

1242
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,960
Yes, who sat on you.

1243
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,960
Who sat on me.

1244
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,960
Or was it Gideon?

1245
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,960
I think maybe Gideon sat on me.

1246
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,960
Oh, Gideon.

1247
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,960
Gideon sat on you.

1248
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,960
Yeah.

1249
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,960
Yeah.

1250
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,960
I think I remember the name.

1251
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,960
I think I remember the name.

1252
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,960
I think I remember the name.

1253
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,960
I think I remember the name.

1254
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,960
I think I remember the name.

1255
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,960
Gideon sat on you.

1256
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,960
Yeah.

1257
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,960
Yeah.

1258
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,960
Yeah.

1259
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,960
That was one of the first things maybe that ever happened to me at Disneyland.

1260
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,960
And yet I still liked it enough to talk about it every week somewhere.

1261
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,960
They're doing like a strength testing machine that is so caustic.

1262
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,960
It is like.

1263
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,960
What, the mallet?

1264
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,960
Yeah.

1265
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,960
Yeah.

1266
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,960
It is like it's just like crazy loud.

1267
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,960
It feels very haunted mansion and it's like almost like a little mini jump scare.

1268
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,960
Am I crazy?

1269
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,960
That thing is like dialed up so loud.

1270
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,960
That noise is so like unpleasant, you mean?

1271
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:24,960
Yeah.

1272
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,960
Yeah.

1273
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,960
Yeah.

1274
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,960
Just kind of adds to the.

1275
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,960
I mean, they, you know, they do very well.

1276
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,960
They, they're very good at recreating like a hectic shady carnival for sure.

1277
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,960
That's true.

1278
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,960
Yes.

1279
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,960
It feels chaotic.

1280
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,960
Yeah.

1281
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,960
But I guess there is, there is a joy to this sequence.

1282
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,960
Again, if you didn't know what was coming.

1283
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,960
Oh, but do you think, Erin, do you feel like it's all a little grimy?

1284
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,960
Yeah, I don't know.

1285
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,960
If I was there in real life, my like shady senses would go off.

1286
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,960
I'd be like, no.

1287
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,960
Yeah.

1288
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,960
Yeah.

1289
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,960
Yeah.

1290
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,960
Keep the kid away.

1291
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,960
Yeah.

1292
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,960
But yeah.

1293
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,960
And then you got the rough house.

1294
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,960
Yes, the rough house.

1295
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,960
Which in the movie, the rough house is like just kids like break glass.

1296
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,960
I think I'm trying to remember in that sequence.

1297
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,960
I think they are just throwing glass at each other.

1298
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,960
I just, I'm so confused by like the morality here.

1299
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,960
Like Walt smoke and drank.

1300
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,960
Was it just saying kids don't do this until you're 18?

1301
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,960
Like, is this what the whole point of it was?

1302
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,960
Or like 15?

1303
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,960
What?

1304
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:32,960
It's just funny to me that you're like, yeah, don't do this thing that I'm, you're going to do later.

1305
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,960
And I do all the time.

1306
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,960
Yes.

1307
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,960
Yeah.

1308
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,960
And some of it involves rides and stuff.

1309
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,960
Right.

1310
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,960
I don't really, if it is a morality play, what's the moral?

1311
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
You step out to a carousel.

1312
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,960
Like that's what the exit points you to.

1313
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,960
Oh yeah.

1314
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,960
And it's not about like drinking in moderation.

1315
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,960
Like Pinocchio only have two beers before you drive home or something.

1316
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,960
Like it's not that.

1317
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,960
And he's not doing like, he's not doing opiates in Pleasure Island.

1318
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,960
Is he?

1319
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,960
I've never gotten that sense.

1320
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,960
Cigar and beer.

1321
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,960
Cigar and like a bottle.

1322
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,960
There's some fortune telling, but I don't know that there's any drugs implied.

1323
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,960
Unless the cigars are laced with something.

1324
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,960
It could be.

1325
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,960
Yeah.

1326
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,960
We know Pinocchio likes to get wet, but I don't know if he likes to get wet in the PCP sense.

1327
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,960
No, Pinocchio doesn't like to get wet.

1328
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,960
There was an act that a guy threw water at him.

1329
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,960
Pinocchio is not you.

1330
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,960
Right.

1331
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,960
Okay.

1332
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
Okay.

1333
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,960
So Pinocchio is more like Ethan Hawking training day where he gets wet by like a chip.

1334
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,960
Wet Jason.

1335
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:33,960
Yeah.

1336
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,960
Wet Jason is a new character.

1337
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,960
So it's all strange.

1338
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,960
It's all strange.

1339
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:48,960
And then you end up in the, going through the eight ball where you, this is the first that

1340
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:57,960
you see is little buddy Lampwick and Lampwick turns around and reveals his donkey face and

1341
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,960
the body horror, or this chapter of the body horror begins.

1342
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,960
Yeah.

1343
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,960
Oh boy.

1344
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,960
And it's, this is a hologram trick.

1345
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,960
Oh, in the mirror.

1346
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,960
You're right.

1347
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,960
In the mirror.

1348
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,960
This is one of the first uses of Disney using holograms.

1349
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,960
Similar to the Queen that we're going in the Snow White ride.

1350
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,960
Yeah.

1351
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,960
Similar to the same like trick in the.

1352
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,960
Oh right.

1353
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,960
Yeah.

1354
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,960
Yeah.

1355
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,960
But here's where we, here's where the curse comes in.

1356
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,960
Yes.

1357
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,960
Yeah.

1358
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,960
Or yeah.

1359
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,960
Do you want to do the honors?

1360
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,960
Yeah.

1361
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,960
Go ahead and make a jackass of yourselves.

1362
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,960
Like so crazy.

1363
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,960
And just like, here's where you start feeling like you're being scolded by this attraction.

1364
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,960
Yes.

1365
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:41,960
Which I love.

1366
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,960
It's like calm down.

1367
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,960
What are they doing at this point?

1368
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,960
We don't really, especially with the story of the ride stripped out, what exactly has

1369
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,960
Lampwick done to make himself a jackass?

1370
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,960
He played pool.

1371
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,960
Played pool?

1372
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,960
Which is as far as I know is legal.

1373
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,960
And maybe had a beer.

1374
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,960
There's beer in that part, right?

1375
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:01,960
Yeah.

1376
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,960
I think they have beer in that and they play pool.

1377
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,960
They have beers, yeah.

1378
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,960
Which is as bad in the music man as well.

1379
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,960
That is, yeah, they get a pool table.

1380
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,960
That's a real bad thing.

1381
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,960
That is a big thing.

1382
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,960
I assume that kept you away from pool for years, Jason.

1383
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,960
The music man.

1384
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,960
Well, you know.

1385
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,960
This is one of the discrepancies I noticed is that in a 2020 video they say go ahead

1386
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,960
and make a jackass of yourself.

1387
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:27,960
But then I caught a 2021 recording of this ride and he says that kid always makes a jackass

1388
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,960
out of himself.

1389
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,960
So I don't know if it's, there's a couple lines in there or they changed it.

1390
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:38,960
We were watching a ride through earlier that was something about like bad kids.

1391
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,960
So you enjoys being bad.

1392
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,960
There we go.

1393
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,960
Yeah.

1394
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,960
So maybe it's a.

1395
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,960
There's a few of them.

1396
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,960
There's a few different lines.

1397
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:46,960
That one is pretty fun.

1398
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,960
I like that one.

1399
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,960
Yeah.

1400
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,960
You were asking for the salt mines.

1401
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,960
Which sounds like Bugsy recorded a few of these.

1402
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,960
Yeah.

1403
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,960
Mind your P's and Q's.

1404
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,960
Yeah.

1405
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,960
He works at Bugsy has worked on Pleasure Island.

1406
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,960
I assume that would make a lot of sense.

1407
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,960
Somewhere.

1408
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:13,960
And then we're now this is where it's a like a litany of darkness.

1409
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:18,960
I just like when I, when I talked about like just my temperature rising with thinking about

1410
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:26,280
this, like just think about, and it's so upsetting in the movie also just like you still have

1411
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,280
your brain.

1412
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,280
Yeah.

1413
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,560
But now my form is a donkey and they're just waiting for me to not be able to vocalize

1414
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,920
that I'm a person anymore.

1415
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,320
Do you remember that in the movie where it's like, what's your name?

1416
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,280
And like, oh, I'm getting upset thinking about it.

1417
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:44,760
We're like, the kid says like Daniel or something and he goes, this one can still talk and throws

1418
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,400
him back until he can't talk anymore.

1419
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,400
Right.

1420
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:54,660
So that implies like your brain is still human brain, but you're just in the body of a donkey

1421
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:59,580
and all you can do is scream as like a donkey's voice.

1422
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:03,940
And you're in your mind saying I'm a person, like let me go home.

1423
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,820
But you're to, we're watching this while you're pregnant.

1424
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:12,940
Also we're like bringing a kid into the, and like watching the grimace to like this thing

1425
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:17,420
about boys, bad things happening to little boys.

1426
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:22,140
Just thinking about, yeah, just, it is truly like, and that's where it like, it is funny

1427
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:25,980
that they get any mileage out of the magic of Pinocchio.

1428
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:32,820
Tom Manx, America's greatest, the real life Geppetto would be finally Geppetto for real.

1429
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,780
And I like, and when you wish upon a star is the anthem.

1430
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:39,820
And then it's for a film that has things that grotesque in it.

1431
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:40,820
It's upsetting.

1432
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:41,820
Yeah.

1433
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,780
I can't think of much more upsetting than that.

1434
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,780
Yeah.

1435
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,940
Have you had bad, have you had dreams about that occurring?

1436
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:50,100
I will tonight.

1437
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,100
Now we will.

1438
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,700
Cause now it's, now Figaro's keeping that in your head.

1439
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:55,700
Yep.

1440
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:59,540
Well that's pretty in multiple copies.

1441
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:04,860
I liked Pinocchio as a kid, but all this, I think I blacked out a lot of this stuff when

1442
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,500
I was like, I liked that stuff you're talking about.

1443
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,020
Like, oh, Jiminy Cricket's fun, isn't he?

1444
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,980
Well, it just didn't bother me as a kid.

1445
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:19,580
Like it was like, man, they turned into donkeys and like not thinking about, you know, what

1446
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:20,620
it actually means.

1447
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:21,620
It's terrible.

1448
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:26,340
I think I didn't even, so I was like, I didn't even think like, oh, I better not smoke cigars

1449
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,660
or drink beer.

1450
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,620
I just thought, oh, you're going to turn into a donkey soon.

1451
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,640
Like this will be what happens to you.

1452
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,540
So I just didn't want to deal with that part, that reality that I would soon be a donkey

1453
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,540
boy.

1454
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:42,140
As long as you don't get tricked by grifters, as long as you avoid like, you know, railway

1455
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,140
men.

1456
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,140
Don't take improv classes.

1457
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:48,340
Well, yeah, see that's what happened.

1458
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:54,300
The lesson went away as I learned so much theme park stuff and then I had to relearn

1459
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,300
it.

1460
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,860
COVID was a reset.

1461
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:01,980
The theaters went away and then like, like two people in coats are going to be like,

1462
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,460
isn't it time for you to get back in classes?

1463
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,460
Sharpen your skills.

1464
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:09,580
Be a performer on a stage.

1465
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,980
Everyone clapping for you.

1466
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,180
We take Venmo now.

1467
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:19,420
Local theater needs your help or whatever.

1468
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,020
Oh, there's nothing.

1469
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,460
Yes, we need your help.

1470
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,820
We're all a family.

1471
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,180
You may as well just be boarding the raft to Pledge of Island at that point.

1472
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:31,180
We all fell for it.

1473
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,440
Page slams down.

1474
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,700
This will be your home now.

1475
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,700
Practice your third beats.

1476
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,140
Oh, the best part of every show.

1477
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,180
Do your group games, your nonverbal.

1478
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,460
Yes, sound and movement openings.

1479
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,060
Everyone ends up acting like an ape.

1480
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,980
There you go. Act like a jackass.

1481
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:55,060
Why don't you see if it inspires any seeds?

1482
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:02,380
We're joking about, you know, we're all going like, yeah, a lot of dark stuff in this.

1483
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:09,420
But I don't know if you guys remember this, but in the middle of the pandemic last summer,

1484
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:16,500
less than reputable theme park webs like did clearly get worked by some readers who sincerely

1485
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,580
wrote in emails complaining about like they need to read.

1486
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:24,300
If they're redoing Snow White and Splash Mountain, they need to redo this.

1487
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:29,060
And sincerely were complaining about there is child slavery in this ride.

1488
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:34,500
And the emails all had the same ring of like they're using the same phrase of like the

1489
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,860
Pinocchio ride.

1490
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:39,100
It's not the happiest place to be on earth.

1491
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,340
The Pinocchio ride is not the happiest place in Disneyland.

1492
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:45,060
And I was to be on Earth.

1493
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,340
It's really clunky.

1494
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:52,860
Wait, so somebody had sent like a fake email to emails like Astro Turf emails, a false

1495
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:57,460
flag in the middle of that, like save the children epidemic where it's like Wayfair

1496
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:02,340
is selling kids like a QAnon madness.

1497
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,940
And this website posted it.

1498
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:07,820
It's like readers are saying they should change this ride.

1499
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,380
And they printed all of these.

1500
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,380
Yeah.

1501
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,540
Yeah, that's yeah.

1502
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:16,620
Well, I know the one you're talking about that'll say like fans demand.

1503
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:18,420
And then it's like it's one guy.

1504
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:27,060
It's this it's the account that posts about Jack Sparrow three times a day and has for

1505
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:28,340
the last three years.

1506
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:33,900
It truly is like what is this like a game meant to drive me insane?

1507
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,020
I can't unfollow it.

1508
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:35,820
I can't do it.

1509
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:39,540
We text each other every time they did it again.

1510
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,380
What's happening?

1511
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:41,900
What does it mean?

1512
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:47,340
How can grown adults care about Jack Sparrow to this extent?

1513
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:52,140
Five out of six people that I ran up to at this diner want Jack Sparrow back in the

1514
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,820
movies like headlines like that.

1515
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:56,340
You're like, that's newsworthy thing.

1516
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:02,340
Anyway, so look out for the new Q drop on the new Q's daring journey.

1517
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,220
Bizarre.

1518
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:08,860
I well, you know, it is it is odd and strange.

1519
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:14,900
But but Aaron, you were saying that like there OK, there have been the redos of these

1520
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,060
rides and they made Snow White not scary.

1521
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,780
Oh, if they redo this ride, I won't like it anymore.

1522
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,260
Touch one.

1523
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:24,460
They change one salt mine.

1524
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,340
I know I complained about the 60 watt light bulbs that they need.

1525
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:32,660
If you put in one 60 watt light bulb to brighten this place up, I won't like it

1526
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,300
anymore.

1527
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:37,380
I need it to be decaying and sad and a dud and a lemon.

1528
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,180
Yeah, yeah.

1529
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:46,100
If they did things, though, to make it sadder, what if they put more donkey boys in

1530
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:53,540
the cage like they're poorly lit and already falling apart, even though they're

1531
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:56,580
brand new from a construction standpoint, I'm all in.

1532
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:00,140
OK, yeah, because like whatever they like, stop the car in front of one of them.

1533
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,980
And it's really upsetting because you hear there like a minute monologue from them

1534
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:06,220
about what they're going through, what they're leaving behind.

1535
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:11,300
So as long as it's under the upsetting or like low rent range, it's good.

1536
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,380
I'm all for it.

1537
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:12,660
Yes.

1538
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:15,060
OK, I was going to graduate third grade.

1539
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,660
Now it's all mine for me.

1540
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,140
I was just coming here to stop my friend.

1541
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,620
Your car won't move until I see you shed a tear for me.

1542
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,180
We have the technology to do that.

1543
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,580
We're scanning your eyes.

1544
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,820
You're scanning your eyes for tears.

1545
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,900
Show that you care.

1546
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:40,540
And then Aaron's like, yes.

1547
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,540
All right.

1548
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,700
I love you seeing the new interactive crate.

1549
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,300
It's amazing.

1550
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:52,860
It's almost a breast after Pleasure Island when like Jiminy Cricket slowly gets

1551
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:59,340
lower down and then later goes like, oh, my gosh, Monstro like.

1552
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,100
Before it's too late.

1553
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,900
Yeah, when a whale gets launched at you.

1554
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:07,140
Oh, which is so confusing.

1555
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:07,860
I love that, too.

1556
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:12,420
There's so much time devoted to Pleasure Island and the donkey stuff and, you know,

1557
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:16,100
to the salt mine and, you know, every whip cracks, whip cracks.

1558
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:20,780
All the kids have been sold their crated and then you just round the corners.

1559
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:21,820
Monstro.

1560
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,020
Oh, yeah.

1561
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:23,540
Huh?

1562
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,780
Yeah, wait, whatever.

1563
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,660
What are you talking about?

1564
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:26,940
Why do you know his name?

1565
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,780
Oh, yeah, you know, this specific whale in the sea.

1566
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:37,580
Yeah, that is one of the classic Disney dark ride, like the Ursula thing where

1567
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,580
somebody pops in and you go, wait, what?

1568
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,580
And Ursula is dying in the background.

1569
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:45,340
We're past it.

1570
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,940
Look, love loves in the air.

1571
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:50,100
It's the old ending to Snow White where you're like, ah, the dwarves, they're

1572
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,300
like, they're on the mountains.

1573
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:52,660
We're the rise over.

1574
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:53,780
And we're like, what?

1575
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:54,540
I love it.

1576
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,300
Just like weird, like out of left field things, which I feel like they are

1577
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,260
getting rid of slowly.

1578
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:04,220
But I maybe to me, maybe it's part of the fantasy land experience that at least

1579
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:09,580
in the majority of them, there's like something really, you know, at least in

1580
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:14,300
the recent past, something strange and dark has occurred and then, and then

1581
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,180
doors swing open and you're outside again.

1582
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:16,460
Bye.

1583
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,180
Thanks for coming.

1584
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,260
Oh, dream is what your art makes.

1585
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:19,700
Bye.

1586
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:21,660
Part of the charm.

1587
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:22,020
Yeah.

1588
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:22,420
Yeah.

1589
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,020
Yeah.

1590
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,820
They, I, you guys, none of you have been on Snow White though, right?

1591
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:26,700
Not yet.

1592
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,500
No, we didn't get to do it.

1593
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:27,700
Yeah.

1594
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,500
Really solved this problem for snow.

1595
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,900
Like there's really like, you have a night, like everything feels very satisfying.

1596
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,860
All the moves make sense in the story.

1597
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,100
So maybe that's bad.

1598
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,020
Maybe that's bad.

1599
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:38,580
I don't know.

1600
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,740
You don't want it for, well, what happens in the movie to the, I don't think

1601
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,180
they get saved in the movie.

1602
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:46,220
I think they do go to the salt mines.

1603
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:46,860
They do.

1604
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:47,300
Yeah.

1605
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,380
All those kids are going to die.

1606
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,100
Donkeys.

1607
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:52,700
Hopefully sooner rather than later.

1608
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:54,340
Like, honestly, you pray for death.

1609
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:54,740
Yeah.

1610
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:55,060
Yeah.

1611
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,420
Pinocchio gets out and sends no help.

1612
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:03,060
Which also begs the question, why does no one help Geppetto?

1613
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:07,460
Is he just that reviled that or was he going around to people and going like,

1614
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,780
can you help me find my lost puppet?

1615
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:13,700
It's like, no, man, I already, you're already gone thin fucking ice.

1616
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:16,540
Well, yeah.

1617
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:22,660
A puppet theater is the biggest attraction in town, but a puppeteer is spit on.

1618
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,220
How dare you?

1619
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,940
They should foreclose your creepy store.

1620
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:30,060
Your 40 clocks wakes up every night.

1621
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:33,980
I don't know.

1622
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:36,100
I make them, they're set to 4 a.m.

1623
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,420
I don't know what else to do.

1624
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:40,100
Has anyone ever bought, are his clocks for sale?

1625
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:41,980
I would think.

1626
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:43,340
You would hope.

1627
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,580
I mean, what is he doing then?

1628
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:48,340
In the, not in the, not like in the ride.

1629
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,980
You can't like buy the ones at the end.

1630
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:50,460
No.

1631
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:50,860
In the world of the.

1632
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,620
Although there used to be used to be at the.

1633
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:57,660
Yeah, there used to be a Geppetto like wood shop gift shop at the end of this,

1634
01:13:57,660 --> 01:14:00,740
where you'd buy like in the same way on Galaxy's Edge, you can buy like little

1635
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:04,900
wooden Boba Fett's, you can buy like little wooden like trinkets that the Geppetto

1636
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,500
would make and apparently that didn't sell very well.

1637
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:12,260
No, it's like this where you could buy your family crest or like an actual sword

1638
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:15,780
or suit of armor, like really fun to walk through.

1639
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,420
What do you clear every year?

1640
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,540
Like, how much do you make?

1641
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:25,540
I bought an $800 cuckoo clock custom made shipped from Italy.

1642
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:28,500
I have to carry this on splash mountain with me.

1643
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:40,460
So yeah, it is like that litany of whip cracks and salt mines and now a whale.

1644
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,660
And what is the whale doing?

1645
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:44,660
He's jumping up and jumping up.

1646
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,980
There's some light flashes.

1647
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,780
Yeah, he's trying to eat you, I guess.

1648
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:49,140
Right.

1649
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:53,860
And we know that he does eat them in the movie, but I guess we just skip over that

1650
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:54,260
part.

1651
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:54,900
Right.

1652
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,660
Yeah, because Geppetto is already OK.

1653
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:58,180
Yeah.

1654
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:01,860
Geppetto is just looking for Pinocchio, but they find each other in the whale in

1655
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:02,860
the movie, isn't that right?

1656
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,540
Yes.

1657
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,100
Yeah.

1658
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,580
Which why it'd be fun to like end up in the whale.

1659
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,140
It would.

1660
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:07,580
It would be.

1661
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:07,940
Yeah.

1662
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:08,300
That'd be.

1663
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:11,420
I mean, you do it in even though you don't really do it, you do it in the

1664
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,140
storybook boats.

1665
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:14,460
Yes.

1666
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:14,820
Yeah.

1667
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,940
You go through it at least.

1668
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,020
You're not in it's like guts.

1669
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:21,940
But guys, remember opening morning of Galaxy's Edge when we got to see the guy

1670
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,380
brushing monstrous teeth?

1671
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,860
Oh, wow.

1672
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:26,220
Boy, did we cheer.

1673
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:27,460
And that's not ironic at all.

1674
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,500
Oh, my God.

1675
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,780
We were so excited.

1676
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:34,180
Just never would have occurred to me that the whole group of people walking by as

1677
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:36,820
we saw it, we were all everyone, I think, had the same reaction.

1678
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,180
Like seeing a giant whale.

1679
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,020
Nobody knew that as a Disneyland fact.

1680
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:42,860
Nobody had.

1681
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:45,020
And the hero had not pulled in there yet.

1682
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:45,420
Right.

1683
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:46,140
Let's do it.

1684
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,500
What a delightful one.

1685
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:48,060
Yeah.

1686
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:48,420
Yeah.

1687
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:51,380
That can replace any pubescent memory I have.

1688
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:54,020
Wedding day out.

1689
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:54,620
Wedding day.

1690
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:54,940
Yeah.

1691
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:56,220
Sorry.

1692
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,300
That memory is done.

1693
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,020
Whale toothbrush in.

1694
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,460
So, unlit Geppetto.

1695
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,700
Then the blue fairy shows up.

1696
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,180
Then you are back in the comfort.

1697
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:13,300
You kind of weave back through Pinocchio Village.

1698
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:13,940
Things get kind of peaceful.

1699
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:14,820
It's redundant.

1700
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:15,660
Yeah.

1701
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:18,500
Because you've seen it a little bit before you go to Pleasure Islands.

1702
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,140
Yes, true.

1703
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:20,460
Yeah.

1704
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:25,380
Well, the whole ride does kind of end with like a bunch of ballast a little bit.

1705
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:29,140
Like sort of the robots and the excitement are a bit done.

1706
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:32,140
I mean, you get blue fairy, the Pepper's ghost effect.

1707
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:32,900
It's neat.

1708
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:33,340
Yeah.

1709
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:36,780
Not even really sure where she is hiding.

1710
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,620
I don't know where that is.

1711
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,020
Right.

1712
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:39,660
Stage.

1713
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:40,500
Yeah, that is a good question.

1714
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,860
Because I was rewatching it.

1715
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,300
I was like, oh, yeah, that's pretty cool.

1716
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:43,780
Yeah.

1717
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,100
Yeah.

1718
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:48,940
I also like to just imagine that it's just Geppetto is like fantasizing and it's not real.

1719
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,980
And he died in the whale.

1720
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:53,460
Yes, I'll say yes.

1721
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:59,220
It's just, yeah, it's a nice, like peaceful death dream he's having.

1722
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:01,420
And none of it.

1723
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:03,260
That was just he like brought.

1724
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:06,540
He did make the puppet, but it didn't come to life.

1725
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:11,940
And he kind of carried it around and imagined like, what if that fox told him to go somewhere?

1726
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:16,980
It was just like a bunch of madness until he fell into the pier while he was talking to himself.

1727
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:17,900
Isn't that a better?

1728
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,420
Swallowed up by what?

1729
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,180
I like that.

1730
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,020
It's a better story.

1731
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:20,340
Yeah.

1732
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:20,860
Yeah.

1733
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:21,380
Yeah.

1734
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:31,140
But so he, well, this is the scene where he's supposed to become a real boy.

1735
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:35,660
And yet does this, did this occur to anybody that he does not?

1736
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,700
If you watch the video.

1737
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,420
Right, right, right, right.

1738
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:44,540
It's the same like logic of like the Little Mermaid cartoon.

1739
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,340
She's still a mermaid.

1740
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:53,220
Maybe it was a prequel or something, but it's just like, you know, we just watch a whole movie where you got unmermated.

1741
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:54,660
Yeah, forever.

1742
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:55,100
Yeah.

1743
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,820
Yeah, I don't know.

1744
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,300
That's yeah, that's a good point.

1745
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,380
I don't know.

1746
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,860
Are they trying to say that this is just an infinite loop?

1747
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:08,100
Is this like that we're going to do this forever or like we don't want to resolve it?

1748
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,780
Because then you would never need to go on the ride again.

1749
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:13,260
I mean, they don't do that with other rides.

1750
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:17,780
So it is an odd choice not to put in a very pivotal moment in Pinocchio's life.

1751
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:21,740
An unpleasant moment because we were talking about smooth Pinocchio early.

1752
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:29,100
He is a little even as a kid, I was like, oh, that's what he looks like as a boy.

1753
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:33,380
That's how I felt about the beast too, when he turns into a beast.

1754
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,660
Yeah, that's disappointing.

1755
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:40,380
Because you've grown to like this character just as they are in so many other stories.

1756
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,300
Or it's like you had it inside you.

1757
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,180
You were right.

1758
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,500
You were good all along.

1759
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,660
You know, right.

1760
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:48,060
And true beauty is your inner beauty.

1761
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,260
It's not your exterior.

1762
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:52,060
Then the lesson for a lot of the stuff is like, yeah, but he's also like this.

1763
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:55,580
Luckily, luckily, he's a beautiful man.

1764
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,180
Now he's not the beast.

1765
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:00,420
He's sort of like there's like a little bit of Fabio going on.

1766
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:02,740
That's what I, yeah, that's why I said, be like a beautiful man.

1767
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,580
Like, yeah, yes.

1768
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:07,220
The way that Fabio is beautiful, like a horse.

1769
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,340
Exactly. Yes.

1770
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,460
Luxurious man.

1771
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,060
Exactly.

1772
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:14,660
So, yeah, he's just like it's a different it gives him a different vibe, which maybe

1773
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:17,620
you spend another movie with him, you would feel that way.

1774
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:19,620
But now we've, you know, we'll see.

1775
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:23,060
Was there never a weird sequel where you hang out with like?

1776
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,100
As soon as I said that, I was like, is there a?

1777
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,820
This blonde Adonis?

1778
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,940
Because there's the sequel.

1779
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:33,220
The first sequel is the like, isn't it doesn't like take place in between like

1780
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,380
Christmas and Thanksgiving or something?

1781
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,580
I've never seen it.

1782
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:38,260
There's like a prequel Beauty and the Beast where it takes.

1783
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:39,540
Enchanted Wish.

1784
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:44,180
Yes. Tim Curry is a CGI organ that mismatches the rest of the film.

1785
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,780
Yes. Right.

1786
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:49,620
Like just utterly different movie.

1787
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:53,780
Yeah. Like was drafted straight out of reboot.

1788
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:57,300
Right. And that's a prequel.

1789
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,100
Yeah. Yeah.

1790
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:02,020
Now they had to keep finding ways to like, we got a remake of Fire.

1791
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,460
We got a really good guy.

1792
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:05,540
Yeah, because they knew it was a problem.

1793
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:08,020
Nobody wants to see this Fabio looking beast.

1794
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:10,980
But in this case, don't you want to like have the resolution of this?

1795
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:12,580
Don't you at least want to say now he's a real?

1796
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:13,620
Now he's a real boy.

1797
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:17,300
The pride underplays the lying element of the story.

1798
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:21,140
It focuses on the journey and adventure and sometimes it's a big nose,

1799
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,900
but they really don't cover the lion.

1800
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,340
They don't talk about it at all.

1801
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:29,940
Right. So it actually takes out, I guess that one's the most like concrete thing

1802
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:33,300
you should tell like a kid, like even though, yeah, like you should tell them,

1803
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,260
like, oh, don't lie.

1804
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:37,380
Always tell the truth, even though, you know, sometimes you don't always have to,

1805
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:40,500
but that depends situation by situation, you know, but that's a nuance.

1806
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,540
They learn that.

1807
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,860
Yeah. But okay, generally, don't lie.

1808
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,540
Just keep that to yourself.

1809
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,860
Not everyone needs to know everything, you know.

1810
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:51,300
But at least that would give like a clear thing to a kid that they want to understand

1811
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,740
because most kids aren't like, I'm dying to have a cigar at five.

1812
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,260
Like they're not looking for that.

1813
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,180
So if you were really trying to teach some kid something,

1814
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,420
at least that's the closest thing to a lesson.

1815
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:01,860
Okay, I get it.

1816
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:06,260
Pinocchio is being tortured brutally because he lied.

1817
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:06,980
Okay, got it.

1818
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:09,780
I can draw a straight line there if they see if they're on this ride.

1819
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,700
You can still have heavy handed morals.

1820
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,700
Just make it applicable to your real life.

1821
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:16,660
Yeah, something.

1822
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:19,700
Yeah. Why are you yelling at me about cigars?

1823
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,260
I don't know.

1824
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:23,460
Look, especially now, like my childhood past, I did not,

1825
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:27,220
me, I've had a try to cigar or two in my adulthood, but that's okay.

1826
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:27,780
You did it.

1827
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:30,100
Walt, I didn't do it when I was a kid, I swear.

1828
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,700
So why are you mad at me?

1829
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:32,260
Right.

1830
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:35,380
And all if you didn't know anything about Pinocchio, you'd be like, oh, look at this

1831
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:37,700
young actor and now he's being punished.

1832
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,220
I guess I shouldn't go into the acting profession.

1833
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:47,860
Was this all, was Pinocchio just a big way to get kids to stop coming up to Walt and saying,

1834
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,860
how can I be in one of your movies, sir?

1835
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:54,100
Well, I'll tell you what, go see this new film I have.

1836
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,700
He did himself a personal favor.

1837
01:21:55,700 --> 01:22:01,300
Unless you've got the charm of a young Suzanne Plachette, don't even think about it.

1838
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:01,540
Yeah.

1839
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:02,900
Knock it off, kid.

1840
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:07,380
You all look like the children from this picture, this, which I am showing the Walkman's

1841
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,420
first album cover of just children smoking cigarettes.

1842
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:14,980
Oh, they're all in like, like sooty halves.

1843
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:15,940
Yeah.

1844
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:16,900
Showing us.

1845
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:20,500
I see. Yep. That'll be you. That's actors.

1846
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,100
All right. Well, that was my child.

1847
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,300
Yeah. I have a cabbie hat.

1848
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,340
I was just smoking.

1849
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,140
How was being a newsie?

1850
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,380
Well paid.

1851
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,060
It was terrible on the joints. A lot of work.

1852
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:37,620
Children should not develop that level of arthritis.

1853
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,620
Hours of tossing the one motion over arthritis.

1854
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:47,540
And on Sunday, the thicker paper don't even get me started.

1855
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:54,660
So then, so Pinocchio is maybe he'll become a real boy after we're gone.

1856
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:55,860
The blue fairy shows up.

1857
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:57,220
The blue fairy is there.

1858
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:05,220
That causes Jiminy Cricket to say, does he say this is a cause for celebration?

1859
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,580
Yeah. Something like that?

1860
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:09,380
It's something about like, let's celebrate.

1861
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:12,180
And then you go into an empty room full of clocks.

1862
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:13,860
There's not a single person.

1863
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:14,980
There's not.

1864
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,020
Well, now.

1865
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:22,020
Like, are we supposed to assume like, let's go celebrate.

1866
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:22,740
We're out of here.

1867
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:28,100
We're all left in the car while they go celebrate elsewhere.

1868
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:28,580
Eight and ten.

1869
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:29,860
Why not get to hang with the cricket?

1870
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,500
It's like a party with him after all this.

1871
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:35,700
Where your primary entertainment is a puppet theater.

1872
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:41,220
To go in a room and see so many accurate clocks ticking in one place is a party.

1873
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,180
That's a celebration.

1874
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:46,580
That was the equivalent of going to a movie back then.

1875
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:46,980
Yeah.

1876
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,260
Going into a room with different kind of clocks and looking at them.

1877
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,100
Look at all these synchronized clocks.

1878
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:53,860
That was like seeing the Avengers.

1879
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:55,780
If you saw like seven clocks on the wall.

1880
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,740
And that's how this ride ends.

1881
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:04,900
That is your like, ta-da, grand finale is a quiet room of ticking clocks.

1882
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,540
Rooms of well-maintained clocks.

1883
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,780
The time is accurate.

1884
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:12,980
They're loud, but enough, but not too loud.

1885
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:14,580
They're charming.

1886
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:15,460
Well crafted.

1887
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:16,500
Good knots.

1888
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:21,620
Rise of the Resistance ends with you're on a star destroyer and it's blowing up

1889
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:25,860
and you have to get in an escape pod and fly back to the surface of a planet.

1890
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:26,340
Yeah.

1891
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:26,900
Pinocchio.

1892
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:29,460
The equivalent of looking at seven accurate clocks.

1893
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:31,940
Exactly.

1894
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:32,500
Same thing.

1895
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:37,940
Lieutenant Beck could have a cuckoo clock at that console.

1896
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:38,820
Oh yeah, for sure.

1897
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:40,260
He'd love to.

1898
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,140
Yeah, and then you're out and you see a sign that says,

1899
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:45,300
when you wish upon a star, all your dreams come true.

1900
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,460
All your dreams of seeing accurate clocks.

1901
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:53,940
Sit in a clock room, look at a bunch of plates on a mantle.

1902
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:54,820
What's going on with that?

1903
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,300
You see that at knots.

1904
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,340
When you go to Knott's Berry Farm, I'm like, here's what a mantle was like.

1905
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:03,060
And it would have five silver plates.

1906
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:06,260
And I feel like I remember my grandma having her five plates.

1907
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:07,860
Make sure you have the plates.

1908
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:09,300
What is that?

1909
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:14,580
You would have a piece of furniture that would display plates standing up.

1910
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:17,540
And I do recall, I think my grandmother had it too.

1911
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:20,580
I don't know, you would show your plates, I guess, to people.

1912
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,700
Yeah, you're not going to...

1913
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,060
They're probably dusty as shit.

1914
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,260
You're not going to eat off of them.

1915
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:25,140
They would be like plates.

1916
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:27,060
Sometimes you put it under a different plate.

1917
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:27,780
What do you call that?

1918
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:32,340
Oh yeah, like for an elegant meal where you have the show plate.

1919
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,340
Where the mayor comes over or something to the house.

1920
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:40,740
And then waiters come around and take away the show plate.

1921
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,420
This gets no time.

1922
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:47,060
Back into the cupboard or back into the display cabinet or the mantle.

1923
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:53,060
Yes, that's still a trap, a part of the show at fine dining, fine restaurants.

1924
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:56,660
But I think people were like, we don't have to do this in our homes every night.

1925
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:57,700
This is exhausting.

1926
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:02,340
I make my toddler his dinner with a show plate.

1927
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:08,180
Yeah, once Kmart came along, once you're like, I bought my plates at the same place I bought my underwear.

1928
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:10,900
It's like, oh yeah, show plates are on their way out.

1929
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:16,340
It's like sometimes I feel like the kid's just in it for the little pieces of chicken nuggets

1930
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,340
and doesn't even care about presentation.

1931
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,980
Put so much effort into the show plate and the white glove.

1932
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,740
I've seen no appreciation for luxury.

1933
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:31,620
And the mayor's baby's coming over and he's not even going to impress him.

1934
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:33,620
He doesn't even know.

1935
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:38,100
And that's Pinocchio's daring journey.

1936
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:38,820
What a strange.

1937
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:41,780
I always bounce off the car at the end and go, ah.

1938
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:42,820
Yeah, I mean, it's good.

1939
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:43,320
We did it.

1940
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:50,580
It's almost odd to step through it in this way and go and then salt mines and then plates

1941
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:53,140
that you are always on this ride like, yay.

1942
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:56,020
Like you're a dog sticking your head out the window.

1943
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:00,340
Look, that and that, it's so exuberant.

1944
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,420
One of these days I feel like they're going to change it.

1945
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:05,220
And when they do, I'll be really disappointed.

1946
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:08,740
Little pockets of weirdness slowly getting cleaned up at Disney.

1947
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:12,340
Even 10 years ago, there was so much little oddity.

1948
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:16,980
I mean, that Carnation Gardens stuck around for so long where it's just like, this is just

1949
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:20,340
an outdoor gazebo kind of thing.

1950
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,500
And sometimes people swing dance here.

1951
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:26,260
And it's like, isn't this the most expensive real estate in the country?

1952
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:26,760
Yes.

1953
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,460
People swing dance at Fantasy Fair now, though.

1954
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,020
They do.

1955
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:33,060
So there's still some strange swing dancing happening.

1956
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:37,380
That sums up a lot of stuff that we're all obsessed with about any of this.

1957
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:45,460
It's like the primest of real estate that a corporation spends billions of dollars

1958
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:46,740
to maintain every year.

1959
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:52,980
And some of the things there are the most outlandish blockbuster things you've ever seen.

1960
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:56,500
Unreal uses of technology and storytelling.

1961
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,300
And then also, here's this cuckoo clock room.

1962
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:01,780
Some of it is just confusing trash, and I love it.

1963
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,460
But that's part of it.

1964
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:03,620
Yeah.

1965
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,220
And I don't know.

1966
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:10,260
I think what we get caught on so much is how has this been allowed to stay here?

1967
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,500
But it's great that it's allowed to stay.

1968
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:17,460
If they were able to micromanage everything, it would be something so much kind of sleepier.

1969
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,980
I think I said, was it on the Fortune Teller one?

1970
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:26,340
Where I was like, I think if Disney or any other, say this was a new idea to build a giant

1971
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:31,300
multimillion dollar theme park entertainment place, so much weird stuff would be gone.

1972
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:36,740
There would be no like, now we must allocate a spot for people to square dance or to dance

1973
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:39,940
like for once every month or something like that stuff would be gone.

1974
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:41,300
Where will the ska bands go?

1975
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:47,620
So yeah, I think they're like some of it's hold over, but then now it's just sort of

1976
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:48,900
grandfathered in to try.

1977
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:54,660
I'm sure the Imagineers have like some fondness for some of the odd stuff like this.

1978
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,500
I mean, with Pinocchio, yeah, I don't know.

1979
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:01,940
It's still who knows if it could be replaced by what would be the most popular thing.

1980
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:06,020
I guess they're probably make a bigger Frozen ride, but that's what I think this is going

1981
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:10,740
to end up being some like it's some maybe this will be the one that gets changed out for.

1982
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:13,140
This is Tangled or something.

1983
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:14,260
For sure it will be.

1984
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:18,660
Yeah, it's like, I mean, who knows if that's in 30 years, but there's no way they would.

1985
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:21,620
The other three are more untouchable, especially with Snow White.

1986
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:25,780
I would have said Snow White was not untouchable until they did this new redo on it, and we'll

1987
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:29,940
see how the lines are, but them doing that much work to it and Snow White's the first

1988
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,860
movie and that feels a little more precious.

1989
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,060
This is the second one, right?

1990
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:33,780
The second one.

1991
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:37,060
Yeah, second appears at the time was not a big hit.

1992
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:37,860
I don't believe.

1993
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:38,420
I suppose.

1994
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:39,380
Why?

1995
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,100
Why was it?

1996
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,540
It's 1940.

1997
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:43,300
America has entered the war.

1998
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,660
The world is at war.

1999
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:47,060
Come see a sad, upsetting film.

2000
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:50,020
Come be upset with Mr.

2001
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:55,220
War might be depressing, but if you think about turning into a donkey might make you appreciate

2002
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:55,860
the war.

2003
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:56,420
Yeah, sure.

2004
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:04,740
So yeah, I will say, I mean, depending on how it's funny because I think depending on how

2005
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:10,580
ambitious they're going to get with their new like Disney, whatever they're calling it,

2006
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:14,340
the Anaheim Initiative thing where they're going to build the one that built like tons of stuff.

2007
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:15,060
Such a boring phrase.

2008
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:15,780
I already don't remember.

2009
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:16,900
Yeah, I don't remember what it is either.

2010
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:17,700
I don't remember that one.

2011
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,780
The initiative, the Disneyland Initiative.

2012
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,180
Disneyland proposal.

2013
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:26,580
I feel like if that stuff goes like they go like, yeah, do whatever you want.

2014
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:28,420
And they're like, let's put a bunch of money into that.

2015
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:33,860
Pinocchio has a bigger chance of being say like it will stick around depending on the

2016
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,060
ambition of the rest of it.

2017
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:38,020
Because then they're like, well, we don't need we have the room now to do other stuff.

2018
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:38,820
Why would we?

2019
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,140
Right.

2020
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:41,700
Well, and Fantasyland is always packed.

2021
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:43,860
Like it's always you go to Fantasyland at noon.

2022
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:44,340
Sure.

2023
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:45,700
It's always packed.

2024
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:50,500
So it's not like hurting for like, oh, we need something to draw people.

2025
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:53,860
It'll always be very popular.

2026
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:58,900
But I'm just saying like if they're not going to do a big ambitious plan,

2027
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:01,460
they're definitely going to like find places.

2028
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:02,820
Start finding the holes.

2029
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:03,300
Yeah.

2030
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:05,780
And they're going to go, well, one of these is not like the other.

2031
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:07,540
One of these dark rides, not like the other.

2032
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:08,020
Yeah.

2033
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:08,500
Yeah.

2034
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,220
One of them has the notion of salt mines.

2035
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:11,460
Yeah.

2036
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,700
There's a cuckoo clock at the end.

2037
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:13,940
Yeah.

2038
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:16,020
Has anybody been on this thing in 10 years?

2039
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:17,220
My little dud.

2040
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:17,940
No.

2041
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:18,500
Yeah.

2042
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,380
But you love it.

2043
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:20,500
You want it to be how it is.

2044
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,460
And let me ask you this.

2045
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:27,220
If it were to go away and there was some opportunity to salvage one item,

2046
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:29,620
and have it in your home, have it in our home,

2047
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:37,220
and pass it on to our next generation, what would we want to have to remember our little dud by?

2048
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:38,340
I only get to pick one.

2049
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:42,420
I'd probably, I mean, it's massive, but I'd probably take the crate that says to the salt mine.

2050
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:45,300
Oh, man.

2051
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,900
And that's how you keep them in line.

2052
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:47,380
Yes.

2053
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:49,060
All right.

2054
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:50,500
You want to go to the penalty box?

2055
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:54,580
I was going to suggest a different thing to keep Scott in line.

2056
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,380
This clown.

2057
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:58,660
You know, he's fine.

2058
01:31:58,660 --> 01:31:59,620
Let me clarify.

2059
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:02,340
I am not scared of all clowns.

2060
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:02,980
I love it.

2061
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:03,620
There are some clowns.

2062
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:05,060
Every other episode.

2063
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:05,780
I love it.

2064
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:06,900
New clowns around every corner.

2065
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:10,260
It's like 1950s men who are dressed as clowns.

2066
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:10,980
I think that's it.

2067
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:11,220
Yes.

2068
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:13,860
That being a cartoon, I think I'm rarely scared

2069
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:19,540
of cartoon clowns, but when it's like, yeah, it's like, you know, like a guy with kind of

2070
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:26,100
drink bloat and like who hasn't shaved properly and he kind of like rushed some clown makeup on

2071
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:32,420
and then like a little hat with his like stringy unwashed hair coming out underneath.

2072
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:37,780
So now I have to rewatch Mad Men to see if there's an episode where like John Ham or Rich Summer

2073
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:43,460
dress up as like begrudgingly dress up as a clown for their kid's birthday.

2074
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:44,980
So something I could have done.

2075
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:47,940
Scott, do you so you like Bozo's clown babies?

2076
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:49,300
Oh, wait.

2077
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:49,860
Oh, God.

2078
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:50,980
I stepped right in.

2079
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,660
No, I don't like all cartoons.

2080
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:54,020
Bozo's clown babies.

2081
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:57,460
Do you see if you've seen those clown babies?

2082
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,020
I haven't.

2083
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,140
I have poor vision.

2084
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,180
So I kind of can't see.

2085
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:01,300
Okay, let's keep it that way.

2086
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:04,420
Imagine the cutest little clown babies you can.

2087
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:07,140
Well, now I just have the Muppet Babies theme song stuck in my head.

2088
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,540
Seems very that era.

2089
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:14,180
While we're while we're asking running things by you guys,

2090
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:17,780
Erin, I want to ask you something I asked Scott on the last episode as a kid.

2091
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:22,420
Did you watch the film Rock-A-Doodle about Shana Clare the Bird?

2092
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:26,580
No, no, Rock-A-Doodle was not part of my my my kid.

2093
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:26,980
Okay.

2094
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:33,060
But we have a friend who was very into it and showed it to us and I was like, oh, this just doesn't.

2095
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:35,220
Did we check out of Rock-A-Doodle?

2096
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:35,460
Yeah.

2097
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:36,740
Hmm, interesting.

2098
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:38,660
Yeah, I didn't listen to your last episode.

2099
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:39,300
Jason's.

2100
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:44,820
Oh, well, hey, spoiler alert, Rock-A-Doodle is back and back again.

2101
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:50,980
Well, it comes up is like the when Disney was going to do a story of the legend of

2102
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:54,100
Shanta Clare, but like this was a Don Bluth.

2103
01:33:54,740 --> 01:34:00,020
I was talking about the Don Bluth film in the the 80s and that that I feel similar to when

2104
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:06,020
you describe something as a like that has a Pinocchio level of sinister energy in it.

2105
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:13,860
But I also wanted to run you by you guys and Mike, you do a newer theme park innovation.

2106
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:21,220
This was sent to us by a Twitter user Fry Cook on Venus and the person who uploaded the

2107
01:34:21,220 --> 01:34:24,180
video originally on Twitter is named Asher Adams.

2108
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:30,900
This is a new offering at Universal Orlando and it's a big walk around boss.

2109
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:31,380
Maybe.

2110
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,180
I know all about this.

2111
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:35,540
I know all about this.

2112
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,420
I'm a big fan of this walk around boss, baby.

2113
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:41,620
I was at Universal not but a few days ago and I did not.

2114
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,140
Is this in Hollywood or no?

2115
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:45,780
Just this is this is in Orlando.

2116
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:47,300
This video is walking.

2117
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:48,100
Stern is a guest.

2118
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:49,380
I think I love it, though.

2119
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,980
It's a little bit of the vibe of that walk around toad.

2120
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:56,900
Universal Japan.

2121
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:57,400
Yes.

2122
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:00,580
It's like little guy with a huge head.

2123
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:01,220
Yep.

2124
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:02,420
He's kind of cool.

2125
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:03,220
I agree.

2126
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:03,540
Yeah.

2127
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:05,380
I've never seen boss, baby.

2128
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:06,660
I think I love it, though.

2129
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:09,700
If you just like judge it off of this.

2130
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:15,700
If he's just a guy who kind of makes finger guns at you from a from a great distance.

2131
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:15,940
Right.

2132
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:16,500
All for it.

2133
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:16,740
Yeah.

2134
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:18,020
No reason to be upset about that.

2135
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:18,340
Yeah.

2136
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:23,140
We got to hopefully they bring him to Hollywood so we can I guess we can go out to Florida and meet

2137
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:29,620
him when you were talking about unpleasant old cartoons that you've that other kids didn't like.

2138
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:34,900
Aaron, I know you were fond of this bizarre movie Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night.

2139
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:35,140
Yes.

2140
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:36,340
Yes.

2141
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:39,700
That's what I thought maybe you were talking about Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night.

2142
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:46,420
I loved loved loved Pinocchio as a kid and I had a we went to the video store every week to go rent

2143
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:50,740
movies and I loved it because all I had to do was give the phone number like my parents phone number

2144
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:55,140
and I can rent videos so my mom would let me go like be an adult like you could go into the video

2145
01:35:55,140 --> 01:36:00,980
store and I rented Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night probably monthly.

2146
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:06,980
Which is like this other Pinocchio just to clarify it's not Disney.

2147
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:08,260
Is Christopher Lloyd in it?

2148
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:09,380
Christopher Lloyd is in it.

2149
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:10,020
Emperor of the Night.

2150
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:11,300
No I didn't write down his character.

2151
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:12,260
As a boy.

2152
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:14,180
He's always the Emperor of the Night.

2153
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:14,660
Okay.

2154
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:20,900
I think he is the villain of the movie but it also features if you don't know this this odd non-Disney

2155
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:27,620
film yes Ricky Lee Jones singing this weird creepy song that I found was written by the person who

2156
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:29,460
wrote all the Steve Winwood hits.

2157
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:29,860
Really?

2158
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:33,860
Yes back in the high life and Valerie and eventually my heart will go on.

2159
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:34,740
No wonder I liked it.

2160
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:39,220
Also wrote this this creepy what was that song do you know it?

2161
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:44,340
No I don't we rewatched it when we watched Disney's Pinocchio as well.

2162
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:44,580
Yeah.

2163
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:46,580
Wow Tom Bosley Don Knotts.

2164
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:51,060
Don Knotts as G Willikers Ed Asner as Scalawag the Raccoon

2165
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:58,180
Jonathan Harris from Lost in Space as Lieutenant Grumblebee what's any of this who are any of them?

2166
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:00,660
But this movie is packed.

2167
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:06,500
It's another bizarre like the original Pinocchio another like just insane characters that don't

2168
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:10,820
fit together why are we in space there's lieutenants why's Pinocchio meeting lieutenants

2169
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:14,340
and emperors Pinocchio looks a little bit like Rainbow Brite or something.

2170
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:17,060
That's probably why I liked it I really liked Rainbow Brite.

2171
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,100
Very similar to Rainbow Brite.

2172
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:18,980
That whole aesthetic.

2173
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:23,620
It was really like drawn over like really like it felt like rotoscoped a little bit with some

2174
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:26,180
of the characters and like creepy too much detail.

2175
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:31,620
A filmation movie which was founded in the valley it was founded in Reseda.

2176
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:33,940
Yeah and was really close to where I grew up.

2177
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:34,900
My beloved Reseda.

2178
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:36,740
Yeah.

2179
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:39,220
Um yeah that's a that's a bizarre one.

2180
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:44,740
Which episode do we do there's a character named Willikers we just came upon right in the recent

2181
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:45,540
past am I wrong?

2182
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,460
Not the name of Knott's new.

2183
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:48,900
No that's Whittles.

2184
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:49,700
That's Whittles.

2185
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:54,900
That's Whittles but Willikers is a character we came upon months ago and I cannot remember

2186
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:57,940
and somebody who's listening now is yelling the name of it out at me.

2187
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:59,460
You know what I'm talking about though that sounds familiar.

2188
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:01,140
Yeah a cartoon character.

2189
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:05,380
Willikers from maybe a different like a different old ride or something.

2190
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:06,660
Oh this is gonna get no.

2191
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:07,140
Not sure.

2192
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:08,420
Well we'll come back to it.

2193
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:12,980
Okay um let me move let me move on to this uh because we have to talk about this a little bit

2194
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:18,900
uh and it'll it'll bring us into our final thing um Aaron you wished upon a star and your dream

2195
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:22,900
came true uh you you got to be on the prices right.

2196
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:23,380
Oh yeah.

2197
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:29,220
Yes this was and which was a a lifelong dream like you attempted to do this many years ago.

2198
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:34,580
I got tickets um I've loved the prices right for ever and ever and for my 18th birthday

2199
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:40,020
that's what I did I skipped school and I got tickets to go to a taping of the prices right

2200
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:44,340
but that was back when they just gave tickets to anyone who wrote in and I didn't know that

2201
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:48,020
you had to get there at like four in the morning if you wanted a chance to even walk in the

2202
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:52,500
building so I waltzed in there way too late and everyone was like yeah like.

2203
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:54,020
He worked on.

2204
01:38:55,220 --> 01:39:01,300
I don't know what you're thinking getting here at 10 o'clock like um and that kind of turned me

2205
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:03,140
off from it so I never I never tried again.

2206
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:10,820
You didn't pursue it again and then in this bizarre COVID lockdown era they changed their

2207
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:16,820
system of doing things and they had to vet people and test people and it still was like not you know

2208
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:21,540
it was not guaranteed that you would be on even after passing the audition you still get there

2209
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:24,260
and they have to talk to you and make sure you're not a crazy person.

2210
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:26,340
Make sure you are a crazy person.

2211
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:29,780
Sorry I'm sorry yeah don't be afraid of myself as jackass as possible.

2212
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:34,100
Yeah they bring in 12 and nine get to play.

2213
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:35,460
Yeah yeah which is pretty good.

2214
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:36,500
Good odds yeah.

2215
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:37,140
Really good odds.

2216
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:40,980
Those numbers are great I don't know how much longer they'll be doing it this way

2217
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:46,500
but you sort of took advantage of the new way that they've been doing it which led to this

2218
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:53,460
great moment of the show begins it is like they say the price is right and then Aaron

2219
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:59,220
Garner come on down like immediately after um and you're and this is still so let me let me say this

2220
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:04,100

2224
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:27,220
just I'll just film it off the tv I guess like with my camera I know how to rip it or anything

2225
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:33,700
so yeah geez so wonderful so appreciate it and it was so like so fun watching people like live

2226
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:39,140
react and watch and watch the thing but like so you this just aired but you did it in February

2227
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:43,860
when things were still so covety and so miserable and you got to have this moment of it where you

2228
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:49,140
there was like a there was like a little hook to put your mask on correct yeah at the at the

2229
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:55,220
podiums show show oh that was at the podium but you like like you got to like you were still

2230
01:40:55,940 --> 01:41:01,620
masked but then like took it off to run out is that correct oh yeah yeah you held your masks to

2231
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:06,820
your face in the wings and if you heard your name they had a garbage can and you throw your mask in

2232
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:12,500
the garbage can right before you exit the door yeah you got to do that and then run out and have

2233
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:19,220
this moment you're on tv and on your favorite show just like so magical in this like dreaded

2234
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:23,860
not great time um just was and we're heading to something here but is there anything else you

2235
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:29,860
want to say about that experience or anything the listener people wouldn't know about the show or

2236
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:34,820
whatever oh no I don't think so I just yeah you played thank you which game you played I played

2237
01:41:34,820 --> 01:41:40,900
one right price right which is I was both relieved and disappointed because I am such a fan I'm a

2238
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:45,940
super fan of the show right and I feel like I could play anything and I think that's why they put me

2239
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:51,300
like in the first four to become on to come on down because I feel like I know every game and

2240
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:55,780
I can play any game and I'm pretty good at them I'd watch you for months preparing for this because

2241
01:41:55,780 --> 01:42:00,100
it also got pushed because things got even super locked down so you were thinking about this for

2242
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:04,260
so many months and playing along you're watching every episode and going I'll see how I would have

2243
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:10,420
done this and she overbid and she you were so primed yeah just like very serious about it um so

2244
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:15,220
yeah I get I play one right price which is just the easiest most boring game it's the quickest like

2245
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:19,380
it's the quickest game yeah so I was a little disappointed but also relieved because I was

2246
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:24,980
nervous as hell like it's so much harder when you're in there and you know I flubbed it when

2247
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:32,340
when it was I got the opportunity to bid last in the second game and I I made a rookie mistake and

2248
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:36,820
anyway it took the entire show for it to come back around to me to be the last person to bid

2249
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:42,340
which is the position you want to be in so I had to wait the entire show so I didn't I was the first

2250
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:48,100
person called to come on down last person to play a game you got to it was fun watching the audience

2251
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:55,460
like live feel how you felt where you're like you like keep getting snaked by the just adding the one

2252
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:59,460
dollar it's not that's how you play the game yeah it wasn't mad at anyone who did that to me it's

2253
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:04,100
just strategy it's how you play the game well I was mad they were standing in my way of a

2254
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:11,140
trip or maybe some nice plates I did it at the end though it's how you play the game yes yeah you

2255
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:17,700
that it did end up being your your ticket up you play so for for people who did not watch this um

2256
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:26,020
you uh you play the game and you are the prizes our prizes were uh so I won a giant tv uh to

2257
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:32,660
get up on stage which is great and then it ties in so nicely to the topic of the day a billiards

2258
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:39,940
table was one of the prizes yes and um a fire table a fire pit wow a fire table I wish it was

2259
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:44,820
called it is what it's called really yes I was calling it a fire pit but I've gotten many

2260
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:50,420
email or not many I've had some email exchanges now with the company to confirm shipping and it's

2261
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:55,860
called a fire table that's awesome there is a little like marble table around it I'm so excited

2262
01:43:56,420 --> 01:44:01,940
we feel like like it's going to transform our backyard into like a uh like a Tucson Marriott

2263
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:06,980
you say that because I'm currently watching bachelorette and it feels like something

2264
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:11,300
there yeah there wow no they're in like New Mexico or something right now but

2265
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:15,700
yeah it feels the base currently it's not like a Benny Hawn table you could I think you can cook

2266
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:23,220
with it really is it uh propane powered I think it's gas oh it's gas okay yeah um well look

2267
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:26,580
everybody's invited all the listeners are invited over we'll get out our address you can come check

2268
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:30,820
out the fire we're not going to be turned into donkeys anytime soon though because I forfeited

2269
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:35,700
the pool table I don't have room for it don't have room for the yeah yeah you can forfeit

2270
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:41,060
prizes you don't want so yeah couldn't do it yeah couldn't keep the pool table kind of broke

2271
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:47,300
old Scott's heart but you know what we talked about it yeah yeah like well I don't know do we

2272
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:53,940
need a bathroom what if we stood it up long ways and only pulled it out when uh you know the mayor's

2273
01:44:53,940 --> 01:45:01,860
baby is over but I guess it is the right move uh for our son this would clearly be the path to

2274
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:09,940
to bring out yeah yeah yeah uh yeah donkeys turns into donkeys as soon as we set it up um okay but

2275
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:17,140
all of this to say uh that now I think this is a perfect opportunity to tie everything together

2276
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:24,900
and to have an actual now price is right winner attempt to play our equally iconic segment that I

2277
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:30,580
had to remember what we officially we were calling it souvenir smackdown yes all right

2278
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:36,900
that we don't have a cue or anything it's not as exciting you don't get to run uh you can stay in

2279
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:45,060
your seat um but so not only souvenir smackdown but this I have prepared a specific Pinocchio themed

2280
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:50,660
version nice of super smacked I did not know about this yes yeah yeah everything is related

2281
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:56,980
or well it's related to things that have been in the air uh in the episode uh in general so uh let

2282
01:45:56,980 --> 01:46:01,780
me let me find my notes here um everybody will play you know I think like while Erin

2283
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:08,900
has proven herself on price is right uh we're also it's like weird uh crap off of ebay which

2284
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:14,900
I think gives Mike an advantage and some of it is rather old tiny so Jason is in the game as well

2285
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:21,700
so everyone's got some sort of a hook so we'll have our strength yes yeah yeah superpowers um

2286
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:28,100
okay and uh and as with uh price is right as with bitters row uh it's whoever is closest to the

2287
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:34,420
actual ebay price without going over um do we do they shake it up every time do they change the

2288
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:42,340
order Erin should Erin I'll start with you uh well no whoever wins um if we're doing it yeah

2289
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:49,700
price is right way whoever like if we're going uh clockwise I guess yes whoever wins uh the first

2290
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:55,860
person to bid will be the next person clockwise okay here well look we're gonna start with you

2291
01:46:55,860 --> 01:47:01,140
and then you just tell me how it works next time okay next round well like if I win then um well

2292
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:06,740
technically I'd be out uh-huh we'll just make it so that I'm not not the last person okay okay I

2293
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:12,100
win got it all right uh I'll try I'll still consult with you okay let's do round one okay

2294
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:16,980
figure it out uh okay so I will I will try to show this really quickly off my laptop and then I will

2295
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:26,180
uh describe it a little bit more so uh round one is an original copy of a hand-drawn political cartoon

2296
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:32,500
from 1986 this is so it's like it's it's original art drawn on paper this was in a newspaper but

2297
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:41,220
this is the actual uh copy and what the political cartoon it's not Ronald Reagan close this is then

2298
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:49,220
Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis oh and he is dressed as Pinocchio and uh well before this was

2299
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:54,660
cleverly said about uh Trump throughout his presidency he is portrayed uh as with the long

2300
01:47:54,660 --> 01:48:00,500
nose he has told many lies and in this case his long nose has enough room to write the whole phrase

2301
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:08,260
Massachusetts payroll under Dukakis so body just oh and you're not coming back from that son

2302
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:15,220
he tried to run for president yeah really why'd you even give it a shot um okay so this is original

2303
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:23,140
artwork it's said to be in very good condition um and uh it's it's very cutting and satirical

2304
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:29,780
um let's uh let's take a guess uh what this is uh the asking price on eBay Erin four dollars

2305
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:39,700
four dollars Jason I'm gonna say five hundred and one dollars Mike uh 150 dollars

2306
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:46,660
Erin you win round one the actual eBay price 39.99

2307
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:53,620
so by taking the low round what was that what made you think that maybe this would be a

2308
01:48:54,980 --> 01:49:00,580
valued item for people oh I've just gone to a lot of comic book conventions and looked at original

2309
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:06,180
art and yeah it's much higher even if I'm even if it's like little Lulu or something that's

2310
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:10,740
probably a bad example because a little Lulu kind of beloved yeah more iconic than this one than

2311
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:15,780
Pinocchio fused with governor Dukakis but you never know I don't know I feel like political car I feel

2312
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:21,300
like there are big fans of like Doonesbury and political so you never know um okay now actually

2313
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:27,940
now I said eBay but we're actually going to switch to Etsy for this next round uh for which I will

2314
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:39,220
show you uh this uh child's Jiminy Cricket costume okay is a a uh cosplay Jiminy Cricket

2315
01:49:39,220 --> 01:49:45,460
for a little boy I will demand that we never have this item I'm glad this isn't my present

2316
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:50,020
right and we could end up with it I do not want to it looks well made yeah I think it is very well

2317
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:56,340
made now I don't have the facts in front of me but this is a custom job on Etsy so they'll make

2318
01:49:56,340 --> 01:50:02,820
it to your child's size I believe some uh I think I saw some uh taffeta was involved it looks it's

2319
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:08,260
it's it's prettier than a giant hat huge hat so and you know and you're getting buttons and gloves

2320
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:17,780
the the the hole where this is from Etsy user Petit Leon so for a custom Petit Leon child's

2321
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:24,100
Jiminy Cricket costume um where do we where do we start well I should like the advantage since I won

2322
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:29,780
the last one I should start because the advantage is going last okay okay so maybe same order yeah

2323
01:50:29,780 --> 01:50:38,180
all right let's do that all right okay I'm gonna say uh 190 um Jason hmm I'm gonna go with 60

2324
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:48,100
dollars okay Mike 99 dollars uh Aaron you win um now I was gonna I've prepared four and the idea

2325
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:53,620
was the two was going to take it so I believe you have already won I'm already 21 uh which I'm really

2326
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:58,500
good at game shows you're very good at game shows if you have a game show get Aaron on it you have a

2327
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:04,980
tip of a game show that is happening uh and you know I want more fire tables also so let's keep

2358
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:51,780
personalization uh lowers the cost or ups the cost but like yeah autographs are always yeah those i

2359
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:57,540
feel like are more than you think don't know what oxidation does to it um don't know what people not

2360
01:54:57,540 --> 01:55:04,340
knowing is something that happens to food not photographs i think a lot of old media

2361
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:10,100
is starting to deteriorate and that physical photographs might fall into that category

2362
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:16,180
depending on how they were processed deteriorate like our memories so the important things in our

2363
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:21,860
heads we have to keep them like the name the name of the actor who played Geppetto Christian Rub

2364
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:29,700
the fact that the figaro signs don't line up in america and france um and all of the wonderful

2383
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:27,220
that we got on reddit which is that uh you are you are a coward because you didn't wear a

2384
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:33,140
patanakush shirt on the prices right those are both true statements i am a coward and i did not

2385
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:41,780
wear a patanakush t-shirt so yeah i think they i think they would have let a weed smoking shirt

2386
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:47,140
pass in that one it doesn't have logos so yeah oh yeah that's right you just can't wear logos

2387
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:50,500
right they might have like if they had a problem they could have just digitally

2388
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:54,740
blurred it frame by frame i mean if you were wearing a traditional patanakush shirt it would

2389
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:59,380
have been far too many sizes too big so you would have eaten it as you came on down right

2390
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:06,020
now that's right i've ripped over my own feet it's like an elephant in the chipmunk shirt
